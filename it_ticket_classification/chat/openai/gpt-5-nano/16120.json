While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if the notification removal needs admin privileges, it doesn't seem to be about rights. I'm leaning towards \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d here.**Deciding on category for ticket**\n\nThe content of the IT ticket is vague, but \u201cRemove from notification\u201d seems to fit best under \"Miscellaneous.\" There isn\u2019t a specified category for notifications in the options provided. I might think of it as \"remove from notification pm,\" maybe indicating a private message. Since the ticket doesn\u2019t clarify further and there\u2019s no \"Notifications\" category, \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is likely my best option. I\u2019ll respond with the category in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
