I'll classify accordingly.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket. The details mention \"installation,\" \"senior engineer,\" and \"mob zone,\" which could suggest it's part of an \"Internal Project,\" especially since installation is involved. However, it's a bit vague. \"Access\" could be relevant but is not directly stated, while \"Administrative rights\" could apply if elevated permissions are needed. \"Mob zone\" might hint at a specific area. Ultimately, I think classifying it under \"Internal Project\" makes sense for this installation task.**Choosing the IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket. The ticket mentions \"installation,\" which could fit under \"Hardware,\" especially since it involves a senior engineer in a \"mob zone.\" However, it doesn't specifically mention whether this is hardware or software installation. Since there's no \"Software\" category available, \"Hardware\" seems like the best choice. Alternatively, I could go with \"Miscellaneous\" if I'm uncertain. Still, since the user requested a clear category, I think I should go with \"Hardware.\"{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
