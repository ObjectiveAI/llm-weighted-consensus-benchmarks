It mentions things like \"production,\" \"extend configuration,\" and \"secure proxy,\" which hints at needing access or administrative rights. The categories I have include Access and Administrative rights, both of which seem relevant. The user is asking for advice on extending configuration, so I'm leaning toward Access since they want to modify the production environment. What fits best?**Evaluating IT Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket, which could relate to an \"Internal Project\" due to its production setup focus. \n\nWhile it mentions \"connecting cards,\" which hints at hardware, the context feels more focused on software\u2014especially with terms like \"proxy production.\" \n\nI\u2019m also weighing \"Access\" since they might need permission for production configuration changes. Yet, \"Administrative rights\" stands out as the most fitting category because modifying production settings usually requires specific administrative privileges. \n\nSo, it seems \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d is the best choice here!**Finalizing IT Category**\n\nI\u2019m weighing the options here. The \u201cAccess\u201d category seems relevant, but since there\u2019s no direct mention of user access\u2014only configuration extension\u2014it\u2019s more fitting to lean toward \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d \n\nNow, I need to craft the final output in the required JSON format. The instruction asks for a category, and given our analysis, I\u2019ll respond with {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. It looks straightforward, and I\u2019ll keep the quoting plain. Let's finalize this!{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
