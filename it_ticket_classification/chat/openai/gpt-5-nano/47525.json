The details mention \"event notification sub door remote alarm,\" which suggests a focus on a security event. It seems most fitting for the \"Hardware\" category since it's about a door remote alarm. I\u2019m considering \"Administrative rights\" too, especially if there's an access aspect to it, but the hardware connection seems stronger here. Overall, it looks like \"Hardware\" fits best given the focus on the remote alarm.**Crafting JSON response**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize the IT ticket. It looks like \"Hardware\" is the right fit, especially since it\u2019s about a door remote alarm. Now, I need to format my response as a JSON object according to the instructions. It says to provide the category only, so I\u2019ll go with {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. While I could add some reasoning, since the instruction specifically asks for just the category, I'll stick with only the JSON output. Let's do that!"
