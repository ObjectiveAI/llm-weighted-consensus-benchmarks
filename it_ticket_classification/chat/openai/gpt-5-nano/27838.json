The prompt indicates that a long text follows, which I should analyze to determine the appropriate category. I\u2019ll need to review the ticket content carefully to select the best category.**Analyzing ticket content**\n\nThe text appears somewhat garbled, but it looks like it's discussing a new starter needing hardware and an AD profile for an engineer, with references to a complete starter form for October. This seems to involve hardware provisioning, particularly about computer allocation. Given that it directly relates to hardware needs for a new employee, categorizing it as \"Hardware\" seems fitting. However, I might also consider \"Access\" if it relates to the AD profile access.**Determining category output**\n\nThe ticket mentions providing an AD profile, which relates to access, but the main focus is on hardware allocation for a new starter, including computers and peripherals. The text references terms like \"complete starter form\" and \"allocation policy,\" which further indicate that hardware provisioning is the priority. Therefore, I should categorize this as \"Hardware.\" \n\nThe expected output is a JSON object with the category included, formatted as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"} \n\nI\u2019ll make sure there's no extra commentary in the output."
