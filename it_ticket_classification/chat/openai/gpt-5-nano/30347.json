It might fit under \"Access\" since these down links could affect access. Alternatively, \"Hardware\" could work since it mentions hardware elements like tunnels and towers. \"Internal Project\" could be relevant due to the testing and change implementation, but the options are limited. I need to choose carefully.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket content, noting that \"primary links down\" points to network issues, but there's no specific \"Network\" or \"IT Infrastructure\" category. \"Hardware\" might work if it's about devices. I also consider \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" due to change implementation. The mention of testing scenarios and implementation suggests a project task, so \"Internal Project\" feels fitting since it focuses on testing and change management. I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project.\"**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the category for this ticket, reflecting on the terms \"towers,\" \"tunnels,\" and \"primary links down,\" which might relate to hardware or network issues. The prompt asks for a specific category from the provided list: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" etc. Given the references to \"annual service test,\" \"test document,\" and change implementation, it seems to fit best under \"Internal Project.\" Thus, I\u2019ll prepare the response as a JSON object, specifying \"category\": \"Internal Project.\"{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
