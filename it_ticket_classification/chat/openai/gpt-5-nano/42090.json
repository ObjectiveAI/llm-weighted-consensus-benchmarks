However, the challenging part is that the ticket text is a messy auto-transcript, which makes it hard to identify the right category. I\u2019ll have to carefully read through the text to understand the issue before selecting the most fitting category. Let's see what I can figure out!**Identifying Document Access Issues**\n\nI\u2019m dealing with a complex ticket that mentions issues accessing certain documents. There's an error notification when trying to open files, particularly with the Chrome browser. It looks like there's a workaround suggested: using Internet Explorer or Edge instead. I'll need to parse through this messy auto-transcript to clarify the main problems and potential solutions. It\u2019s super important to provide clear guidance for anyone needing to access these documents!**Determining Access Category**\n\nI think the reference to \"explorer or for opening documents\" likely means Internet Explorer or another form of Explorer, and they mention the \"chrome browser.\" The core issue seems to relate to access to documents on a web platform\u2014specifically for employees and clients. This suggests the ticket is about \"Access\". \n\nSo I'll categorize this as \"Access\" and respond with the proper JSON format. It looks like I just need to output the category object now! Here it goes:\n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]},\"value\":\"Access\"}}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
