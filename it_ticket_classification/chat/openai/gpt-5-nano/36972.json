It's important to carefully read the user-provided text to ensure I choose the most accurate category. I want to make sure I'm addressing their needs correctly while also adhering to the guidelines for categorization. Let's get this right!**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nLooking at this IT ticket, it clearly relates to someone who has left the company, indicating that their access and domain should be disabled. Given the details, this ticket fits into either the Access or Administrative rights categories since it involves deactivating accounts. I need to be careful to categorize it correctly to ensure that the user's request is handled efficiently. I'll decide between those two categories based on the context.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI see there are two relevant categories: \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" This ticket discusses disabling domain access and relates to a leaver document. While it could fit \"HR Support\" because it\u2019s about an employee leaving, the primary focus is on disabling user access due to termination. I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category since it's about controlling access. \"Administrative rights\" would be relevant mainly for requests about granting or revoking admin privileges, which isn't the case here. Now I should respond with a JSON object reflecting that category.**Finalizing the ticket response**\n\nThe user wants to categorize the ticket, so I should respond with a JSON format containing the selected category. I'll output it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Since the instructions specify to keep it concise, it seems best not to include any additional notes or explanations. I\u2019ve double-checked, and \"Access\" is an allowed value, so everything looks good. It's time to produce the final output!"
