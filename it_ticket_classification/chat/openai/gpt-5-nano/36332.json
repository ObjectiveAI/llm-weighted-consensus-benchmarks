The options are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It\u2019s important to choose the right one to make sure the ticket gets handled properly. I\u2019m considering what the ticket is about and which category fits best. This should help streamline the support process!**Analyzing user ticket issue**\n\nThe user has a ticket that mentions trouble accessing a folder, related to a storage location and an upgrade process. They\u2019re concerned about freeing up space and ask how to back up data before the upgrade. I see they have received a notification about the upgrade, but it looks like their drive doesn\u2019t have enough space for it. I\u2019ll need to guide them on moving personal and work files to create that necessary space for the upgrade.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that the most appropriate category for this IT ticket is \"Storage.\" While there\u2019s also a mention of restrictions that could relate to Administrative rights, the primary concern is about storage space, the upgrade process, and backing up data. I\u2019ll follow the system instructions and return a simple JSON object that reflects this categorization, specifically as {\"category\": \"Storage\"}. The user just needs the category, so I won't include any extra information in my response."
