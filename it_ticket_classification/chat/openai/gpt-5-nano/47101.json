The categories available include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The user mentions issues with their laptop's reliability, particularly concerning wireless connection problems. I'm thinking this fits under \"Hardware\" if it's a hardware issue, but it might also belong to \"Access\" if it relates to network connectivity. I need to choose the best category!**Categorizing IT ticket again**\n\nThe main issue here is a wifi connectivity problem, possibly related to drivers. In terms of categories, \"Hardware\" fits best since it's a laptop issue involving hardware and peripherals. I could also see \"Miscellaneous\" being an option if it's unclear, but \"Hardware\" definitely seems more accurate. I'll output the category in JSON format as instructed, which will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I might consider adding a brief rationale, even though the user didn\u2019t explicitly request an explanation.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
