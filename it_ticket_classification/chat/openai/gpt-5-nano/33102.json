Looking through them, I see mentions of \"leaving announcement,\" \"exit interview,\" and \"administration officer,\" which suggest HR-related topics. It seems clear that \u201cexit interview\u201d aligns with HR matters. Considering the allowed categories, \"HR Support\" fits best here. I'll go ahead and categorize this ticket as HR Support, since that seems appropriate for the context presented.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like I need to categorize this ticket as \"HR Support.\" There's a mention of \"due leaving announcement\" and \"exit interview,\" which definitely points to HR-related topics. I do consider whether \"Access\" might also apply since leaving employees typically require access removal. However, given the overall content, I think \"HR Support\" is the best fit. I should prepare a JSON object reflecting this: {\"category\":{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}}. I'll ensure to stick strictly to the output format!**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering if \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d might apply too since it involves accounts, but it's not explicit about access. So I'll stick with \"HR Support\" for this ticket. I need to output it correctly as a JSON object: {\"category\":{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}}. I\u2019ll double-check the schema to confirm it matches the requirements, ensuring it\u2019s just the necessary output without any extra text. Everything seems in order, so I\u2019m ready to produce it!"
