There's also a potential case for \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" since those are often necessary for such changes. However, \"Storage\" is definitely the most appropriate category. The user appears to be non-native English, but the request is clear.**Formatting response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that includes a \"category\" field as per the format provided. The instruction includes categories, and \"Storage\" is appropriate based on the IT ticket. So, the output should simply be:  \n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}  \nI need to ensure it aligns perfectly with the required formatting, sticking to the schema defined in the instructions without any extra text. I just want to make sure it's clear and precise!"
