This format fits their requirements perfectly!**Delivering JSON output**\n\nI want to be clear and concise since the user requested a specific categorization for the IT ticket. They directly asked for the category, so I\u2019ll keep it simple. I'll deliver exactly what they've asked for, which is the JSON object with the category. The output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That fits the request perfectly! The main goal here is to keep it straightforward and to the point."
