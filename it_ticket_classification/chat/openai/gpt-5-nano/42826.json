The ticket content is a bit garbled, suggesting a request for software to open embedded documents. The user mentions needing resumes by tomorrow, indicating urgency. They also refer to being a sales lead, which makes me think this could fit under Internal Project. I'll need to decide which category matches best!**Evaluating IT ticket categories**\n\nI'm considering which category to assign to this IT ticket. It could be \"Administrative rights\" if they need permission to install software, but that usually means they're explicitly asking for admin privileges. The ticket hints at needing software to access embedded documents, which might fit \"Access.\" However, since they\u2019re also asking for software advice, \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d or \u201cInternal Project\u201d might be better options. This ticket seems to come from a sales lead needing resumes by tomorrow, adding urgency. I'll decide on the best fit!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm weighing which category to assign to this IT ticket. It might be \"Purchase,\" since they seem to need software that may require a license. That aligns with a procurement request. However, the ticket also hints at ambiguities, so \"Miscellaneous\" could work. \"Access\" isn't quite right since it's not about login credentials, and \"Administrative rights\" doesn't fit either, as they're not requesting permission to install software. Overall, this ticket seems best categorized as \"Purchase\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Reviewing IT ticket categories**\n\nI'm looking at the typical IT ticket categories: Hardware for physical issues, Access for permission and login concerns, and Administrative rights for installation permissions. The ticket refers to needing software to open embedded documents, suggesting it could fall under \"Purchase\" if they're looking to buy software. The message is a bit garbled, likely because of OCR, so it might mean \"Open embedded PDF.\" They have a time-sensitive request to get resumes by tomorrow afternoon. This context helps narrow it down!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
