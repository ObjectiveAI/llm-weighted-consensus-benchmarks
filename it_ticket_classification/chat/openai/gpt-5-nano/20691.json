It could also relate to providing access, but that doesn\u2019t align with access credentials. \"Administrative rights\" might apply if they need those rights, but the specific mention of \"pipeline codes setup\" leads me to stick with \"Internal Project.\" So, I think the output should definitely be formatted as a JSON object.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to ensure that my response adheres to the expected format, which is a JSON schema-like object. The category I want to use is \"Internal Project,\" so I can return it as `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`.\n\nHowever, I also have to consider that the evaluator might expect me to wrap it in a schema format showing the type and properties. But really, it seems I should focus on just providing the category. The main point is that my output should reflect the requirement clearly!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
