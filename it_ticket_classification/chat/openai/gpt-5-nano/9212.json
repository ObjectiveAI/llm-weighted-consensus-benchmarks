The ticket mentions \"cable connection,\" \"port switch,\" and other terms related to network equipment. It seems to relate to connecting cables, which likely fits the \"Hardware\" category best, rather than Access or Internal Project. I\u2019ll output a JSON with \"Hardware\" as the category. This looks like the most appropriate fit!**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nI\u2019m deciding between categorizing this IT ticket as \"Hardware\" or \"Internal Project.\" Since the request is for help connecting a port and not about access or purchases, \"Hardware\" seems like the best fit. I need to return the JSON format as specified: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. The user instructed to categorize the ticket, so I want to keep it concise and ensure I output just this JSON object without any additional text or formatting. Let\u2019s go with that!**Delivering IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019ll provide the output as a JSON object with just the category field. The correct format is {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, and I need to avoid including any additional wrapper or schema portions, just the straightforward object. The user asked to categorize the ticket, so providing this simple response aligns perfectly with their request. Keeping it clear and focused. Alright, time to deliver that output!"
