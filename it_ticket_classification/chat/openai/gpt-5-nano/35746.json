The system has specific categories such as \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and a few others. Since there's no \"Security\" category, I think \"Miscellaneous\" could be a good fit, but \"Access\" might work too, given it involves suspicious attachments. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" for safety.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this ticket, which feels security-related, but there\u2019s no specific security category. The closest match would be \"Miscellaneous\" since it doesn\u2019t fit into hardware, storage, or anything else specific. I could think about \"Administrative rights\" if it involved access requests, but it doesn\u2019t quite apply here. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous\" and format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to keep it concise with no extra content."
