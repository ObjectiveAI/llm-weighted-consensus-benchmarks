The user\u2019s message includes phrases related to document locking and permissions, like \u201clocked by mysterious thread\u201d and \u201chow to delete document.\u201d The best fit is likely \u201cAccess,\u201d since it relates to permissions and locked access. However, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d might also be relevant, since it concerns unlocking documents.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI see multiple mentions of \"signature,\" hinting it might relate to a DocuSign-type situation. The core issues include being \"unable to delete a document\" and checking permissions related to locking. So, this relates to document access and permissions. I\u2019m deciding between the \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" categories; I\u2019d lean towards \"Access\" because it deals with deletion and control. I'll prepare the response as a JSON object with \"{\"category\":\"Access\"}\" to fit the requirements. A brief reasoning could be helpful too!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize this IT ticket, and the output format should be a JSON object specifying only the \"category.\" I'll choose \"Access\" since the ticket is related to deleting a document and unlocking permissions. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit too, it seems broader to stick with \"Access,\" which encompasses permission issues without necessarily being tied to admin actions. So, I'll finalize my output as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra text!"
