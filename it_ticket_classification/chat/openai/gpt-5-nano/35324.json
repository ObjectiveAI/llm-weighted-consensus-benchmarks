The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The ticket discusses a security software rollout, including installations and updates. This makes \"Internal Project\" the most fitting category. However, it could also fit under \"Administrative Rights\" if admin privileges are necessary for the installation or updates. Let's proceed with \"Internal Project.\"**Formatting IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe content indicates a company-wide security software rollout. I think it fits best under the category \"Internal Project.\" Since the instructions specify to format this in JSON, I\u2019ll create a simple object with the category string. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra commentary and provide just the JSON output. Let's proceed with that!"
