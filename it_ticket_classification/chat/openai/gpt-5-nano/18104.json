They're asking to set up a Confluence page, and the terms suggest it's about project management. The main keywords are \"internal project Confluence,\" \"create dedicated Confluence note,\" and \"design lead.\" Given that, it seems most appropriate to classify this ticket as \"Internal Project.\" While \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" are mentioned, they don't seem to apply here.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think this ticket maps to \"Internal Project\" based on the user's mention of setting up a Confluence note. There\u2019s some ambiguity with \"advice about sub type\" and \"design lead,\" but it seems like a request for a Confluence space for the project. Even though \"Access\" is a possibility, it's more likely about project management. I'll respond with the category as \"Internal Project\" and provide a brief justification formatted in JSON.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
