They mentioned encountering a certificate error when trying to join meetings, which seems related to access issues. I'm considering whether it fits into the \"Access\" category or \"Administrative rights.\" Since the problem involves a security certificate preventing meeting access, it likely falls under the \"Access\" category. I'll go with that classification to address the user's concern effectively.**Deciding on Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering different categories for this IT ticket. While \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" might work, the best fit seems to be \"Access,\" since the issue involves not being able to join meetings due to a certificate error. The user needs me to categorize the ticket, so I will respond with a JSON object. The output should look like this: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I\u2019ll stick to the required format and avoid any extra comments."
