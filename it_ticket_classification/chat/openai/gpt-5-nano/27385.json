The ticket discusses installing an adjustable stand for a monitor and mentions requisition details. It seems to revolve around procurement and is primarily about a purchase requisition for a hardware item. While \"Hardware\" could be applicable since it involves equipment, the ticket is more closely related to the procurement process, so I think the best category is \"Purchase.\"**Finalizing category classification**\n\nThe ticket involves installing an adjustable monitor stand, but the main focus is on the requisition process. The user requested to categorize the IT ticket, and the best fit is \"Purchase\" due to the emphasis on requisition rejection, purchasing lines, and suppliers. While \"Hardware\" pertains to the item itself, this ticket is more about procurement. So, I need to produce a JSON object that simply states the category, which will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
