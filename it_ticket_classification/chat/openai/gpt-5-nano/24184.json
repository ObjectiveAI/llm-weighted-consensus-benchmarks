The primary focus appears to be on adding meeting rooms and gathering forms.  \n\nLooking at the categories available\u2014like \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\"\u2014I think this ticket could fit into one of those, possibly \"Miscellaneous\" if it doesn't quite match any specific category. I'll evaluate these options carefully!**Evaluating IT ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m categorizing an IT ticket, and the categories I have include things like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and Internal Project. The ticket discusses meeting rooms and gathering form fills, seemingly for a project in December managed by an infrastructure consultant. \n\nThat hints at it belonging to \"Internal Project,\" but I wonder if it could also relate to \"Access\" if they're looking to grant room access. I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project,\" but it\u2019s close!**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nThis IT ticket is about meeting rooms and forms to fill out, which seems more related to space planning than hardware or access. \"Administrative rights\" might apply if they wanted to grant admin access, but that's not the case here. \n\nI'm thinking the best fit is \"Internal Project,\" as it relates to the project's infrastructure. It seems we need to respond with a JSON object, specifically: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Keeping it concise sounds good, just the category should suffice here!**Crafting JSON output**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket and provide the output as a JSON object. The final content should look like: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That seems straightforward, but I could also add a reason, like \"project meeting rooms; infrastructure consultant.\" However, since that's not strictly necessary, I'll stick to just the JSON for now. \n\nSo, I'll go ahead and output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Keeping it clear and concise!"
