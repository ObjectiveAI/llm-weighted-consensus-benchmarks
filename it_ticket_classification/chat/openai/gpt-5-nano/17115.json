The ticket mentions a \"new starter\" and \"work location,\" which suggests it\u2019s related to onboarding. There are also terms like \"log\" and \"additional help needed,\" indicating they might be asking about access provisioning or permissions. It seems like the best category for this ticket may be \"HR Support\" or \"Access,\" given the context of onboarding and work location.**Determining Category for IT Ticket**\n\nI believe the closest category for this ticket would be \"Access,\" considering it includes terms like \"new starter,\" \"work location,\" and \"log in.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could also fit if there were mentions of admin rights, it seems that the focus is more on onboarding and access provisioning. The text makes it clear that they need help with access, so I'll craft a JSON object that specifies \"Access\" as the chosen category. Here\u2019s the response format: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. That should do the trick!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
