It mentions a new purchase order for a Voyager wireless mono ear headset and requests to log the installation. This points toward a new hardware purchase. So, I should classify this ticket under the \"Hardware\" category, as it clearly indicates a request related to hardware procurement and installation logging. It seems straightforward: logging installation is part of the hardware process!**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket focused on logging the installation of hardware. The mention of a \"new purchase PO\" suggests it's related to procurement, but since the user is asking to log installation, it seems more related to hardware. The device in question appears to be a Voyager wireless headset. I should lean towards categorizing it as \"Hardware\" since it's about the installation process rather than just being a purchase. That's the clarity I need!**Categorizing JSON response**\n\nI\u2019ve determined that this ticket should be categorized as \"Hardware\" since it involves deploying a headset, which falls under equipment installation. The user requested the category in JSON format, and they want it to be clear and concise. I need to respond with exactly the required JSON, which looks like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I won't add any extra text, keeping it minimal as per the user's instruction. That clarification is important!"
