The user is requesting mailing lists for projects, which might involve adding owners and assigning roles after a migration. It sounds like it could relate to administrative rights since they're mentioning roles and owners. Overall, this ticket seems focused on IT support for mailing list management and access configuration.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThis ticket seems to focus on creating mailing lists and managing roles, which relates to access control, particularly with administrative rights. It\u2019s likely about assigning permissions for mailing lists. While \"Internal Project\" fits since it's for internal use, \"Administrative rights\" might be a better fit because it involves granting roles and permissions. The user mentions \"supporting projects\" and \"migrate,\" both indicating a need for proper access. Ultimately, I'll categorize it under Administrative rights.**Choosing IT ticket category in JSON**\n\nI'm deciding between categorizing as Administrative rights or Access. Given the tasks mentioned, like \"add owner\" and \"receive addresses,\" the best fit seems to be Administrative rights since it involves managing permissions and roles. Now, I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object based on the provided schema. The instruction is to output the category in the designated field, so I'll make sure my response is straightforward: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I'll avoid any extra commentary to keep it clean!"
