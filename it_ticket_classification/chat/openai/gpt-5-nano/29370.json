The message seems a bit jumbled, but it\u2019s clear they\u2019re having issues with Oracle time cards, particularly with duplicate entries that were approved mistakenly. They're asking for help with deleting these duplicates and removing unnecessary assigned code. Given this context, I should consider categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous\" for their issues related to timekeeping and troubleshooting.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at an IT issue about removing duplicate work submissions, which seems tied to deletion privileges. This could relate to \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" since they want to remove assigned code that\u2019s redundant. Since they mention Oracle time cards, which is linked to HR or a timekeeping system, it\u2019s tricky because the categories available don\u2019t include \"Software\" or \"Timekeeping.\" I think \"Administrative rights\" fits best, as deleting requires elevated permissions. \"Access\" might apply too since they mentioned issues with deletion.**Parsing the ticket details**\n\nI\u2019m breaking down the content from the IT ticket. It references the Oracle time cards system and indicates that the user submitted the same work twice, which was approved twice, but now they can't delete it. They\u2019re looking for help to remove what seems to be unnecessary assigned code. Given that context, I think the most fitting category is \"Administrative rights\" since it involves permissions to delete or modify submissions. \"Access\" could also be relevant, but \"Administrative rights\" seems to be the best choice.**Preparing the JSON output**\n\nThe user wants to categorize the IT ticket regarding removing assigned code and deleting duplicates, which likely requires admin rights. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Administrative rights.\" I need to respond with a proper JSON object that fits the provided schema. The response format should be clean, so I'll create the structure as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to follow the exact capitalization of \"Administrative rights\" and ensure it matches the required format. Let's finalize this response!"
