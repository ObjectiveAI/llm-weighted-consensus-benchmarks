The ticket mentions a \"new starter\" and references a \"starter form\" along with a filled \"hardware section.\" This could indicate a hardware request, but it also seems to involve HR elements, given the context of \u201cprolonged leave\u201d and review process. I\u2019ll need to decide if it fits better in Hardware or HR Support.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis ticket seems to be about provisioning hardware for a new starter, so it could fit into either the \"Hardware\" or \"HR Support\" categories. The mention of a \"new starter form\" suggests HR involvement, along with onboarding and \"prolonged leave\" review. Yet, the user also specifies that the \"hardware section is completely filled,\" indicating hardware provisioning. It\u2019s a bit tricky since the ticket has elements of both HR tasks and hardware requests. I\u2019ll lean towards \"HR Support\" for its broader relevance.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI need to choose one category for the IT ticket and then format my response as a JSON object like {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} or {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. The ticket mentions \"new starter\" and that the \"hardware section is completely filled,\" implying it relates to hardware provisioning for onboarding. However, there's also mention of \"prolonged leave,\" hinting at HR aspects. Since this ticket mainly revolves around hardware, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware,\" but I recognize the HR elements too.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nThe user might be referencing the \"new starter\" process with their ticket. Our category options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. Since the ticket indicates a \"hardware section completely filled,\" I think it best fits the \"Hardware\" category. Although there's a mention of \"Administrative rights\" and potential \"Access\" for system logins, the emphasis on hardware makes me lean towards classifying it as \"Hardware.\" Thus, I\u2019ll respond succinctly with the JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
