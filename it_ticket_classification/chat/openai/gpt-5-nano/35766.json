This is crucial for communication on ongoing projects, so it\u2019s important to choose the right category from the list: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the nature of the issue, I'm thinking \"Hardware\" seems like the best fit.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket details a malfunctioning secured video system and video conference equipment, which is clearly a hardware issue. It should fall under the \"Hardware\" category since it's about hardware malfunction that impacts communication with clients, not \"Internal Project.\" The user is asking to categorize the ticket, likely meaning they want a JSON object. So, I\u2019ll need to format my response to include the \"category\" property with a value of \"Hardware.\" Here goes!**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nThe instruction specifies that the category should be formatted within a JSON object. So I\u2019ll respond with {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to reflect that properly. The schema requires the \"type\" wrapper, but it doesn\u2019t need to appear in the actual response. To play it safe, I\u2019ll stick to the straightforward output of {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any extra text. This keeps things clear and concise, which is exactly what the user needs! Let\u2019s finalize that."
