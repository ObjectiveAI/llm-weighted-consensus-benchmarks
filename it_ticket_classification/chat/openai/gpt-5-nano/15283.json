However, if they\u2019re seeking procurement, \"Purchase\" could also fit, but since it's primarily about the hardware defect, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" Let's format it: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize this IT ticket and provide the category in the required format. The system expects just the category field, and I\u2019ll return it as a simple JSON object. So, I\u2019ll format it correctly to be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I will make sure there\u2019s no extra text or information included in the response. Alright, that\u2019s done!"
