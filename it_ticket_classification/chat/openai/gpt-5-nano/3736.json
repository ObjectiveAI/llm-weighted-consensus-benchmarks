The user has asked me to classify the ticket content after their prompt, \"Categorize this IT Ticket:\" I should carefully analyze the ticket details to determine which category it fits into. Let\u2019s make sure to accurately parse the ticket for proper classification.**Analyzing the IT request**\n\nI see that this is an IT request related to a new report in OBI (Oracle Business Intelligence?). The goal is to help recruiters track their own candidates and frequently update their information. They want to filter candidates by recruiter name and show results based on step status. There's also a need to modify the active candidates dashboard, filter by organizations, and display candidate grades. These improvements aim to minimize effort in creating a report.**Categorizing the request**\n\nThis request seems to relate to either \"Internal Project\" or \"HR Support.\" It's about the recruitment process, focusing on recruiters and candidates. While the categories don\u2019t specifically say \"HR,\" \"HR Support\" fits well for recruitment dashboards and candidate tracking. The request is also about creating a new report to help recruiters. Given the details, it seems appropriate to categorize this as an \"Internal Project,\" as it aims to build a useful reporting tool.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards \"HR Support\" or \"Internal Project\" for this ticket. It appears to come from an IT context, requesting a new report in the internal HR system \"OBI,\" likely Oracle BI. If this ticket is about creating a new report for recruiters to track candidates, it\u2019s more fitting to classify it as an \"Internal Project.\" While \"HR Support\" addresses HR processes, this request seems more like a feature development. So, I'll choose \"Internal Project\" and ensure to output it in the required JSON-like format.**Preparing the JSON output**\n\nI need to create a JSON structure for the category, based on the provided schema. The category will be \"Internal Project,\" as it's about developing a new report. I want to ensure my final answer follows the correct format.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward with the output as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It looks like they didn't ask for the \"type\" field, so I won\u2019t include that. Let's just finalize it with the simple object structure as required!"
