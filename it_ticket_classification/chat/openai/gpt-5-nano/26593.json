The output will look like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nBut wait, the required format is a JSON-like object, requiring \"type\" and \"properties\"! I'll ensure I follow that structure properly.**Clarifying JSON Output**\n\nI understand that the task is to categorize the IT ticket, and the prompt specifies to output a JSON object with the category field. The schema indicates that I need to include a \"category\" with one of the enumerated values. However, it doesn't require including \"type\" and \"properties\" in my response; this is just part of the schema.\n\nSo, to be safe and align with the instructions, I'll respond with a minimal JSON output like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"} \n\nNo extra text needed!"
