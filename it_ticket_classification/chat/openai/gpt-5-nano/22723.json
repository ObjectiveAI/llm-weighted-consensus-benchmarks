The mention of accepting/declining suggests it's about permissions or an email signature change. It seems that \"Access\" fits best, but \"Administrative rights\" could also apply since it's related to the signature change.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing how to categorize an IT ticket related to \"change signature,\" which involves email signature settings. This could fit under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" depending on whether it's about modifying settings or granting permissions. The phrase \"accept decline\" suggests an approval process related to access requests. Given that \"pop wants to access sales marketing\" implies a request for a resource, I think \"Access\" is the best category. I'll respond with a JSON object to formalize this, like {\"category\":\"Access\"}, and might add a brief explanation too.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
