It seems clear that this is a hardware issue, so the category should be \"Hardware.\" It could also be considered under \"Purchase\" if new equipment is needed, but I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" for the primary categorization. The user asks for a JSON object format, so I\u2019ll prepare that accordingly with the category specified.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to ensure that my response is correctly formatted as plain text. The user has requested that I output just the JSON object with the category specified. So, I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra commentary or unnecessary details included in my response. Keeping it simple is key here! Alright, I\u2019m ready to respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
