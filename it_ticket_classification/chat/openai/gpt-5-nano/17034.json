It seems they're mentioning \"Applications Management\" and making a reference to a time on \"Wednesday PM.\" The message is pretty messy, but it feels like they might be pointing to an HR issue involving \"discipline.\" Given the available categories, this ticket likely falls under \"HR Support.\" Let's classify it there!**Categorizing an access issue**\n\nThis ticket involves access to Confluence, which means the \"Access\" category fits well. I should note that the user has requested removing someone from a Confluence space. There\u2019s also a mention of a senior engineer, which might suggest an \"Administrative rights\" angle if they're looking to remove rights. However, since it's primarily about access control, \"Access\" is the best choice. I'll respond in the required JSON format: {\"category\": \"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
