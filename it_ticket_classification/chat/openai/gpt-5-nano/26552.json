The ticket states: \"new starter Wednesday November PM starter form ext\". This seems to refer to a new employee starting on Wednesday. \"PM\" could indicate the afternoon or possibly project management, while \"starter form\" suggests some sort of paperwork, and \"ext\" might refer to an extension. The appropriate category to use from the allowed enums is likely \"HR Support\" since it pertains to onboarding a new employee.**Categorizing IT tasks**\n\nWhen dealing with a new starter, the tasks typically involve setting up a new user account and possibly sending a starter form extension. The term \"starter form ext\" likely refers to an HR-related form, but since this ticket is categorized under IT, it makes sense to lean toward the \"Access\" category for user access provisioning. Although there might be a consideration for \"Administrative rights,\" it's safer to default to \"Access\" for setting up general user access. Therefore, I'll respond with a JSON object indicating the category as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
