This seems more aligned with software tasks rather than hardware. The main action is to clone self-service dashboards, likely within ServiceNow. Since the categories available don't specifically mention \"Software\" or \"IT Support,\" I could fit it under \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or possibly \"Access\" for these cloning tasks, though it feels more like a project than access rights.**Categorizing IT tasks**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize tasks involving dashboards and reports. While \"Miscellaneous\" might fit for general IT tasks, \"Internal Project\" seems more appropriate because it relates to setting up user dashboards and monitoring tickets in ServiceNow. The request appears to focus on cloning dashboards across profiles, which aligns with software configuration. The categories don\u2019t suggest hardware, HR support, storage, or purchase, so \u201cInternal Project\u201d is definitely the best fit here.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m reflecting on the request to categorize an IT ticket about cloning dashboards for different user profiles. While it could involve \"Administrative rights\" regarding permissions, the language indicates it's more about cloning self-service dashboards. It doesn\u2019t strictly relate to access rights, so \"Internal Project\" fits best. Based on the prompt, I need to respond with a JSON format, specifying the category. So, my final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
