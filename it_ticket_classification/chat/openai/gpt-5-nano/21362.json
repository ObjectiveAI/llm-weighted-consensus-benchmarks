The JSON output should directly reflect that classification. I\u2019ll format it correctly as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} based on my understanding of the ticket content. That seems appropriate!**Determining Category for IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to categorize the IT ticket. It seems like it\u2019s primarily about an \"Internal Project\" since they\u2019re creating codes for a project. I briefly considered \"Access,\" but there's no mention of credentials. Other categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Hardware\" don\u2019t seem relevant either. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. My final output will be a JSON object formatted like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Outputting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on the user\u2019s request. The instruction clearly directs us to respond with the category. I see that the schema includes a \"category\" property, and it looks like I should return just that as a JSON object. The format should be simple, like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and avoid any extra text since that's what\u2019s required. So, that\u2019s the final output!"
