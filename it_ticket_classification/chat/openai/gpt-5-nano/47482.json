The categories I can choose from include \"Hardware\" and \"Storage.\" Since this issue is specifically about storage capacity, it fits best under the \"Storage\" category. \n\nSo, I'll output a JSON object indicating that: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I won't add extra explanations since the user didn\u2019t ask for that.**Categorizing ticket as storage issue**\n\nThe content I\u2019m looking at refers to \"disk space on drive,\" which clearly indicates a storage issue rather than a hardware failure. So, \"Storage\" is definitely the best category. \n\nI should respond with just the required JSON object. It's clear that the output format must be correct: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. While I considered \u201cInternal Project\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d they don\u2019t apply here. \n\nSo, my final answer is to provide that JSON object indicating \"Storage.\" I'll make sure it's valid!"
