The allowed categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The ticket involves bulk hardware allocation for leaver interns and a request for help with their bulk leaver forms. Since it's about offboarding interns, I think the best categories might be \"HR Support\" or \"Hardware,\" leaning more toward HR Support for this case.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nThe category options include HR Support, but \"Administrative Rights\" isn't relevant here. \"Access\" might relate to removing access, but the ticket doesn't mention that\u2014just a bulk leaver form. Since the ticket focuses on leavers and bulk forms, the best category seems to be \"HR Support.\" However, it also involves bulk hardware allocation, which points to \"Hardware.\" It could be about allocating hardware for interns who are leaving, so I might lean toward \"HR Support\" ultimately.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"bulk leaver form interns\" indicates a form used during offboarding. The request is clear: they\u2019re asking for help filling out this bulk leaver form. This seems to relate more to HR processes, even though IT is involved in handling it. Given the options, I think \"HR Support\" is the best category because it focuses on the leaver form. The user asked for a categorical response, so I\u2019ll format it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Finalizing the JSON response**\n\nThe top-level key name here is \"category,\" following the schema correctly. So, the final output needs to be precise: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I need to avoid adding any extra commentary or details, just deliver the required information as requested. Let's go ahead and present that cleanly!"
