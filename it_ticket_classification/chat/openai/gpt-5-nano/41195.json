The categories available include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the user is looking for a fix, \"HR Support\" is definitely the right choice. I should respond with a JSON-like object containing the \"category\" field.**Outputting structured JSON**\n\nI need to provide a structured JSON object that reflects a category for the IT ticket, focusing on \"HR Support.\" The schema requires a top-level key named \"category\" with specific allowed values, including \"HR Support.\" I have to ensure I format it correctly with the exact spelling, including the space. The final response should be a plain text JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. No extra commentary is needed; it should be straightforward."
