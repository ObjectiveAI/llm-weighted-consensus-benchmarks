It mentions aspects like work location and return information, and it raises questions about whether this falls under categories like HR Support, Access, or Administrative rights. Considering the focus on onboarding paperwork and information requested by the administration officer, it seems most likely to be categorized as HR Support.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket appears to involve HR onboarding or administrative paperwork. It mentions terms like \"new starter,\" \"admin officer,\" and \"requested form,\" along with specific dates and work locations. While \"Administrative rights\" might suggest access permissions, it doesn't explicitly ask for login information. Overall, I think the best category for this ticket is HR Support, despite its distinction from general HR. Alternatively, \"Administrative rights\" could be applicable but feels too specific based on the content.**Finalizing Ticket Categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering if this ticket could fall under \"Administrative rights,\" but there's no mention of IT access or system-related permissions. The details about the \"new starter\" and the requested forms indicate it's more likely related to onboarding. So, I think categorizing it as \"HR Support\" makes sense. I need to output a JSON object as per the instructions. I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} to ensure it follows the required schema."
