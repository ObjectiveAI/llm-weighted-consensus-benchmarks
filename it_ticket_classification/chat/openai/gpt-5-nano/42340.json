The closest options might be \"Hardware,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since they're asking about performance enhancements and potential machine upgrades, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit for this ticket.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering the categorization of an IT ticket related to Excel crashes and performance issues. While the user suggests they may need a faster machine, the primary concern is the software crashing. Unfortunately, there's no \"Software\" category, so I believe \"Miscellaneous\" is the safest option. I should format the response as a JSON object, like {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I might also consider adding a brief note to clarify the context for better understanding!**Formatting Output Properly**\n\nI need to ensure I'm following the instructions correctly since the format should only include the category object without any extra text. This means I should return just the JSON object as required. I want to keep it clean and simple, so I'll focus on delivering only the necessary information. It's important to deliver what the user expects, so I\u2019ll prepare to respond with only that JSON object."
