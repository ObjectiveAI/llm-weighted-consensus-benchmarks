The user requested access related to a library and mentioned that they could previously edit documents but now can only read them. This indicates a permissions issue. The categories available include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others \u2014 and it\u2019s clear that this ticket falls under \u201cAccess\u201d since it concerns permissions related to library access.**Outputting IT ticket category**\n\nThere\u2019s a category for \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d but the user request is specifically about access to a library and mentions needing write access. The most fitting category here is \u201cAccess,\u201d as it directly relates to permission issues. Although \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could be relevant, it's likely too specific for this case. I need to respond with a JSON object containing the category \u201cAccess\u201d as instructed. The response will follow the specified format. Here we go: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
