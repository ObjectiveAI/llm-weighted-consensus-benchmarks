Even though it\u2019s a bit jumbled, it seems to be a request about switching careers, which doesn\u2019t really fit into typical IT categories. The categories include options like \u201cHR Support,\u201d and that seems most suitable since the mention of \u201ccareer switch\u201d relates to HR. But I\u2019m unsure how to proceed because the content appears not entirely relevant to IT support.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the ticket as \"HR Support\" since it\u2019s clearly related to a career switch and subject alignment. I briefly thought about \"Administrative rights,\" but that doesn\u2019t really fit. According to the schema, I must output a JSON object with \"category\": \"HR Support.\" \n\nI believe it would be best to keep it concise with no extra text, strictly adhering to the required format for clarity. So, my final output will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
