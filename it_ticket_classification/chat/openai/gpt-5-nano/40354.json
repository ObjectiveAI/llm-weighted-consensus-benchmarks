It\u2019s a bit unclear, but it seems focused on access or connectivity in Atlanta. I'm thinking it could fit under \"Access,\" \"Hardware,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it talks about connection problems, \u201cAccess\u201d seems like the best fit because it specifically relates to network access issues.**Formatting IT ticket category**\n\nI see that \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" aren't relevant here, and \"Miscellaneous\" is too broad. Since the user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, I need to choose the best option from the provided categories. Based on the message, \"Access\" fits best because it discusses connectivity issues. The request clearly revolves around access to the network. So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`.**Delivering the JSON response**\n\nI need to make sure I stick to the format and only provide the necessary JSON object without any extra text. The required response is straightforward: it should clearly indicate the category chosen for the IT ticket. Considering the context, I'll go with `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I\u2019m aware that \"Miscellaneous\" could be a catch-all if there\u2019s ambiguity, but I\u2019m confident \u201cAccess\u201d is the most appropriate choice here. Let\u2019s deliver it!"
