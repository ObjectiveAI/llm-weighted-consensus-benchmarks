After considering all the details, \"Purchase\" is definitely the best fit, not \"Administrative rights,\" since it emphasizes stock replenishment and purchase approval.**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions the Apple Pro Retina adapter and MB adapter, but its main focus is on purchase requests and approvals. Therefore, I need to categorize it as \"Purchase.\" \n\nI have to respond exclusively in JSON format, as instructed. The final JSON should look like this: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`.
