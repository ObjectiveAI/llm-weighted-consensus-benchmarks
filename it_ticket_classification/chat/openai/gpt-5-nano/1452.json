The ticket content discusses migration planning, git repositories, and access rights. I\u2019m considering \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project\" for categorization. \"Internal Project\" could fit best since it relates to an internal repository migration. However, terms like \"grant rights,\" \"permissions,\" and \"collaboration tools\" also suggest it might be appropriate for \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe request seems focused on migration planning and access changes. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" since it involves migration of a repository. There's a mention of \"Administrative rights,\" but is it really about admin rights? It also notes \"granted rights\" and \"permissions write,\" so access rights are involved. However, the ticket outlines actionable steps for the migration project, making \"Internal Project\" the most fitting choice.**Responding with JSON**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category. The required format is to have it structured properly, like:\n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}\n\nUltimately, I\u2019ll provide it as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, while ensuring I follow the exact schema. I must avoid adding extraneous text and format it correctly to prevent any issues. Let\u2019s deliver this clearly as a plain text JSON object."
