The text mentions \u201cpipeline,\u201d \u201csaved calculation for budget,\u201d \u201cdata,\u201d and issues about data being deleted and not saving correctly. This suggests it may relate to a problem within a software or internal project context. \n\nBased on that analysis, it seems like the best fit for categorization would be \u201cInternal Project,\u201d as it likely involves data handling in a specific pipeline.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at how to categorize this IT ticket. It could relate to \"Storage\" since it mentions data not being saved, which fits with data persistence issues. \"Access\" might also apply if there are access issues with the pipeline. However, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d doesn\u2019t seem likely. \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is a catch-all, but it makes sense to be precise. Given the mention of the \"unknown pipeline\" and saved calculations, I'll go with \"Storage\" as the best category.**Crafting category response**\n\nI need to provide a response in the required JSON format for the category. The instructions specify that I should categorize the IT ticket and use one of the allowed values. It makes sense to use this format: {\"category\": \"Storage\"} since it relates to a data-saving issue in the pipeline. While I could add a brief justification, it\u2019s not necessary according to the instructions. So, I'll keep it simple and just respond with the category JSON."
