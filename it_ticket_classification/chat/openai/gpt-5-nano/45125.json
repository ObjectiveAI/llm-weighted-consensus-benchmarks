Other categories like \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase\" don\u2019t apply here. This one clearly relates to IT support for scheduling features!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket discusses issues like \"assisting with scheduling\" and \"free/busy meeting calendars,\" which are related to Outlook features. The \"Access\" category fits best, although \"Miscellaneous\" could work if needed. I need to respond with a JSON object, structured according to the given schema.
