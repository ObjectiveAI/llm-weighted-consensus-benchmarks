It seems to talk about onboarding a new starter in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, mentioning roles and forms. Keywords include \"new starter\", \"engineer senior technician joining\", and \"compliance officer\", which hint at onboarding complexities. The best categories to consider are \"HR Support\", possibly \"Administrative rights\", or \"Internal Project\", since there's no specific \"Onboarding\" option. This gives me some direction on how to categorize it!**Deciding on the category for the ticket**\n\nThis ticket is clearly related to onboarding a new starter, suggesting forms and compliance checks in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. I\u2019m considering whether to label it under \"Administrative rights,\" since it might relate to access, but there's no clear mention of accounts. The recurring keywords like \"new starter,\" \"joining,\" and \"compliance officer\" indicate that this is primarily an HR process. So, I think the best fit for categorization is \"HR Support,\" possibly \"Internal Project\" too, but \"HR Support\" seems most appropriate!**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to prepare the response as a JSON object with the category set to \"HR Support,\" which I've decided is the best fit for this IT ticket. The user specifically asked for a category classification, so I\u2019ll keep the response simple and straightforward. The required format is just this JSON object, so I\u2019ll avoid any extra commentary. I\u2019ll ensure the output is clean and exactly as the user needs. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll deliver:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
