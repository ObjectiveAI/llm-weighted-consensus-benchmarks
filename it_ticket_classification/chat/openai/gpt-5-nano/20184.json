The ticket mentions adding a commission type and various allocation types, suggesting it's related to application development or a feature request. It might fit under \"Internal Project\" since it involves a specific application feature, but \"Miscellaneous\" could work too if it\u2019s less specific. It\u2019s definitely not about access. I\u2019ll lean towards \"Internal Project\" for clarity.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that follows the specified category schema. The instructions require me to format it as an object with a string category property. After reviewing the ticket's content, it seems best categorized under \"Internal Project\" since it involves adding a commission type and allocation types on a screen, which is a feature enhancement. I\u2019ll make sure my output is a valid JSON string with no extra text. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll craft:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
