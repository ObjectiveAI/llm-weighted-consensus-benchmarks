Based on their wording, this seems primarily related to \"Storage,\" as they want more space. However, there\u2019s a hint that they may also want more hardware for that storage, which could fit into \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" I need to decide how best to map it to the appropriate category.**Finalizing Category Response**\n\nThe core of the request is about increasing storage on a shared drive, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Storage.\" I need to respond with a JSON-like object in the right format. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and just output: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. This aligns perfectly with the guidelines, making sure there are no extra words or text. It\u2019s all about being precise and clear here! Let's finalize that."
