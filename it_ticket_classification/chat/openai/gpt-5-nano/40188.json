The other categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous\" don't fit as well. Since the core concern is about the requisitioning process, I'll categorize it as \"Purchase,\" as that seems to be the most appropriate choice.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to create a JSON object based on the specified format. The prompt clearly indicates a \"category\" field, and the options include things like \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" Since I've determined that the relevant category for this ticket is \"Purchase,\" I\u2019ll format my response as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I need to make sure I escape everything correctly and follow the instructions exactly\u2014no extra commentary or deviations. It's important to deliver this clearly!"
