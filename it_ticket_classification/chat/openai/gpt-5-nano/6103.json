The available categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and a few others. The mention of \"new starter\" and needing feedback suggests it relates to onboarding. I'd consider \"Access\" for system access or \"HR Support,\" given its context. It seems the ticket is definitely IT-related, leaning towards either \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\"**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"new starter\" really points to onboarding processes. Onboarding typically involves setting up accounts and access rights, which makes me think \"Access\" is the right category for this ticket. There's a mention of \"id image cd,\" which might relate to verifying identity. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit if they're requesting those rights, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access.\" If it's too unclear, \"Miscellaneous\" might work, but I prefer to go with \"Access\" since it seems the most relevant.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize the IT ticket, and I need to follow the prompt and provide the correct JSON schema. According to the specifications, I should include the category as a string from the allowed enum. I'll make sure to output it in the required format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's crucial to get this exact since they want a JSON object with no extra text. I'll deliver just that."
