I\u2019ll create a JSON object with that value, which will look like this: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. I want to ensure the capitalization matches what's in the category options exactly. Since the user specifically asked for categorization, I think it\u2019s best to keep my response straightforward and minimal, just providing the JSON object without any extra explanations. I'll finalize it now."
