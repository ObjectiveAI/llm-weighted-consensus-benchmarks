The allowed categories include \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights\". From the content, it seems to relate to a new employee starting on Wednesday, mentioning terms like \"starter form\", \"allocation\", and \"access\". I\u2019m considering categories like \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Administrative rights\", or \"Internal Project\". I need to pick the most fitting one!**Understanding the ticket content**\n\nThe content seems to be about a new employee starting soon, mentioning the starter form, allocation, and access to certain areas. Key phrases include \"fill completed starter form\", \"allocation\", and \"ensure ready\". I\u2019m considering categories like \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights\", especially if it involves user access rights. However, there's also a mention of liaising with a specific area related to the floor. I just need to ensure I pick the right category!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe content I have is quite garbled, but it mentions things like \"starter form,\" \"allocation,\" and \"very high importance,\" which suggests it's about provisioning IT access for a new employee. This likely means creating a user account and setting permissions, fitting well into the \"Access\" category. Alternatively, \"HR Support\" might apply if it involves onboarding. However, since this is clearly in the IT category, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" and format it as a JSON-like object.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
