It's all a bit garbled, but I'm seeing phrases like \"new starter\" and \"administration officer,\" which suggests it's related to onboarding. This might mean it falls into \"Access,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Maybe it also touches on an \"Internal Project.\" The mention of \"Bucharest\" and other jumbled phrases seems like it could relate to the ticket's specifics, possibly address information.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI think categorizing the IT ticket as \"Access\" makes sense since it's about granting system access for a new starter. I need to respond with a JSON format that follows the user's expectations. The JSON object should just contain the category property, like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nHowever, I'm wondering if I should also consider \"Administrative rights,\" given the mention of \"administration officer.\" Although \"Access\" seems broad enough for this scenario, \"Administrative rights\" might be a more specific category. But I'll stick to \"Access\" for now.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
