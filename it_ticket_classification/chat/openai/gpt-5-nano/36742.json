It falls under a specific taxonomy with categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. The ticket content is messy, discussing issues with adding a tag through Maven, Git, and host key verification failures. It seems to relate to CI/CD job tagging. I\u2019m considering whether it should be categorized as \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but the options are quite limited.**Understanding the User's Issue**\n\nThe user is struggling to add a tag using a job and has shared a lengthy message about their problem. They mention issues with Maven tags, git commands, and a specific error: \"host key verification failed\" when pushing changes. It's clear they\u2019re seeking advice on how to resolve this issue effectively. I need to help clarify the problem involving job execution and git commands to offer valuable guidance in response to their request.**Deciding on Ticket Categorization**\n\nI think this IT ticket should be categorized as \"Internal Project\" since it's related to a CI/CD job within that context. While \"Miscellaneous\" could be another option, it's clearly focused on \"CI/CD tag deployment\" tied to an internal project, making \"Internal Project\" the best fit. Now, I need to respond with a JSON object, ensuring it has the right format. The response will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, and I'll make sure to include appropriate punctuation.**Delivering the Category**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on the allowed categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the user mentioned \"Internal Project,\" which is exactly the right capitalization, my response will be straightforward.\n\nI will present the categorization clearly without any extra explanation or text. So, the output will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Alright, let\u2019s deliver that!"
