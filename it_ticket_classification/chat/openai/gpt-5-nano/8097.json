It mentions circuit installation, replacement, and assessments, which makes me think it involves technical aspects. I need to choose from allowed categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access.\" Given that it discusses physical circuit installation and configuration, it seems most appropriate to categorize this ticket as \"Hardware\" since it concerns a tangible component. I'll confirm this choice!**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize an IT ticket regarding circuit installation. It seems to relate most closely to \"Hardware\" since it's about physical components. \"Internal Project\" could be relevant if it's about upgrading infrastructure, but since the focus is on hardware installation, \"Hardware\" feels like the best fit. I'll choose that and ensure the response is in the correct format\u2014 a JSON object. So, the final output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Following Instructions for Categorization**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket as requested by the user. Since the user specifically asked for a category, I'll focus just on that without adding extra explanations. It\u2019s important to keep it minimal and straightforward. I believe sticking to the category output is the right approach here, ensuring that I follow the user's instructions carefully and deliver the response they want without any unnecessary details."
