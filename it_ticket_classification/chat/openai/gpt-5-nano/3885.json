The user input is quite messy but focuses on upgrading Zephyr, which is a tool related to project management. It mentions release notes and seems to be a request for assistance. I think the ticket likely fits best under \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" rather than categories like hardware or storage.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nIt seems \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since the ticket focuses on upgrading a software component related to an internal project. It could also be classified under \"Administrative rights\" if the upgrade requires those privileges. The repeated mention of Zephyr suggests it's a significant aspect of the project, especially in testing. I'll categorize this ticket under \"Internal Project\" and respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, ensuring proper casing and format.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
