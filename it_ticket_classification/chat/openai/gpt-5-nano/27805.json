It seems the user needs a password reset because their maternity leave has expired. I'm leaning towards categorizing this as \"Access\" since it involves password access, but there's also a mention of maternity leave, which could point to the \"HR Support\" category. It's somewhat tricky!**Categorizing IT Ticket Response**\n\nIt looks like the ticket is about a password reset due to the user's maternity leave expiring. This definitely points toward an access issue, meaning the most fitting category is \"Access.\" The user is asking for a specific categorization, so I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object. I\u2019ll make sure it only contains the necessary information without any extra content. The final output will be in proper casing: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That should work perfectly!"
