It seems to fall under \"Access\" for access control issues, or possibly \"Administrative rights\" since it involves permission management. Overall, \"Access\" feels like the best fit.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI need to decide on the proper category for the IT ticket, which centers around permissions management and access control. While \"Administrative rights\" could work, it\u2019s better classified as \"Access\" since it specifically discusses access permissions for staff. The instruction requires a JSON output specifying the category. So, I\u2019ll output exactly that without any extra text. The response will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
