It seems likely to fit under \"Internal Project\" for ongoing project management or possibly \"Administrative rights\" related to access issues.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket discusses setting up projects for a new client and mentions an automatic pipeline, a process bug, and manual setup options. It seems to fit best under \"Internal Project\" since it's about project setup within internal tools. While \"Miscellaneous\" could work if it\u2019s unclear, the others don\u2019t really fit, like \"HR Support\" or \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object to match their requirements:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
