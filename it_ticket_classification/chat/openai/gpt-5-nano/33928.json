The ticket mentions \"starter hardware allocation,\" which strongly suggests it falls under the \"Hardware\" category. Although there are some references to forms and administrative aspects, the primary focus seems to be on hardware allocation. Therefore, I think it makes the most sense to categorize this ticket as \"Hardware.\" I'll respond with a JSON object reflecting that choice.**Crafting JSON Output**\n\nI\u2019m preparing the answer as a JSON object with the category specified as \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll make sure to follow the required format exactly, so it looks like this: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}.\n\nI\u2019m double-checking to confirm that the primary focus is on hardware allocation based on the user's text. Although there were mentions of forms, the core subject remains hardware. So, I\u2019ll stick to \"Hardware\" for the category and output the JSON without any extra commentary. Here goes: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. That's it!"
