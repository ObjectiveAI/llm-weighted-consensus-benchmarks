The options are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The input seems garbled and mentions \"snow warnings\" several times, which could relate to weather alerts. It looks like it might fit into the \"Miscellaneous\" category, as it's not clearly IT-related. I need to decide on a suitable category for this ticket and then format it into JSON.**Deciding on category**\n\nI need to determine which category fits best for this ticket. The content mentions \"snow warnings\" and seems vague, possibly leaning towards \"Miscellaneous.\" It might relate to \"Administrative rights\" if it's inquiring about privileges, but that feels uncertain. Since the content doesn't clearly categorize as IT-related, \"Miscellaneous\" appears to be the safest choice. I'll format the response as a JSON object with just the category value, adhering to the required schema.**Providing classification**\n\nThe user is asking for a classification in a specific format. I\u2019m seeing that I need to respond with just the required output, which is: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. It\u2019s clear that I should avoid adding any extra explanations or details. Keeping it straightforward is key here, so I'll go ahead and deliver exactly that JSON response without any additional commentary. Let's keep it simple and to the point!"
