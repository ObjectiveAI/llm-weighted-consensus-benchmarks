The allowed categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket suggests that it\u2019s about unlocking an account, which aligns closely with the \u201cAccess\u201d category. While \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d might apply, it\u2019s more about unlocking access rather than granting rights. So, \"Access\" seems like the best fit for this ticket.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nSome may consider categorizing this request as \"HR Support,\" but that doesn't fit since it's clearly about unlocking an account. \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous\" also don't apply. While \"Administrative rights\" might seem relevant, it's about granting privileges rather than access management. The appropriate category here is \"Access.\"  \n\nI should output a JSON object with just the category, as per the required format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll stick to that without adding any extra text."
