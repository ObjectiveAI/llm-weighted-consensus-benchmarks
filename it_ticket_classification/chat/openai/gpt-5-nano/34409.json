Considering the options, I think it fits best under \"Miscellaneous,\" but I might also consider \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" depending on the context. I'll decide soon!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating an IT ticket about an Oracle error related to a sheet. It could fit under \"Miscellaneous,\" which feels like a safe choice, since it's somewhat generic. I might think of \"Access\" if it\u2019s about permissions for deleting entries, but the user doesn't mention access rights specifically. \"Cannot erase wrong entries\" sounds more like an editing issue. Given the vagueness, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" and respond with a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
