The category options include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I think \"Access\" fits best since it's primarily about granting user access. However, since it also touches on user rights and roles, \"Administrative rights\" could also be valid. Ultimately, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" since it's mainly focused on user account creation.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user's request includes a \"never expires\" attribute and mentions \"integrate instance actual slave nodes,\" which could point to integration. However, since the main task is creating a new Active Directory user, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" Although it could also fit \"Administrative rights,\" it doesn't explicitly deal with admin privileges. I need to respond with a JSON object specifying the category. According to the guidelines, I'll format the response as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
