The user's text mentions things like \"new purchase,\" \"po,\" \"log allocation,\" and \"receipts,\" which all point to the category of Purchase. Given the categories listed \u2014 such as Hardware, HR Support, and more \u2014 it\u2019s clear that this ticket fits into the Purchase category. So, I\u2019ll make sure to output a JSON-like object stating that the category is \"Purchase.\" It needs to be in the required format, too!**Confirming the Output Structure**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category. Based on the ticket details, the correct category is \"Purchase.\" The required format indicates that I should output this as `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`.\n\nI should keep it concise, focusing on providing just the necessary information. The text supports this categorization, mentioning terms related to purchases, so I will stick to the format without adding extra explanations, as the user asked only for the category.**Delivering the Output**\n\nI\u2019m ready to output the response as `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. It\u2019s important to make sure the quotes and formatting are correct, as the app needs valid JSON for parsing. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward without adding any extra commentary, just delivering the concise category that the user requested. Let\u2019s make sure everything aligns properly!"
