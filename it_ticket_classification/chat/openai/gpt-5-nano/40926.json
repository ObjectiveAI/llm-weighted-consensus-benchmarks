The text involves annual leave requests, Oracle, and issues with booking leave, so it seems more HR-related. Given the options, it looks like it fits under \"HR Support\" since it deals with annual leave requests. However, it might also be relevant to \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" if it\u2019s about accessing the Oracle system. Overall, HR Support seems like the best choice!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s IT ticket mentions \"cannot book annual leave\" and seems to relate to accessing the Oracle system. It looks like we could categorize it as either \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\" Given that it discusses the annual leave request process and involves HR issues, \"HR Support\" might be the better fit. I need to output this in a JSON format. So, I\u2019ll use: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Deciding on category**\n\nThe user mentioned \"Oracle\" and \"cannot book annual leave,\" pointing to a system access issue. I think \"Access\" is a suitable category, but since booking annual leave is also an HR process, I need to think carefully. If the status shows \"awaiting approval\" then \"withdrawn,\" it could indicate a need for either access or administrative rights. However, since it's primarily about the inability to book leave, categorizing it as \"Access\" seems most appropriate. I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
