The likely categories are \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" Since the message emphasizes the procurement of a monitor and installation details, the \"Purchase\" category seems most appropriate. However, I should also consider \"Hardware,\" as it directly refers to the monitor itself. It\u2019s important to choose the right category for efficient processing!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nSince the user's request involves logging installation and receipts, it leans more toward administrative purchase and asset creation. Phrases like \"new purchase po\" and \"mandatory receipts\" signal a financial workflow, so I'll categorize this as \"Purchase.\" I need to respond in the correct JSON format: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. Though \"Hardware\" could be relevant here too, focusing on the procurement process makes \"Purchase\" the best fit. It includes installation aspects as well!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
