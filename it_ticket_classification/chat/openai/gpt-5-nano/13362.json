Given the content, it seems like a request to reassign ownership due to maternity leave. So, that ties to \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s about assigning ownership to a project. I think \"Internal Project\" is the closest fit since there's no specific \"Project management\" category available.**Analyzing category options**\n\nThe user is looking at how to categorize an IT ticket, possibly as \"Administrative rights\" if it relates to managing permissions. When I analyze the phrases, it seems to be about assigning ownership due to someone being on maternity leave. The phrases indicate it's mainly about ownership and approvals. So, \"Internal Project\" appears to be the best fit, especially given the context of project management updates. I'll prepare a JSON object to match the category schema provided.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to output a JSON object containing the selected category. In this case, I'll set the category to \"Internal Project\". Since the user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, I'll keep my response simple and straightforward without any extra explanations. \n\nThe format will be standard JSON as required, so my response will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nThis will ensure I meet the user's request efficiently and accurately."
