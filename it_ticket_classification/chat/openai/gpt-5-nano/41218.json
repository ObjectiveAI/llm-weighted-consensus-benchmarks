The user provided some text that mentions issues accessing an account related to an application. They also asked for a display name change for an event coming up on Monday, which sounds urgent. So, it seems like this ticket is primarily about access issues and updating account details, specifically regarding application usage.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThis IT ticket appears to focus on access issues, specifically with logging in and encountering federation errors on Safari. The content mentions a request to change the display name, but that may not directly relate to administrative rights. Since the main concern is being unable to access the application due to these login and federation problems, I think \"Access\" fits best. I'll prepare the output as a JSON object with the category set to \"Access\": {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That seems clear and straightforward!"
