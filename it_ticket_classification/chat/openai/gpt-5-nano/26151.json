The ticket mentions terms like \"modem,\" \"spare modem,\" and \"allocate modem,\" which suggest it's hardware-related. Since there's a clear request for a mobile modem for traveling purposes, it solidifies that this falls under the Hardware category. Although it could also touch on Purchase if they're looking to order one, it primarily seems like a hardware request. So, Hardware is the right call!**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the specified categories. From my analysis, it looks like Hardware is the best fit. So, I should respond with a JSON object containing a \"category\" field. The required format seems to be: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. \n\nI want to ensure it's a properly formatted JSON, as the task specifies it might need parsing by code. I just need to be careful and keep everything tidy!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
