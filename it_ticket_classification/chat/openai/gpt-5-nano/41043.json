I'll choose the \"Access\" category since it aligns with the request to disable access and manage leaver tickets. It's important to ensure everything is clear and correctly classified to facilitate proper processing.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket details related to deactivating access for a leaver, which involves references to access cards and disabling accounts. The mention of \u201craise disable her\u201d and terms like \u201cdeprovision\u201d suggest it fits best in the \"Access\" category, which makes sense given its focus on user privileges. I should present this in a JSON format, specifically as {\"category\":\"Access\"} to comply with the requirements. This keeps everything clear and structured for processing!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
