They seem to be describing a display problem. The defined categories include \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", and others. Since this appears to be a hardware issue with the monitor, I think it fits best under \"Hardware\". I\u2019ll respond with a category object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to align with the required format.**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nI think we should reply with a JSON object for the IT ticket, specifically: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. The user requested categorization, but they might appreciate a brief note. However, the instruction specifies to keep it to just the category object. \n\nIt\u2019s certainly a hardware issue since it involves monitor colors during booting, and there\u2019s mention of using the laptop without an external monitor. So, sticking with \"Hardware\" is definitely the right choice. I'll ensure to respond with just the JSON object."
