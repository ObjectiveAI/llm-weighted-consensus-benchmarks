The text seems to indicate it's a network connectivity issue, which could fall under \"Access\" or \"Hardware.\" Typically, \"Access\" is for login/network issues while \"Hardware\" is for physical devices. Since the user can't connect via wired but can connect wirelessly, it leans toward \"Access.\" However, if it's related to a specific project, \"Internal Project\" could work too. I'll formally categorize this IT ticket now.{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Confirming category choice**\n\nThe user mentions \"located th floor,\" which I think could mean \"third floor,\" but I'm not certain. The issue seems related to the switch or cable. However, since the ticket is about \"Cannot connect to wired network,\" it clearly indicates an access issue. So, I believe the safest and most appropriate choice is to categorize it as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll go ahead and finalize that now."
