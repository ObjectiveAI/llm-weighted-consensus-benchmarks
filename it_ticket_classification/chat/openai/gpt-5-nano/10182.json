I'll format this as a JSON-like object with the field \"category\" set to \"Internal Project.\"**Delivering the JSON object**\n\nI can confirm that \"Internal Project\" is included in the enum, which is great! Now, I just need to deliver the essential information without any extra text. I'll format it neatly as a JSON-like object and stick to the straightforward request. It\u2019s important to keep it clear and concise. Here we go: I will just output the object without unnecessary words. Let's keep it simple!"
