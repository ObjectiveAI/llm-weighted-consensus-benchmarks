Phrases like \"access point\" suggest it could be in the Access category. There's mention of speed manipulation, which might require administrative rights, but the categories are limited. Ultimately, \"Access\" seems the most appropriate choice for this ticket since it focuses on network speed setup.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON-like object. The guidelines specify we should include a category, and the category options are clearly defined. Based on the user\u2019s request to manipulate the speed connection, it sounds like it could fit into either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since adjusting settings may need admin permissions. However, I think the best choice here is \"Access\" because it aligns most closely with the request. So, I'll format my response as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user provided a messy request, but the main action seems to be about accessing an access point to manipulate connection speed. While \"Internal Project\" crossed my mind, I believe \"Access\" fits better for this context. The instruction clearly states I should respond with a JSON object containing only the category. So, I\u2019m going to format my response simply as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
