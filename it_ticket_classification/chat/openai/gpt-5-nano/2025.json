The mention of \"new starter\" and \"id image cd\" likely indicates a need for an ID card image. Upon considering the options, \"Access\" appears to be the best category since the new starter probably requires access and needs to fill in forms. However, it might be helpful to clarify further, as the user is specifically asking for a category classification.**Responding with a category**\n\nI need to respond with a category for the IT ticket, likely \"Access,\" since it seems related to onboarding for a new starter requiring an ID. The category could also be \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative Rights,\" but \"Access\" fits best. I'll craft a concise JSON response as requested, using the defined schema: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. While I consider adding a brief note, the instructions emphasize providing only the category in JSON format, so I\u2019ll focus on that to keep it clear.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
