The ticket mentions an issue with a desktop computer that won't power on after a move. Clearly, this points to a hardware issue since it worked before the relocation. Other categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" don\u2019t seem to fit. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" as the appropriate category and prepare to return a JSON output with that information.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe prompt indicates I need to provide a category in a JSON format. The appropriate response is to send back `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}` since that's the only fitting category from the details given. I've double-checked the formatting to ensure it's correct and that I'm only including what's necessary. Even though I could ask for clarification, the instructions clearly state to give just the category. So, I\u2019ll go ahead with the clean, simple response."
