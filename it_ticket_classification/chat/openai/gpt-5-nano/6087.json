So, I\u2019ll output a JSON object with the appropriate category: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. This seems like the best interpretation of the messy ticket text!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize the ticket about \"Oracle awaiting for approval.\" It suggests a pending access request. There's mention of a screenshot, and the context indicates the user could be asking for \"Administrative rights\" or \"Purchase.\" The allowed categories include \"Access,\" which aligns with the access rights request, and possibly \"Purchase\" for procurement purposes. The repeated mention of \u201cawaiting\u201d is a strong indicator of something pending approval. I\u2019m not sure if \"Miscellaneous\" is appropriate since it's not listed as a valid category.**Selecting IT ticket category**\n\nI see that \"Miscellaneous\" is indeed an option. In interpreting the poorly formed ticket text, it seems to signal they are waiting for approval regarding Oracle, indicating a need for access to the system. The phrase \"awaiting approval\" strongly suggests they\u2019re looking for access permission, making \"Access\" the best option. I could also consider \"Administrative rights,\" but since \"Access\" is more general, I\u2019ll go with that. I'll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
