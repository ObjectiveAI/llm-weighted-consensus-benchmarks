The ticket mentions issues with viewing incidents in ServiceNow IT Ops, pointing to an inability to check incidents and an error message that\u2019s affecting operations. It definitely sounds urgent and relates to access issues. So, I\u2019ll classify this ticket under the \u201cAccess\u201d category, as it\u2019s all about permissions to view incidents in the ticketing system.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the user's message about an inability to view incidents, which points to an access issue. The most fitting category here seems to be \"Access,\" as it's specifically about permissions. I\u2019ll ensure to format this correctly as a JSON object without any additional commentary since the user just wants the category. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This should meet the requirement neatly!**Deciding on category**\n\nI'm confirming that the appropriate category for this IT ticket is \"Access,\" not \"Administrative rights.\" The user mentioned issues with viewing incidents in ServiceNow, clearly pointing to access rights as the problem. So, \"Access\" is definitely the best fit here. I'll focus on delivering just the JSON object as requested, ensuring everything is clear and concise. Alright, I\u2019ve got this!"
