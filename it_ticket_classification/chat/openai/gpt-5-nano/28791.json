So it involves hardware, camera acquisition, and streaming details. I\u2019ll lean towards categorizing this under \u201cPurchase\u201d since it\u2019s primarily about acquiring equipment and solutions for broadcasting meetings.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to decide whether this ticket fits under \"Internal Project\" or \"Purchase.\" It mentions purchasing hardware, specifically cameras for streaming meetings, and it's recommending acquiring equipment for redundancy. The focus appears to be on setting up a streaming solution, which makes me lean toward \"Internal Project\" since it involves planning and deploying new initiatives. However, the \"Purchase\" category also fits due to the emphasis on acquiring hardware. Ultimately, I think categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" is the best choice since it encapsulates the broader initiative.**Analyzing ticket details**\n\nThis ticket is asking about setting up a streaming solution for meetings. It mentions testing broadcasts, cameras, and training materials, which points to a need for robust streaming capabilities. There are details about using mobile cameras instead of fixed ones for greater flexibility and associated costs. The request also emphasizes the importance of making meetings public and avoiding overload during broadcasts. Overall, this ticket suggests a focus on implementing an effective and flexible streaming system for meetings.**Finalizing ticket classification**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project,\" even though \"Purchase\" could apply too. Since the categories are singular, I\u2019ll stick with my primary choice of \"Internal Project.\" Now, I just need to format my response in JSON. The format requires a specific structure that indicates the category. I'll go ahead and output it as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. There won't be any extra text\u2014just the clear response."
