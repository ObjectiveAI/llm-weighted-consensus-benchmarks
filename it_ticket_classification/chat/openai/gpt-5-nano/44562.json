The text isn\u2019t clear, but I suspect that \u201ctem\u201d is a typo for \u201cteam.\u201d It seems like the issue relates to permissions or administrative rights when trying to add this team member. Considering the context, I\u2019ll probably classify it under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Evaluating ticket category**\n\nThe user is asking for advice on fixing an error related to adding a team member, possibly to a project involving \"Oracle,\" which might refer to a software tool. I think the ticket could fit into \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" \"Access\" likely pertains to login issues, while \"Administrative rights\" involves granting permissions. The phrase \u201cissue with adding new tem member\u201d suggests it\u2019s about a team member, so I need to categorize it accordingly.**Determining appropriate ticket category**\n\nMy best guess is that this ticket fits the \"Access\" category since it's about adding a new member to a project, which likely involves access issues. However, \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if it were about granting privileges, though I think this situation revolves around project access rather than admin-level permissions.\n\nThe user mentioned \"Internal Project,\" which might apply if it's specifically related to internal project management tasks. Since the ticket is about adding a team member to a project, I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as \"Access,\" but \"Internal Project\" could also make sense.**Selecting category for IT ticket**\n\nConsidering the context, \u201cAccess\u201d seems to be the best category since the issue involves adding a user to a project and requires access rights. The user referenced an \"error\" and requested \"advice,\" which are common in access request situations.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll prepare to output the appropriate JSON object with the category as \"Access.\" The schema specifies that it should be in a specific format, so my final response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
