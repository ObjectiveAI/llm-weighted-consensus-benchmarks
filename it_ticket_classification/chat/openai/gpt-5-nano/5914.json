Given the provided categories, I'll classify this under \"Access\" as it best fits the context of managing visibility and member additions. So, \"Access\" it is!**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nThe user\u2019s ticket includes phrases like \"add member to space\" and \"shows visibility over,\" which is a bit unclear. I\u2019m considering that \"add member to space\" might relate to a collaboration platform. The term \"visibility over\" likely pertains to permissions concerning that space. I think it points to needing access rights. Therefore, categorizing under \"Access\" makes the most sense, so I\u2019ll respond with the category object: {\"category\": \"Access\"}.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI'm ready to respond with a JSON-like object that includes the category property using one of the enumerated strings. So, I'll output: \n\n{\"category\": \"Access\"}\n\nSeems like that's all that\u2019s needed, although I\u2019m wondering if a brief note could be helpful too. However, since the instruction strictly says to provide the category, sticking to the exact output format is probably best. So, I\u2019ll just go with that. Let's do it!"
