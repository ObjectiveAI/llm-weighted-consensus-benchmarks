They mention things like \"new purchase,\" \"po,\" \"installations,\" and \"receipts.\" It looks like this is related to a purchase order and installation process, which leads me to think it fits best under the \"Purchase\" category. The user's focus seems to be on logging that purchase and handling the related receipts, so \"Purchase\" really seems like the proper choice here.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nIt seems like we need to categorize this IT ticket properly. The user's message focuses on a \"new purchase,\" \"purchase order,\" and \"installation,\" which hints at procurement and processing orders. While categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Hardware\" seem less relevant, the \"Purchase\" category fits well. \n\nSince the prompt requests a JSON output, I\u2019ll write it like this: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. It also makes sense to include a brief explanation to support the classification.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
