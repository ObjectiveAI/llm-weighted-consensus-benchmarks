Since the ticket is primarily about hardware installation\u2014despite some mentions of purchase order and receipts\u2014I think it best fits under Hardware. I need to respond with a JSON object in the specified format. The format is straightforward, requiring only the category property as \u201cHardware.\u201d So, I'll just give the response: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. No additional explanations needed!**Validating category response**\n\nI\u2019m double-checking the relevant categories, which include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It's important to ensure the response is formatted correctly as a JSON object without any trailing spaces. I've got to keep it concise and just provide the output. I should be super careful with formatting, to make sure it meets the requirements perfectly. Now, let\u2019s produce the JSON response!"
