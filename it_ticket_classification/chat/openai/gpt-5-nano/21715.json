The text mentions \"excel file,\" \"recruiters,\" and \"candidates located folder storage reports.\" This suggests that the ticket is about accessing a file storage location. The repeated references to folder storage and reports might indicate it's best categorized under \"Access.\" However, since it leans toward file storage and reports, \"Storage\" could also be a possibility.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user's input suggests they might be asking for access to a shared folder or link. Phrases like \"kindly ask special allow\" and \"concomitantly based colleagues experience\" are a bit unclear but hint at the need for special access. It seems related to file management, potentially fitting either \"Storage,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" If the request is for access, it would fall under \"Access,\" but if it's for permissions to modify files, it could be \"Administrative rights.\"**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nThe context of the user's request revolves around \"excel file,\" \"recruiters,\" and accessing a \"folder storage reports.\" They seem to be asking for special access, possibly to shared resources related to colleagues' experiences. While \"Storage\" could fit due to the mention of folder storage, the typical classification for requesting access to files would be \"Access.\" Since they've specifically asked for \"special allow,\" I think it's best to categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" I'll need to respond with a JSON object that includes the category field.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
