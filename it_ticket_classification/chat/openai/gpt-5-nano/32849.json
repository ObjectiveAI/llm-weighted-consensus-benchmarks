There\u2019s mention of approvals and a user guide, so it might involve account deactivation or reinstatement. I'll figure out the best category based on these details!**Categorizing User Message**\n\nThe user's message is quite confusing and feels like gibberish, but I need to identify the category. It seems to refer to \"old blocked leavers,\" \"device,\" and \"approver,\" which suggests it could fit into \"Access,\" especially regarding an ex-employee's blocked access. There's also potential for it to be under \"Administrative Rights\" if the focus is on admin privileges. I\u2019ll determine the most appropriate category based on these clues!**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket includes terms like \"apply changes per column,\" \"approver,\" and \"registered under number,\" which suggest IT administrative tasks. It likely involves deactivating accounts for former employees and changes in access rights. Considering these factors, \"Access\" feels like the best category since it directly relates to leavers and approvers. There\u2019s also corporate structure mentioned, but it's not strong enough to make it \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access\" and format it as a JSON response.**Formatting the Output**\n\nI need to produce the required JSON object format, which includes a category field that must be among the valid options. So, my main response would be `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. The specification mentions using a \"type\" object wrapper, but in the past, we've successfully just provided the category value. However, I want to be cautious and prefer the safer route. So, I'll stick with just giving the category: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}` without any extra text or punctuation!"
