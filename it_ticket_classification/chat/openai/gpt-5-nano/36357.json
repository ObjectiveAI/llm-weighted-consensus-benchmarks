I\u2019ll prepare a response in the required JSON format, ensuring it matches the needed schema with \u201ccategory\u201d: \u201cStorage.\u201d Let\u2019s make sure it\u2019s precise!**Preparing JSON output**\n\nThe instructions are clear: I need to respond with the category in a specific JSON format. In similar tasks, I've previously returned something like {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. However, the schema provides a more detailed structure. To align with this, I should ensure the response matches the required format. \"Storage\" definitely fits as a valid category in this case.
