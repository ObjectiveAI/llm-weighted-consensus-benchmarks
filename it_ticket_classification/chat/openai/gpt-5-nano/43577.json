It looks like the user is saying \"Lazar's laptop won't work anymore\" and that there\u2019s a water spill on the laptop keyboard, leading to the keyboard not functioning. This sounds like a hardware problem. Therefore, I'll go with the category \"Hardware.\" It seems I should respond with a JSON object that simply states this category.**Formatting JSON for category**\n\nI need to format a response as a JSON object for categorizing an IT ticket. The schema specifies that the \"category\" field should indicate one of the enumerated options like \"Hardware.\" Since the user's issue relates to a keyboard malfunction from a spill, the right category is \"Hardware.\" I should output just the JSON itself without any extra text. Thus, the final response will be: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. Keeping it simple and precise!**Confirming category response**\n\nThe ticket clearly describes a hardware issue with the keyboard not working because of a water spill. Therefore, \"Hardware\" is the correct category. I\u2019ll respond succinctly with the JSON object as {\"category\": \"Hardware\"} without any extra text. Keeping it straightforward helps maintain clarity for the user, and I'll proceed with that format. No unnecessary embellishments, just the necessary information!"
