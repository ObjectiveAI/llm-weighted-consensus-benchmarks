There's a range of categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and more. The ticket mentions issues with the Firepower Management Center and connectivity problems, so it might best fit under \"Access\" since it deals with logins and connectivity. While \"Hardware\" could be relevant if it connects to firewall hardware, \"Access\" seems the most appropriate due to the nature of the connectivity issues.**Providing category in JSON**\n\nI need to create a JSON-like object for the IT ticket category. Since it's not a hardware issue, the best fit seems to be \"Access,\" as the ticket relates to connectivity problems with the Firepower Management Center. The prompt just asks for a categorization, so I won't add extra notes or explanations. I'll make sure the output is properly formatted as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Keeping it concise while following the required schema is important!"
