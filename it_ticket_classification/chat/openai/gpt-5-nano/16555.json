The ticket text mentions a monitor arrival, installation, a purchase order, and a budget item. It seems to fit best in the Hardware category since it primarily discusses the monitor. However, I could also consider Purchase because it directly mentions \u201cpurchase\u201d and \u201cpurchase order.\u201d I should categorize it as Hardware.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI need to figure out the best category for the ticket based on its text. It mentions a monitor arriving, indicating it's about hardware, and also notes a purchase was made, which relates to procurement. The user is asking for installation logging and to perform a purchase order, possibly for someone unfamiliar with the process. However, since the focus is primarily on the monitor, the best category here is Hardware. The response format needs to be a JSON-like object per the provided schema.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
