It mentions \"git repository templates,\" \"git migration,\" and addresses for users in northern and southern locations. The available categories are somewhat limiting, as they don't include specific IT topics like \"Software\" or \"Development.\" Given the content, the best fit seems to be either \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative Rights,\" with \"Miscellaneous\" also being a possible choice.**Parsing IT Ticket Request**\n\nI'm looking at this ticket, which seems to focus on \"git repository templates,\" migration, and routes for remote users in northern and southern areas. It suggests they want to set up remote access to the git repository. The term \"Administrative rights\" hints at access permissions. Given the emphasis on internal project components like templates and migration, \"Internal Project\" looks like the best category, but \"Access\" could also apply based on user access needs. The mention of \"routes required for remote users\" reinforces this consideration.**Formatting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to provide a category in the required JSON format for the IT ticket. The instruction states to categorize the provided text and output a JSON object containing the category field. Based on the keywords like \"git repository templates,\" \"git migration,\" and the focus on setting up remote access, I think the best fit is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nWhile \"Access\" might seem relevant due to mentions of \"required users remote,\" there's no explicit request to grant access, making \"Internal Project\" the more suitable choice.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
