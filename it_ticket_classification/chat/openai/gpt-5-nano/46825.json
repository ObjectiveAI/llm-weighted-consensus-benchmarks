The ticket mentions issues with uploading documents and broken links, which makes me think it could fit into \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Storage.\" Generally, upload problems point to storage, access, or permissions. The mention of \"contract id manager\" suggests a connection to a management system. However, it's not strictly a login issue, so I'm leaning toward \"Access.\"**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to classify the IT ticket as \"Miscellaneous.\" There's also \"Administrative rights\" for user permission issues if uploading is restricted by permissions. The mention of \"contract id manager\" suggests a specific system that manages contracts. Investigating the issue is crucial. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" since uploading requires permissions. However, \"link breaking\" might point to connectivity issues, suggesting it could fit under \"Miscellaneous.\" I think the best choice might still be \"Access\" because uploading inherently requires some level of access.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that \"Storage\" could be the right category since the ticket revolves around uploading documents, which relates to file storage and uploads. In some IT ticket frameworks, \"Storage\" is specifically for such issues. Looking at the provided category list confirms that this makes sense. The instructions clarify that I need to respond with a JSON object containing the category. The output will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. Although providing a rationale could be helpful, it wasn't requested, so I\u2019ll stick to just categorizing.**Finalizing output format**\n\nI feel it\u2019s helpful to mention the category, like: \"Category: Storage \u2013 issue uploading documents.\" However, the output format needs to be a JSON object, so I\u2019ll keep it simple. The \"category\" field is what I need to provide, which leads me to respond with: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I want to make sure there's no extra text because the app will likely only parse the JSON. So, I'll stick to just that response!"
