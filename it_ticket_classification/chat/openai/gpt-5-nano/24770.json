Since this is mainly about access for a new starter, I'll categorize it under \"Access.\" It could also relate to \"Administrative rights,\" but \"HR Support\" doesn\u2019t seem quite right.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI'm considering the best category for this IT ticket. \"Access\" seems most appropriate since it's about access provisioning and Active Directory visibility. If admin rights are needed, it could also fit under \"Administrative rights,\" but it's primarily about user provisioning, so \"Access\" is definitely the better choice. \"Internal Project\" doesn't apply here, nor does \"Miscellaneous\" or \"HR Support.\" So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and format that in a JSON category object."
