I wonder if they want to modify a list on Thursday or convert something to uppercase. There might be a hint towards \"Administrative rights,\" but there\u2019s no clear request for permissions. Given all of this, I think the best fit for this ticket would be \"Miscellaneous.\"**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nI see the message: \"list change thursday change hi please make caps thank.\" It seems to be about a list change on Thursday, and maybe they want the capitalization changed to uppercase. I don't think it's hardware, HR, or access, though access could apply if they were asking for permission. \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t fit well either. So, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the best choice. I should respond with a JSON object format, indicating the category as \"Miscellaneous.\"{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
