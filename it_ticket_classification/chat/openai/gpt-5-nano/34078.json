Since it's about a bilingual English contracts attorney position in Atlanta, GA, it seems like the user is asking HR for help with submitting their application materials. This sounds recruitment-related, so the best category is likely \"HR Support.\" However, if it's primarily a permission error, \"Access\" could also be appropriate.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user is asking to categorize an IT ticket, and the content discusses an application for a bilingual English contracts attorney position in Atlanta, GA. The most fitting category here seems to be \"HR Support,\" as it relates directly to HR processes, and it's included in the taxonomy. I need to provide my response in the required JSON format, which will look like: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I should just stick to that without needing extra explanations, as the instructions specify to simply categorize.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
