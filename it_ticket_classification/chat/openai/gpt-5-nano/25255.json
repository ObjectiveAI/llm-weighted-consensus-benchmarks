It mentions Raspberry Pi, configuration needs, and connecting to a TV display while being accessible by colleagues, plus some authentication issues related to wired devices. Given these details, it seems like the most fitting category would be \"Hardware\" since it revolves around the Raspberry Pi and its configurations. Let\u2019s assign it accordingly!**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how to categorize this IT ticket that involves setting up a Raspberry Pi as a display device, which needs network access and authentication with Active Directory (AD). It definitely involves hardware, but there are also access considerations due to the authentication needs. Since the categories are discrete, the best fit seems to be \"Hardware,\" as the primary focus is on the Raspberry Pi setup. However, I can't ignore the access requirements that may also incline me towards the \"Access\" category.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering the categorization of this IT ticket, which involves ensuring the Raspberry Pi is accessible to colleagues and integrating it with Active Directory (AD) for authentication. It has strong hardware elements, so I might lean toward \"Hardware,\" especially since it focuses on the Raspberry Pi. While access rights are mentioned, the primary concern seems to be about hardware setup for display. Based on this, I'll classify it as \"Hardware\" and prepare to output the category in the required format.**Outputting Category Format**\n\nI need to provide the category object in the specified format, which should really just be the JSON representation. The instruction specifies that I only need to include the category, despite initially considering adding a brief note. The final output should simply be: \n\n```json\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n```\n\nI think that's straightforward enough, so I'll answer concisely to meet the requirements!"
