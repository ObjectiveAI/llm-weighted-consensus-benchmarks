The ticket mentions a shortage of software licenses, which is a clear issue. The best categories seem to be \"Purchase\" for acquiring more licenses or \"Access\" for license access problems. \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Hardware\" don't fit. I could use \"Miscellaneous\" as a fallback, but I want to be accurate. Finally, I'll output the category in JSON format with the correct classification.**Categorizing license requests**\n\nThe ticket highlights issues like \"running out of licenses\" and \"maximum number reached,\" indicating a problem with license availability, which disrupts daily activities. It might pertain to requesting more licenses. I see two potential categories: \"Purchase\" for acquiring more licenses or \"Access\" since the license limits hinder software access. Considering the context, \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category to address the request for increased licenses. I'll categorize this IT ticket as \"Purchase.\"**Providing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a simple JSON object for the IT ticket categorization. The required format is straightforward: a JSON object with \"category\": \"...\" that indicates the relevant category. In this case, I'll return `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. The instructions focus on the category itself, so I don't need to add extra justification, but I could keep it minimal if necessary. Let's proceed with this output as it matches the provided schema requirements."
