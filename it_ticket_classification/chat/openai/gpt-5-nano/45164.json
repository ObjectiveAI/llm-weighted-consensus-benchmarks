Since this seems like an access-related issue, I'll classify it under \"Access\" or possibly \"Administrative rights\" since it's about changing visibility and permissions in ServiceNow.**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nI need to choose between categorizing this issue as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The user mentions needing to \"add correct groups catalogues,\" which suggests they\u2019re requesting group membership changes related to access rights management. While both categories fit, I think \"Administrative rights\" is more specific since it directly relates to permissions for viewing and creating changes in ServiceNow. So, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Administrative rights\" and format the output as a JSON-like object with the appropriate schema.**Formatting Output**\n\nI need to ensure the output is in the correct JSON format. The schema indicates it should look like this: `{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}`. Since I determined that \"Administrative rights\" is the appropriate category, that seems straightforward. The instructions specify to just categorize the IT ticket, so I think it\u2019s best to stick with only including the category field. I\u2019ll finalize it as `{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}` for clarity and completeness."
