I should classify this under the appropriate category from allowed values. Perhaps \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" could fit best.**Determining the Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket further. It mentions \u201cpm change\u201d and \u201cplease assign pm,\u201d which suggests that it's related to project management and administrative tasks. This leans towards the \u201cInternal Project\u201d category rather than \"Administrative rights.\" While it could be about access, there\u2019s no explicit mention of permissions. So, I think \u201cInternal Project\u201d fits best. Now, I\u2019ll prepare the response as a JSON object with the category labeled as \"Internal Project.\"{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
