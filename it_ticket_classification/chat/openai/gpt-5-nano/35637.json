The possible categories are diverse, including Storage and Internal Project. The mention of recovery points and synchronization leads me to think it\u2019s related to Storage, but I\u2019m also considering if it might fit under Internal Project. I\u2019ll likely lean towards Storage. I need to respond with a JSON-like object.**Finalizing Category Output**\n\nI'm concluding that \"Storage\" is indeed the best category for this IT ticket, especially since it relates to backup storage and recovery points. The terms \"critical alert\" and \"status active\" hint at incident management, but \"Storage\" aligns best with the allowed categories. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object with just the category field, ensuring it\u2019s simple and adheres to the specified format. My final output will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}."
