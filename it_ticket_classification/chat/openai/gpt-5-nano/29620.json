The categories provided are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. This ticket seems focused on decommissioning a project dashboard and involves migration, uploading files, and deadlines. Given this context, \"Internal Project\" appears to be the most appropriate category. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply, it feels less relevant to the overall content of the request.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis ticket seems to fit best as \"Internal Project\" because it focuses on decommissioning a project and the migration process. I need to provide a JSON response indicating this category as follows: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I briefly considered \"Administrative rights,\" which might apply if they needed admin access, but it seems more centered on decommissioning and migration. \"Storage\" could work if it were solely about file transfers, but overall, \"Internal Project\" is the most suitable choice. I'll make sure the JSON is valid as I finalize this."
