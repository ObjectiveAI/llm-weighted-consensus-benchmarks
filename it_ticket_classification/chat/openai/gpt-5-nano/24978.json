The ticket text suggests that the user wants to add terminals and addresses related to them. It seems like they're likely referring to physical terminals for a schedule, leaning towards the \"Hardware\" category. However, if it's about access to terminals or IP addresses, it could also fit under \"Access\" or even \"Storage.\" There\u2019s some ambiguity here!**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nThe request to \"add terminals to Tuesday December PM\" seems like a scheduling query, which could suggest categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" However, \"Administrative rights\" would only apply if there's an authorization need. Ultimately, \"Hardware\" seems the best fit since it\u2019s about adding devices. There\u2019s also the possibility of needing \"Administrative rights\" for configuration updates, but I think \"Hardware\" is the most straightforward choice. Now, I\u2019ll format it as a JSON object as required. \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}**Formatting category output**\n\nI have the schema, which shows that I need to output the category as part of an object. I\u2019ll go ahead with {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. \n\nI briefly considered adding a note or justification, but the instructions specify only to provide the category without any extra details. So, it looks like I\u2019m all set to output just the JSON object now. Let's keep it straightforward and stick to what\u2019s required!"
