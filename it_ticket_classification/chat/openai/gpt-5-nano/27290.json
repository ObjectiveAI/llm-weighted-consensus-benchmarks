These elements can fit under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it focuses on rights management for the site, I think \"Administrative rights\" is more specific. However, it's still about access, so both could work. The user's request to categorize the ticket suggests we should pick the best fit. Though the mention of \"sprint\" implies project management, the ticket mainly addresses permissions.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket focuses on access permissions and admin rights. I need to determine whether to categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" It mentions \"editing rights,\" \"owner rights,\" and actions like changing uploads and deleting files, indicating it fits into administrative rights better. The list allows for both options, but \"Administrative rights\" feels more precise. I'll create a JSON object that returns just the category without any extra text."
