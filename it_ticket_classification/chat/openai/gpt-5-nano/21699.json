The user's message seems to revolve around a \"starter form\" related to a new starter returning to the organization, which sounds like it falls under HR Support. I'll match it against the available categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. HR Support feels like the best fit here!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe content in the ticket references terms like \"starter form,\" \"new starter,\" and \"returning,\" suggesting it's HR-related, specifically focused on onboarding or offboarding processes. While categories like \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" could apply, \"HR Support\" seems to be the best fit as it encompasses onboarding activities, including starter forms. Given the context, I'll categorize this ticket as \"HR Support,\" since it's primarily about new starter forms and processed leavers. I'll output this as a JSON-like object now!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI considered categorizing this IT ticket under \"Access\" since it mentions starter forms related to access. However, the content primarily focuses on onboarding, with phrases like \"new starter,\" \"transfer,\" and \"leaver,\" which aligns more with HR processes rather than provisioning access. So, \"HR Support\" is clearly the better choice here! I\u2019m ready to finalize this category and provide the answer accordingly."
