The content includes topics like \"change tasks\" and references an application manager, suggesting it might be about modifying task statuses within a tracking system. It seems appropriate to label it as \"Internal Project,\" indicating it's about managing internal processes or software changes. While \"Administrative rights\" might fit, it's more focused on project management. So, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best option to classify it.{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}}{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}}{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
