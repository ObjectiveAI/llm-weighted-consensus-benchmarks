The user provided a cluttered message mentioning \"changing field opportunities\" and multiple clients, which might suggest they're requesting adjustments in a CRM. I\u2019m considering categorizing it under \"Access\" for permissions, \"Administrative rights\" for admin access, or possibly \"Internal Project\" for system modifications.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user frequently mentions \"opportunities,\" suggesting a possible CRM data change request. Terms like \"action needed\" and \"tab each client\" make things a bit unclear. I need to choose the most fitting category. \"Administrative rights\" relates to access, but I\u2019m leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as it seems about an IT project involving field changes or data migration. Though there\u2019s no clear sign of a new project, some phrases appear to refer to client names, indicating it might involve a dataset.**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering whether \"Access\" would be suitable since the user's ticket hints at needing access to fields. The phrases like \"action needed\" and \"how works\" make things a bit murky. \"Administrative rights\" refers specifically to user permissions for system changes, which could apply here too. However, I think \"Internal Project\" might be the best choice since it relates to managing opportunities across clients as part of a data workflow change. I need to format the response as a JSON object with the chosen category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}  \n\nI see that the \"category\" field needs to be in a JSON format, specifically a string from the allowed options. I\u2019m opting for \"Internal Project\" because it fits best. While I could provide a brief explanation, the instruction clearly states to respond with just the category. So I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and just deliver the JSON object as required. Just double-checking that everything aligns before sending the response!"
