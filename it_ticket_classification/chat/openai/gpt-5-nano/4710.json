The user mentioned \"starter form\" and signed off with \"senior developer.\" Looks like it could fit into categories like \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" Given that the phrase \"new starter\" hints at onboarding, I should lean towards \"HR Support\" for this ticket. It\u2019s essential to ensure I'm picking the most appropriate category!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI notice that IT tickets often fall into the \"Access\" category for user accounts. However, since this one mentions a \"starter form,\" it seems more HR related, even though there\u2019s no explicit \"Onboarding\" category. The best fit here is \"HR Support\" since onboarding is part of HR. It could also be \"Administrative rights,\" but that\u2019s not clear. I\u2019m concluding that the category should be \"HR Support,\" and I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
