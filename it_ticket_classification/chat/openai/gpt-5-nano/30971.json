It seems like they are asking for access rights for Friday evening, possibly to some planning resources. Given the categories available, \u201cAccess\u201d feels like the most appropriate choice since it directly relates to access rights. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit, we're limited to top-level categories here.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe content I\u2019m processing indicates a request for access rights to planning resources, possibly including something referred to as \"bb ribbon.\" Given this, \"Access\" is the most fitting category since it focuses on access to specific resources. While \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant, it seems they simply need access rather than admin privileges. So, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" and prepare to output it in the specified JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
