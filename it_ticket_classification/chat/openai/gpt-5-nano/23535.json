Despite the confidentiality disclaimer, it seems clear that this is about improving the landing page, indicating it fits under \"Internal Project.\" It\u2019s focusing on performance optimization and image handling rather than any hardware or access issues.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to determine the best category for this IT ticket. It seems to be focused on improving landing page performance and implementing changes, which leans towards \"Internal Project.\" While \"Miscellaneous\" could be a possibility, it doesn't quite fit the project scope of an IT ticket about performance changes. Other categories like \"Storage,\" \"Access,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Hardware,\" and \"HR Support\" don't apply here. So, labeling it as \"Internal Project\" makes the most sense. I'll structure my output in the required JSON format with the category!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
