It seems to concern access cards, leading me to think the most fitting category is \"Access.\" Although it might also fit into \"Internal Project\" since it involves an audit, I'm leaning towards \"Access\" due to the specific mention of access cards. I'm eager to classify it correctly!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe categories include \"Internal Project,\" but in this case, \"Access\" is more fitting for the ticket about the \"access cards list mini audit\" scheduled for Friday in July. It clearly relates to access control. I think I should respond with a JSON object based on the format provided. To confirm, I will simply output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This aligns with the schema and instructions for delivering the correct response!**Finalizing the output**\n\nI think I should output just what the instructions require, which is: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I could add an explanation, but since the instructions don\u2019t ask for it, I won't. Just providing the JSON object is sufficient. I\u2019ll make sure the format is valid, with quotes around the keys and strings, and \"Access\" is an allowed value. I feel confident about this response, so I\u2019ll return it as is!"
