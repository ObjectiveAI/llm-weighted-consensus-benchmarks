The relevant categories seem to be \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Given that it's about maternity leave, it likely fits under \"HR Support,\" as this involves HR processes rather than IT issues. However, it may also touch on \"Administrative rights\" if access adjustments are needed for leavers. I need to be precise in my classification!**Classifying maternity leave request**\n\nThe phrase \"maternity leaver form\" hints at processes related to account deactivation and access revocation. I'm considering categorizing this under \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" since it involves handling leaver forms and inventory updates. While \"Access\" might seem fitting, the content strongly indicates that this is an HR process. I think my best bet is to classify this IT ticket as \"HR Support,\" focusing on the maternity leave forms and the related updates.**Determining category for the request**\n\nI'm considering the phrase \"inventory update\" and whether it points to hardware or asset management. There are categories like \"Storage\" and \"Purchase,\" but this doesn't fit well. It might lean toward \"Internal Project\" if viewed as a process, or even \"Miscellaneous.\" Ultimately, I think \"HR Support\" is the strongest fit since the request centers around maternity leave forms. I'll respond with the JSON object format required: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}.**Finalizing JSON output for IT ticket**\n\nI need to respond with the JSON format specified, so I'll be outputting exactly: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This fits well under the requirements, given it's an IT ticket about maternity leave forms. I briefly considered \"Access\" since it involves leaver forms and access revocation; however, the context strongly points to HR. I'll stick with categorizing it as HR Support for clarity. It's crucial to keep it succinct!"
