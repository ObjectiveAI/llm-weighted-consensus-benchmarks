The phrases \"installation pull squash\" and \"improve process\" suggest it's related to software management. Since \"pull request squash\" relates to code management, I think the best fit might be the Internal Project category. Let's decide on that!**Selecting a ticket category**\n\nI need to choose a category for the ticket, which could fit into \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Access,\" depending on the content. Since the request mentions squashing pull requests, it seems development-related, leaning more towards \"Internal Project\" rather than access rights. I could consider \"Miscellaneous\" if I'm unsure, but since the user is looking for a single classification, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit based on the context of development workflow and marketplace management.**Creating JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object according to the required format for categorizing the IT ticket. The schema specifies a category field with specific allowed values. I'll set the category to \"Internal Project,\" ensuring the string matches exactly with the required space. Since the instruction is simply to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" I won't include additional rationale or explanation. I\u2019ll just provide the plain JSON response: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} as requested."
