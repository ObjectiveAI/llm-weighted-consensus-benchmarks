The category should be \"Access.\" I'm thinking about nuances in the text, like \"leaver\" and \"form,\" as well as phrases like \"access removed\" and \"forwarded.\" While \"HR Support\" could fit because of the leaver form, this is really about removing access, which is IT-focused. So, to stay aligned with the user\u2019s request, I'll confirm that the final category is indeed {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
