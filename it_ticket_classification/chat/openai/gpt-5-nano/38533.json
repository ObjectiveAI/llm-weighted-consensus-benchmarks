The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It seems the ticket involves an Oracle update related to a change in the line manager career and an approval message issue. This could fit into either HR Support, Access, Administrative rights, or Internal Project. I need to select the most appropriate category.**Assigning IT ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing a ticket that mentions \"line manager,\" \"career,\" and \"approval message,\" suggesting it's related to HR processes or access rights for Oracle. The categories available include HR Support, Administrative rights, and Access. It appears the user needs help with an update in Oracle regarding their line manager, where an old approval message is still showing. Since there's no specific HR category, I should assign this ticket to \"HR Support\" since it deals with HR data and processes.**Finalizing IT ticket response**\n\nThe ticket mentions an \"approval message\" that still shows the old line manager, which could imply a need for permission to change that in Oracle. While it may relate to access rights, it primarily concerns an HR data change. The best category for this issue seems to be \"HR Support.\" To finalize, I should format my response properly and provide a JSON object: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. However, I'm wondering if I should just respond with the category itself based on prior tasks.**Formatting IT ticket category**\n\nThe instructions are clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket and format my output correctly. Given the schema, I should create a JSON object with \"category\": \"HR Support.\" The object structure looks like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support.\"} However, the schema in the prompt provides enumerated options to follow. I want to ensure I'm returning the correct category value, following the format for automated processing while keeping it straightforward. It makes sense to output just the category string in a JSON format.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
