They mention \"licenses for voice,\" \"routers,\" and \"sip trunk,\" so it seems to be about voice communication setups. I need to decide if it fits under categories like Hardware, Access, or possibly Miscellaneous. Given the focus on voice and networking, it might lean towards Hardware or Purchase, but I'll choose the best fitting category carefully.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis ticket is about purchasing licenses for voice, routers, SIP trunk, and redundancy features. It makes sense to categorize this as \"Purchase\" since it concerns equipment procurement and licensing. The mention of relocation and escalation further supports this being an IT infrastructure issue, but it doesn't fit under access or admin rights. To meet the system's response format, I\u2019ll output a JSON object indicating the category as \"Purchase.\"**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI need to output the category as a JSON object following the specified format. The instruction indicates that the response should just be the JSON without any extra text. Based on what I\u2019ve processed, the correct format is: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to stick strictly to this format to avoid any confusion. This way, it\u2019ll be clear and straightforward for any subsequent code operations."
