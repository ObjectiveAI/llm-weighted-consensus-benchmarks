The key phrases are \"creating named board\" and \"please make myself administrators,\" which suggest access rights are necessary. Since the ticket is focused on granting admin rights for the new project, the most suitable category here is \"Administrative rights.\" It aligns perfectly with the user's request for access.**Deciding on the ticket category**\n\nI see there's also an \"Internal Project\" category mentioned with the phrase, \"new project required Tuesday pm.\" This could fit, especially since they want to create a named board, which may indicate it\u2019s an internal project tool. However, the request for admin rights is quite significant, and phrases like \"please make myself administrators\" suggest they need elevated access. After reviewing, I think the best fit is \"Administrative rights,\" as that aligns closely with granting permissions and adding users.**Selecting the category for the ticket**\n\nThe category list includes \"Internal Project,\" which could fit given the user's mention of a new project with a Tuesday PM deadline. However, the main focus is on creating a board and granting admin rights, indicating that it's more about permissions within internal systems. Since there is a specific category for \"Administrative rights,\" I'll go with that. Heeding the prompt's instructions, I\u2019ll output the category as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
