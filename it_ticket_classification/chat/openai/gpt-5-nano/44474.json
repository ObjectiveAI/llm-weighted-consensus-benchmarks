It\u2019s tricky, though, because that category may imply internal IT project tasks rather than routine issues. Still, it seems like \"Hardware\" could also fit for the physical connection aspect.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIn IT ticket categorization, \"Internal Project\" often serves as a catch-all when nothing else fits. The user explicitly asked me to categorize the ticket, so they probably want a specific JSON-like output. I see the required format is a category object with predefined options. Given the focus on \"infrastructure\" and \"investigate\" in the ticket details, I'd choose \"Internal Project\" since it aligns with the infrastructure issue described, specifically about investigating a \"line connected duplex.\"{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
