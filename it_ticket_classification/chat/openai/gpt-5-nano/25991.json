I'm looking at terms like decommissioned, imported back, and location. From the category options, it seems most related to \"Hardware\" since it's about asset management and decommissioning. While \"Storage\" might fit if it's about assets in storage, it feels broader than just that. \"Internal Project\" is another possibility, but \"Hardware\" seems like the best choice overall.**Outputting IT ticket category**\n\nIt seems that this ticket is really about asset reconciliation, especially concerning decommissioned or imported assets, so I believe \"Hardware\" is the right choice. I need to format my response in JSON, specifically the category field that matches the requirements exactly, without any extra commentary. I\u2019ll make sure to output only the JSON object as follows: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This aligns perfectly with the instructions provided, so let's deliver that without any additional text."
