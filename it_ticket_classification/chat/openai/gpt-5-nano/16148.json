The ticket mentions a \"new starter\" and \"starter form,\" indicating it could be HR-related or an IT task for onboarding. I\u2019m considering if \"PM\" refers to a project manager. I think the best fit for this ticket might be \"HR Support,\" but it could also fall under \"Access\" for new user provisioning. The categories are all relevant to IT, so it's a bit tricky!**Analyzing IT ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m looking closely at the IT ticket categories, which include \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access.\" Since this ticket references a \"new starter,\" it's likely related to creating accounts and assigning access. The phrase \"please fill enclosed starter form\" implies there's form-filling involved for onboarding. While it could fit under \"HR Support,\" that's a bit unconventional here. I\u2019m noticing the ticket contains jumbled messages, and I need to classify it into one clear category based on the given text!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nIn analyzing the ticket, it seems most related to new starter onboarding. \"Access\" is the most fitting category since it pertains to provisioning access. Although \"HR Support\" could work if it were about HR forms, that's more about HR tasks than IT tasks. I think \"Access\" is definitely the best choice here, especially since the ticket doesn\u2019t mention anything about admin rights. So, I\u2019ll categorize the ticket as \"Access\" and prepare the output in the specified format!"
