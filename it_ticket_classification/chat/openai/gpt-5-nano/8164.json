They mentioned a \"new starter form\" related to a contractor, which suggests it's about onboarding. The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context, this seems to relate closely to \"Access\" and potentially \"HR Support.\" So I need to decide which category best matches the ticket's content.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI need to classify an IT ticket related to onboarding a contractor, based on the user's request for help with a \"starter form.\" It seems this involves access provisioning and account creation. I have two strong category options: \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" The ticket focuses on new employee onboarding, which leans towards \"HR Support.\" Although \"Administrative rights\" is also mentioned, it doesn't seem as relevant in this case. So, \"HR Support\" feels like the right choice.**Classifying IT ticket category**\n\nIn IT ticket systems, onboarding typically falls under \"Access\" because it involves granting system access. However, since the user referred to a \"new starter starter form\" and the category includes \"HR Support,\" this sounds like an HR-related query. The request for help with the starter form aligns with this too. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and respond with a JSON object. The required format is clear, so I'll provide: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
