The available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. My goal is to output a JSON object with a category. The ticket text references \"everest issues\" and seems to be about logging an issue with a meeting room, possibly about hardware problems. I'll need to analyze it closely to pick the best-fitting category.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket text mentions \"plugs tested solution providing cable,\" which sounds hardware-related. It could go in the \"Hardware\" category due to references to physical components. While \"log\" might imply \"Administrative rights,\" it seems to refer to logging a ticket instead. The mention of \"meeting room plugs tested\" also points toward hardware. Since the categories don\u2019t include \"Networking\" or \"Facilities,\" I\u2019ll settle on \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll produce the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. No extra formatting is needed!"
