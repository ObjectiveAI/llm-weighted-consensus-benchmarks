However, it could also be categorized as \"Access\" if the user is facing system access issues. I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support\" for the categorization.**Confirming ticket categorization**\n\nThe ticket mentions issues with submitting annual leave and an error message, which makes this an HR process. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" I need to create a JSON object with the proper syntax to reflect this category. The output should look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. \n\nSince the user asked for a categorization, I should ensure it\u2019s precise, including the uppercase format, to align with the allowed categories. I'll provide just the JSON output."
