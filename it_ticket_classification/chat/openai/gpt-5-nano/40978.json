It looks like a standard email bounce message with phrases like \"mailbox full\" and \"your message could not be delivered.\" The user listed some categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and more, but none specifically mention email. I\u2019m thinking \"Storage\" makes sense due to the mailbox being full, but \"Access\" might fit if I'm considering the password expiration mentioned. It's a mixed message!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe main issue here seems to be that the recipient's mailbox is full, which suggests it should fall under \"Storage\" since this relates to storage capacity. Although I'm wondering if \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous\" might fit too, they're not as relevant. The message itself is tough to parse, but since it mentions \"full mailbox,\" I'm leaning towards \"Storage.\" I think I should format my response with a JSON category object to keep it clear and organized.**Formatting the category response**\n\nThe prompt specifies that I need to format my response with a category string and an enum of allowed options. Since the best fit here is \"Storage,\" I\u2019ll output it as a JSON object: `{\"category\": \"Storage\"}`. The instruction is clear for categorizing this IT ticket, so I just need to respond with that JSON object without any extra commentary. It's important to keep the formatting correct with quotes."
