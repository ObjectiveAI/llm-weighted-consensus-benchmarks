The ticket discusses an Oracle issue, specifically a problem with deleting \"manage cards.\" It doesn't seem to relate to permissions, so I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" The essence of the issue seems to revolve around software functionality within an internal system related to Oracle. I'll format it in a JSON-like structure with the appropriate category.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, but the options don't include a \"Software\" category. The closest fits seem to be \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project,\" since the ticket addresses a bug in an internal system. It could also be \"Access\" regarding permissions for the delete button. Although context mentions \"logs,\" \"annual leave,\" and \"public holiday,\" they're not central to the issue. Considering everything, I think \"Miscellaneous\" might be the safest bet, especially for a general bug report. I'll format my response as a JSON-like object with the chosen category.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
