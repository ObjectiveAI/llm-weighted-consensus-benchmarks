The message mentions issues like \"cannot create because server protected\" and \"last recovery points created.\" These sound like they relate to backups and potentially storage systems. Given the context, I think it fits best under either the \"Storage\" or \"Hardware\" categories, especially since it deals with recovery points and backup issues. My instinct is to lean toward \"Storage.\"**Categorizing backup issues**\n\nI'm considering that the phrase \"server protected computer encountered error\" likely relates to a backup issue, pointing towards the Storage category. The alert message has a structure that resembles a data export. It mentions \"data source non writer\" and implies that there\u2019s a problem with creating recovery points because of this error. So, based on this analysis, it makes sense to categorize this IT ticket under Storage. I'll formulate the response as a JSON object with \"category\" labeled as \"Storage.\"**Producing category response**\n\nThe system specifies that we need to provide a category object formatted precisely as {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I want to ensure it meets the requirements exactly. The user has asked for a categorization, and it\u2019s crucial to keep the response succinct. I\u2019ll stick to delivering just the JSON-like object as instructed. I think the rationale is clear since this categorization relates to a backup issue, but I\u2019ll keep my response focused on the format."
