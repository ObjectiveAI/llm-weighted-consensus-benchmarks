The user mentions issues with builds not working, boot failures, and connection problems, which points towards a hardware or software issue. \n\nFrom the provided categories, the most appropriate fits seem to be either \"Hardware\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" However, since the ticket clearly focuses on booting problems, I'll lean towards \"Hardware.\" \n\nI'll finalize this with a JSON-like object that includes the selected category.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the category for this IT ticket. It mentions a boot failure and splash screen, which suggests it could belong to \"Hardware.\" \"Miscellaneous\" feels too broad, while \"Storage,\" \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights\" don\u2019t apply. \n\nSince the core issue revolves around booting and server connections, \u201cHardware\u201d seems to be the best fit. I'll go ahead and format this as a JSON object with the category set to \"Hardware.\"**Formatting the category output**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on the user\u2019s input. The instructions clearly state that I should only respond with the category in a specific JSON format. Since the options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others, I can confidently go with \"Hardware\" based on the boot failure aspect mentioned. \n\nI'll ensure the formatting is precise as expected: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. Just to be safe, if there were more uncertainty, \"Miscellaneous\" might work, but \"Hardware\" feels right for this case.**Finalizing the category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket text that mentions issues with builds not working and problems related to booting. The phrase \"checking connections\" suggests hardware connections are involved, and \"finding server\" hints at a potential network issue. \n\nSince there isn\u2019t a clear mention of software, it seems reasonable to categorize this under \"Hardware.\" I\u2019m ready to finalize the category selection and present it clearly in the required format."
