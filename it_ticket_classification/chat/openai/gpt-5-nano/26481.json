It\u2019s important to choose the right category to ensure it gets handled appropriately. I'll carefully consider the content of the ticket to ensure I\u2019m making the best choice. Let's clarify this and get it sorted!**Interpreting ticket about tokens**\n\nThis text seems to be a ticket related to hardware tokens, specifically security tokens that are expiring. It's requesting spare tokens, handling login queues, assigning tokens, and ordering additional fobs. There's also a mention of replacement tokens by location. I need to extract the key action items from this and ensure they are addressed properly. Understanding the urgency in the message is essential for making sure everything is resolved efficiently.**Categorizing access ticket**\n\nThis ticket is primarily about access since the tokens are used for authentication. It could be categorized under \"Hardware,\" given that they are hardware tokens. However, since the ticket frequently mentions access-related terms, \"Access\" may be the more appropriate category. It contains phrases like \"spare token,\" \"replacement tokens by locations,\" and \"assign token.\" Although it includes \"print\" for labeling, that's not the core issue. So, I should categorize this ticket as \"Access\" for clarity and efficiency.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
