Given the context, the best category appears to be \"Purchase\" since it relates to procuring a software license. I'll go ahead and assign it there!**Confirming category output**\n\nSince the ticket is primarily about licensing procurement, I\u2019m confident it falls under purchases. While access is a consideration, the focus on \"Sketch license request\" clearly suggests a purchase context. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize the ticket as \"Purchase.\" \n\nFor the output, I must format it as a JSON object, which should look like this: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. That's the valid category selection according to the schema. Now, let\u2019s confirm that format!**Confirming JSON output structure**\n\nI see that the instructions specify a JSON format with a schema for the allowable categories. While the schema outlines categories, the user simply needs us to categorize the ticket, which means I should stick to the required value output.\n\nI'll format my response as `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}` since that's the appropriate value for the category. It\u2019s essential to keep this concise and strictly in JSON format without any additional text or formatting!"
