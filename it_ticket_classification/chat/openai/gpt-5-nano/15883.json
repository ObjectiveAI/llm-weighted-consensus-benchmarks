It mentions things like builds failing, restarts, and devices. This points to a possible issue with software builds, so I might consider options like \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll need to map it to the right category, juggling all these bits of information while making sure it's accurate. Let's see what fits best!**Identifying ticket categories**\n\nLooking at the user's message, there are phrases like \"eliminate device,\" \"loads image,\" and \"restarts,\" which suggest a software build issue across multiple devices. My first instinct is to consider \"Internal Project,\" especially since it deals with builds and debugging, though that category typically relates to internal company projects. If it\u2019s more general, \"Miscellaneous\" could work too. Since there\u2019s no specific \"Software\" category, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit for this situation!**Outputting IT ticket category**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to respond with a JSON object in a specific format. The category options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the ticket involves builds and the need to investigate issues, \"Internal Project\" seems like the right choice. \n\nI'll make sure to format it correctly: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} with no extra text. That should do it!"
