I need to respond in a specific JSON format, so I\u2019ll structure it like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}\n\nThe schema requires that I provide a JSON object with a \"category\" field of string type. It seems essential to stay concise, as the instructions specify this categorization is the main focus, so I won\u2019t add any extra notes."
