It could fit in \"Access\" since it involves changing ownership permissions in a CRM. On the other hand, it might also relate to \"Administrative rights,\" as altering ownership might require admin permissions. I\u2019ll lean towards these two options for the category.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nThe phrase \"locked moment id\" is a bit confusing, but it seems like the user wants to change the owner of an opportunity, which ties into access control and permissions. I'll consider categorizing it as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The difference here is that \"Access\" pertains to login permissions, while \"Administrative rights\" refers to the ability to perform admin actions, like changing ownership. Since this is a privileged action, I think \"Administrative rights\" is the better choice for categorization.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
