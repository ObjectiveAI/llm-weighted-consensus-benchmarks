It mentions a customer password reset issue, which hints at a problem related to access. The prompt indicates a need to output a JSON object with a specific schema. Given the content points to difficulties customers are having with their passwords, I'll lean towards \"Access\" as the most fitting category. This matches the context better than \"Administrative rights.\" I'll prepare the JSON object accordingly.**Categorizing Password Reset Request**\n\nI see this request is about resetting customer passwords because they can't do it themselves. It\u2019s definitely IT support related to user access, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it involved granting privileges, there\u2019s no mention of that here, just password resets. I\u2019m going to prepare the JSON object accordingly: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and keep it clean without any additional text."
