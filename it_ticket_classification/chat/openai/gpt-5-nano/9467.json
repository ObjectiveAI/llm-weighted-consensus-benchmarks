The ticket says, \"backpack needed,\" which seems to be a request for a physical backpack. In an IT support context, it\u2019s most likely about a physical item, so I think it's appropriate to classify it as Hardware. There's no specific \"Equipment\" category, but Hardware would certainly cover that. If it's unclear, I could consider Miscellaneous, but Hardware seems to fit best.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to provide a JSON category object based on the specified schema. The required output format includes a \"category\" field with specific options like Hardware, HR Support, and others. Since I'm categorizing the IT ticket as \"Hardware,\" my final answer should be simply: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I must remember not to add any extra commentary, just the JSON structure as instructed. Alright, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and stick to the format."
