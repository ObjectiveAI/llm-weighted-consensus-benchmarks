The text mentions a \"new purchase\" and talks about monitors, purchase orders, and logging receipts. It seems ambiguous, but I can see connections to hardware and purchases. Given terms like \"mandatory receipts\" and requesting allocations, I think the best category would be \"Purchase.\" However, it might also fit under \"Hardware\" since it specifically involves monitors. I'll lean towards \"Purchase\" for this situation.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nAlright, I see the main elements of \"new purchase,\" \"log allocation after receive item,\" and \"receipts.\" This leans toward \"Purchase\" due to the procurement workflow. However, \"monitors\" suggests a hardware asset, and there's a \"Hardware\" category available for such requests. Though it might seem ambiguous, I think the more specific option is \"Purchase\" because it directly relates to a new purchase order. \n\nI'll make sure to present the output as a JSON object with the category included!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
