It seems like they might be asking for administrative rights since they want help with the form. Let's sort this out!**Parsing the IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m breaking down the ticket text. It starts with a mention of a new project, which seems important. Then there\u2019s a repeated request about filling a form, likely an administrative task. The mention of a custom pipeline linked to code raises concerns about access or permissions. However, the phrase about linking code versions is a bit confusing. Considering all of this, it might best fit under \"Internal Project,\" but I\u2019ll also consider \"Administrative rights\" since they could be asking for form access.**Finalizing the IT Ticket Category**\n\nIt looks like the appropriate category for this IT ticket is \"Internal Project,\" since it's discussing a new project, pipelines, and code linking. The user's text clearly relates to setting up an internal IT project, which fits well. I need to prepare a JSON object with the category field correctly set. The format should follow the specified JSON structure: a type object containing a string type for the category. Let\u2019s finalize this as a well-structured JSON response!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
