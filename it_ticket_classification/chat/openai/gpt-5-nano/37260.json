The best option seems to be \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d since we don\u2019t have a software category, even though there could be an argument for \"Administrative rights\" if there are permission issues. Since that isn\u2019t specified, I'll stick with \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d to stay clear and concise.**Providing Category Object**\n\nI see that I should only respond with the category object since the user asked to categorize the IT ticket. The output must be a JSON object containing the key \"category\" with a string value. The right response would be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I want to make sure everything is formatted properly for parsing. While I could suggest adding a subcategory or ask for clarification, keeping it minimal is best here since the user specifically asked for just the category. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward!"
