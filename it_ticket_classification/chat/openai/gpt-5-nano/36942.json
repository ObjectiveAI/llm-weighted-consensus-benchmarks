This could suggest a hardware issue, but there's also a chance it's software-related since there's no explicit \"Software\" category. However, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware\" since it's about a laptop not booting.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object following the category format specified. It allows categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and more. Given this, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}.\n\nWhile I might want to add a brief note, the instructions clearly focus on categorization. So, the output should stick strictly to the required JSON format. I\u2019ll keep it concise and crafted exactly as needed: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That should work perfectly!"
