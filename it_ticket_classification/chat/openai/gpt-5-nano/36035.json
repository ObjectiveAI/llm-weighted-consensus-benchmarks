Still, phrases like \"approve requisition\" and cost splitting suggest it deals with purchasing. Given the context, it seems \"Purchase\" is the best category since it aligns with requisition processes.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to decide the category for this IT ticket. The content mentions \"Macs required for developers,\" which suggests hardware, but the category \"Purchase\" seems more fitting because the ticket focuses on approvals and requisition workflows. The user specifically asked to categorize the ticket, so I\u2019ll format it as a JSON object with the category field. I\u2019ll choose \"Purchase\" as it aligns better with the core issue of requisition approvals and costs.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
