The ticket mentions a printer paper jam issue related to duplex printing, where others are experiencing similar problems. Given the content, I need to refer to the provided JSON schema for categorization. The most suitable category seems to be \"Hardware,\" since it directly relates to printer issues, even though \"Miscellaneous\" could also apply. Ultimately, \"Hardware\" is likely the best fit.**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nThe category is identified as \"Hardware,\" so I need to respond with a JSON object that specifies this. According to the instructions, I'll format it properly with the necessary property. It should look like this: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. The user specifically asked to categorize the IT ticket, so I want to keep my response clean and focus solely on the requested format without any extra text.
