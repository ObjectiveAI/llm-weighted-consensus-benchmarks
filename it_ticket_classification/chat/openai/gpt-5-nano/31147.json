I'm considering whether it fits under \"HR Support\" because it's related to onboarding, or if it should go under \"Administrative rights\" due to access control issues.**Analyzing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThis ticket seems to be about onboarding forms for a new employee, including issues with the process, form attachments, deadlines, and setup details. It fits well under \"HR Support\" since it's all about onboarding. However, there are mentions of hardware requirements and possibly access rights, which might suggest \"Access.\" But it isn't explicitly about access provisioning. I need to determine the best-fit category, potentially leaning toward \"HR Support\" while also considering other options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nGiven that this ticket is about an onboarding form and tracking the process for a \"new starter,\" it clearly fits under \"HR Support.\" I need to provide this information in JSON format, adhering to the instructions for the correct schema, which requires a \"category\" field. The format will be: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. I'll ensure it complies with the specified requirements, as it's essential to follow the correct structure. Let\u2019s go ahead and prepare that JSON snippet!**Outputting ticket category**\n\nI see some tasks that typically require just the category string, but the guidelines clearly state I need to output a JSON format with the key \"category.\" The schema is a bit confusing because it looks like a description rather than an actual JSON instance. However, since the instruction is to categorize the IT ticket, I\u2019ll output it as {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. I need to make sure there\u2019s no extra text, just that JSON format. Alright, I\u2019m delivering it!"
