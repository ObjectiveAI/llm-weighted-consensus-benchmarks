The user describes an issue with a meeting room phone not working and needing reconfiguration for an extension. Based on the categories available, it seems like this is a hardware issue since it's related to a device. It could also fit under \"Administrative rights,\" but that seems unnecessary here. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware,\" given that it clearly involves a hardware failure related to the phone.**Outputting JSON category format**\n\nI need to produce a JSON object that categorizes the IT ticket as \"Hardware.\" The required format specifies a structure, and typically I'd respond with just {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. However, there\u2019s a defined schema that includes a wrapper. It mentions that the output should have a \"type\" and \"properties.\" To be safe, even though I could take the simpler route, I'll make sure my output matches the schema: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",...]}}}.**Providing JSON response**\n\nIt seems the internal tool I\u2019m using only expects a simple JSON response with just a \"category\" field. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and respond with {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any extra text or formatting. This way, I'm making sure I meet the requirements directly. It's all about getting straight to the point without any fuss! I'll just focus on delivering exactly what\u2019s needed."
