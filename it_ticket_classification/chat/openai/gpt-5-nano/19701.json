The text mentions logging backups and running attached scripts, so it seems related to storage. While \"Administrative rights\" might apply to the request to run scripts, the primary focus is on backups. Given the information, I think the most fitting category is \"Storage\" since backups are fundamentally about managing data storage.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering categorizing this IT ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it's related to deployment. However, that category feels a bit broad. The content primarily mentions backups, which leads me to believe \"Storage\" is a better fit. I\u2019ll follow the JSON format for the output. According to the schema, I'll provide: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. The user specifically asked for a category, so I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and only deliver the JSON object as instructed.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
