The ticket mentions a \"new starter\" and a \"former employee,\" which makes me think it's related to onboarding and offboarding. It also references \"service now,\" which is an IT service management tool. Given the context, it seems best to classify this under \"Access\" since it's about adding or removing access for the new starter and former employee. \"HR Support\" could work too, but \"Access\" feels more appropriate here.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe text mentions a \"new starter\" and a \"former employee,\" which feels a bit jumbled, but it hints at needing access provisions, possibly due to missing details. I'll categorize this as \"Access,\" since it seems to involve user access. So I need to format this as a JSON object according to the provided schema. The final output should be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Okay, let's make sure to stick to that exact format before finalizing!"
