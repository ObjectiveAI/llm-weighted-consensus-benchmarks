It looks like they want to categorize it into one of the specified categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. I'll read through the content carefully for clues, especially terms like \"video connection check\" and \"video cables\" to help me figure out which category it fits into best.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm parsing the user\u2019s text, which includes terms like \"video connection check\" and \"video cables checking.\" This suggests it's likely related to hardware issues, so I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Hardware.\" However, there's also mention of something regarding an engineer, which could hint at \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but that feels less relevant. I think the best fit is \"Hardware,\" given the focus on video cables and connections. I need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category.**Preparing JSON structure**\n\nI need to format my output as a JSON object for an API. The required structure is straightforward: I\u2019ll include just the category value as \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ve confirmed the allowed values, so I\u2019ll stick to the specified format without adding any extra text. Here\u2019s my final output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
