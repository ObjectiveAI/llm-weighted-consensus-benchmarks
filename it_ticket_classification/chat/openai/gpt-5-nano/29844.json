There's mention of contributions to growth and strategies that might also connect to administrative tasks. Since it leans toward personnel updates and organizational roles, I'll likely categorize it as HR Support for clarity.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe content of the ticket mainly discusses personnel updates, such as roles and new hires, with mentions of terms like \"structure\" and \"interim.\" Although the ticket is labeled as IT, it seems more relevant to HR matters. Given the allowed categories, I should categorize it as \"HR Support\" since it focuses on personnel updates. I\u2019ll create a JSON object with the category set to \"HR Support\" and ensure it matches the exact format required. Here we go:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
