They mention \"no network access on cable\" and \"connect cable,\" which suggests a network connection issue. The most likely category seems to be \"Access,\" since it\u2019s about network access. However, it could also point to a \"Hardware\" issue if the cable is faulty. The wording is ambiguous, particularly with phrases like \"address set automatic.\" I'll proceed with \"Access\" as the primary category.**Categorizing IT tickets and formatting**\n\nTypical ticket triage for a network access issue would usually fall under \"Access\" or \"Networking,\" but given the categories list, \"Access\" seems best since it's clearly about network access. So, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access.\"\n\nNext, I need to create a JSON-like output. The required format is an object with a specific property: \n\n{\"category\": \"Access\"}\n\nI'll make sure to use the exact key 'category' and value according to the enumerated options provided. This ensures we follow the system's schema correctly.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
