Since it mentions purchase orders, I think it might best fit under the \"Purchase\" category, as it relates to PO reports.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the appropriate category for the IT ticket. While it might seem to fit \"Internal Project\" due to discussions of reporting and locations, the focus is primarily on PO reports and updates. It could also be \"Administrative rights\" if permission is needed. However, since the main topic relates to procurement systems, I'd lean toward categorizing it as \"Purchase.\" \n\nThe user might want this for triage, so I'll propose the \"Purchase\" category, adding \"Miscellaneous\" if unsure. I need to respond with a JSON-like object format for clarity.**Preparing JSON output format**\n\nI see that the system's requirements include a JSON schema for categorization. It looks like I need to create a JSON object with the \"category\" field as a string limited to specific values. \n\nGiven the context, I should output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} since that aligns with the focus on PO reports. I could consider \"Internal Project,\" but \"Purchase\" is the clear choice. The final output will be minimal, just presenting the JSON as instructed. Let\u2019s finalize that!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
