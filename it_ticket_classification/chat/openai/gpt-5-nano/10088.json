The ticket states, \"new starter hi please assist completion attached return form also empty part assist great thanks officer.\" \n\nHere, it sounds like the user is requesting help with completing a return form, which implies it's related to onboarding a new employee. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"HR Support.\" I think that fits best since it's about assisting a new starter!**Classifying IT ticket request**\n\nThe user is asking for help with completing an attached return form, and there's a mention of an \"empty part,\" which suggests there might be missing sections. \n\nWhen looking at the ticket categories, \"Access\" could relate to permissions for a new starter. However, since this involves onboarding, it leans more towards \"HR Support.\" The request also implies administrative assistance, but \"Administrative rights\" would fit less directly. Given all this, I think \"HR Support\" is the best category to choose.**Classifying IT ticket categories**\n\nIn classifying the IT ticket, the message about \"assist completion attached return form\" suggests it might relate to an employee return form. The categories I have include things like HR Support, Access, and more. I'm considering the user's request for onboarding, which indicates a new starter needing help with a form. While \"Access\" fits due to login provisioning, \"HR Support\" might also be relevant for onboarding assistance. Ultimately, I believe \"HR Support\" is the better fit for this situation.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nThe phrase \"new starter\" suggests this ticket is about employee onboarding, where \"Access\" for provisioning accounts is common. The user requests help with an \"attached return form,\" which might imply an empty section needing completion. However, that form doesn't seem strictly related to IT. Given the categories, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" Since this involves setting up accounts for new staff, I'm deciding on \"Access\" to reflect the necessary provisioning for new starters. I\u2019ll prepare to output the response in a JSON format.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI've reviewed the instruction schema, and I see that it requires a JSON object. The category I've decided on is \"Access,\" so the final response should look like this: {\"category\": \"Access\"}.\n\nSince the user requested to \"categorize this IT ticket,\" I\u2019ll make sure to respond strictly with that JSON format. So, I'm ready to output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's proceed with that!"
