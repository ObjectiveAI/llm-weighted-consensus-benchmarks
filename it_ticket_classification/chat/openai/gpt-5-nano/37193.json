The approval process seems to have been halted due to an application error, and it mentions a variety of keywords like submission date, assignee, and task number. It feels like this should fall under an \"Internal Project\" category. I\u2019m pondering whether \"Access\" fits, but it\u2019s more about administrative rights related to the approval process. I need to decide the right category for this issue.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about the best way to categorize an IT ticket that mentions things like the discovery phase, submission date, and trip per diem, which makes me lean towards \"Internal Project.\" The content involves an Oracle server incident and an application error that halted the approval process. While \"Administrative rights\" could be a consideration, it\u2019s not explicitly mentioned. I believe \"Internal Project\" is the best fit, so I\u2019ll prepare a JSON response like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
