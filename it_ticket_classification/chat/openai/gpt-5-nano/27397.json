The available categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The user's text mentions the decommissioning of sites, which suggests it pertains to systems. I think \"Internal Project\" might be the best fit since it relates to the decommissioning process. Time to output a JSON object with the selected category.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI notice there\u2019s no explicit hardware mention, but the topic of decommissioning suggests it could relate. The available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since decommissioning is about asset management, \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems to fit best for this context. The user's note indicates a scheduling task for decommissioned sites, so I'll output the required JSON with \"Internal Project\" as the category: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Returning JSON object**\n\nI need to present a JSON object specifically with the \"category\" field restricted to the allowed values. So, my output should simply be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I'll ensure there's no additional text, just the required JSON as instructed. It's all about keeping it clean and straightforward for the user\u2019s needs. Let's stick to that!"
