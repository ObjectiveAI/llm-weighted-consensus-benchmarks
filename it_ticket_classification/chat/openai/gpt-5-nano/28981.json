Key phrases like \"new starter centre,\" \"starting October,\" and \"attached filled out form\" jump out at me. This looks related to HR support and onboarding processes. The categorization options I have include Hardware, HR Support, Access, among others. Since the user is discussing onboarding and forms, it seems most appropriate to assign it to HR Support.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe content mentions terms like \"new starter center,\" \"attached filled out form,\" and \"application engineer ext,\" which suggests it's related to onboarding. This leans towards HR Support as the appropriate category. The user has asked me to categorize the IT ticket, and I'll respond with a JSON format. \n\nI\u2019ll present it as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I want to ensure I follow the instructions carefully, so I\u2019ll double-check that I use the capitalization exactly as required.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
