The user mentioned access cards for the integration team, which suggests this is primarily an access issue. While \"Hardware\" could apply since access cards are hardware tokens, \"Access\" feels like the more fitting category here. So, I'll structure the JSON response as {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI need to follow the instruction that specifies the output format as a category object with a string for the category. So, I'll respond with the JSON as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's important to ensure that the JSON is valid with the proper quotes and structure. I'll avoid adding extra commentary to keep things simple and to the point. Let's deliver this response correctly!"
