Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket under \"Access\" and format my response as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the issue with the ticket that states, \"locked account Outlook keeps asking for credentials.\" This is clearly an access issue since it involves a locked account and login prompts. \n\nWhile I considered \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d the focus is definitely on credentials. So, \u201cAccess\u201d is the best fit. I\u2019ll format my response strictly as a JSON object, which looks like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll provide!"
