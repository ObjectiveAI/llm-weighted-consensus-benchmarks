The categories are \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights\". The ticket mentions RAM memory expansion, purchasing an additional module, and running multiple virtual machines. Both \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase\" seem relevant, but since it focuses on RAM expansion, I think \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate category. So, I\u2019ll generate a JSON-like response categorizing this ticket as \"Hardware\".**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize the IT ticket. There's a mention of \"purchase additional module,\" which relates to procurement, but the main focus is on memory expansion, which falls under hardware. The category list allows for both \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" Given that the primary topic is a RAM upgrade, I think \"Hardware\" is the safest choice. Additionally, the request for advice on increasing memory reinforces this. I'll conclude with the final response as a JSON object: category: \"Hardware\".{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
