The instruction asks me to categorize it, so I'm thinking \"Internal Project\" might fit since it's related to onboarding tasks. The term \"new starter\" suggests onboarding as well. I need to ensure my answer is in the correct JSON format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Should I consider other categories like \"Hardware\"? I'll stick with my choice for now.**Categorizing onboarding tasks**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on the content related to onboarding for a new starter, which includes license activation. It seems like \"Internal Project\" is the most suitable category since it involves multiple tasks related to this onboarding process. There\u2019s also nothing specified about \"Administrative rights,\" so that doesn't apply here. I need to make sure to respond in the correct format as required. So I'll go ahead and provide: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
