It mentions checking available hardware resources for a new test environment, along with terms like \"storage,\" \"virtual,\" \"docker,\" \"azure,\" and \"migration.\" This makes me think it could fit under \"Internal Project,\" \"Hardware,\" or \"Storage.\" \"Hardware\" aligns with the resources reference, while \"Storage\" could relate to storage needs. Overall, it seems to focus on infrastructure provisioning for a test environment.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm thinking about categorizing the IT ticket. \"Internal Project\" seems appropriate since it\u2019s focused on building test environment resources and migration. \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t fit here, and \"Purchase\" isn't relevant since there\u2019s no actual request for resources\u2014just available hardware resources and approvals. So, \"Internal Project\" is the go-to choice, but \"Hardware\" might also work since it's about hardware resources. The ticket discusses resource allocation and setting up a test environment, leaning toward \"Internal Project.\"{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
