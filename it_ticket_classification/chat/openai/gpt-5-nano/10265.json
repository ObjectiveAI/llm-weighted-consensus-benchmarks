I consider \"Administrative rights\" for admin privileges, which doesn't apply here. \"Access\" would apply to login issues, and \"Hardware\" or \"Storage\" would be specific to device issues. \"Internal Project\" might relate to the mention of \"grades,\" but I'm leaning more toward \"Purchase\" since it involves a cost offer. It could be about showing grades or scheduling, but I should stick with \"Purchase\" for clarity.**Delivering IT ticket category**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to provide a JSON object that matches the category schema. The text mentions \"cost offer\" and \"purchase,\" which point clearly to the \"Purchase\" category. I want to keep it simple, so I\u2019ll respond with just the category formatted as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nThis should meet their request neatly. I\u2019ll make sure it uses the allowed category values correctly."
