The user is asking about \"leavers notifications\" connected to some employees leaving. I see there are several categories available like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given that it focuses on employee offboarding and the management of notifications, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit, but I\u2019m also considering \"Access\" if it pertains to access changes for those leavers.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the content requesting amendments to \"leavers notifications\" for Friday in November. The user seems to want updates to the leavers list and notifications, which might indicate it relates to HR admin tasks. \"Administrative rights\" could apply if assigning someone, but \"Access\" likely pertains to user access management. In this case, \"HR Support\" seems to fit best, as it's about handling employee departures. I need to format a JSON response with the selected category.**Categorizing leavers notifications**\n\nIt seems like this ticket is about managing notifications for employees leaving the company. The word \"assign\" likely refers to designating someone for this task. \"Please amend leavers include\" suggests adding individuals to the notification list. I\u2019m considering \"HR Support\" since it pertains to HR processes, but it could also be categorized as \"Access\" because it deals with user access for leavers. Since there's no explicit \u201cOffboarding\u201d category, so \"Access\" would fit best if it's about adjusting notifications for offboarding.**Choosing the right category**\n\nThis ticket is about offboarding processes, specifically related to \"leavers,\" which refers to employees who are leaving. The phrase \"notifications for leavers\" indicates a procedure, and \"friday november\" likely points to the scheduling of these notifications. Considering all this, it could fit into either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" but I think \"Access\" is a better match since it directly relates to user access management. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, keeping it concise as requested.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
