The content mentions screens on a laptop and running out of disk space multiple times. It's a bit messy, but it seems to relate to hardware or storage issues. The mention of \"location where store working folders\" hints at a need for access to proper storage to avoid losing work. I'll proceed with categorizing it accordingly.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nI think the ticket should be categorized as Storage since the main issue appears to be a disk space shortage. The user's urgent request suggests a risk of data loss, reinforcing the need to focus on where to store working folders. I\u2019ll go with \"Storage\" as the category, even though \"Hardware\" might fit too. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object since the prompt requires it. So it\u2019ll look like: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Formatting the Response**\n\nThe instructions are clear: I need to format the output simply with just the category. So I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. There\u2019s no need to provide extra explanations unless the user asks for more details. Since the user specifically requested categorization, I\u2019ll stick to the format and deliver the response without any additional information. Let's go ahead and finalize this!"
