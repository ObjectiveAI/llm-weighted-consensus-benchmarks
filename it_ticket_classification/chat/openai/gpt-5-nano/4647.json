The ticket text is a bit jumbled but seems focused on creating a template for generic requests, which includes terms like \"template,\" \"requests,\" and \"teams.\" This makes me think it\u2019s related to some internal project since it doesn't mention hardware, storage, or purchasing. I\u2019m considering labeling it as \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Administrative rights.\" It\u2019s definitely not about anything else on the list.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI'm thinking that the best fit for this IT ticket about template creation is \"Internal Project.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could be considered, it seems less relevant. \"Miscellaneous\" is another option for unknown categories, but it doesn't quite match here. I\u2019m figuring I need to output a JSON object with the category field, precisely as specified. So I\u2019ll provide: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, making sure everything is correctly spelled and formatted. Let's confirm before finalizing!"
