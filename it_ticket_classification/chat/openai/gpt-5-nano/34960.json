Let's move forward with that!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like the user is asking for help with a potential hardware issue in what seems to be a meeting room, possibly related to equipment like a projector or AV system. Since the category options include Hardware, that makes the most sense. I won't categorize it under HR or Access since it clearly points to a technical concern. I\u2019ll create the JSON object with the category set as \"Hardware\" now. Here\u2019s how it looks:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
