The ticket is likely related to hardware since a tape library is used for backup storage. So, I\u2019m considering the categories available: \u201cHardware\u201d and \u201cStorage.\u201d Since tape libraries specifically pertain to storage, I think \u201cStorage\u201d is the best fit here. It seems like this is a straightforward decision based on the content of the ticket.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions liaising with a hardware provider about issues with a tape library, which is primarily storage hardware. I think the appropriate category here is \u201cStorage.\u201d I need to respond with this category in a specific JSON format. It seems the best output would be: `{\"category\":\"Storage\"}`. While I could suggest next steps, the instruction just asks for categorization, so I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and ensure the output is in JSON format for clarity and machine readability."
