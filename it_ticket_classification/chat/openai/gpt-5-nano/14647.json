The key points are about being unable to submit leave requests and backdated leaves, which suggests it falls under HR Support. While Access could be relevant if there are login problems, the mention of \"annual leaves\" leans toward HR. I should definitely classify it under HR Support as the primary category.**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt looks like the user's mention of being \"unable to submit\" points to issues with submitting their annual leave request, potentially due to system access. This could relate to the \"Access\" category if it\u2019s about submission issues or \"Administrative rights\" if they lack permission. However, since it mainly involves annual leave, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit. While job roles like \"programme portfolio officer\" and \"architect\" are mentioned, they don't override the need to categorize it under HR Support for leave processes.**Clarifying ticket details**\n\nThe ticket states there are issues with submitting an annual leave request, and it mentions wanting to backdate leave entries. This indicates a system issue with the leave management platform. While it could relate to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" it doesn't seem to fit under hardware, storage, purchase, or internal projects. Since it primarily concerns IT issues around leave submissions rather than HR processes, I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Access\" based on the specific context.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user is seeking IT assistance for an issue related to submitting annual leave requests, which suggests that the category should reflect an IT problem. While \"Access\" fits since it involves system access, the phrase \"unable to submit\" indicates it's more about submission issues than login problems. However, many tickets like this get categorized under \"HR Support\" since they deal with HR processes. Given the user's context, \"HR Support\" feels right, but I\u2019m still deciding between that and \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
