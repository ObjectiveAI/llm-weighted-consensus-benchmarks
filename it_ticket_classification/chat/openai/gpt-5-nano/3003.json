The user's message about a \u201csecond adapter\u201d is a bit unclear, but it seems they're requesting an adapter for immediate use at work. Since it involves hardware, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this as \"Hardware,\" although it could also fit under \"Purchase\" if they're requesting to acquire another adapter. Overall, it looks like they truly need advice about getting this adapter quickly for their work.**Categorizing helpdesk ticket**\n\nIn triage, the phrase \"second adapter for second adapter\" is confusing, but it could refer to a hardware adapter, like a USB-C to HDMI. Since it\u2019s a short message focused on hardware, I\u2019m inclined to categorize this as \"Hardware.\" Although the user isn\u2019t explicitly stating \"purchase,\" the context indicates they need to acquire an adapter for work tomorrow. So, I think \"Hardware\" fits best, with a note that they\u2019re seeking advice on obtaining this second adapter.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
