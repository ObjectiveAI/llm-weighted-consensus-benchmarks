So, I\u2019ll interpret this ticket as belonging to the \"Access\" category. Now, I'll format this into a JSON object with the appropriate category key.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the available categories for the IT ticket. \"Access\" stands out as the most relevant choice, especially since it relates to remote work access, systems, VPN, and remote desktop issues. The ticket mentions raising tickets and resolving issues with remote assistance.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Access\" and format it correctly as a JSON object. The output will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nI\u2019ll keep it concise since they just asked for the category without extra text."
