The mention of \"ad account still active\" suggests it relates to Active Directory, indicating a user account issue. Since they\u2019re asking to check if it was requested by someone, this seems to fall under user access concerns. I think \u201cAccess\u201d is the most fitting category here, as it relates to general account access rather than just administrative rights.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s request is clear: they want to verify if an AD account is still active and if it was requested by someone. I\u2019ve decided to categorize this ticket as \u201cAccess.\u201d I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object in the correct format. Following the instructions, my final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I don\u2019t need any extra comments, just the concise response should suffice. So let's go ahead and finalize it!"
