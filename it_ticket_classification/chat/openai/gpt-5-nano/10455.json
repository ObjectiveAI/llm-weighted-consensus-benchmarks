Keywords like \"new starter Bogota,\" \"compliance officer,\" and \"senior technician joining\" suggest that it's about onboarding in Colombia. It mentions \"access\" and \"form,\" which could indicate a request for access provisioning. Given that this centers around a new hire, the most suitable category seems to be \"HR Support\" since it relates to onboarding and administrative rights.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI need to choose the best category for this IT ticket. The options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and a few others. The user's text focuses on onboarding a new starter in Bogota, Colombia, mentioning completing forms and regulatory checks. This leans toward \"HR Support,\" as onboarding typically falls under that. While \"Access\" could be relevant for account setup, \"HR Support\" feels like the most appropriate choice given the context. So, I\u2019ll go with that!**Formatting the category**\n\nI recognize there's an \"Access\" category that might fit, especially with mentions of a technician joining, which could suggest access provisioning. But the focus on \"complete form\" leans more HR-like. Since the user hasn\u2019t requested justification, I need only to categorize the ticket. The output must be in a specific JSON format, so I\u2019ll just provide: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. No extra text\u2014just the JSON!"
