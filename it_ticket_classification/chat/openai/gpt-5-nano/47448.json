The ticket describes a user having trouble submitting a time sheet in Oracle for last week and facing issues saving it despite it being approved. This sounds primarily related to HR Support, as it involves payroll and time tracking. It doesn\u2019t seem to fit under Hardware or Access categories. So yeah, HR Support seems like the best match!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nIt seems clear that the ticket should fall under \"HR Support\" since it's about time sheets related to an HR system. While \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" could also apply, the focus here is on HR functions rather than application issues or access. Since the provided categories don\u2019t include \"Application\" or \"Oracle,\" \"HR Support\" is definitely the most fitting. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object, so it\u2019ll simply be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. No extra text!"
