The options include categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and a few others. The user\u2019s message discusses issues with installed machines, availability of a viewer, and installation locations, suggesting it relates to access or licensing limitations. It seems to fit more into \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll carefully consider the content before making a decision on the right category.**Parsing user request**\n\nLet\u2019s unpack this message: there's a lot to comb through. The user touches on topics like the \"viewer,\" \"diagrams,\" and issues with documentation being inaccessible for many users. It sounds like they\u2019re asking about the viewer that's included in the default installation, its licensing limitations, and where to find information on its installation. They also mention testing with sample users and concerns about documentation accessibility. It\u2019s a bit jumbled, but those are the main points I can identify!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm thinking this ticket likely concerns \"Access\" to documentation or possibly \"Administrative rights\" for software installation. The user references the \"installed by default build\" and seems to ask where to find installation information, hinting at deployment issues. While I could consider \"Internal Project,\" it doesn't quite fit since it's not about project tasks. Given that they mention the inability to access documentation, I'll go with \"Access\" as it aligns well with their concerns about availability and installation.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe \"Access\" category seems to be the best fit as it encompasses access to resources, documents, and licenses. While \"Purchase,\" \"Storage,\" \"Hardware,\" and \"HR Support\" don\u2019t apply, \"Administrative rights\" might work if the user needs admin access to install the viewer. However, considering they mention issues with the viewer's availability and licensing limitations, the \"Internal Project\" category could be relevant too, as it relates to diagrams and architecture. Ultimately, I'll stick with \"Access\" since it aligns best with their concerns. I\u2019ll present the category in the required format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
