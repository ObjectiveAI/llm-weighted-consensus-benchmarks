Since it involves access to software, the best category seems to be \"Access.\" However, I also see the potential for \"Administrative rights\" due to the admin-level aspect. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" as it fits the general theme. But I\u2019ll weigh both options carefully before making a final decision.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI'm looking at the ticket that requests permissions for Confluence. The mention of \"add permissions\" suggests it's related to access. Although \"Administrative rights\" could apply, it feels more specific than necessary. Given the broader context, I'm leaning towards \"Access,\" as it aligns well with what the user is asking for. I need to format the response correctly as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's ensure that only this JSON payload is included in the final output."
