They mention that their allowed leave isn't showing correctly. It seems to involve HR processes regarding their leave balance. So, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the appropriate category since it pertains directly to leave management. \"Administrative rights\" doesn't fit since this isn\u2019t about access permissions. I'm aiming to ensure the right category is selected to assist the user properly!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to decide how to categorize the IT ticket. While I considered \"Access\" since it mentions viewing leave, it doesn\u2019t seem to fit because they can view it; the issue is more about incorrect information. \"Internal Project\" doesn't apply either. Based on the user's question around annual leave, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" because it relates directly to HR policy and data. It\u2019s about how the leave balance displays, so \"HR Support\" looks like the best choice!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
