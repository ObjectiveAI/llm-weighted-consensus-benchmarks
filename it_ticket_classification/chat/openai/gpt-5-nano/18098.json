This feels like the best fit!**Deciding on category**\n\nI'm debating whether to categorize this IT ticket under \"Internal Project\" or \"Access,\" depending on what \"code setup\" refers to. It seems related to setting up a code based on the attached form, potentially about provisioning access or a project code within Oracle Fusion. \n\nSince the text mentions \"new project code,\" it really hints at internal project management. The \"Internal Project\" category feels like the best fit. I think I\u2019ll go with that and then output it in JSON format.**Ensuring correct format**\n\nI need to make sure I follow the correct output format as specified in the prompt. It says to return a JSON object with a \"category\" field from a specific list of allowed categories.  \n\nSince I decided that \"Internal Project\" is the best choice, I\u2019ll format my output accordingly. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Okay, I\u2019m ready to finalize that!"
