Phrases like \"meeting failure\" stand out as it appears twice. The phrase about \"log was having issues setting up meeting\" suggests it could relate to login issues. So I\u2019m contemplating which category fits best: \"Access\", \"Administrative rights\", or \"Internal Project\"? The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI see that the text seems to indicate possible login issues, especially with repeated phrases like \"meeting failure.\" The mention of \"being signed normal\" could imply inconsistency during the login process. There's definitely the \"Access\" category for such login issues, which fits well since it relates to setting up meetings. Although \"Miscellaneous\" is an option due to the vague nature of the text, I think \"Access\" is the more precise choice, as it directly pertains to login problems.{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
