The categories provided are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the issue is related to Microsoft Word but doesn't fit neatly into any specific category, I think Miscellaneous is the best option. It\u2019s sort of a catch-all for issues that don\u2019t clearly belong elsewhere. I'll output the JSON object with \"category\": \"Miscellaneous\".**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI considered categorizing this IT ticket as \"Internal Project,\" but that's not quite right. It seems to involve issues with Word since the user mentioned \"documents only mode.\" If they're unable to type in Word, it might indicate it's stuck in \"Read-Only\" mode. Since none of the provided categories cover software issues directly, \"Miscellaneous\" fits best. I'll deliver the appropriate JSON output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} to correctly categorize the ticket."
