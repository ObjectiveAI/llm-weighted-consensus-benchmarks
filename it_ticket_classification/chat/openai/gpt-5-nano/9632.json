The categories available are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. After analyzing the content, it seems to focus on backup tapes, tape change templates, updating tickets, and references to escalated changes. This information suggests that it would best fit in the \"Storage\" category, given the context of backup activities.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the IT ticket to categorize it properly, and it really points toward storage, especially with mentions of \"backup tapes,\" \"locations,\" and \"backup activities.\" The available categories include \"Storage,\" which seems like the best fit. While \"Hardware\" could be an option due to tape drives, this ticket mainly discusses processes rather than hardware. Other categories like \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" don\u2019t apply here. So, I'll go with \"Storage\" and format the response as a JSON object.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
