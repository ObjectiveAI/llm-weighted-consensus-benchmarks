Considering the categories provided\u2014like \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and \"Hardware\"\u2014it seems like it might be related to a software build issue on a CI slave node. Since \"Software\" isn't an option, I'll probably go with \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" based on the context of their problem.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm looking at the IT ticket details, and the closest category seems to be \"Internal Project\" since it involves build issues with a configured job. If the problem relates to the slave machine hardware, it could also fit under \"Hardware.\" The user mentioned Maven errors, pointing to a potential build failure from their CI system. Since \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" don't apply, if I'm unsure, I might fallback to \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll format my answer in JSON as needed."
