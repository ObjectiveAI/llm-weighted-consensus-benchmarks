This could fit into either \"HR Support,\" since it involves onboarding, or potentially \"Access\" for Confluence access. I'll have to decide between these categories.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user mentions \"Confluence,\" a software platform used for documentation, and \"new starter,\" which indicates onboarding. \"Bucharest\" seems to be the location, and \"Friday PM\" refers to the time. The message is a bit garbled, but I can extract that it\u2019s likely related to onboarding someone new and granting them access to Confluence. I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Access,\" since it's about providing access permissions. There may be an attachment with more details too, suggesting further action may be needed.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nThis ticket is about setting up a new user and granting access to Confluence, so it seems fitting to categorize it as \"Access.\" I think it's important to stick to the user's request for a JSON output without extra text, as they might be expecting a straightforward answer. The response format should be in JSON, so I\u2019ll prepare the output as follows: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That keeps it clear and within the designated guidelines!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
