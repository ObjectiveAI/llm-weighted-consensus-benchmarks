The request is messy, but it seems the user wants to cancel a series of recurring meetings, particularly related to Outlook sessions scheduled for Wednesdays in November. They're referring to multiple sessions created by a PM concerning maternity leave and specific planning sessions, like sprint reviews and pre-planning. Ultimately, I think they\u2019re asking to cancel those recurring meetings.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering which category the ticket falls under. It\u2019s about Outlook calendar meetings, so \"Administrative rights\" could fit if they need to cancel meetings created by someone else. Although, it could also be \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Internal Project\" since it's related to sprint planning and reviews. The mention of maternity leave adds some nuance, possibly indicating a project team context. I need to make sure it\u2019s properly categorized based on those details.**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI think the best fit for this ticket is \"Internal Project\" since it revolves around sprint planning and project calendars. It could also be \"Access\" if they need permission to modify meetings created by the PM, who might be on maternity leave. The user clearly wants to cancel these recurring sessions. I'll categorize this as \"Internal Project\" and craft a JSON response with the category field for the tool. I might also include a brief note for clarity.**Delivering Response**\n\nI see that the instruction specifies to provide only a category object. The system expects a JSON object containing \"category\" as a string with the allowed values. So, the proper response is straightforward: I'll deliver it as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} without any extra content. It's essential to keep things concise and focused on what's required. I'll make sure that's clear in my response!"
