This could relate to HR since they might want to update their personal information due to this change. The best fitting category could either be \"HR Support\" or \"Access,\" but it seems more like HR Support than administrative rights since it's about personal info modification.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIt seems the user is asking to modify information rather than requesting access. Since this is related to a career change, it falls under HR matters rather than IT hardware or software. I\u2019ll categorize this as \"HR Support\" since it aligns with their request. I need to respond in the required JSON-like format, ensuring it follows the structure: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll stick to that format without adding any extra text."
