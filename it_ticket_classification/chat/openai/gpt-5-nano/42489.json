The text refers to something that was \"erased\" and needing to be retrieved urgently. Given this context, the best fit seems to be the \"Storage\" category since it relates to data recovery. There's a chance it could also fit under \"Access\" or \"Internal Project,\" but \"Storage\" appears to be the most suitable option for this ticket.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that includes the category field. The format specified is a schema-like structure, so I should output: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. The instructions indicate that we should return the category without any additional commentary or formatting. I\u2019ll ensure to keep it simple and just provide the JSON. So my final output will solely be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. No extras\u2014just the clean JSON format!"
