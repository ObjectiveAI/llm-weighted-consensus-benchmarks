The user seems unable to modify permissions or role assignments, asking for assistance with updating dates. It sounds like the underlying issue relates to access rights and permissions. I think I should categorize this as \"Access,\" possibly refining it to \"Administrative rights\" for specificity. The goal here is to clarify access and get help with permission modifications. So, \"Access\" feels like the right choice!**Deciding the category**\n\nI\u2019m considering categorizing the ticket, and it seems \"Administrative rights\" is a strong choice since it directly relates to role assignments and permissions preventing modifications. The ticket likely requires more specific access rights for these modifications. The format for my response needs to be a JSON object with one of the specified categories. Given that the text highlights \"modifications because rights,\" I feel confident in classifying this as \"Administrative rights.\" So, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object accordingly!{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
