Given the options\u2014like \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d and \u201cInternal Project,\u201d I\u2019m leaning towards classifying it as \"Miscellaneous\" since it deals with a mail filter problem. It looks like missing emails is the core issue here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm working on categorizing an IT ticket based on the user's request. The ticket does not fit into categories like Hardware, HR, Access, or Storage. \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a safe option since it's about mail filtering issues; it doesn\u2019t really align with \"Internal Project\" or other categories either. The output should be a valid JSON object with the category labeled as \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll format it like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.
