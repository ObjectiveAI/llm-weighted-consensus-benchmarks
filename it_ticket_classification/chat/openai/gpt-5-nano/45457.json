It\u2019s describing an issue where users' contacts have disappeared, and the desktop looks rearranged after booting. It mentions changes after a restart while connected via wireless and also after switching to a cable connection. It seems there's an ongoing issue after updates during the weekend. I\u2019ll parse it to understand the specific details better.**Parsing IT Ticket Details**\n\nIt seems like the issue is that users' contacts have disappeared. They're also mentioning that their desktop layout looks rearranged after booting, and there are changes happening after a restart. It appears that the behavior differs when connected wirelessly versus through a cable. There's a mention of a \"weekend update,\" which likely indicates that the problem began after that update. Overall, this seems to involve multiple symptoms, but some parts are still unclear.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket based on the issue described. The problem of \"contacts disappeared\" could relate to various areas such as access, miscellaneous issues, or storage since it deals with contact data visibility. The mention of desktop rearrangement and network connection differences suggests hardware involvement. However, since this primarily relates to software behavior and data loss, I believe categorizing it under \"Storage\" fits best, as it deals with the lost contacts.**Categorizing IT Ticket Symptoms**\n\nThe symptoms indicate that the desktop looked rearranged after booting, which might imply a profile issue or changes due to a weekend OS update. This situation involves multiple potential problems, like user profiles and Windows Explorer view settings. If I have to choose one category, \"Miscellaneous\" might work, though a more specific category would be preferable. Since the issue includes missing contacts, \"Storage\" seems the most fitting. Yet, the desktop arrangement could indicate software involvement, so it could also fall under \"Miscellaneous.\" I think it'd be wise to ask for clarification!{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
