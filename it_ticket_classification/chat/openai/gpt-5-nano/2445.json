It likely involves access issues, possibly concerning passwords for a web client and signing contracts. Given the context, \"Access\" fits best for this ticket since it relates to login credentials and permissions.**Categorizing Client Access Request**\n\nThe user mentioned, \"new client not pas web client,\" which I think likely means \"new client not pass web client.\" It's tricky to fully understand, but it hints at onboarding a new client and could relate to signed contracts and linking to Active Directory. The tasks involve provisioning access, and since that aligns with access issues, \"Access\" seems like the appropriate category. I\u2019ll prepare to respond with the required JSON format for the category: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
