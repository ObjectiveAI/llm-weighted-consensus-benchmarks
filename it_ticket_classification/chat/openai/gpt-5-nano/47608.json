The content mainly references HR-related issues and exit interviews. Given the categories available, it seems most appropriate to categorize this ticket under \"HR Support.\" After all, it concerns employee announcements and their exit processes. Let's ensure clarity in this classification to best assist the user with their request.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket concerning an employee's leaving announcement, received on Friday. I need to consider the categories available, and \"HR Support\" seems like a strong fit because it relates to employee offboarding and announcements. However, the mention of \u201cnote mailbox does receive incoming\u201d suggests there could be an access issue regarding email settings for the departing employee. I should probably categorize this under \"HR Support\" because it aligns best with the situation.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user mentioned adjustments for \"setting leaving announcements,\" which makes me think this involves modifying distribution lists or configuring out-of-office auto-responses for an employee. The reference to \"exit interviews\" also points towards an HR-focused process. Since this ticket is primarily about the employee's departure, the best category is \"HR Support.\" I'll format my response as a JSON object following the specified schema, ensuring it looks like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I'll just stick to what\u2019s needed!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
