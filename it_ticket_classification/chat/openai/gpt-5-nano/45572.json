The user mentions not being able to access the database, even though they have granted access to certain features. I'm guessing it fits best in the \"Access\" category since it's primarily about access problems. I'll make sure to confirm this understanding and proceed accordingly to classify the ticket correctly.**Categorizing Access Issues**\n\nI need to determine the right category for this IT ticket. The user's message mentions that they can\u2019t search the database, despite having granted access in Oracle, which definitely points to an access issue. Given the listed categories, \u201cAccess\u201d seems the most fitting. I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object that reflects this category. The instruction also suggests including a justification, so maybe I\u2019ll add a brief line explaining the access problem. I'll ensure it's formatted correctly!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
