The categories to choose from are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the context, it sounds like it fits best under \"Internal Project\" since it's about a project setup, though it could also potentially fall under \"Miscellaneous\" due to the code related issues.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the IT ticket and considering the presence of code and issues mentioned. While it seems to relate best to \"Internal Project,\" I\u2019m also contemplating \"Access\" in case it's about Oracle, but that's not clear. Other categories don\u2019t seem suitable either. To align with the instructions, I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object, indicating that the category is \"Internal Project\" since that fits the context best. Here\u2019s the final output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
