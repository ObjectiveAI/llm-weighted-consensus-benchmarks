The ticket text is a bit garbled, repeating \"license\" and mentioning \"software\" and \"consultant,\" which leads me to think it's about a software license. I have several categories like \"Purchase,\" which might fit for a license, or \"Administrative rights\" if it's about installation rights. However, considering the focus on licensing, I'd say \"Purchase\" is the best fit for this ticket.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"license\" multiple times along with \"software\" and \"consultant,\" which is a bit confusing. I believe the best category here is \"Purchase\" since it most closely relates to a software license. I need to format my response as a JSON object, so I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I did consider \"Access\" for software access, but I think \"Purchase\" stands stronger here. Keeping it simple is key!"
