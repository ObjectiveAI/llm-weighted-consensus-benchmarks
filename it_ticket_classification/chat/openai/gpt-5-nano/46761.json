It's referring to a \u201cway match PO not working\u201d and mentions raising a ticket, which suggests it\u2019s about Purchase Orders. Given that there's a category named \"Purchase,\" it fits well. I think it's logical to classify this ticket under that category. Now, I\u2019ll prepare to respond with a JSON object that includes the category as a string.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I have a specific JSON schema to follow. It looks like I need to respond with a JSON object structured to include the category. In this case, I think \u201cPurchase\u201d is the right category based on the repeated mention of \"way match PO.\" I\u2019ll create the JSON object as required, ensuring there's no extra text.
