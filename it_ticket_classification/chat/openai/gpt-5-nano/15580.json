However, it could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" since adding users could involve permissions. I\u2019m weighing the two options: \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" \u2014 it looks like \"Access\" is the most appropriate category here.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI\u2019m deciding not to grant admin rights, as the request is primarily about adding users to a group. This definitely falls under the \"Access\" category. I could consider \"Internal Project\" if there was a specific project mentioned, but that's not the case here. So, \"Access\" it is! Now, I need to respond with a clean JSON-like object as specified: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text. Let's proceed with that!"
