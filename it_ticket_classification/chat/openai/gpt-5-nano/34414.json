Since the issue seems related to software, it might fit under \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Access\" or \"Internal Project.\" It's definitely not about hardware, storage, or HR.**Categorizing IT Issues**\n\nThis ticket could fall under \"Internal Project\" if it's related to a project task, but \"Miscellaneous\" seems more fitting for general IT issues that don\u2019t have another category. It could also be \"Access\" if it involved data access, but it\u2019s primarily about data not loading in Excel tabs. Since the issue doesn't mention permissions, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll suggest some troubleshooting steps, like checking data connections and ensuring all tabs reference the same source.**Outputting IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe instruction clearly states to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" so I need to format my response as a JSON-like object. The required format specifies that the category should be one of the enumerated values, and I\u2019ve decided on \"Miscellaneous.\" Therefore, I will respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. It's important to ensure the capitalization is correct, with a capital \"M.\" I\u2019ll keep it simple and return only that object."
