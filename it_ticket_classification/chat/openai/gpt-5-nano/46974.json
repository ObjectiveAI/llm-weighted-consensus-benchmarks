The text mentions problems like not being able to view costs and totals related to CAD entries. Looking at the provided categories\u2014such as Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights\u2014this ticket seems to fit best under \"Miscellaneous,\" given the nature of the issues described.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nIt looks like this ticket relates to the \"PAS\" and \"CAD\" currency, so I\u2019m considering categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It seems to involve software issues within a project management tool. The \"Access\" category isn\u2019t quite right since it deals with data display rather than login access. The other categories don\u2019t seem relevant either. So, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and respond with a JSON object that includes this category value.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
