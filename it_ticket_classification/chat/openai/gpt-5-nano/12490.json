Timecards are definitely part of HR and payroll, so it seems that \"HR Support\" is the best fit for this ticket. There are also mentions of Oracle, which points toward HR-related software. Seems clear to me!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket regarding automatic approvals after submitting timecards. It mentions \"oracle,\" which hints at the Oracle system. While I considered categories like \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access,\" the focus on timecards suggests that \"HR Support\" is the best fit since it relates directly to the approval process. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too vague. So, I\u2019m settling on categorizing it as \"HR Support\" and will prepare a JSON object to reflect this choice. Sounds good!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
