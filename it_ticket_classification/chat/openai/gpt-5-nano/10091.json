The raw text mentions a \u201cnew starter\u201d form and asks for help with completion, indicating it's related to HR onboarding. Available categories include HR Support, Administrative rights, and Access. Given the context, it seems like \u201cHR Support\u201d would be the most appropriate category since the request is about completing a form for a new starter's induction. I\u2019ll output that in a JSON object.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nIt looks like someone is asking for help with filling out a new starter form. In the context of IT ticket categories, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit for onboarding forms. However, if the form relates to access rights, \"Administrative rights\" could also be considered. Since the text mainly focuses on completing a form, \u201cHR Support\u201d is the most appropriate category to choose. If necessary, I could fallback to \"Miscellaneous\" but that doesn't seem ideal here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis task is more related to administration and HR, so I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" for the category. The request concerns a new starter induction form, and it doesn't seem to involve access or hardware issues. I need to format my response as a JSON object that includes a \"category\" field. Since the user asked to categorize the IT ticket, my final response will be {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That feels like the right choice!**Delivering final response**\n\nI need to craft the final answer as a JSON object, specifically with the category field. It's essential to output exactly: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I've checked the capitalization, and \"HR Support\" matches perfectly with the enum requirement. So, I'll deliver that without adding any extra commentary."
