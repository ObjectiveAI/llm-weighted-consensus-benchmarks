It mentions multiple phrases like \"action required,\" \"approve requisition,\" and \"errors.\" \n\nThe possible categories for this ticket are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I should select a category that fits the content best, which seems like it could fall under \u201cPurchase\u201d given the references to requisitions and courier fees. Let's consider that.**Categorizing Requisition Approvals**\n\nThe text focuses on requisition approvals, actions related to access tasks, and courier fees. Since it's repeating phrases about approving requisitions, it seems to best fit into the \"Purchase\" category, as it's mainly about procurement approvals. There are some references to access management, but with the emphasis on requisitions, \"Administrative rights\" isn\u2019t the right fit. I'll format the response in JSON, providing the category value as requested. So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
