The user mentioned things like \"create job permission required\" and \"wallet setup,\" along with some messy language. It seems like the core issue is about needing permission and access control rights. Given that, I think \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit, as it relates to permissions needed to create a job. Let's make sure to appropriately classify this ticket!**Deciding on category**\n\nI need to choose between the \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" categories for this IT ticket. The ticket is clearly related to needing permissions for creating a job, and it mentions rights, which suggests an elevated privilege request. While \"Access\" generally covers permissions, \"Administrative rights\" seems more specific and accurate for this situation. Given the language like \"create job permission required,\" I think \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit for categorization!**Providing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object for the category format. The user prompt is straightforward: \"Categorize this IT Ticket.\" Since the output should be a category object, it must include \"category\": \"Administrative rights.\" There's no need for extra fluff or explanation since the instructions specify that I only need to provide the category. I\u2019ll make sure to use the correct JSON structure and deliver the response clearly. Here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
