The categories we have include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nThe text refers to a \"new monitor for tower\" and mentions equipment and activities related to it. It looks like a hardware request, so I think it fits best under Hardware or Purchase, depending on how the organization classifies new hardware requests.**Classifying IT ticket request**\n\nThe text from the user indicates a request related to a monitor for a tower PC, despite its chaotic nature. I\u2019m weighing whether to categorize it as either Hardware or Purchase. Since it's clearly a request for a monitor, which is a hardware asset, it could fit under Purchase if the system treats new equipment that way. However, considering the specifics, I think Purchase is the more precise option. \n\nSo I need to respond with the appropriate JSON format.**Deciding the category for the ticket**\n\nI\u2019m parsing the user\u2019s ticket, which is clearly a request for a new monitor for a tower. It mentions \"monitor equipment\" and \"monitor switched working tower.\" Since this doesn\u2019t relate to HR, access, or other categories, I need to decide between Hardware and Purchase. It seems this is a purchase request specifically for procurement. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase\" to accurately reflect that. The response will just be the JSON object: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}.**Finalizing the IT ticket category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, which means I just need to provide the category in a JSON format. The instructions are clear that the output must focus solely on this. \n\nSince \"Purchase\" is a valid category according to the enumerated strings, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I need to ensure there\u2019s proper spacing in the output. Let's finalize this!"
