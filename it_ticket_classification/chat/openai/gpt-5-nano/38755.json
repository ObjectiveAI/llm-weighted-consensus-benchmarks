The ticket describes a video call error during screen sharing with a client. It works fine with colleagues, but not with the client. Since \"Software\" or \"Network\" aren't options, I have to choose the closest category. \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the most fitting choice, although it feels quite generic.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI think \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is the best choice since the issue doesn't really fit any specific categories. \u201cAccess\u201d could work if it's related to permissions for screen sharing with the client, but that feels tentative. The problem seems like a software bug in the video call app. Given that, \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is the safest bet. I'll format the response in the required JSON-like structure to categorize it properly. \n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
