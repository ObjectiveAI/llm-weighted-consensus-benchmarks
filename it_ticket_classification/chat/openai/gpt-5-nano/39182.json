It seems like a reporting issue, possibly involving Snow (like Snowflake or a Microsoft dashboard). They mention multiple aspects like data visibility, search results, and satisfaction scores. The available categories don't specifically include Software or Analytics, so I think \"Miscellaneous\" might fit best, or possibly \"Internal Project\" if the dashboard is project-specific.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nThe issue at hand is about data not loading, so I need to categorize the ticket. It doesn\u2019t fit neatly into any specific category, but \"Miscellaneous\" could work since none of the others apply well. Alternatively, \"Administrative rights\" might be valid if it relates to permission issues. Since the ticket focuses on a dashboard bug, I\u2019ll lean towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the best fit. I'll respond with a JSON object saying:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}**Providing IT ticket response**\n\nI\u2019ll keep it straightforward by categorizing the ticket as \"Miscellaneous.\" Although the user didn't ask for additional details, it might still be helpful to include a brief note about the dashboard display issue. Potential steps to investigate could include checking the data source, ETL, or filters since July's data is missing. However, since the instruction is to respond with category only, I\u2019ll stick to the format required and provide:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
