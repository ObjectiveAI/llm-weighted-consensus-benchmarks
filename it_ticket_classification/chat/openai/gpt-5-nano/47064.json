The phrasing is a bit odd, but it seems clear enough. I have a list of categories to choose from, including \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since this is about an application issue, I\u2019m considering \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Access\" due to potential permission issues. Still, it feels more like a UI issue.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the category for this IT ticket regarding Oracle Applications not showing task details. The available categories include \"Administrative rights,\" but that only applies if it\u2019s permissions-related. \"Storage,\" \"Hardware,\" and \"Purchase\" don\u2019t fit, and \"HR Support\" isn\u2019t relevant either. It seems the best category is either \"Miscellaneous\" due to its generic nature or \"Access\" if we think it pertains to access issues. The user\u2019s sentence is ambiguous, making \"Miscellaneous\" a safe choice. I should prepare to output this as a JSON object with the selected category.**Determining category type**\n\nThe phrase \"does not show tasks details\" might imply an access issue, but it doesn't relate to login\u2014a problem with the details not showing instead. Since access typically refers to permission, I think the best category is \"Miscellaneous,\" as \"Software\" isn't available. I\u2019ll prepare a response with just the JSON object for the category. They're asking to categorize the IT ticket, so I'll format it like this:\n\n{\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}\n\nNo extra text, just the category. This should work!"
