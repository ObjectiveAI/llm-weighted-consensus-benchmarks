The categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Purchase,\" among others. It makes sense to consider \"Purchase\" since it's a request for an item. Although \"Hardware\" could work, I think \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category for this request.**Determining the Appropriate IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a ticket requesting backpacks for interns. While it mentions \"top priority\" and \"building interns,\" the best fit seems to be \"Purchase\" since it's a procurement request for backpacks. It could relate to \"Internal Project\" if it's part of an initiative for interns, but that leans more toward HR. Since the core request is for backpacks, I'll categorize this as \"Purchase\" and prepare to respond with a JSON object detailing the category.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
