The content seems to focus on permissions, admin roles, issue codes, and other technical aspects. Given the focus on permissions and administrative information, it seems to fit best under \"Access.\" So, I\u2019ll format that into a JSON format with the appropriate category. Overall, this ticket appears to center around access permissions and related issues.**Choosing the category**\n\nIt seems the ticket deals with access and permissions related to sending to a distribution list. It brings up terms like \"owner permissions\" and \"administrators generating remote returned resolver,\" which lean towards access control. After considering both \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" it feels that \"Access\" fits best as the primary category. The content strongly suggests access issues, specifically for distributing lists, so I\u2019ll format this into a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
