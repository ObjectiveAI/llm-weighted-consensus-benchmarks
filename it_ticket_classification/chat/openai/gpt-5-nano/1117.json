The user's text talks about the employee leaver process, mentioning access rights, mailbox details, and approvals. It seems to center around deactivating access for a leaver. I'll focus on the most relevant categories: \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or maybe \"HR Support\" since it pertains to user privileges and provisioning. It looks like \"Access\" is the most appropriate, given the context of deprovisioning AD rights and mailboxes.**Finalizing category response**\n\nThe ticket is about user access provisioning and deprovisioning, mentioning terms like \"leaver,\" \"rights,\" and \"permissions.\" It seems clear that the best fit is the \"Access\" category. I need to respond in JSON format, specifically an object with a \"category\" field. The correct response should be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to stick to just this response without any additional information. This aligns perfectly with the expected format from the system."
