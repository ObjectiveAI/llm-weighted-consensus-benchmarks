The categories include Hardware and Purchase. \n\nIf they're asking for an extra cable, it fits both \"Hardware\" since it's a component and could also be \"Purchase\" as they might want to buy it. \n\nI'll lean towards categorizing it as \"Hardware\" since it's primarily about a physical item. So, I think the appropriate JSON object is: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nWhen categorizing IT tickets, \"Purchase\" typically refers to budget requests or procurement, while \"Hardware\" is for hardware issues or requests. Given the phrase \"additional cable please provide,\" it's clear they're requesting an extra cable, which classifies it as a hardware item request, not an issue. I need to decide whether to categorize it as \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" Since it's primarily a hardware item request, I'll go with \"Hardware\" for the category.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
