It seems like it's primarily a hardware request, but it could also fall under the \"Purchase\" category since they are asking for procurement. The line \u201cprovide additional keyboard\u201d implies they\u2019re seeking to procure an extra keyboard. So, I'll lean towards categorizing this ticket under \"Purchase\" as it's specifically about acquiring hardware.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket that contains a request for an \u201cadditional keyboard\u201d for a laptop. It\u2019s a bit poorly worded, but the main idea is clear: they want to make their work easier with an extra keyboard. Considering typical IT ticket categories like Hardware and Purchase, it seems to fit under \"Purchase\" since it implies a request to procure a new keyboard. I\u2019ll provide the category in the specified JSON format.**Returning JSON Category**\n\nThe system defines a category object that requires a specific JSON format. I need to return a JSON object with a \"category\" key set to one of the specified strings. Since the user is requesting an additional keyboard, I initially considered \"Hardware,\" but since this is about procuring a new item, \"Purchase\" is the more accurate choice. I'll provide the JSON response as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} with no extra text. Let's deliver that!"
