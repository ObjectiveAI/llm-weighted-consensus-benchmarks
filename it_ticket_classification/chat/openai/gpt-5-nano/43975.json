The ticket text mentions issues with approving a submitted timesheet and an inconsistency in the approval section. It seems related to accessing or approving a document. I\u2019ve identified that this problem is more about access, possibly falling under \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" due to its connection with timesheets. It looks like \"Access\" is the most fitting category based on the context provided.**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m working on categorizing an IT ticket related to timesheet approval. Since timesheet issues fall under HR processes, I notice that \"HR Support\" is an appropriate category per the provided JSON schema. I need to create a JSON object using one of the enumerated categories. The ticket\u2019s focus on the \u201capproval section\u201d suggests that it ties back to HR processes, making \"HR Support\" the best choice for the category I\u2019ll select.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
