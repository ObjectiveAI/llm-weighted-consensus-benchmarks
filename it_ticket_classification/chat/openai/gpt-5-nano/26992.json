The content suggests it concerns configuration changes related to an app and Git, so it could fall under \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" There are various options to consider, including \"Access\" or \"Purchase,\" but nothing is entirely clear. I need to determine the best fit from the list provided.**Categorizing IT ticket options**\n\nI'm looking at the categories for an IT ticket. This ticket seems to discuss updating a package and configuration, indicating it could be an \"Internal Project.\" It might also be seen as \"Miscellaneous\" due to its ambiguity. While \"Administrative rights\" could be a possibility, it seems more focused on deployment and configuration rather than requesting access. Based on everything mentioned, categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best option. I\u2019ll format my answer in JSON with that category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
