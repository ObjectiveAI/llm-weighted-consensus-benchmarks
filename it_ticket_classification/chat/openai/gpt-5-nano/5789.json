Two possible categories come to mind: \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" Since the user is asking to procure this equipment, it's a bit tricky. Yet, since they mention specific hardware, I think \"Hardware\" feels most appropriate, while \"Purchase\" highlights the procurement aspect.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket that involves requests for hardware like monitors, keyboards, and headsets. While the user mentioned purchasing, it feels more fitting to use \"Hardware\" since the request focuses on hardware items. The ticket text is a bit jumbled, but it's clear they want to categorize their request. Based on the provided information, I\u2019ll respond with the appropriate JSON-like object: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. That should cover it!**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to label this IT ticket as \"Purchase\" because it\u2019s a request for new equipment. However, since the instruction is to simply categorize the ticket, I think \"Hardware\" fits best. The user wants just the plain category without extra information. I\u2019ll go ahead and produce the output as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It looks valid, so I'll deliver that!"
