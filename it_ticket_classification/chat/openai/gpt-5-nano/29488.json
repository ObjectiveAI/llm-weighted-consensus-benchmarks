The instructions indicate that I should produce a JSON-like object with a category field selected from specified enums, such as \"Internal Project.\" The content mentions moving servers and a location, which suggests this fits under \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll create that JSON output with the correct category based on my analysis of the text. I'll ensure it's formatted properly!**Analyzing IT Ticket for Categorization**\n\nThe user\u2019s ticket is about moving servers and mentions future resource needs, which suggests it\u2019s from the Infrastructure team. I'm considering categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Hardware.\" If the focus is on a project to relocate servers, \"Internal Project\" makes sense. However, since it specifically involves servers, \"Hardware\" could fit too. The mention of future resource needs might suggest capacity planning or potential purchases, but the main action is clearly about moving servers. I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\"**Finalizing Category Output**\n\nI believe \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category for this ticket since it pertains to a project involving infrastructure relocation. Categories like \"Storage,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights\" don't apply here. The required format is a JSON object with a \"category\" property, so I\u2019ll produce: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. The user only asked for categorization, so no need for extra notes or questions. I\u2019ll ensure this output matches exactly what\u2019s needed. Let's proceed!"
