The text is a bit garbled, mentioning things like \"new purchase,\" \"apple back cover,\" and \"mobile subscription.\" It seems to focus on requests related to the purchase and installation of a device and possibly receipts. It could fit into categories like Purchase, Hardware, or Administrative rights. Since it involves device installation and a specific item, I think Purchase might be the best fit.**Classifying Ticket Category**\n\nIt looks like the \"Purchase\" category is the best fit for this ticket since it's centered around a new purchase order, receipts, and received items. Terms like \"include device under user name\" and \"installing device\" might indicate installation instructions, but the main focus seems to be on procurement. This leads me to classify it under \"Purchase\" rather than \"Hardware.\" Since I need to create a JSON-like category object, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
