They\u2019re asking for help with a \u201cstarter form,\u201d which seems related to HR onboarding. The available categories are \u201cHR Support,\u201d \u201cInternal Project,\u201d \u201cNew Starter,\u201d and others. Since this ticket specifically asks for help with an onboarding form, the best category to choose is likely \u201cHR Support.\u201d It could also fit under \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d if it involves those forms.**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nIt seems like \"HR Support\" is the best category for this IT ticket, although \"Internal Project\" could also fit if it's an onboarding project. However, to keep it simple, I'm sticking with \"HR Support.\" Now, I need to format the response as a structured JSON object based on the provided schema. The format requires me to just return the object with the chosen category, so my final output will be:  \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}  \n\nI won't include any extra commentary, just the JSON object as instructed."
