It mentions \"not working on computers\" and an issue spreading across more hosts, which hints at a network or hardware problem. The content suggests urgency and a recent configuration\u2014so it might relate to an ongoing issue. I\u2019m debating between \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous\" for the category since it seems to involve IT incidents. Let's focus on resolving this effectively!**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize the IT ticket, but the message is pretty unclear. I\u2019m considering \"Internal Project,\" but that might not fit. \"Hardware\" seems to relate to machine issues, especially with the phrase \"not working on computers,\" which suggests some machines are malfunctioning. The risk of an issue spreading points to network or configuration problems. There's also mention of \"receiving addresses,\" leading me to think it might be spam. Given all the vagueness, I believe \"Miscellaneous\" would be the best fit.**Preparing JSON category**\n\nThe user expects me to provide a JSON-like category format for the IT ticket. The structure should include a \"category\" key with a string value from specified options. Based on the message about computers not working and a recent configuration causing issues, I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous.\" Although \"Hardware\" might fit as well, I think \"Miscellaneous\" captures the ambiguity better. So, my final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} \n\nOkay, I'll respond with just that JSON object, no extra text needed!"
