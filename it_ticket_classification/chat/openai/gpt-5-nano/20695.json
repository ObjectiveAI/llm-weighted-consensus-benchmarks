Given the context and the focus on macros and scripting, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" It appears this issue involves access control and user permissions, which fits this category best!**Finalizing category selection**\n\nIt appears this IT ticket is closely related to \"Administrative rights\" since it involves enabling or disabling script host, restrictions on macros, and program execution. Although it could also be categorized as \"Access\" due to the mention of roaming users, the focus on security policies aligns better with \"Administrative rights.\" I should prepare a JSON object with the appropriate category field reflecting this. It seems clear that this ticket deals with important security configurations!**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to create a JSON object with a category string based on the provided structure, which includes options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. After considering the ticket details, it seems \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit because it involves modifying policies like exception list configuration and disabling script hosts. The JSON object will be straightforward, matching the instructions precisely with no extra commentary. I'll output: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
