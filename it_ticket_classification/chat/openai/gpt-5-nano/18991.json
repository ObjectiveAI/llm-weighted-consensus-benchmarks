It's about issues with exporting details from Excel and Word after an upgrade, which sounds like a software application issue. Since there's no specific \"Software\" category, I'm considering \"Miscellaneous\" as it fits best. \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" don't apply here. I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the most appropriate choice since the issue doesn\u2019t specifically fall under any other option given.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best category for this generic IT ticket, especially since the issue involves exporting details. Some might argue for \"Internal Project,\" but it feels more like an everyday IT task. According to the system instructions, I need to respond with a JSON object for the category. So, I'll output it as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. The instruction is clear, so just the JSON without any additional commentary is perfect!"
