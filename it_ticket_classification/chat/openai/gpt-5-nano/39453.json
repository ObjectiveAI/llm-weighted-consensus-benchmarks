This likely relates to HR (leave management) but could also touch on Access or Administrative rights. Given the context, I'll output a JSON-like object with an appropriate category field from the allowed categories. The choices are somewhat limited, so I'll decide which is the best fit for this ticket.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket describes an Oracle error along with issues related to sick leave and status submission. It seems most related to HR, but the only fitting category in the allowed list is \"HR Support.\" There's also mention of \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" but those don\u2019t directly apply here. Since the focus is on sick leave and submitting the week, \"HR Support\" is the best choice. I'll provide a JSON-like object formatted correctly, including the specified properties for the category.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI see that the valid channels indicate I should return a \"category\" object. The task is to categorize this IT ticket, which means I need to output a JSON formatted properly. The format requires the structure with \"type\" and \"properties,\" especially for the category. The standard response would be simple, like {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}, but I must fulfill the specified schema. So, my final output needs to be plain text. Here we go: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
