The system has specific categories to choose from, including \"Hardware,\" which seems fitting since the user mentioned problems with a mouse. Even though they replaced the battery, the mouse is still skipping, clearly indicating a hardware issue. I'll structure my response as a JSON-like object with \"Hardware\" as the selected category. This should meet the requirements perfectly!**Crafting JSON output**\n\nI need to ensure I'm providing the right format for the JSON output. The instruction specifies using a category object wrapper, which involves using \"type\":\"object\", along with the necessary properties. Previously, I may have only provided the category. Since the issue clearly states it's about a mouse that needs replacing, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Hardware.\u201d However, it could also fit under \"Purchase\" because they\u2019re requesting a new mouse. But given their phrasing, \"Hardware\" feels more accurate! So, the final output should be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Deciding on the category**\n\nThe ticket mentions that a \"new mouse is required,\" but the user is having issues with the current mouse they've been using. In categorizing IT tickets, the request for new hardware could fall under either \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" They mention changing the battery, which suggests a malfunction rather than just a request for purchase. Given that the main issue is with the existing hardware, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Hardware.\" That seems the most appropriate choice!**Finalizing the category**\n\nIf the user is asking for a \"new mouse,\" it sounds like they need a replacement, which is definitely a hardware issue. Given that context, I\u2019m set on categorizing this IT ticket as \"Hardware.\" The intent seems clear, so I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Alright, let\u2019s deliver that response!"
