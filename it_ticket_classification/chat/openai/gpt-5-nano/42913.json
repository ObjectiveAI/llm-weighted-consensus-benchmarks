Now, I\u2019ll make sure to validate the details and confirm the categorization.**Classifying access issues**\n\nThe ticket seems to concern access since it mentions not being able to log in due to credentials, and there's a focus on adding or resizing a picture. The key phrases, like \"can not access\" and \"credentials,\" lead me to believe this should be categorized under \"Access.\" While administrative rights could be relevant, the main issue seems to revolve around access problems. I'll go ahead and classify it as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
