They\u2019re having trouble with accessing a report. Words like \"cannot leave report\" likely mean they can\u2019t exit or close it. The mention of \u201clast month\u201d indicates past access issues. The user could be referring to needing permissions, which suggests the **Access** category fits best. Though **Miscellaneous** or **Administrative rights** could also apply, I think **Access** is the most suitable choice.**Determining Access Issue Category**\n\nThe user's issue clearly indicates an access problem with an Oracle report and it's a high priority case. Since they mention being unable to leave the report and that they previously had access, it definitely fits the **Access** category. I'll format the response as a JSON object, which means I need to present it like this: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. The instructions specify to categorize the ticket, so I think this will satisfy their requirements nicely!"
