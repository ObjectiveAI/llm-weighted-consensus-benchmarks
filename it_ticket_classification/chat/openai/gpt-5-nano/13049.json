Since none of the existing categories fit precisely, it seems I should classify this under \"Miscellaneous\" as there\u2019s no specific software category.**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m scratching my head over the best category for this IT ticket. The options are \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights,\" but the last one doesn\u2019t apply since it\u2019s about scheduling reports, not permissions. I think \"Snow schedule report Friday PM\" likely refers to ServiceNow and involves scheduling recurring reports. If it's a development request, \"Internal Project\" could fit, but since it seems more general, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a better choice. It's a bit tricky!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket. From the available options, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" since it doesn\u2019t fit into hardware, HR, access, storage, purchase, or administrative rights. It seems to involve scheduling recurring reports, possibly related to ServiceNow, and might also skirt close to \"Internal Project.\" Given the general nature of the request, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the safest bet. I'll respond with the JSON format as requested: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} \n\nI think that's what I need to send, based on the user's request. The specifications suggest I only provide the category without any additional notes, just sticking to the JSON format. So, I\u2019ll focus on keeping it simple and clear by responding with just that JSON object. That way, I\u2019m ensuring I follow instructions precisely!"
