It seems it fits best under \"Internal Project\" as it's about creating a mobile app related to Oracle Expenses. \n\nThe user is asking for a categorization, not a solution, so I'll have to format my response as a JSON-like object with the appropriate category field according to the required schema.**Formatting the category response**\n\nI need to output the category as a JSON object. The required format is `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}` based on the schema provided. The schema specifies it should include a \"category\" field with certain constraints, which I\u2019ll follow. It's crucial to keep it strictly as JSON without any extra text or messages.\n\nSo, my final output will simply be: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. I\u2019m double-checking to make sure that\u2019s the right category choice!**Categorizing mobile application content**\n\nI see the content mentions \"oracle mobile expenses\" and \"change control,\" which is administrative. However, it doesn't directly ask for admin rights. Given the unclear grammar, the best fit for categorization seems to be \"Internal Project,\" as it relates to developing a mobile application.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. Now it's time to deliver that!"
