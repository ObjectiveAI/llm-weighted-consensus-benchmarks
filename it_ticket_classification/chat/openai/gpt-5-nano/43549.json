The provided categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since this is a software issue, I can't classify it as \"Software,\" but \"Access\" seems to fit best since the user is unable to utilize the application properly.**Categorizing IT issues**\n\nThe user is asking for help, mentioning \"tester,\" which suggests they might be in QA. The main problem is Chrome crashing, possibly preventing access to certain websites. The category options include various types, and while \"Software issue\" would be ideal, it's not listed. \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the best fit. I'll structure the response as a JSON object with the category set to \"Miscellaneous,\" indicating it's a general issue rather than an access-related one.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
