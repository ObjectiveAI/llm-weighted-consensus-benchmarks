It\u2019s quite a jumble, mentioning things like leaver forms, dates, locations, and mailbox details. It seems to describe a workflow for an employee leaving the company. There are mentions of approvals, rights, and various actions related to their departure. Clearly, it's related to the leaver process within the IT system, so I\u2019ll need to make sure to organize that appropriately!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket based on the provided options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket deals with aspects like leaver processes, mailbox setup, and access rights, making \"Access\" seem like the best fit since it's about removing access for an employee leaving. While \"HR Support\" crossed my mind, this ticket appears more focused on IT tasks for de-provisioning, so I'll go with \"Access\" for the classification.**Outputting the category JSON**\n\nEverything points to categorizing this ticket as \"Access\" since it's focused on access removal. The categorization instruction is clear: I need to respond with a JSON object that includes the category. The format specifies a type of \"object\" with properties. So I\u2019ll ensure to wrap my response correctly. The output will be simply:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThis matches the required format while keeping it straightforward with no additional commentary. Let's finalize this response!"
