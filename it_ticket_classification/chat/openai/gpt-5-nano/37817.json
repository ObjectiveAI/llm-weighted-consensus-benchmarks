It's not hardware-related, nor storage or purchase, so I'd lean towards \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\".**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize the IT ticket, and the best fit might be \"Miscellaneous,\" since it\u2019s not entirely clear. There\u2019s also the \"Internal Project\" category if the referral tool is for internal use, but that usually relates to specific initiatives. Given the mention of \"cannot upload documents,\" it feels like an accessibility issue\u2014so \"Access\" could work, especially if it\u2019s about permissions. I may need to respond with a JSON object for proper formatting.**Formatting response correctly**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object, specifically a category object. The valid categories include options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Access,\" among others. I\u2019ve decided on \"Access\" for this ticket since it relates to permissions. Since the instructions specify no extra text and just the JSON format, I\u2019ll stick to that. The final output should look like: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThat\u2019s clear and straightforward!"
