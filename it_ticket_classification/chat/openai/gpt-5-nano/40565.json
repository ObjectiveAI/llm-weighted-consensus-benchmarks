They're having issues adding documents, possibly related to the Statement of Work (SOW). It may pertain to access or storage, especially if it involves a document library. Without additional details, I\u2019d categorize it as \"Access\" or \"Storage\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" Based on this, I must formulate and provide a category label in a JSON format along with a brief justification for the choice.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI have a category schema that requires me to provide a JSON object with a specified category. The user mentioned issues like \"cannot add documents to sow\" and references an \"error below.\" This makes me think \"Access\" is likely the best category since it suggests a permission issue. \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant too, as it might relate to permission restrictions. There's also a chance it relates to \"Storage\" if it's about document quota problems. Overall, I need to choose the most accurate category based on this context.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nThe ticket is a bit vague but likely falls into the \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" category due to possible SOW access restrictions. Since the user cannot add documents, it sounds like an access issue. It makes sense to categorize it as \"Access\" because it relates to user actions that are restricted. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nAdditionally, I might consider asking follow-up questions to get more details, like the error message or the specific system involved. But for now, I\u2019ll deliver just the JSON."
