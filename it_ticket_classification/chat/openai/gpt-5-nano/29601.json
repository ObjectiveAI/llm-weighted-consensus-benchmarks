I see \"change ownership\" and \"mailing list\" as key phrases. Since it relates directly to ownership permissions, I think the \"Administrative rights\" category is the most precise fit here, though \"Access\" is also a contender.**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m exploring how to categorize an IT ticket since it\u2019s related to mailing list onboarding. I\u2019ve evaluated possible categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and Administrative rights. It looks like \u201cAccess\u201d fits due to changing access to the mailing list, but \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d is more specific regarding rights management. Since the user's request focuses on changing ownership, I\u2019m settling on \"Administrative rights\" as the best choice. So, I\u2019ll output it in the JSON format: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
