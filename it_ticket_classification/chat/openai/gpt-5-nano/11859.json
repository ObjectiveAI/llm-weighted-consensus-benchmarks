It seems like they're discussing business requests, including duplicating items and improving product availability during an event. I need to analyze it further to determine the appropriate category.**Categorizing IT Project Features**\n\nI notice the mention of terms like \"client,\" \"golf championship,\" \"traffic spikes,\" and \"product availability.\" These sound like features relevant to IT project management and system capacity planning. Since this ticket is about updates for handling traffic and improving system functions, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit. Though \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Purchase\" could apply if it's about expanding contracts, I think \"Internal Project\" accurately captures the essence of the request, especially with references to testing and updates."
