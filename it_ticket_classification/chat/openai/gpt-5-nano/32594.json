We have category options from the system, and based on the context, it fits under the \"Purchase\" category. I should format this into a JSON object with the appropriate category field. Let's go with that!**Preparing category response**\n\nThe schema I've got outlines how to respond with a category for an IT ticket. So I need to provide the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I need to make sure the final answer includes just this category in JSON format, without any extra details. The instruction clearly asks to categorize the ticket, so I\u2019ll deliver that straightforwardly. Yes, \"Purchase\" seems like the right choice! Let's go ahead and finalize that."
