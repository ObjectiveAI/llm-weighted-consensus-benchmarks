The ticket mentions modifying the project end date in Oracle, specifying it's urgent and that the option seems disabled because of the current end date. This seems related to permissions, which could fit under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\". I think \u201cAccess\u201d might be the best fit since it\u2019s about permissions needed for changes.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering categorizing this ticket. It mentions modifying a project end date, which could fit under \"Internal Project.\" However, since it also talks about checking permissions, it leans more towards \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" They specifically ask, \"how to change\" and if they have the required permissions, indicating it's Access-related. Given that \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" are both relevant and they clearly ask about permissions, I think I should categorize it as \"Administrative rights.\" But I might also keep \"Internal Project\" in mind.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
