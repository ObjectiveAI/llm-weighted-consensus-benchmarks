The closest fit seems to be \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Administrative rights\" popped into my mind briefly due to possible permissions. However, that's not really relevant here.

Since it relates to a display issue, I'll stick with \"Miscellaneous.\" Now, I need to make sure to format my response correctly as a JSON object.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
