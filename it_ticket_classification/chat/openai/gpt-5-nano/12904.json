The options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. \n\nThe user's text suggests it's about an \"Internal Project,\" especially since they mention a \"senior tester\" and testing plans. Although it could also fall under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative Rights,\" I think \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category based on the context.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI see that another possibility for categorizing this ticket could be \"Administrative Rights\" if the user needs permission to modify the image, but it\u2019s not entirely clear. The ticket involves changing lock screen images, and it seems more fitting for an \"Internal Project\" since it\u2019s likely about updating internal assets.\n\nI think I should respond with just the necessary JSON format for the categorization: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, as that captures the essence of the request without any extra text.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
