They mention that the recruiting area turns blank, which suggests it could relate to \"Access\" since it seems to involve a system page. Although \"HR Support\" is also a contender, the specific mention of the recruiting area makes me lean towards \"Access.\" I should be careful to classify it properly to help the user effectively!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nSo, I\u2019m looking at an IT ticket concerning an issue where the \"Recruiting area\" screen turns blank. This seems to indicate an access issue, possibly related to permissions or software. The user specifically asked to categorize the ticket rather than resolve it, so I need to pick the best fit. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" since it seems related to permissions. I should reply with a JSON-like response that clearly specifies the category, as instructed!**Formatting the response**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the schema provided, which tells me that I need to output a JSON object for the ticket category. The category can be one of several options listed. Since this concerns access issues, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The instructions don't require any additional explanation, so it\u2019s best to keep it simple and follow the specified format \u2014 no extra content! I\u2019ll make sure my response is a plain JSON string as instructed."
