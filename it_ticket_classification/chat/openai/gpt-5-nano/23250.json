The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket mentions a submission issue with a form that doesn't display correctly. This doesn't fit neatly into any category since there's no option for \"Software\" or \"Application Issue.\" It seems like a software-related problem, but I'll have to pick the closest match. This is a bit tricky!**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket, which could fall under \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d \u201cInternal Project,\u201d or \u201cAccess.\u201d Given it\u2019s about a PM submission issue, \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems appropriate as it relates to project management requests. There\u2019s also some mention of submitting a form, which might hint at an \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d issue, but that's not quite right. None of the categories specifically mention software issues, so if I have to choose, I'd lean towards \"Internal Project.\"**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe phrase \"assign to project PM submission issue\" suggests this ticket is best categorized as an \"Internal Project.\" There\u2019s also a mention of \"assign vacation,\" hinting at HR aspects, but that\u2019s less relevant here. I need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category. I'll go with `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}` since it seems like the best fit. \n\nIt's important to deliver it in the proper format, so I will respond solely with the JSON object as required."
