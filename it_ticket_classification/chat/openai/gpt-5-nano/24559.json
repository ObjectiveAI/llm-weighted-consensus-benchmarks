It mentions a \u201cnew purchase po\u201d and includes terms like \u201cinstallation\u201d and \u201cbackpack,\u201d which makes me think it\u2019s about hardware. \n\nI realize that I need to choose the best fitting category from the given options. The \"Purchase\" category seems most appropriate since it's about a new purchase order, but \"Hardware\" could also apply because it involves a physical item. I need to decide soon!**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket details. It seems to revolve around a new purchase order and mentions installation, which signals that it belongs in the \"Purchase\" category. While \"Hardware\" could fit given the mention of a backpack, \u201cnew purchase\u201d and \u201cpurchase order\u201d make \"Purchase\" the safest choice. \n\nI\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the category field. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll deliver: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It should be straightforward without extra commentary."
