I should follow the schema and create a JSON object in the required format, so I\u2019ll structure it correctly. For this ticket, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\"  \n{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Analyzing the request**\n\nI'm looking at the text: \"add people to com thursday pm add hello please add thank senior software developer.\" It seems to be a request to add individuals to a group or contact list, possibly a company or communications (maybe \"com\" refers to \"comm\"). The mention of \"thursday pm\" indicates a deadline and \"senior software developer\" probably suggests the role of someone to be added. Overall, it sounds like they're asking for assistance in adding people to a specific group by that deadline.**Determining the category for the request**\n\nIt looks like this is an access request to add people to a project or group by Thursday PM, which fits best under the category \"Access.\" There\u2019s also a possibility for the \"Internal Project\" category, but it seems like adding someone, specifically a \"senior software developer,\" points towards granting access rights. Therefore, I'll choose \"Access\" and respond with a valid JSON object, ensuring it adheres to the schema. \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
