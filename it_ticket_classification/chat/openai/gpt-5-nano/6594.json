It seems clear that it's related to the \"Hardware\" category since monitors are hardware. The term \"recent pm code\" is a bit unclear, but I think it doesn't affect the categorization. The user wants a JSON object format, so I should respond with something like: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That should align with the required format!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's message about the monitor suggests they're asking for an improvement to their setup for productivity and mentions a location. Since it's mostly about the monitor, I think categorizing it as \"Hardware\" is accurate since monitors fall under that category. I need to output this in a JSON format that matches the required schema. So, ultimately, I should respond with something like: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I just need to ensure it's precise!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
