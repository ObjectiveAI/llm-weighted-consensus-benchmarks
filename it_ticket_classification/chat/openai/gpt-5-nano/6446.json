The mention of \"tower outages\" suggests infrastructure concerns but could refer to either power or data center towers. I need to output the category in the right JSON format according to the instructions.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nThe user needs me to categorize, so I should generate a JSON object with a \"category\" field. I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the safest default since the content isn't clearly defined, but \"Internal Project\" could fit if it relates to outage notifications. However, I'll stick with \"Miscellaneous\" to keep it simple. The user only wants the JSON output, not an explanation. So, I\u2019ll format it correctly as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} and deliver that!"
