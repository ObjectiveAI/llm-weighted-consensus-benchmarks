The issue involves not being able to submit for a past period, suggesting an application service outage. The best fit seems to be \"Access,\" since it relates to service availability and permissions, but \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" might also work. It\u2019s definitely not related to hardware. I'll make sure to choose a fitting category!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think the closest category for this ticket is \"Access\" since it involves an inability to submit due to Oracle services being unavailable. However, it's not directly about user access rights but more about a service outage. I could consider \"Miscellaneous\" if it doesn\u2019t fit, but \"Internal Project\" could also apply since it might be related to internal tasks. Given the instructions, the response should probably be formatted as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. But I need to double-check if \"Access\" is the right choice here.**Selecting the appropriate category**\n\nThe issue is that \"Oracle services are unavailable,\" which indicates a service outage. While \"Access\" usually refers to access rights, here it seems to be about system availability affecting the user's ability to submit a task. If it doesn\u2019t fit, \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option. Considering the user's requirement, I think \"Access\" is the best category since it relates directly to service unavailability impacting their submission. I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text!"
