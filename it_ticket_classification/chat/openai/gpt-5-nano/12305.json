It's important to ensure we classify it accurately so the right team can address it efficiently. I should consider factors like the issue type, urgency, and its impact on operations. By organizing the tickets correctly, it streamlines our workflow and ensures that nothing gets overlooked. Let's make sure we have clear categories established to help with this process!**Cleaning up ticket text**\n\nI'm noticing this ticket text is quite messy, with lots of phrases jumbled together. It looks like the user is asking about a laptop request and there are mentions of performance issues regarding CPU and memory while running virtual machines. My goal is to sort through all these details to better understand the problem. I'll need to extract the key points and organize them so the support team can address the concerns effectively and clearly!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on its content, which mentions laptop issues, performance, upgrades, and hardware assessments. The most fitting category is \"Hardware,\" as it focuses on hardware-related problems and upgrades. While \"Internal Project\" seems like a possibility, this ticket primarily addresses a hardware concern. Following the provided schema, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the category correctly specified. So, the output will look like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
