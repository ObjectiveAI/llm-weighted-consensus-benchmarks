I\u2019m considering several categories: it could be related to Administrative rights due to the mention of access issues, or it might fall under Internal Project if it discusses project tracking. Alternatively, it may just be Miscellaneous if it doesn't fit neatly.**Evaluating IT ticket category**\n\nThe text mentions \"greyed out,\" which hints at a UI or access issue, and repeats terms like \"level\" and \"review level.\" It seems to discuss access restrictions, possibly requesting to \"grant\" certain rights. The mention of closing a ticket relates to an impact on schedule, suggesting it could be about an Internal Project. However, since the key terms point toward a request for Administrative rights, I have to choose between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" as the most fitting categories.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
