It seems to fit under Miscellaneous or Internal Project. If it's about removing someone from notifications, \"Administrative rights\" could work, but it may involve modifying distribution lists. The phrase \"please advise\" and the context suggest it's more of a feedback ticket, possibly related to issues from customer service calls that trouble the phone job.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI need to pick a category for this ticket. \"Administrative rights\" makes sense because it involves removing someone from a notification list, which relates to permissions. However, \"Access\" fits better since they specifically want to change their inclusion in notifications. While \"Notifications\" isn't exactly \"Access,\" it deals with permissions about who is on the distribution list. If nothing fits, I could also consider \"Miscellaneous.\" In response, I\u2019ll format it as a JSON object specifying the \"Access\" category.**Finalizing the category choice**\n\nI\u2019ll go with \"Access\" for this ticket because it directly relates to removing someone from notifications, which is a permissions matter. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit, it's more about broader admin capabilities rather than just notifications. Since I need to return a JSON object reflecting the chosen category, I'll format it like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019ll be concise, without any extra explanation, sticking to the request to categorize the IT ticket."
