I think \"Miscellaneous\" fits best since it's about a reporting issue in the financial module. However, if it pertains to an ongoing IT project, \"Internal Project\" could also apply. I'll output a JSON with the selected category!**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI have another option: \"Internal Project\" if it relates to the aging report. The ticket mentions \"fusion,\" probably a user, and requests to raise a ticket about issues with unapplied receipts and custom aging reports. This is a software bug and doesn't fall under hardware, access, storage, purchase, or HR. So, \"Miscellaneous\" fits best. I\u2019ll keep it simple: the user asked to categorize the IT ticket, so I\u2019ll provide just the category in the JSON format. Here we go: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
