Given the context, \u201cAccess\u201d seems like the best fit since it directly relates to accessing the license server. Then again, if it refers to permissions specifically, \"Administrative rights\" could apply too. However, I'll go with \"Access\" and respond with a JSON object reflecting that.**Formatting IT Ticket Response**\n\nThe task is to categorize an IT ticket based on provided text, following specific output requirements. The format for the response is a JSON object that includes the category. I need to ensure it's valid JSON without any additional text. Since \"Access\" is an included category, that seems like the right choice based on the context. I\u2019ll respond simply and correctly with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI'll double-check for any trailing spaces and finalize my answer."
