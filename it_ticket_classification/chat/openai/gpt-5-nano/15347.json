The snippet mentions a \"new starter\" in Bogota, which suggests it relates to HR or Access for onboarding. It talks about a completed form and an engineer joining, indicating it likely falls under HR Support or Access. Let's focus on those categories for this ticket.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nThe ticket's primary category seems to be \"HR Support,\" as it pertains to a new starter joining the company. I\u2019m considering the difference between \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Although there\u2019s mention of completing a form and a compliance officer in Colombia, the focus on onboarding makes \"HR Support\" the best fit. I\u2019ll prepare a JSON-like response to categorize the ticket, highlighting its importance and time-sensitive nature for onboarding the new hire.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe system requires a category in a specific format, so I need to create a JSON-like object with a \"category\" string. Based on the context, \"HR Support\" seems to be the right choice. I will return the precise JSON format: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`. I want to make sure I follow the instructions closely, so I won\u2019t add any extra commentary\u2014just the JSON object itself. It's important to deliver that correctly!"
