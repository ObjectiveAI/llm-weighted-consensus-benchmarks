The user's message is pretty garbled and seems to be asking for help with submissions or completing something. Phrases like \u201ccomplete cards\u201d and \u201csubmit regards platform\u201d suggest they might be seeking assistance with a platform, but it\u2019s unclear. I\u2019ll have to choose the best category despite the confusion.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering categorizing this ticket as \"Miscellaneous\" since it's a general request that doesn\u2019t clearly fit into hardware, access, or other specific categories. It might be \"Access\" if they\u2019re having issues filling out forms on the platform, but it doesn\u2019t seem about login or permissions. Since the ticket feels like a general help request, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the best fallback. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object that matches the required structure for the category.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
