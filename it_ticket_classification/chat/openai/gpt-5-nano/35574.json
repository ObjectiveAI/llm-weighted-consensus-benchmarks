They mention connection issues involving something called Nexus, and their request implies there's a blocking problem. The categories to choose from include \"Hardware\", \"Access\", and \"Internal Project\", but the user's message isn't very clear. It might relate to software rather than hardware. I'll analyze the language used to decide the best fit to assist the user effectively!**Determining the Ticket Category**\n\nI notice this ticket focuses on \"dependencies,\" \"blocking issue,\" and needs attention on Nexus. While \"Access\" might be a consideration, it doesn't clearly indicate access problems. \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit since it pertains to a Nexus repository connectivity issue. I\u2019m convinced that \"Internal Project\" captures the essence of the user's concerns more accurately than the other categories. So, I\u2019ll output the category in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let\u2019s deliver that succinctly!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
