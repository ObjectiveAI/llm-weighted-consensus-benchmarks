Since the problem relates mainly to document storage and upload permissions, I\u2019m leaning towards classifying this under \"Storage,\" but \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could also fit. It's worth considering permissions related to this \"without creating folder\" aspect too.**Analyzing ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering the IT ticket about users unable to upload documents and the potential issues with permissions. The mention of \"Administrative rights\" is relevant since it might involve folder creation permissions. However, the user is specifically having trouble adding documents to an \"opportunity,\" possibly linked to a CRM. \n\nThe error messages suggest they might need to create a folder to upload files, indicating the category that fits best is likely \"Storage\" as it pertains to file saving and uploading rather than access issues.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
