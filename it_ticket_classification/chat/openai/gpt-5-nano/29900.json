There\u2019s a possibility that it falls under \"Access\" since \"din exterior\" and \"exterior\" imply some sort of external access. The mention of \"Spartans\" might refer to a system the company uses. Since the user is asking for a category, I could suggest \"Access\" while also noting it\u2019s unclear and that clarification might be needed. Let's explain my reasoning based on the context!**Structuring Access Category Response**\n\nI think I should categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" The term \"spartan\" could refer to an application, and it likely involves an access issue that might be external or remote. Though the category set doesn\u2019t include \"Remote Access,\" I can suggest a couple of subcategories like VPN or firewall rule. \n\nI\u2019ll provide a structured response with a justification and output it in a JSON format like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That should do the trick!**Creating JSON Object for Category**\n\nI'm focused on crafting the final response as a JSON object with the category property. The instructions indicate that it\u2019s best to provide just the JSON to meet the formatting requirements. Even though adding an explanation can be helpful, the system suggests a straightforward output. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll go with just this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s essential to ensure the enum value is exactly \"Access\" with a capital A. Let\u2019s stick to that!"
