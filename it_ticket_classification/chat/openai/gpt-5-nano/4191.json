The ticket addresses the cleanup of duplicated job records in Oracle, which hints at data management. It doesn't fit into Hardware, Access, or HR Support, even though \"jobs\" might refer to positions. I think \"Internal Project\" works best if it\u2019s part of a data cleanup initiative, while \"Miscellaneous\" is more general.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nThe content definitely points to a task focusing on cleaning up duplicate jobs and exporting data, indicating an internal project in Oracle. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ve verified other categories and found them irrelevant; Administrative Rights, Access, Storage, Purchase, and Hardware don\u2019t apply here. I need to prepare a JSON object with just the category specified. The final output will be:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}  \n\nThis keeps it clean and direct!"
