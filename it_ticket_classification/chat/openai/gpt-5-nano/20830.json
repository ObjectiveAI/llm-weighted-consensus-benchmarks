The ticket is somewhat garbled but seems to request adding rights, possibly related to access permissions. I\u2019m leaning towards \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d since it directly pertains to privileges. However, the mention of \u201cset new lists\u201d complicates things since it's not specific. I think \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d is the best fit here.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe core of the request involves \"add rights\" to \"two lists\" and \"set new lists.\" This seems like it\u2019s asking to set up lists and grant permissions, potentially fitting into \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the categories available, the best match is likely \"Administrative rights\" since it specifically addresses permission changes. I need to respond in JSON format, choosing either {\"category\":\"Access\"} or {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}, but \"Administrative rights\" seems more precise based on the context.**Determining the IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user didn\u2019t specifically request \"grant admin rights\" but the phrase \"add rights\" could imply access rights, which typically falls under the \"Access\" category. However, since \"Administrative rights\" is also available and more specific to granting permissions, it seems appropriate. Given the request to \"please give add rights,\" it indicates a desire for admin privileges, so I'll categorize it as \"Administrative rights.\" The final output will be the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
