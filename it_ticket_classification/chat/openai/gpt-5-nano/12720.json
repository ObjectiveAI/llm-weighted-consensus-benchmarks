The allowed categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The text mentions codes, PM codes, and cost tracking, but it\u2019s not clear which category fits best. It might relate to \"Administrative rights\" if it's asking for approvals, or perhaps \"Internal Project\" due to the mention of project codes. I'll consider these options carefully.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the content of the IT ticket, which includes phrases like \u201cplease assign\u201d and \u201cexport codes allocated.\u201d It seems like a request related to assigning codes, possibly for \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d but that\u2019s not entirely clear. \"Access\" could also work for rights to code systems, though it's more about project codes. \"Internal Project\" seems fitting since it focuses on project management. I need to choose the best category and prepare it in JSON format.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
