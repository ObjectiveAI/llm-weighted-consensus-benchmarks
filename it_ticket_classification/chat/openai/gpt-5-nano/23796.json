However, \"Administrative rights\" isn't quite a fit. The phrase \"assist completion attached return form thanks officer\" is a bit unclear, but \"starter form induction\" suggests it\u2019s about onboarding, which aligns with HR or Administrative categories. Given that this is an IT ticket, it could suit \"HR Support\" or \"Access,\" especially since it involves onboarding forms and processes.**Choosing ticket categories**\n\nI see that \"Access\" seems like the safest category, especially since \"new starter\" indicates someone needs access to systems, and \"induction\" might refer to training. The exact text mentions a new starter form being completed along with a request to assist in returning it. While it could relate to \"Administrative rights,\" I think it would be more fitting to classify this as \"HR Support\" since it primarily concerns onboarding forms. So, I'll choose \"HR Support\" and prepare a JSON object with that category."
