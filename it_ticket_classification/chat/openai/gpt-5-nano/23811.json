It could fit into \"Storage,\" due to potential size limits on OneDrive, or \"Access,\" if they\u2019re requesting permissions. It's a bit poorly structured, so I\u2019ll focus on the key parts mentioned.**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt seems like this could be a request to either enable sharing or to actually share larger files with teammates. When categorizing an IT ticket, typical categories include Access, Storage, Administrative rights, and a few others. Given the mention of \"OneDrive account,\" it leans towards \"Storage,\" but it could also fit \"Access\" if they need specific permissions. However, since they want to share larger files, \"Storage\" feels like the right choice. I'll format my response as a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}."
