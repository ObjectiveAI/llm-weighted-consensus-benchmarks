The categories I have are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Since \"extension cord\" implies hardware, I think \"Hardware\" would be the best fit. However, it could also be about purchasing one, making \"Purchase\" another possibility. But typically, I\u2019d go with \"Hardware\" for an IT helpdesk ticket about extension cords.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket asking about an \"extension cord.\" The user seems to be requesting it, but there's also mention of colleagues helping out. I interpret this as them needing one, which leans toward \"Hardware,\" as it's a physical item. However, if they\u2019re asking for a purchase, that could justify \"Purchase.\" Given the context, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" Now, I need to format my response as a JSON object with that category.**Responding with JSON Category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, and I'll provide it as a JSON object. The category is \"Hardware,\" which seems fitting given the context. I want to make sure to respond clearly without any extra text, just the necessary JSON format. The instruction specifies that I should avoid heavy formatting, and since the schema expects a straightforward object, I'll deliver it as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That should keep it clean and accurate!"
