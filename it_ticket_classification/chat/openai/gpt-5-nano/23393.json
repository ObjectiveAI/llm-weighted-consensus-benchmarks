I think about categories like \"Storage\" for documents and \"Access\" for permissions. The ticket seems to be requesting help to locate a personally uploaded version from December. This definitely falls under \"document management,\" as they want to view version history. I wonder if it also relates to \"Administrative rights\" for proper access to those documents.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe categories provided are somewhat limited, but \"Storage\" seems to fit well for document storage and versioning. The ticket title suggests it's about \"finding a document\" and \"viewing history versions.\" Since the user asked me to categorize this IT ticket, it makes sense to output a JSON structure. I believe \"Storage\" is the most appropriate category. I'll follow the specified format and ensure the category object is correctly structured with \"category\" set to \"Storage.\"{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
