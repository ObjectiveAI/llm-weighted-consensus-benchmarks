It seems they may not be able to delete recurring meetings and want help managing their calendar. The category \"Miscellaneous\" feels appropriate since it's not distinctly fitting any standard category. However, I wonder if \"Access\" is a better choice since it involves deleting invites, or possibly \"Administrative rights\" if they're trying to manage invites on someone else's calendar. It's a bit tricky!**Deciding category for IT ticket**\n\nI think the user wants help because their calendar keeps automatically recreating a meeting invite. This sounds like an issue with calendar management, which isn\u2019t a direct category. Since it's related to the permissions for deleting these invites, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" \n\nThe prompt asks for a JSON-like object in a specific format, so I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. \n\nI\u2019ll keep the note brief as the instructions focus on categorizing, so I'll just provide the category itself!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
