The categories available are things like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and Miscellaneous, but \"Application\" isn't listed, which is puzzling. Given the context, I\u2019m inclined to choose the closest category, though it may not perfectly match.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI see that the available categories are limited to Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The user mentioned \"category application,\" but that option is missing from the list. They also referenced a monthly broken links report, which might imply it relates to an Internal Project. I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit here, but \"Miscellaneous\" could also work if there\u2019s no clear connection. It\u2019s a bit tricky!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIn ticketing systems, a \"broken links report\" often relates to an application. The user mentioned \"category application,\" but that isn't in the allowed categories. I'm left with Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since it seems to involve automation, \"Internal Project\" feels like the right choice for this monthly report. I\u2019ll represent the response in a JSON-like format, outputting: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll also note that \"Miscellaneous\" is another option, but might be less specific.**Finalizing category response**\n\nI believe \"Internal Project\" is the best choice for this IT ticket. Following the instructions, I need to provide just the category in a JSON format without extra text. So, I\u2019ll output it as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It's important to ensure that the JSON is correct, matching the schema without any additional commentary. I\u2019ll keep it in the exact format because sometimes the system expects more specific structures. Alright, I\u2019m ready to deliver!"
