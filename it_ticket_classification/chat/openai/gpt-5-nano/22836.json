The text mentions backup jobs, transaction log backups, database failures, and manual backups, all related to IT. \n\nGiven the categories available, this seems to fit best under either \"Storage\" or \"Miscellaneous\" since it's focused on backups and databases. I'll lean towards \"Storage\" for its relevance.**Finalizing category response**\n\nIt seems clear that the ticket is about backups, so categorizing it as \"Storage\" makes sense. I need to remember to format my response as a JSON object since that's what's required. The schema specifies the structure I need, and it looks like I should return a clean JSON like this: {\"category\": \"Storage\"}. I won't include any extra text\u2014just that single line! Though I wondered if \"Administrative rights\" might also fit, the core focus is backups, so I'll stick with Storage."
