The categories I have are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The text includes phrases like \"provide keyboard\" and \"engineer,\" pointing toward a hardware issue. However, it could also fit under \"Purchase\" since it might be about buying a new keyboard. I'll lean towards categorizing it as \"Hardware\" since it\u2019s most relevant.  \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}**Categorizing IT ticket requests**\n\nI need to decide on the right category for a ticket that's about a keyboard request. If it\u2019s just about a hardware issue, it falls under \"Hardware.\" However, if it involves asking someone to order a keyboard, then it fits the \"Purchase\" category. The phrases \"order\" and \"provide keyboard\" suggest it's more about procurement. As it\u2019s focused on ordering, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase.\"  \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
