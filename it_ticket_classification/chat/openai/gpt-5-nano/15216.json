Since it's focused on site work involving fiber cables and related tasks, I think it\u2019s best to assign it to the \u201cHardware\u201d category. This choice matches the content well!**Deciding Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket. It\u2019s related to a construction or infrastructure project, which makes me think \"Internal Project\" could fit. But it also involves fiber cables, so \"Hardware\" is another option. \n\nHowever, the ticket includes scheduling, engineers, parking, and site visits, which points to project management. \"Internal Project\" seems the most appropriate. \"Access\" doesn\u2019t quite match since it's more about informing regarding testing works. So, I\u2019ll settle on \"Internal Project\" as the category!**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to create a JSON object for the category \"Internal Project,\" which is required for the response. I\u2019ll format it as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. The guidelines specify it should be a JSON object with the category key properly formatted.\n\nI want to ensure the capitalization is accurate since that's essential. I\u2019ll stick to the required structure and respond only with the JSON object. So, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
