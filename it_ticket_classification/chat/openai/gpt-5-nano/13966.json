It seems to involve changing something in Oracle, requesting approvals for absences due to public holidays. This definitely feels like an HR-related ticket since it mentions absence approvals. Even though it refers to software, the main focus is clearly on HR Support. So, I think I'll categorize this ticket as HR Support.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThis ticket likely relates to approvals for leave or absence replacement due to public holidays. It seems like they might be requesting changes in Oracle regarding these approvals. It definitely falls under HR management. I\u2019ve decided to categorize it as HR Support since that covers the request about HR processes, leaves, and time off. \n\nI'll produce a JSON object to reflect this category as specified. Here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
