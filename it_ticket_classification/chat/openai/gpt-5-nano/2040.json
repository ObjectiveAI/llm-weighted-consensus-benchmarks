They've mentioned \"OS wireless ad,\" which could refer to Active Directory, and \"automatic authenticated wireless,\" possibly indicating 802.1X wireless authentication. The user appears to want a setup where users are automatically authenticated via AD. I\u2019ll look at the provided categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights to find the best fit for this ticket.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think the best category for this IT ticket is \"Access,\" since it involves configuring wireless authentication using Active Directory for automatic user access control. The user is likely looking for a way to streamline network authentication. The instruction indicates I should output a JSON object with the category. The structure specifies that I need to follow the schema, ensuring \"Access\" is the right choice. So, I\u2019ll prepare to output the appropriate JSON object with the category \"Access.\"**Outputting JSON category**\n\nThe text indicates a need for Active Directory integration focused on wireless authentication, which relates to access control. So, \"Access\" is the right category. I need to format my response as a JSON object to capture this properly. The schema requires the object to include a \"category\" field. Therefore, I'll ensure my output is strictly: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I have to be precise and avoid any extra text or characters, just the JSON as instructed. So, here we go!"
