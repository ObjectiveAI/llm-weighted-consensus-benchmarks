The user shared a long text that feels quite spammy and discusses maintenance work and software changes with phrases like \"peer review task\" and \"wireless upgrade.\" It seems it could fit under \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or even \"Miscellaneous.\" It's not entirely clear, so I may need to evaluate further before deciding.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI have categories to work with: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. This ticket seems to request a software upgrade change with references to a peer review task and notifying relevant heads. It includes terms about change management but doesn't fit into hardware, HR, access, storage, or purchase. It could align with \"Internal Project\" since it's related to an internal IT change task, or maybe \"Administrative rights\" given the context of access.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket is more about an internal process led by a senior engineer regarding a wireless upgrade and software changes. However, the actual content revolves around tasks and change management rather than direct hardware/software actions. Therefore, I think the most fitting category would be \"Internal Project\" since it involves change tasks and peer reviews. I'll respond with a JSON object reflecting that category: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It's essential to keep it concise and stick to the required format.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
