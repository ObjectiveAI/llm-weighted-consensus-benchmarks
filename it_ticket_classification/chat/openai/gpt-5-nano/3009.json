Their wording suggests it relates to software installation, but my options are limited. Since \"Software installation\" isn\u2019t listed, the closest category might be \"Administrative rights\" if they need admin privileges for the install. If that doesn\u2019t fit perfectly, I could consider \"Miscellaneous\" as a fallback, but I'm leaning towards \"Administrative rights\" since a clean install likely requires those.**Categorizing a clean install request**\n\nThe user's phrase is clearly a request for a clean Windows installation. I think I can categorize this ticket as either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since installing Windows generally requires admin privileges, \"Administrative rights\" seems like the best fit. Although I could consider \"Miscellaneous\" since it's not explicitly stated, it doesn't seem as precise. In the absence of a \"Software installation\" category, I\u2019m confident that \"Administrative rights\" is the most suitable choice for routing this ticket.**Outputting the category in JSON**\n\nI need to make sure I respond with a JSON object that matches the required schema. The user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I'll output just the category. The instructions specify that the final answer should only show the category field. I\u2019ll confirm it\u2019s set to \"Administrative rights,\" ensuring it matches exactly with the schema. I\u2019ll provide the response without any extra commentary, so here it goes:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
