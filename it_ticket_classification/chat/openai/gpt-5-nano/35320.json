It seems like a hardware issue given the nature of the problem. While \u201cPeripheral devices\u201d isn\u2019t a category option, \u201cHardware\u201d definitely fits. Even though there\u2019s mention of performance issues, the main focus is on the mouse. So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object specifying that the category is \u201cHardware,\u201d formatted as the instructions require. I'll make sure the output matches their defined schema.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe system instructed me to categorize the IT ticket, and the appropriate category is \"Hardware.\" I need to respond with a JSON object that fits the required schema, which specifies that the property of the object is \"category.\" \n\nSo, I should provide the response as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It\u2019s clear that just the category is needed; there\u2019s no need for extra commentary in my answer. I\u2019ll stick with that format and deliver it."
