The categories I can choose from include Hardware, HR Support, and more. My best move might be to propose multiple possibilities based on my interpretation and then ask the user for clarification while still providing a category label.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket. If the request is unclear, I can choose \"Miscellaneous,\" but it might also relate to \"Access\" if \"shall install senior\" refers to an installation by a senior admin. There's a chance it's about \"Administrative rights,\" too. Given the ambiguity, I think the safest option is \"Miscellaneous,\" but I should also suggest follow-up questions. This way, if they need specific access or hardware installation, I can guide them properly.**Crafting IT ticket response**\n\nI think the best category for this ticket is \"Miscellaneous.\" The user's message isn't clear and lacks detail about hardware, software, access, or projects. It makes sense to use \"Miscellaneous\" until I can clarify further. I should ask some quick clarifying questions, like what exactly they are trying to install and if they need admin rights. Then, I need to format my response in a JSON-like structure, so I'll present it as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
