The categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since there\u2019s no specific \"HR\" category, \"HR Support\" seems to fit due to the onboarding form and leave request considerations. I'll proceed with \"HR Support\" as the best choice.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think the best category for this ticket is \"HR Support\" because it involves HR-related forms, onboarding, and leave requests. It doesn't really fit into \"Administrative rights\" since that focuses on permissions. \"Access\" seems to be more about accounts, which isn't mentioned here. Even though \"Miscellaneous\" could work for anything, \"HR Support\" is the most relevant. I need to provide a JSON object with the category key as well. So, I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support.\"{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
