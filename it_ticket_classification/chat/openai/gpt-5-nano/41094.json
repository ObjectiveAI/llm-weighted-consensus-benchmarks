They provided some options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and so on. The ticket text indicates it's about annual leave requests and notifying managers, which points to it likely falling under \"HR Support\" since it's an HR process issue. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support\" since that fits best. I'll output it as a JSON-like object with the appropriate category.**Formatting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to create a JSON object to categorize the IT ticket based on the user's provided categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. Given the details of the ticket, it makes sense to categorize it as \"HR Support.\" The output must be in the correct JSON format. I\u2019ll respond succinctly without revealing the analysis steps. So, the final output will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That should wrap things up perfectly!"
