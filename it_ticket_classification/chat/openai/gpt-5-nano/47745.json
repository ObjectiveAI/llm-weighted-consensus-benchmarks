The user mentions trouble accessing ServiceNow, trying different browsers, and clearing cache, which clearly indicates it's an access issue. The relevant category from the options is \"Access\". Now, I'll format my response in JSON to match the required format, specifying the category as { \"category\": \"Access\" }. It's straightforward, but I want to be sure I get it right!**Delivering IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user has a message about not being able to access ServiceNow, which is a high-importance issue, so it clearly fits under the \"Access\" category. I need to stick to the instructions and avoid adding extra commentary. My response must be formatted as a JSON object, maintaining the exact schema required. Therefore, I\u2019ll provide the output as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let\u2019s make sure that's clear and straightforward!"
