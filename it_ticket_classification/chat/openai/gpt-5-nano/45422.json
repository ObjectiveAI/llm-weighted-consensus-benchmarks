I notice an error with a monthly report timing out, but there\u2019s no \"Software\" category. \"Access\" seems relevant for login issues, and the user mentions something about a new password and filling out a survey, which might not be necessary. The ticket focuses on the error with the report, likely related to \"Miscellaneous\" since there\u2019s no direct software category. It might also relate to \"Administrative rights\" if permissions need fixing.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering the right category for a ticket about a timeout error in a monthly report. While \"Access\" could relate to credentials, that\u2019s not the main issue here. The main focus is on the timeout, so \"Internal Project\" seems like a good fit since the report is part of an internal system. There's no \"Software\" category available, but if I have to play it safe, I might go with \"Miscellaneous\" instead.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the ticket correctly, so I'm considering \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" \n\n\"Internal Project\" seems to fit best since the error relates to the monthly report tool, which is part of an ongoing initiative. I briefly thought about \"Access,\" but since it\u2019s a timeout issue, it doesn't apply. I\u2019ll produce a JSON object confirming the category as \u201cInternal Project.\u201d The format should be strict, so here it is: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. No extra text needed; I\u2019m ready to deliver!"
