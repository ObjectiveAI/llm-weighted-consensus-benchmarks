Given that it's primarily concerning access rights and permissions management, the best fit for this ticket is the \"Access\" category. However, it could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" if it involves granting admin rights.**Categorizing IT ticket for permissions**\n\nThe user mentioned several tasks like \"assign appropriate permissions,\" \"log permissions,\" \"create groups,\" and \"add users,\" which are administrative tasks. However, \"Access\" seems to be a more general category. Also, they mentioned \"shared folder digital\" and \"storage groups,\" but since the ticket focuses on permission management, not storage capacity or backups, it should be categorized as \"Access.\" \n\nI'll deliver the categorization in JSON format.\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
