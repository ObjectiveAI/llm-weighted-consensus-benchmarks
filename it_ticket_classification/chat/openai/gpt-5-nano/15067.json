Given the focus on reporting schedules and access, it seems most appropriate to fit this ticket into either \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I want to ensure I'm selecting the best category, considering it mentions availability of reports and user scheduling.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user seems to be asking about scheduled reports, which might relate to \"Administrative rights\" if they need access for scheduling. However, there's no clear mention of permissions or access in their request. It doesn't seem related to hardware, storage, purchase, internal projects, or HR. \"Miscellaneous\" might be the suitable category since it's a catch-all. The task's scheduling indicates something, but since it doesn't fit precisely into other categories, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the best option. There could still be hints toward \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" with the mention of users who scheduled reports.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nIt looks like the user is asking for information about scheduled reports rather than requesting specific rights. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit if it involved permissions, the ticket mainly focuses on the reports themselves. Since they don't explicitly mention rights, I think it's safer to categorize this as \"Miscellaneous\" to cover a general inquiry. So I'll go ahead and format the response correctly as a JSON object: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
