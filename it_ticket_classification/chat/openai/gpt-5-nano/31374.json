They mention something about closing a project or release, with terms like \"request to close,\" \"work has completed,\" and references to dates and clients. This suggests it's likely related to an administrative task. Based on this noise, I'll categorize it under \"Administrative rights,\" since it seems to be about a project close or release.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm evaluating the user's ticket request, which mentions things like \"head digital\" and \"vice president,\" but it's not about hardware or storage. It seems related to closing a project or release. The available categories include \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project.\" Since the text indicates a project closure, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it involved permissions, nothing suggests that, so \"Internal Project\" feels like the safest choice. I'll prepare a JSON object with this category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
