They mentioned that their annual leave balance is incorrect, which points to an HR-related issue. The taxonomy we're using includes \"HR Support,\" which fits well since it's specifically about leave balances. It's definitely not hardware, access, storage, purchase, internal project, administrative rights, or anything miscellaneous. So, \"HR Support\" seems like the right category for this ticket!**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nI want to provide the best answer in a JSON format for categorizing the IT ticket. The allowed categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It seems like the right output would be a JSON object like {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. The instructions clearly say to categorize, indicating I should avoid any extra text or apologies from the user. So, I\u2019ll stick to just the required JSON object!"
