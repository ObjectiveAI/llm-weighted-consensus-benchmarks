                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the provided string. It mentions several topics like \"planned absence view per team\" and \"logging tickets.\" This suggests it's related to HR or administrative functions, particularly regarding planning leaves. Since \"planned absence\" relates to personnel management, I think it falls under HR support. Therefore, I should categorize this ticket as HR Support, focusing on managing employee absences effectively.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing an IT ticket that discusses \u201cplanned absence view per team\u201d and mentions \u201clogging tickets\u201d and \u201cresolution teams.\u201d Given these elements, I wonder if it fits best under \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or perhaps something like \"HR Support.\" Since the topic mainly involves managing planned absences, it seems to be HR related. However, as it\u2019s framed in an IT context, I think categorizing it as \"HR Support\" would be the most accurate choice.**Choosing the right category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \u201cplanned absence view per team,\u201d which definitely has an HR feel to it. Since \u201cHR Support\u201d is one of the categories and fits perfectly, it seems the most appropriate choice. There\u2019s also a possibility for \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d given the talk of access controls. However, phrases like \u201cplease call\u201d and \u201ctechnical leader\u201d suggest it leans toward implementing an HR-oriented absence viewer. Overall, I think categorizing it as \"HR Support\" is the best fit.**Parsing the IT ticket message**\n\nLet\u2019s break down this ticket: it mentions \u201cplanned absence view per team,\u201d which seems to be repeated. There are also phrases about \u201clogging tickets,\u201d \u201cassigning resolution teams,\u201d and a \u201ctechnical leader.\u201d The main theme revolves around managing planned absences and possibly includes a feature request for reporting. While I could categorize it as an \"Internal Project,\" that might be more suited for broader IT initiatives. Alternatively, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could fit if it's about accessing absence data. I\u2019ll consider which fits best!**Deciding on category output**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the user\u2019s text regarding the ticket, which discusses \u201cplanned absence view per team.\u201d While it doesn\u2019t explicitly mention access permissions, \u201cviewing\u201d does imply they\u2019re relevant. The available categories include Access, Administrative rights, and others. \n\nConsidering the content leans towards a feature request associated with HR functions, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit for categorizing the ticket. I'll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This keeps it simple and precise!"
