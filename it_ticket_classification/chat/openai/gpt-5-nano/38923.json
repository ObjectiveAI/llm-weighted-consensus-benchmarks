It looks like they\u2019re requesting new headphones because their old ones stopped working, which clearly falls under hardware replacement. So, I\u2019ll classify it in the \"Hardware\" category. I have to format this appropriately as a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I want to ensure that the output is clear and can be easily parsed or displayed in an app, so I'll try to stick to the required format.**Ensuring Correct Format**\n\nI need to stick to the required format, which specifies that I should output a JSON object. The correct response is simply {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any extra text. I have to make sure that the quotes and the format are accurate since it needs to match exactly. My focus here is on precision to ensure it meets the expectations laid out in the requirements. So, I\u2019ll finalize with that exact response."
