They mentioned something about \"ms pm,\" which could relate to Microsoft Project. The phrase about \"installed machine order view drawing formats license mostly working learning purposes\" hints that they're using it for learning. Additionally, \"shadow engagement\" might refer to shadow IT.\n\nI have categories to choose from: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I\u2019ll find the best fit for this ticket!**Evaluating IT ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket further. The phrase \"shadow engagement\" might hint at temporary involvement, while the mention of \"license\" suggests it could relate to software licensing. \"View drawing formats\" could connect to CAD formats. Given that they refer to an \"installed machine,\" I need to choose from categories like Hardware, Purchase, or Miscellaneous. \n\nSince the ticket mentions a \"license,\" it seems most appropriate to categorize this as \"Purchase.\" If they're inquiring about obtaining a license, that's likely the best fit!**Determining ticket categorization**\n\nThe user provided details that suggest the IT ticket is about software use for learning, possibly involving \"shadow engagement,\" which might mean working outside official channels. There's a chance it could be part of an \"Internal Project.\" However, since a \"license\" is mentioned, the safest categorization is likely \"Purchase.\" \n\nBut they did ask me to categorize this ticket. While \"Internal Project\" is a possibility, \"Purchase\" seems most relevant due to the license. It might also help to clarify further with the user about their needs!**Preparing category response**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize the ticket, and I can provide my best guess category while also including a prompt for confirmation. The expected response format is in JSON, like {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.\n\nSince \"license\" suggests a purchase, I'll choose \"Purchase\" for the category. It might be \"Miscellaneous\" if things are unclear, but purchase seems to fit best here.\n\nI\u2019ll format my response as required: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It should be succinct and straight to the point!"
