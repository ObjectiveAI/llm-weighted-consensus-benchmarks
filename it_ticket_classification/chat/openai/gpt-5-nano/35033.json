The user mentions a \"bamboo site,\" possibly BambooHR, and indicates they cannot access it. They seem to say it's urgent and request assistance. I\u2019m thinking they meant to say they are unable to browse something related to \"DP.\" Given the context, it looks like this fits best under \"Access\" because it's about issues with site accessibility.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing this as \"Access\" since the user is having trouble with a site. There's a slim chance it could relate to \"Internal Project\" if the Bamboo site is connected to internal CI, but it feels more like an access issue. So, I\u2019ll respond with the necessary JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The user's request is straightforward, so I'll keep it simple and deliver exactly what's needed without additional explanations."
