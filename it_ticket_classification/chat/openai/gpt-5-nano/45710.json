Based on that, it seems best to go with \"Access\" since it fits the description of access problems mentioned. I\u2019ll make sure to format my response in JSON as required.**Crafting IT ticket response**\n\nThe instructions request that I categorize the IT ticket. I see a template for a JSON response that should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s essential to ensure that \"Access\" is indeed one of the valid categories listed. Since it matches perfectly, I can confidently move forward. I should keep my response concise, focusing only on the category since justification isn\u2019t required.
