The text is a bit jumbled, but it revolves around users not being able to approve or reject annual leave requests. The categories provided include \"Access,\" which could relate to permissions, or \"HR Support,\" which seems most appropriate here. \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant too, but \"HR Support\" feels like the best fit.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI see there's an \"HR Support\" category in my list, which makes sense for this ticket since it concerns Oracle notifications and leave approvals, clearly related to HR system assistance. While \"Access\" might seem a fit due to the inability to approve requests, the main focus is on HR processes. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" Now, I need to format that into the proper JSON-like structure for the response. I'll go with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
