It mentions \"backup\" and \"migrating files,\" so I'm thinking it relates to storage or perhaps access. The options to choose from are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the focus on backup and file migration, \"Storage\" seems like the most fitting category for this ticket. Let's go with that!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering that this ticket could fall under \"Internal Project,\" but it seems more appropriate for \"Storage\" since it involves backups and file migration. The user mention of \"external\" suggests they might be referring to an external drive. To categorize correctly, I'll use JSON format for the output as expected. The final category will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I\u2019ll also keep in mind to provide a brief justification since the prompt asks for that.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
