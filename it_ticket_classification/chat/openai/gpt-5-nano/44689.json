There might be different categories based on urgency, type, or department. I'll need to ensure we\u2019re consistent and clear about the categorization process so everyone understands it. This could streamline handling times and improve communication. I guess I\u2019ll need to gather input from the team on how they think we should approach this task.**Interpreting the support ticket**\n\nThe user provided a messy text that seems to be a support ticket related to issues with sending meeting invites. It's about a \"joint retrospective code\" and mentions problems with invites not reaching calendars. I need to determine the core issues here amidst the jumbled text. It looks like the message contains various technical details and error messages likely tied to Outlook or Exchange systems. I might want to simplify it into clearer language and address the user's concerns.**Categorizing the issue**\n\nI see there are key phrases like \"cannot send meeting invites,\" \"recipient address not found,\" and \"undeliverable.\" This indicates issues with calendar invites and email delivery failures. I have a category list to choose from: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It seems like this issue doesn't precisely fit \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" so \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit. Since it\u2019s a technical problem, proposing \"Miscellaneous\" seems reasonable, or I could ask for clarification from the user.{\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}"
