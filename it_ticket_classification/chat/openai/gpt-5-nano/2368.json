Even though it seems unclear, I can tell it describes issues with an old Android development environment. The problems include outdated IDE, memory issues with emulators, slow build times, and IDE freezes, likely due to low hardware specifications. It seems like they're frustrated because interns have received newer hardware while they are stuck with the older setup.**Assigning ticket category**\n\nI'm noticing mentions of \"interns receive\" and \"senior tester mobile,\" which guide me in categorizing the ticket. The main issues are clearly relating to old hardware causing compilation and memory problems. I think the best category to assign here is \"Hardware,\" since the focus is on the outdated equipment affecting their performance. While \"Storage\" could be relevant because of memory mentions, it's primarily about hardware issues rather than needing additional storage, but \"Purchase\" might fit if it concerns requesting new hardware.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
