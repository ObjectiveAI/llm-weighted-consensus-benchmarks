The string seems to mention a \"map change on Tuesday\" along with \"leaver information\" and \"assigned desks.\" It might relate to several categories like \"internal project,\" \"Access,\" or \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll need to fit it into one of the existing categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Then I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object with the selected category.**Parsing IT Ticket Content**\n\nI need to parse this content, which seems to contain multiple phrases and might even include bits from different languages. It mentions a \"map change on Tuesday\" and seems to refer to seating arrangements related to a leaver. The repetition suggests it\u2019s about updating a seating plan due to someone leaving. It might also tie into HR onboarding/offboarding or possibly involve \"Administrative rights\" if they need permissions to make those changes. I\u2019ll need to categorize it accordingly.**Determining Category for Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking \"Administrative rights\" might be the best fit if it\u2019s about getting permission to change a map. However, the content mentions \"map change,\" \"leaver information,\" and \"assigned desks.\" This could relate to an \"Internal Project\" for re-mapping seating assignments. \"HR Support\" might fit for leaver information, but it\u2019s more IT-related. Given everything, I believe \"Internal Project\" is the most appropriate category since it involves planned changes to seating due to leavers."
