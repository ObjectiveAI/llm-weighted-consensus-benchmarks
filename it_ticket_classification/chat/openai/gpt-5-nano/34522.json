They appear to want an audit of these apps, so this request seems to fit into the realm of software management and requires admin privileges for uninstallation. I\u2019m considering \"Administrative rights\" as the most suitable category, but \"Miscellaneous\" could also apply. Overall, it\u2019s an IT request related to unauthorized software.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to pinpoint the best category for the ticket about checking for and removing torrent applications. Options like \"Security\" or \"Policy\" would fit best, but they\u2019re not available. I considered \"Access,\" but it's not primarily about access rights. \"Administrative rights\" seems to be the best choice since uninstalling software typically requires admin permissions. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" and respond appropriately, possibly in a JSON format.**Formatting ticket category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to format my response in JSON. The required category options are listed, and the best fit for the request is \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll stick to the schema provided and prepare a concise JSON object. My output will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure there's no extra text, just the clean JSON format the user needs."
