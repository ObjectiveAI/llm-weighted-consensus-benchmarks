The text mentions starting dates, attached forms, and help with confirming these details. Given this context, I\u2019m considering categories like \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" since it involves HR processes and potentially setting up system access for the new employee. It's not entirely clear, but it looks most aligned with \"HR Support\" due to its focus on HR onboarding processes.**Categorizing IT Ticket Content**\n\nI have to categorize the IT ticket based on the user's input, which is about a new starter's scheduled starting date and their attached forms. The grammar is a bit odd, but it suggests a request for help with scheduling. I'd consider \"HR Support\" since it deals with onboarding. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" don't fit, and \"Miscellaneous\" is only for catch-alls. I think the best fit is \"HR Support,\" so I should output it in a JSON-like format like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Categorizing IT Ticket for Onboarding**\n\nThe ticket discusses a \"starting date\" for a new starter, which aligns with typical IT tasks like creating accounts and granting access. However, since it mentions \"new starter forms attached\" and \"needs confirmed,\" it really falls under HR/Onboarding. IT's role here would mostly be to assist with account creation, but the best category is \"HR Support.\" I need to make sure my response follows the JSON format, so I\u2019ll respond like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Let's go with that!"
