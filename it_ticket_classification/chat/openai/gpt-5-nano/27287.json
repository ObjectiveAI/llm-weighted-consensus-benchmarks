They mention a \"new project code\" and want guidelines for creating something themselves, along with an attached form. This suggests they might be looking for something related to project codes or permissions. The possible categories are \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I should choose the one that best fits the content they provided.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing clues from the IT ticket content. The mention of a \"new project code\" points to project management, and \"how create myself\" implies a need for self-service guidelines, potentially involving \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are needed. The reference to an attached form strengthens this context. \n\nSince it revolves around managing a new project code, categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" seems most appropriate. \"Access\" might apply, but it's generally more concerned with direct access rather than project management. I should go with \"Internal Project\" and add a brief justification.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket, expecting a JSON-like output with a specific format. The instructions indicate I need to create an object with a \"category\" field containing an enumerated type. So, I\u2019m set to respond with {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll make sure the string matches exactly, since the categorization is sensitive to space and wording. \n\nNo extra text or punctuation is necessary, just the JSON format should be clear and concise. I\u2019ll finalize with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
