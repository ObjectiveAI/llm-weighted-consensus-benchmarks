The user-provided text seems like a messy mix of emails and content, mentioning things like \"wednesday pm\", \"engineer\", and \"sensitive files information\". It mostly focuses on access rights, site owners, and restricted views. So, it looks like the appropriate categories would be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\", since it relates to permissions and access control discussions.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe content suggests requests to manage access rights, focusing on creating restricted views and handling sensitive files. I\u2019m considering whether to categorize it under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" It mentions restricting views to the minimum number of people, which aligns with access control features. The distinction is interesting: \"Access\" could be more generic, while \"Administrative rights\" implies specific privileges. Given the repeated references to owners and permissions, it seems best to categorize this ticket as \"Access\" for clearer relevance.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
