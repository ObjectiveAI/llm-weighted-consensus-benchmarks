The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The user's message appears messy, discussing double notifications and other details, which makes it a bit confusing. I\u2019ll sift through the content to determine the best category for this ticket. It looks like it could fall under Miscellaneous, but I\u2019ll need to consider the details.**Understanding ticket categorization**\n\nThe content discusses \"double notifications\" and issues with logged tickets, which seems related to ticketing system behavior. It includes mentions of spaces in the summary field and multiple cases. It doesn't clearly fit into hardware, storage, or purchase categories, so I\u2019m considering \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d \u201cInternal Project,\u201d or \u201cAccess\u201d. \"Miscellaneous\" is quite generic, while \"Administrative rights\" relates to permissions and \"Access\" could pertain to login issues. I'll need to determine the best fit.**Finalizing category choice**\n\nI think the best category for this ticket is \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d since it deals with notification duplicates and general ticket system behavior. While \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could be relevant, it feels less fitting. The user likely wants the category as a JSON object. According to the instructions, I'll provide just that, formatted correctly. It looks clear to simply respond with: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} and avoid any extra text to keep it straightforward. Let's go with that!"
