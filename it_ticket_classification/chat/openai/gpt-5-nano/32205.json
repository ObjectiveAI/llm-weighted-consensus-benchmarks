The user provided a pretty lengthy string filled with details like \"leaver\", \"leave date\", \"location\", and \"mailbox\". \n\nI need to categorize this into one of these categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative Rights. Given the content, it seems to relate mostly to HR Support or Access. Let's figure out the right fit!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the content of this IT ticket, which is clearly about an employee leaving. It mentions various specifics such as leaver forms, leave dates, and mailbox access, all of which seem to connect it to an IT Access request. \n\nThe categories I\u2019m considering are \"Access,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" or possibly \"Internal Project.\" However, since it primarily deals with offboarding and the removal of access, I think the most fitting category is \"Access.\" \"Administrative Rights\" could apply due to the mention of AD rights, but \"Access\" seems most appropriate for this situation.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nThe instruction here is to categorize the IT ticket, and I need to provide a specific JSON format. The required schema is clear: it should be a JSON object with \"category\" set to \"Access.\" \n\nSo, I need to keep it simple and get right to the point. The final output I need to deliver will just be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll make sure there are no mistakes and that it matches the expected structure!"
