The content talks about security, particularly regarding permissions and threats from third parties. \n\nNone of the categories fit perfectly, but perhaps \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" would work since the ticket involves blocking domains for security purposes. Ultimately, this feels like a more specialized request, so I might land on \"Miscellaneous\" as a fallback.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket feels like it's related to security configuration, but it doesn't fit neatly into any of the categories. \"Administrative rights\" seems like the best option since modifying the blocklist likely requires admin privileges, even if it\u2019s not explicitly user rights. \n\nI need to respond in the specified JSON format, indicating the category. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} with the proper capitalization to match the enum requirements.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI need to match the user's request exactly for the IT ticket categorization. The instruction is clear: it's just about providing the category, so I\u2019ll keep it straightforward. \n\nI\u2019ll respond with the exact JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I shouldn\u2019t add any extra information or justification since the system expects a clean response, so I\u2019ll stick to just that format without adding anything else."
