The message is a bit jumbled, but it highlights key topics like access issues, resources, and the need to raise a ticket. Given the options for categorization, it seems this ticket best fits either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it primarily concerns access to both the PC and associated resources.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user is mentioning \"no access to resources from PC\" and \"could raise assignee,\" which seems confusing. The main problem identified here is access, so I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this ticket as \"Access.\" However, it could also fit into \"Administrative rights\" if it's about permissions. I need to respond with a JSON object that aligns with the specified format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The instruction is clear: provide the category in that JSON format and nothing else.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
