Given that it mentions aspects like backup material and a renting period, it seems to fit into the \"Hardware\" category due to the mention of the external hard disk. There's also the \"Storage\" category, but since it's about hardware specifically, \"Hardware\" feels like the better fit. However, I might want to note the \"Storage\" category for consideration too.**Categorizing the request**\n\nThe content of the request clearly indicates that the user wants to rent an external hard disk for backup material until December. It leans towards being a hardware request but also touches on storage aspects. Given the categories, I think \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category because it specifies the item. However, \"Storage\" could be relevant too since it deals with backup needs. In the end, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" I'll ensure the output is in the required JSON format.**Deciding on the category**\n\nIn this request, the user is asking for an external hard disk for rental with a focus on backup material. While it certainly involves hardware, there's enough emphasis on storage to consider \"Storage\" as a category too. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" because it directly references the physical item, but since it's meant for backup, \"Storage\" could fit well. Ultimately, I think I'll categorize this IT ticket as \"Hardware,\" as that seems the most straightforward choice.**Generating JSON output**\n\nI\u2019m going to select \"Hardware\" as the category for this IT ticket. Based on the required format, I\u2019ll create a JSON object with the structure they specified. It will look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. The instructions clearly state that it should be a valid JSON object, so I\u2019ll ensure that\u2019s exactly what I produce. My final output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, with no extra commentary. Let's keep it clean and to the point!"
