The content indicates it\u2019s about creating a git repository for a new project, focusing on an automation framework and resource requests. Given that it discusses repository creation and access, it fits into the \"Internal Project\" category. However, there\u2019s also mention of \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access.\" Still, \"Internal Project\" seems to make the most sense for project-related work.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nThe content indicates it\u2019s about a new project involving the creation of a git repository called \"automation framework.\" This leans towards the \"Internal Project\" category since it focuses on project setup and related guidance. While \"Access\" pertains to permission issues, it's not explicitly mentioned here. The user is primarily asking for help with repository creation and procedures. So, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit in this situation.**Preparing the JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON-like object for categorizing the IT ticket. The format specified requires a category string, and I've determined that \"Internal Project\" is the right category based on the ticket content. I'll ensure I follow the exact format outlined. So, my response will be a JSON object like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nThis way, I\u2019m following the instructions properly while providing the exact required output. It's important to keep it clear and precise!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
