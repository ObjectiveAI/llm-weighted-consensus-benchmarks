This IT ticket seems to relate to license management or purchasing rights for software, so it could fit several categories like \"Purchase\", \"Access\", or \"Administrative rights\". The mention of \"writer\" suggests it\u2019s about a software license, and it seems to best align with \"Purchase\", since that relates to obtaining licenses.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI\u2019m revisiting the categories available and considering \"Administrative rights,\" which could relate to licensing permissions. However, phrases like \"licenses you need\" and \"select order\" suggest that this ticket is really about purchasing licenses. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll format the final answer as a JSON object, ensuring it matches the exact strings provided in the schema. This will simply be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Let\u2019s deliver that!"
