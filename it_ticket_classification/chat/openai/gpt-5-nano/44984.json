It sounds like the drive disappears unexpectedly. This seems related to \"Access\" since remote access is involved. It could also fit under \"Storage\" due to the drive's nature. I\u2019ll lean towards categorizing it as \"Access.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user has an issue accessing a network drive, which is primarily a storage resource. While the problem suggests the \"Access\" category due to the inability to get to the drive, it might also fit under \"Storage\" since it's about a storage resource failing. Many systems tag these situations as \"Storage.\" However, since the user emphasizes needing remote access to their files, I'd categorize this ticket as \"Access,\" since that aligns best with their request.**Categorizing IT issue**\n\nGiven the typical IT triage, when a user can't access a network drive, I see it more as an access or mapping issue rather than a storage failure. The user mentions that the drive disappears, indicating a storage problem at the network share level. However, since they\u2019re requesting access, I think it\u2019s simplest to categorize it as \"Access.\" \n\nSo, I\u2019ll format my response as the required JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, keeping it focused and clear as instructed."
