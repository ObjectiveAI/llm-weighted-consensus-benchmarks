The user seems to have connection issues, mentioning \u201cconnection dodgy\u201d and \u201cintermittent when connecting\u201d with something that might be a tabletop connector for a TV. Given the ticket categories\u2014like Hardware, Access, and Miscellaneous\u2014I think it most likely fits under Hardware. While \"Network\" isn\u2019t a category, it certainly feels like a hardware/network issue. If it doesn\u2019t quite match, I might consider Miscellaneous.**Deciding on Category**\n\nThe mention of a \"table top connector present TV\" indicates an external hardware connection, pointing towards a hardware-related issue. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as Hardware. The API expects it in a specific JSON format: a category object within an object, which looks like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I want to ensure it fits that schema and avoid adding extra text. While \"Miscellaneous\" could work too, I'll stick with \"Hardware\" as it aligns better with the details provided. So, my output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
