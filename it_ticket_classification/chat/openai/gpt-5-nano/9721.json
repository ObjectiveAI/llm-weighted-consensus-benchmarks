It seems to describe an improvement request related to Oracle reports and optimizing task details. Given the provided category options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others, I'll have to determine which one fits best. It seems like an internal project might be the right choice, but I need to think it through carefully.**Analyzing ticket content**\n\nI\u2019m looking at an IT ticket that includes key terms like \"Oracle report improvement\" and \"automate selection.\" The user is clearly requesting improvements related to software and reporting rather than hardware, HR, or access. The mention of wanting to increase speed and reduce load indicates that it\u2019s focused on optimizing processes. Unfortunately, none of the available categories like \"Hardware\" or \"Miscellaneous\" perfectly capture this, as there's no \"Software\" or \"Application\" category to fit it into.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket based on its content. The closest options are \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" Since this is a proposal for feature improvements in Oracle reports, it sounds like it fits as an internal project. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" don\u2019t apply here. I\u2019ll lean towards \"Internal Project\" as it's a specific request related to the system used within the organization. I\u2019ll format my output as a JSON object, like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
