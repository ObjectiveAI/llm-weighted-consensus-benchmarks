The strong theme of access removal indicates this ticket should be classified as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format my output in JSON to reflect this category.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI need to follow the system's required format, which is a JSON object containing the property \"category\" with a string enum value. So, I'll respond with {\"category\":\"Access\"}. \n\nWhile it could be helpful to provide a brief explanation, the instructions specify to produce only the category object. Therefore, I'll stick to the required output without any extra formatting or details. It's clear I just need to give the JSON directly. Let's go with that!"
