I think the most fitting category would be \"Hardware,\" since it relates to physical devices. However, I also need to consider if it could fit \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Hardware\" feels right. \n\nI'll output it in JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt seems that the issue is with room phones not working, based on the provided text. I\u2019m considering whether it should be categorized as \"Hardware\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Given that these are physical devices malfunctioning, \u201cHardware\u201d makes the most sense. The user's mention of \"not working rooms\" and grammar suggests some confusion, but the underlying problem remains clear. So, I\u2019ll proceed with the category \"Hardware\" and format it as JSON: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
