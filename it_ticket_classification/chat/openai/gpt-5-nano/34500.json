The ticket seems to be about slow network connectivity, so it could go under \"Access,\" which fits issues related to network access. Even though it might relate to \"Hardware\" due to devices, the primary issue is network performance. So I'll categorize it as \"Access\" and output it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Outputting category as JSON**\n\nThe instruction specifies to \"Output: category,\" which means I need to present a JSON object containing just the category string. I should focus on delivering that concisely and without any extra text. While it might be tempting to suggest recommended actions, the user only asked for categorization. So, I'll stick to that. The crafted JSON output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
