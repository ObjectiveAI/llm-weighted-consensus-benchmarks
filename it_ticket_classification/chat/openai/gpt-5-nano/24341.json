The categories I have include \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Internal Project.\" Given that it references onboarding and forms, it likely falls under \"HR Support.\" However, if the ticket is also about access rights, it could fit \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll keep this in mind as I proceed.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, which relates to a new starter and includes mentions of forms and a starting date. The categories available suggest that \"HR Support\" might be appropriate due to the onboarding context. However, there's also an \"Access\" category, which might fit for requesting new starter access rights. Since the message mentions a form to be filled, it could go under \"HR Support\" or \"Access,\" but I lean toward \"HR Support\" given the onboarding focus.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nSince the user is sending forms for a new starter, this mostly relates to onboarding rather than access privileges. It seems that \"HR Support\" is the safest category here, given the context. Although we have other categories like \"Internal Project\" and \"Administrative rights,\" they don't quite match. I\u2019ll prepare to respond with a JSON object that includes \"HR Support\" as the category since it's the most fitting option to categorize this IT ticket.{\"category\": \"HR Support\"}"
