It seems like it touches on both hardware and access for new interns, which complicates the decision. However, I think I should lean towards \"Hardware\" since that\u2019s the prevailing theme in the ticket. I'll format the output as a JSON object with the selected category.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing the IT ticket as \"Hardware\" because it emphasizes the request for hardware allocation concerning towers. While there's also a mention of creating accounts, that seems to relate to onboarding rather than being the main focus. So, despite the access aspect, the primary theme appears to be hardware. I need to respond with the category formatted in JSON, specifically like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. But I should double-check the formatting, as the system might require only the string."
