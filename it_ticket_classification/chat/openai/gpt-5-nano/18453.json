The options are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The message refers to a \"new starter\" onboarding process and mentions assistance with a starter form, which seems important. It fits best with \"HR Support,\" but it might also relate to \"Access\" if there\u2019s an IT access request for the new starter. Overall, I'm leaning towards classifying it as \"HR Support.\"**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nFor this IT ticket, I think it clearly relates to \"HR Support\" because it involves the onboarding process. There\u2019s mention of a \"starter form,\" assistance with its completion, and the phrase \"joining tomorrow,\" which all hint at HR-related tasks. While \"Access\" could fit if there were a request for system access, there\u2019s nothing explicit about that. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"HR Support\" and prepare a JSON object for the response.**Outputting Category Object**\n\nI need to respond with the category in the correct JSON format. The user asked me to categorize the IT ticket. I\u2019ll create a JSON object matching the required schema, which specifies the \"category\" as a string within an object. I'll construct it as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}, since that\u2019s the category I determined fits best. The format should be properly quoted to ensure clarity. I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s all set for delivery.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
