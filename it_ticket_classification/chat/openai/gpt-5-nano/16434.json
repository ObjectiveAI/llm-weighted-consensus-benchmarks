The closest category might be \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"HR Support.\" Given that it involves new joiners, it seems more like an HR onboarding issue, but it could also be about IT tasks like provisioning accounts or access.**Deciding on category**\n\nI need to choose a category for the IT ticket, and \"Access\" seems to be the best fit since it often covers user provisioning for new joiners. It could also be \"Administrative rights,\" but that's less clear here. While \"Internal Project\" might fit if it pertained to a specific project about new joiners, it\u2019s unlikely. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" and include a brief note mentioning that it\u2019s about provisioning access for new joiners. Let's format the output as JSON: {\"category\": \"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
