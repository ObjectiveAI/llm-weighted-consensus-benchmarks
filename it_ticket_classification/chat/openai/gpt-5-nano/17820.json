The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket mentions changing project status in Oracle, hinting it could involve internal project management. However, \"Project Management\" or \"Oracle\" aren't options. The closest fits might be Administrative rights or Access, since the user seems to need permission to change the status. They emphasize urgency, requesting help with a high-importance task.**Evaluating project status request**\n\nIt seems like the user is requesting an update to a project status in Oracle. The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It's not about hardware, HR, storage, or purchases. Access could work since changing status may require permissions, but they specifically mentioned \"change project status,\" not gaining access. Administrative rights is also relevant for permissions, while Internal Project fits since it\u2019s related to project tasks. I need to pick the most suitable category.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe content \u201cchange project status oracle\u201d suggests this is about an Oracle project management system. The mention of \u201cpending close active needed approve remaining task\u201d indicates workflow states. \"Internal Project\" seems suitable since it's related to project management. However, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d might be more precise, especially if changing status requires admin privileges. The user is seeking help, indicating a permissions request. While the \u201cAccess\u201d category is more generic, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d is likely what IT would prefer. I need to choose which fits best.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket text is a bit messy, but the core request is to \"change project status\" in Oracle. The phrase \"approve remaining task\" indicates the need for approval, so I'll consider \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access\" as possible categories. \"Internal Project\" is good since it relates to project management issues. Since it's about changing a project status in Oracle and not hardware, I\u2019ll choose \"Internal Project\" as the final category and format it as a JSON object for the response.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
