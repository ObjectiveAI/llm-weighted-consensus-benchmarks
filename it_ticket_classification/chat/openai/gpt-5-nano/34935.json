It seems like it relates to charts loading slowly and possibly sending a survey. I\u2019m considering the available categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and more. Since this isn't about hardware or HR, it might fall under \"Internal Project,\" as it could be a feature request or bug. I just need to pick the best fit!**Classifying the IT issue**\n\nI see this is likely an IT issue based on the user's mention of \"chart loading\" and \"did your survey get sent.\u201d It could be a bug with charts not loading, possibly related to \"storage,\" but that usually means physical capacity. \u201cInternal Project\u201d fits project work, while \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d feels too generic. I\u2019m considering \u201cAccess,\u201d but the text doesn\u2019t indicate access denial. I\u2019ll lean towards categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" for now and prepare a JSON object accordingly.**Finalizing the category**\n\nI think \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the best fit due to the vague nature of the user's request. It could also be classified as \"Internal Project\" if it's about a chart in a specific project. However, the mention of surveys suggests it could be about loading survey results in charts, which might indicate a bug. Since there\u2019s no category for \"Software\" or \"Applications,\" I'll go with \"Miscellaneous\" and prepare a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I'll make sure to output it without any extra text!"
