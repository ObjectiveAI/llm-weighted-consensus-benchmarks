The ticket mentions an \u201cissue submitting expenses\u201d and \u201cerror,\u201d so it could be about submitting expenses in the expense system. There isn't a clear category like \"Finance,\" so maybe \"Miscellaneous\" fits best. It could also be about \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" particularly since the user is asking how to change something and seems concerned about permissions or connectivity. It\u2019s a bit confusing!**Categorizing IT Ticket Again**\n\nThe categories don't include \"Software\" or \"Applications,\" so \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the best fit. I know I could ask for clarification, but the task is to categorize the ticket. The output needs to be in JSON format with a \"category\" field, and it should match the required enum exactly, ensuring proper capitalization. So, I\u2019ll respond with just the JSON object: {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}. I\u2019ll keep it clean and direct per the instructions. Yes, that works!"
