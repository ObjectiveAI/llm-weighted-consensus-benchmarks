It mentions \"new purchase,\" \"purchase order,\" and \"purchased PC,\" which suggest it relates to buying something. \n\nConsidering the categories available, \"Purchase\" seems to fit best. I need to respond with a JSON-like object with the category field. So, I\u2019ll create that response for the user to clarify the categorization.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nIt looks like this ticket is primarily about a new hardware purchase related to a PC, alongside aspects like logging allocation and receipts. There are a few categories to consider, but \"Purchase\" makes sense since it involves a purchase order and receipts.\n\nHowever, it could also fit under \"Hardware,\" since it specifically mentions the PC. Ultimately, I'll go with \"Purchase\" as the best match. Now I\u2019ll format that into a JSON response: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}."
