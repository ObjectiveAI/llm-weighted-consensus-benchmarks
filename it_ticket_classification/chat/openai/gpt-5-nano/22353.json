The user\u2019s message mentions installing a cloud build status notifier, which sounds like it fits into predefined categories such as \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Access.\" I think it\u2019s more aligned with an internal project task related to application installation. I might respond with a JSON-like object indicating the category, perhaps something like {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} or maybe \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Internal Project\" seems most accurate.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards classifying this IT ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it relates to a tool for build status notifications in cloud builds. While \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option, it feels too generic. If there's mention of needing admin rights to install, that might suggest \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" But from the request, it seems to be about an internal project, so categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" makes the most sense. I'll output a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}.**Generating JSON Format**\n\nI need to respond in the required format as a JSON object with the category field. It looks like the system expects something like {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} based on the predefined categories. I won't include any extra notes since the instructions suggest delivering just the JSON. It\u2019s clear that this structured format is necessary, so I\u2019ll stick to just providing the category in the specified format. Let\u2019s go ahead with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
