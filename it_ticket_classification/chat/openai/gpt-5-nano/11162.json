The ticket text discusses restricting access, isolating applications, and addressing security threats. It seems to focus on access control and security issues, so \"Access\" could be a fitting choice. However, I\u2019m also pondering if \"Internal Project\" could apply since it relates to a security change to production. Ultimately, I think \"Access\" is the best fit.**Finalizing category output**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the IT ticket under \"Access\" since it directly relates to restricting outside access and blocking applications. Now I need to format my response as a JSON object. It should simply be: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to adhere to the required format and include no extra text. The system specifies that it wants a JSON object with the category string, so I'll stick with that. Let\u2019s proceed!"
