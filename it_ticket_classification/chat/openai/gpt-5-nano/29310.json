It mentions things like memory upgrades per station and logging receipts for four upgraded stations. I\u2019m weighing the options from the list: \u201cHardware,\u201d \u201cHR Support,\u201d \u201cAccess,\u201d \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d \u201cStorage,\u201d \u201cPurchase,\u201d \u201cInternal Project,\u201d and \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d It seems hardware is the best fit since memory upgrades are hardware-related, but it could also involve the \u201cPurchase\u201d category due to the request for receipts.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe line about a purchase order for memory upgrades suggests that the user is requesting upgrades for four stations and is asking to log receipts. I see two plausible categories: \"Purchase\" and \"Hardware.\" Since the ticket primarily concerns hardware upgrades, I\u2019m leaning toward classifying it as \"Hardware.\" The mention of receipts can be seen as part of the purchasing process post-upgrade. So, it seems best to categorize this ticket as \"Hardware\" and prepare the response in JSON format.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
