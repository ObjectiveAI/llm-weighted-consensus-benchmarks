There's \"HR Support,\" but also the mention of a \"feedback button\" which could involve access for certain users or members. If I'm unsure, I might put it under \"Miscellaneous.\" Typical categories could include Hardware, Software, and Network. In this case, \"Access\" aligns well with the feedback button aspect and member restrictions. It seems the user is looking to enable a feedback button specifically for someone.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm thinking about category options for this IT ticket. If it's enabling a UI element for a user group, \"Access\" seems to fit best. \"Administrative rights\" would imply privileges to make changes, but the context leans more toward just enabling access for feedback. The user repeats \"feedback\" throughout their message, which is a bit confusing. Still, since they specifically mention \"add feedback button available for her,\" it reinforces that \"Access\" is the right choice for this ticket.**Selecting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI think \"Access\" is the most appropriate category here since it involves enabling a feature for a user and has a time restriction. Alternatively, \"Internal Project\" could apply if the feedback button is part of an internal product, but it's safer to choose \"Access.\" I need to respond in a specific format, providing just the JSON object for the category field set to \"Access\" as required. So, I\u2019ll output the category object accordingly. \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
