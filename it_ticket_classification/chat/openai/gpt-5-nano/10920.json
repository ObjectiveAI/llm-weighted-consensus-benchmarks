Since it doesn't relate to access or hardware, I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project,\" but it could also fit under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI\u2019m leaning toward categorizing this IT ticket as \"Internal Project,\" since it involves creating a list for a project on Wednesday PM. \"Administrative rights\" would apply if it involved permissions, but that's not the case here. \"Miscellaneous\" is a fallback, but the specifics point to project management.\n\nThe phrase seems to highlight scheduling and ownership, which supports \"Internal Project\" best. So I\u2019m going to format the response as a JSON object with the category field: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
