The categories we have include \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" It feels like it could be either \"Administrative rights\" if they\u2019re requesting permission, or \"Access\" if it's about control over the switch port. I\u2019ll analyze the context further to choose the best fit!**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm looking to categorize the ticket regarding switch port configuration. It seems like the best fits are \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" since it deals with access control. Typically, such requests might also fall under \"Internal Project,\" but I think \"Administrative rights\" makes the most sense here due to the nature of controlling the port. I'll go ahead and craft the response in JSON format, including this chosen category. Let\u2019s get this right!**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to prepare a JSON object based on the given schema. The category I\u2019ve chosen is \"Administrative rights.\" According to the schema, I must ensure it\u2019s structured correctly as an object with the specified format. So, I'll provide just the JSON without any extra text, ensuring the case is exactly right as stated. Here goes:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
