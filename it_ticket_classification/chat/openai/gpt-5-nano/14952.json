The mention of project management and contracts suggests it might fit into \"Internal Project,\" as it seems to discuss starting a new project with pending contracts. It doesn't pertain to hardware or HR support, and while it does mention attached forms, it doesn't seem to require administrative rights or access. This feels clear!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket. Given it discusses a new project code and relates to Oracle Fusion, it leans towards \"Internal Project.\" The mention of \"contracts pending signature\" hints at procurement, which could point to \"Purchase,\" but since it's primarily about starting a project, \"Internal Project\" fits better. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" because it reflects the task of creating a new project code for client engagement. I'll respond with a JSON object indicating this category.**Finalizing response format**\n\nI\u2019m ready to respond with the specified format for the IT ticket. The user asked to categorize it, and I\u2019ll keep it simple and direct without adding extra text. I\u2019ll say: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that \"Purchase\" was a consideration, but I feel \"Internal Project\" is the best fit here. I think I'm set with this final output!"
