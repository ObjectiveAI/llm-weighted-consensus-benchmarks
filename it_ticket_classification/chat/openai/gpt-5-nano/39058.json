The system defines specific categories, including \"Miscellaneous,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. Given that there's no \"Software\" category and the issue is an Excel crash, it seems \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit. While \"HR Support\" might seem related, it doesn't quite match the software issue. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous\" for this urgent Excel problem.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nThe user mentioned \"officer address,\" which might imply a police department location, but that's not relevant to our category selection. Since the issue involves an \"Excel file crash without recovery,\" I should categorize it as a data loss issue. The categories don't include \"Software,\" so \"Miscellaneous\" is the best option here. The required output format needs to be a JSON object, so I\u2019ll deliver just that without any extra text.\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
