Since it discusses hardware allocation and mentions \"temporary laptop request\" and \"temporary monitor,\" it clearly fits under the \"Hardware\" category. I think I'll go ahead and categorize it as Hardware.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm double-checking if there\u2019s a better category than \"Hardware.\" \"Access\" isn\u2019t relevant, and \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t fit. \"Purchase\" could work, but this ticket focuses on allocating a temporary monitor and laptop rather than procurement. \"Internal Project\" doesn't seem applicable either. Although \"Miscellaneous\" is an option, being specific is better. So, \"Hardware\" is indeed the most suitable. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, keeping it concise and to the point."
