The ticket is about a user experiencing issues with job applications in the Mantis system. It seems to relate to HR, given it's about job functions. However, it could also be Access-related since there are mentions of entering credentials. The options include \"Administrative rights\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" but HR Support feels most fitting given the context.**Categorizing ticket correctly**\n\nThe ticket is about a job application issue, so I believe \"HR Support\" is the right category. Considering the available options like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" and others, this one aligns perfectly with human resources. The user had problems applying for an internship, as the portal displayed nothing when they clicked \"apply.\" I need to ensure I format the response as a JSON object with the category string. The correct output will be: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. I'll double-check if they just need this category or something more.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
