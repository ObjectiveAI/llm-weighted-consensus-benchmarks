It mentions several things like \"new starter\" and \"consultant.\" I think the best fit might be \"HR Support\" since onboarding typically falls under that. However, \"Access\" could work if they're asking for system access for interns. Since it's IT-related, I'll lean towards \"Access.\" It's a bit tricky, but onboarding usually triggers access provisioning.**Classifying the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user's message is quite jumbled, mentioning \"consultant Friday\" and asking to \"please help interns,\" which hints at onboarding new staff. This could fit under \"HR Support,\" but the categories are primarily IT-focused. Since I need to provide a JSON response, the directive specifies that I should select a category from the provided list. \n\nI\u2019ll opt for \"HR Support,\" as it aligns with onboarding. Now, I'll format my output as a JSON object that accurately reflects the chosen category.**Selecting the Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket text suggests onboarding with phrases like \"new starter\" and mentions help for interns. This usually relates to access provisioning, which makes \"Access\" the best category for this IT ticket. Although \"Administrative rights\" could be considered, it doesn't fit the context well. The unclear phrases like \"hi attached regards consultant Friday\" aren't helpful. Overall, since access for the new starter and interns is the focus, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access,\" and I'll format the final output as just the JSON object. \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
