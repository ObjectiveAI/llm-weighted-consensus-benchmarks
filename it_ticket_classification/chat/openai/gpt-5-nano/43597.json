The ticket mentions an unavailable Oracle expenses link, which leads to an error when filling out an expense report. It sounds like the resource was moved, causing this issue. I think this fits best into the Access category since it's about permission or access to a resource. It doesn't seem to relate to hardware, so I should stick to Access or possibly Administrative rights.**Assigning IT ticket category**\n\nI'm deciding on a category for the IT ticket related to access to an expense system. It seems best to classify this as \"Access,\" since the issue revolves around a broken link to a resource. While \"Internal Project\" was a consideration, it\u2019s clear that \"Access\" fits better. So, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object containing the category. The final answer will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to make sure I respond correctly with a JSON object for the category field. The user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, so I should provide just the category object. The schema confirms that it should be something like {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text or whitespace. This seems straightforward, so I\u2019ll just present the response neatly as {\"category\":\"Access\"} and nothing more."
