It mentions adding a \"discipline\" in relation to \"Oracle\" and has a structure that\u2019s a bit jumbled. It\u2019s important to decide which category fits best among Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. Since it involves adding something related to a system, it seems likely to be categorized under Administrative Rights or Internal Project. I'll need to clarify further.**Analyzing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket about adding \"discipline\" to a system\u2014possibly linked to a person. The mention of \"application planning officer ext\" suggests some role or extension, while \"notes yellow\" may relate to color coding in the ticket. I need to rule out Hardware since there\u2019s none mentioned. It could fit in Access, Administrative Rights, or Internal Project. However, the context leans more toward Administrative Rights or Access because it involves user permissions or adding fields.**Understanding the IT Ticket Instruction**\n\nIt seems like this ticket is an instruction to add a \"discipline\" to the Oracle system, which likely refers to the Oracle database. The phrase \"discipline to be added\" points to a task for Wednesday afternoon. The mention of \"application planning officer ext\" could indicate that we're adding an extension. This text is pretty jumbled, so I think asking clarifying questions might help. Since the user specifically asked to categorize the ticket, I'll choose a category, provide justification, and maybe suggest a ticket title formatted in JSON.**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON format like {\"category\":\"...\"}, selecting the most appropriate category for this IT ticket. Based on the text, \"discipline to be added\" and \"oracle\" suggest a system-related task. Although \"Internal Project\" comes to mind due to \"application planning,\" there's no explicit project mentioned. \"Administrative Rights\" seems relevant if the intention is to grant access for the \"discipline\" in Oracle. However, the unclear context makes \"Miscellaneous\" a reasonable fallback to ensure I'm covering my bases.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
