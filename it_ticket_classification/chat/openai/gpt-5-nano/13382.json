The provided schema includes various category types like Hardware, HR Support, and others. \n\nThe ticket content seems a bit messy, but I can pull out keywords like \"new project for seal operator\" and \"tracking screens working tomorrow.\" Based on this, it might fit under \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" I\u2019ll have to think about this more!**Choosing a category for the ticket**\n\nI need to find the best category for this ticket. The mention of \"setup seal operator\" suggests it\u2019s a role, and \"tracking screens\" likely refers to UI for a project. It definitely seems to be about establishing something for tracking.\n\nGiven that this is a new project for a seal operator and they've filled out a form, \"Internal Project\" feels like the right fit. \"Administrative rights\" could imply a request for access, but since they don't explicitly ask for it, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best choice here!**Formatting the JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object to categorize the IT ticket correctly. The expected format specifies that I should include just the category. Based on my previous reasoning, I\u2019ve determined that the right category is \"Internal Project.\"\n\nSo, I\u2019ll make sure to construct the JSON object accurately as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll ensure it\u2019s syntactically correct and keep it simple\u2014no extra text needed. Just the clean output will be ready!"
