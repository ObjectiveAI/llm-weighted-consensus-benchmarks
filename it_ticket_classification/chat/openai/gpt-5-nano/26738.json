It includes phrases about setting up a project in Singapore and requests for shared links and access to a repository. Given the content, it seems to fall under \"Access\" since it discusses sharing links and repository access. I want to ensure I classify it correctly among the categories like Hardware, Storage, and Miscellaneous, but \"Access\" stands out.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket. It mentions creating a new site for a Singapore project. While it doesn't fit Hardware or Storage, \"Access\" seems likely since they're asking for a link to the repository. However, it could also fall under \"Internal Project\" since it relates to an internal setup. The request is not for admin rights; they just want links shared. I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category, but I need to confirm.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to categorize this IT ticket related to setting up a project in Singapore. \"Internal Project\" feels like a good fit since it\u2019s about an internal setup. While \"Access\" could apply if they needed credentials, it doesn\u2019t explicitly mention that, just a request to \"share a link.\" Given the content, \"Internal Project\" seems best. If they wanted admin rights, that would be another story, but it's not clear. I'll respond with the category in the specified JSON format."
