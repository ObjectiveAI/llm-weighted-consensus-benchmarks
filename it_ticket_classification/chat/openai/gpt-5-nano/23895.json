I'll categorize it accordingly.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think the primary issue is about updating the starter form with a proposed date, which suggests an \"Access\" rights concern related to provisioning for the new starter. However, the text doesn\u2019t mention specific access details; it focuses on changes to the form itself. Given this context, \"HR Support\" seems to be the most fitting category since it relates to onboarding processes. \n\nNow, I\u2019ll need to return the category as a JSON object in the required format. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI'm making sure my JSON formatting is correct since the user specifically asked to categorize the IT ticket. It seems clear that the best fit is \"HR Support\" because the content focuses on updating the starter form and reflects an onboarding procedure. While I consider \"Access\" due to potential access provisioning, the emphasis on the starter form indicates it's more about HR processes. I'll keep the response straightforward and without any extra text.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"} \n\nI just need to confirm that I'll be responding with JSON only, as instructed. It's important to keep the response straightforward without any additional text. This way, I ensure clarity and meet the user\u2019s request directly. JSON formatting is my focus, making sure it aligns with their specified requirements. I'll just stick to what\u2019s necessary to deliver the correct information effectively."
