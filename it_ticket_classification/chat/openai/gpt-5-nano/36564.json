It seems a bit jumbled, but they're describing problems with tools failing, likely involving Office Word and Excel. They mention that these applications stop working after a few seconds and that this issue happens even after multiple restarts. The user also notes attempts to reinstall software, which didn't resolve the problem that's been persisting for months. Sounds like it's really frustrating for them!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, and I'm considering the options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The user's issue about software crashing doesn\u2019t quite fit into hardware or access categories. Since \"Software\" isn\u2019t an option, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best choice. However, if the issue requires admin rights for installation, \"Administrative rights\" might be applicable too. For now, I'll go with \"Miscellaneous\" since it covers general software problems.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
