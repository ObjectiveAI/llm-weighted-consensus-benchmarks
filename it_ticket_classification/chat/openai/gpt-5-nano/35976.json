The user is seeking assistance with this issue. Given the categories provided, I\u2019ll determine the best fit for this ticket amongst options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, or Miscellaneous. Let\u2019s decide!**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this IT ticket as \"HR Support\" since it's about a referral tool in the HR system. It could also fit as \"Internal Project\" if this tool is just for internal use, but \"HR Support\" seems more accurate. I need to respond with a simple JSON format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. The user requested a straightforward response without extra text, just the category as specified. Let's keep it clear and simple!**Finalizing JSON Response**\n\nI'm sure now that \"HR Support\" is the best category for this IT ticket. I\u2019ll create the JSON response as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I need to make sure everything is properly quoted without any extra commentary. Keeping it straightforward is important since the user is looking for a clear response. Let's finalize this!"
