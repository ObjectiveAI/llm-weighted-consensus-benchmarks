Since they talk about completed purchases and preparing tickets, I think \"Purchase\" might be appropriate, but since it involves hardware, \"Hardware\" could also fit. Ultimately, I must choose just one category.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to decide the best single category for this IT ticket. \"Purchase\" seems fitting since it mentions completed purchases and stock replenishment, which falls under procurement. However, it's also about hardware, like the docking station and monitor. While \"Hardware\" could work, I'm leaning toward \"Purchase\" due to the procurement tasks. I need to format my response as JSON, so I'll go with {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Still, I wonder if \"Internal Project\" or \"Storage\" might be better options to consider.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}{\"category\":\"Storage\"}{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
