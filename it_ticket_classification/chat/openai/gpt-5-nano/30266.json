The \"Purchase\" category is for procurement requests, while \"Internal Project\" is for works like this. I\u2019ll evaluate the best fit carefully!**Analyzing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe string \"import import unit costs costs\" is quite puzzling. It seems to suggest a potential financial context, perhaps relating to importing costs. Since the user wants a categorization, \"Miscellaneous\" might be the safest fit due to the ambiguity. However, if it pertains to costs for procurement, \"Purchase\" could work too. The safest route might be to propose both categories or seek clarification from the user about the intent behind this unusual phrasing!**Deciding on category for ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"import unit costs\" makes me think of a data import task, specifically regarding costs. Given the ambiguity, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the safest choice, though \"Internal Project\" could also apply if it's related to a specific project. Since this doesn't involve hardware or storage, I'll go with \"Miscellaneous.\" The output needs to be in JSON format, following the exact schema, so it will look like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Keeping it concise is key here!"
