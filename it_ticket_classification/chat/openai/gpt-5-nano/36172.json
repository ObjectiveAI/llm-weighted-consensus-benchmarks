The path might suggest permission issues with shared folders. The phrase \"cannot run reports\" is quite general, so I need to categorize the ticket appropriately. I believe \"Access\" fits best, as it pertains to the software access issue. I\u2019ll respond with the category formatted as JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and ensure it's exactly what the system needs.**Delivering JSON response**\n\nThe provided schema indicates I need to respond with a JSON object that includes the category value. Based on our previous discussion, I\u2019ll use \"Access\" as the category. So my final response will be simply: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I won\u2019t include any extra text; I just need to deliver this formatted response. It\u2019s important to follow the schema precisely! Let's keep it clear and straightforward."
