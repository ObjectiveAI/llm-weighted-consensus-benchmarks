It mentions \"oracle still not approved,\" \"two approvers,\" and \"check if the sheet needs approval,\" indicating that it could be related to access control or administrative rights. Alternatively, it might also fall under the category of Internal Project or Miscellaneous. I'll make sure to select the category that best fits the context.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI need to consider the categories available: Access, Administrative rights, Purchase, Internal Project, Miscellaneous, Hardware, Storage, HR Support, and so on. The phrase \"oracle still not approved\" likely refers to a status check for something in the Oracle system, focusing on access or permissions. \"Check if the sheet needs approval\" could indicate workflow approvals. So, I'm trying to decide between Access or Administrative rights, as the ticket seems to center on pending approvals and permissions.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this request as \"Access\" since it involves granting permission related to Oracle. However, the mention of a \"sheet\" could imply a Google Sheet or Excel document needing approval, which might fit under \"Miscellaneous.\" But then there's also the \"Administrative rights\" category for admin privileges. I still think \"Access\" is the best fit, but I\u2019ll keep the potential for \"Administrative rights\" in mind. So, I\u2019ll respond with:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
