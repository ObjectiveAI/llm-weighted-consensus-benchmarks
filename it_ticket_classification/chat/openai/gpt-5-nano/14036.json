The phrase \"exclude machines\" appears multiple times, along with \"script location\" and references to a \"senior engineer.\" This suggests it might relate to an internal project or administrative rights. It's also possible it falls under miscellaneous if the details are unclear. Since we lack more specifics, I\u2019ll choose the best-fitting category based on the content provided.**Choosing a Category for IT Ticket**\n\nI've got to categorize this IT ticket, but it\u2019s a bit tricky. The mention of \"exclude machines\" suggests it could relate to a script or deployment rather than hardware. \"Script location\" points more towards a software issue. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but none are explicitly clear. If uncertain, it might be safest to default to \"Miscellaneous\" for simplicity.**Selecting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this IT ticket as \"Internal Project\" due to the references to \"script location\" and \"senior engineer client.\" However, it could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are involved. The phrase \"exclude machines\" hints at excluding units from a deployment, but since there's no option for \"Software,\" I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best catch-all here. I just need to provide the category in a required JSON format. So, here it goes:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
