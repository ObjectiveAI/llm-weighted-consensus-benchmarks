The ticket describes issues with the meeting room calendar configuration, including multiple bookings and using the room finder. It doesn\u2019t directly relate to hardware, access, or purchase. \n\nGiven the limited categories, \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d feels like the best fit since it encompasses various issues. \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could be another option, but it\u2019s not clearly about that. It seems most appropriate to go with \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d**Categorizing Calendar Booking Issues**\n\nThe ticket discusses calendar bookings related to a meeting room, which hints at access issues. However, the user doesn\u2019t specifically request permission regarding their access; they\u2019re looking for corrections on booking configurations. \n\nThe categories I'm considering are \"Miscellaneous,\" since the problem doesn\u2019t fit neatly into other categories, or possibly \"Access\" for permissions related to using the room calendar. There's also the potential for \"Administrative rights\" because the phrasing suggests a need for administrative changes to the calendar configuration. I think \"Miscellaneous\" fits best here.**Finalizing the Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket appears to be more of a user issue, so I don\u2019t think \"Administrative rights\" applies here, as it's for admin requests. \"Internal Project\" isn\u2019t suitable either, so \"Miscellaneous\" makes the most sense as a general IT issue.\n\nI'll provide the response in the required JSON format with the category key. Since the instruction specifies how to categorize without needing an explanation, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward. Here\u2019s the output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
