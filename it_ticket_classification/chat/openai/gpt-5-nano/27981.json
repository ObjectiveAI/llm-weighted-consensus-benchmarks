The text references an access card, leave dates, name visibility, and specific forms. Given the provided categories, this ticket seems to fall under \"Access\" since it involves access cards and leave requests. I\u2019ll make sure to accurately place it in the right category for effective handling. Let's assist the user further!**Determining appropriate category**\n\nI noticed there's an \"HR Support\" category that could fit, alongside \"Access.\" Parsing the user's messy ticket text reveals references to maternity leave, an access card, and form details. It mentions an administration officer and requests for filling out names and leave dates. Since this seems to involve HR processes related to maternity leave and form completion, \"HR Support\" might be the more appropriate category to select for this ticket. Let's ensure we categorize it correctly!**Choosing the right category**\n\nI need to categorize the ticket under \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" The ticket mentions \"access card\" and \"maternity leave,\" which makes me think about access provisioning. However, since it's mainly focused on maternity leave and related forms, \"HR Support\" seems to be the better fit. The phrase \"maternity leave access card\" hints at access during leave, but HR typically handles these forms. I should provide the category and maybe suggest subpoints or ask for clarification next!**Responding with the category**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON-like object indicating the category of the ticket. The valid options are \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" Since the ticket is clearly focused on maternity leave forms and mentions HR processes, I'll go with \"HR Support.\" The relevant phrases about an \"administration officer\" and \"maternity form complete\" reinforce this choice. So, my response will simply be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I won\u2019t add any extra commentary unless it's requested!"
