It might relate to \u201cAccess\u201d since it suggests they want to add a member \u2014 maybe to a distribution list or system access. However, it could also fit into \"HR Support\" due to the onboarding aspect. Determining the right category is tricky, but I lean toward \"Access\" for clarity!**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI'm trying to categorize an IT ticket, and I think \"Access\" is the right choice since the user is asking about adding a new member. The user phrases like \"new member\" and \"add\" suggest they want to grant access or add to a system, which makes sense for the IT context. I\u2019ll format the response as JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Since the user just wants the category, I\u2019ll keep it simple and direct without extra details."
