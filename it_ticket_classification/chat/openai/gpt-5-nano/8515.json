While \"Internal Project\" could also work due to the attached version, the category I\u2019ll go with is HR Support. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON-like object accordingly.**Clarifying JSON structure**\n\nI\u2019m realizing that the output needs to be in a specific JSON format. The instructions indicate I should provide just the \"category\" field as a string, like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.\n\nThough the schema suggests a more complex structure with type and properties, I think it's safe to simplify my response. I should follow the basic requirement first, which is to focus on returning the chosen category clearly and correctly. I\u2019ll provide the JSON object accordingly!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
