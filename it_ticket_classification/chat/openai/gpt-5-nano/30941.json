Given the categories available, it looks like \"Hardware\" fits best since it's about physical networking tasks. However, it could also lean toward \"Internal Project\" or \"Access.\" But since hardware is the focus, I\u2019ll create a JSON response with the category set to \"Hardware.\"{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}**Verifying User Request**\n\nI see the user\u2019s message is about connecting network ports on the floor side, likely involving a floor side switch. This clearly points to a hardware-related issue. Since the task is about setting up or connecting hardware, it makes sense to classify it as \"Hardware.\" I\u2019m ready to output the necessary response based on this context. I've confirmed the category and now I\u2019ll proceed with the appropriate action."
