I don't think \"Storage\" or \"HR Support\" fit here. I'll prepare to categorize it in JSON format along with a brief explanation.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the provided schema, which includes options like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" and others. Given the issue revolves around repeated login prompts and \"Outlook issues,\" \"Access\" seems to be the right choice. \n\nThe instructions specify returning only the JSON object for parsing, so I'll provide: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI'll ensure the formatting is correct and stick exactly to the required output without adding any extra text."
