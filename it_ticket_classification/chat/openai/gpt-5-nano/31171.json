It mentions wanting to \"add new resource\" and implies a connection to a device, perhaps for guest network access. The phrase \"discipline lead\" could refer to a person or a role involved in this request. Overall, it seems like this ticket could fit into the category of Access or possibly Internal Project, depending on how I interpret the context.**Analyzing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether this ticket falls under \"Hardware\" since it mentions a device, but it might be more about access. It looks like they want to connect to a currently running device, possibly related to guest network access. The phrases \"add new resource\" and \"hi want connect\" suggest they\u2019re requesting connectivity. Since there's mention of a \"guest,\" it likely involves user access. Overall, I think the best category for this ticket is Access.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m assessing the IT ticket to see where it fits. Since the request involves connecting to a resource, it likely falls under Access, especially with mentions of a \"guest\" network or account. The reference to \"administrative rights\" might pertain to admin privileges needed for connection. The ticket discusses \"adding a new resource,\" but this could relate to hardware or storage too. Since the context suggests connectivity and permissions, Access seems to be the most fitting category.**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that \"Access\" is the best category for this IT ticket. The instructions specify that I need to respond with a JSON format containing the category. So, I\u2019ll create the output as a simple JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s important to keep things concise and ensure it fits within the allowed values. While I could ask for clarification, the user's request is clear about categorization, so I'll just deliver that JSON response."
