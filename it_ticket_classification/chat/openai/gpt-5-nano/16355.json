The ticket text is a bit jumbled but mentions \"pro retina intel,\" which might refer to an Apple MacBook Pro. There's also a clear mention of a \"purchase order.\" Given that, \"Purchase\" fits best as a category since it involves a request for delivery and handling orders. So, I'll categorize it as \"Purchase.\"**Formatting IT ticket output**\n\nI need to provide a JSON object that categorizes an IT ticket. The prompt asks, \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" with category options available. Based on the information, the expected output should clearly be `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. I want to make sure the capitalization is correct, as that's key. While I considered \"Hardware\" due to \"Pro Retina Intel,\" the phrase \"purchase order\" leans more towards procurement, making \"Purchase\" the best choice. So, I\u2019ll just respond with the JSON object: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`."
