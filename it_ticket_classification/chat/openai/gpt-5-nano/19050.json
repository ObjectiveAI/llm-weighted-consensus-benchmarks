The categories available for the ticket include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and Administrative rights. Based on the context, \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" seem to be the best fits. Since onboarding usually requires access provisioning, \"Access\" might be the most appropriate. However, there\u2019s some confusion regarding \"select location\" and the mention of a template error.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing an IT ticket regarding a \"new starter\" and the associated tasks like completing a form and selecting a location. It seems they might want to add an image, but the focus here is on granting access to systems, networks, and apps for the new employee. Since this involves creating a user account and providing access, I think categorizing it as \"Access\" makes the most sense. I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object that specifies the category as \u201cAccess.\u201d**Crafting JSON response**\n\nI see that I need to generate a JSON object with the key \"category.\" The primary task is to categorize the request as \"Access.\" Although it seems like a good idea to provide a brief justification, the user didn't specifically ask for that. So, I\u2019ll stick to the requested format and just provide the necessary JSON. I\u2019ll make sure the response is clean and contains only what\u2019s asked for:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
