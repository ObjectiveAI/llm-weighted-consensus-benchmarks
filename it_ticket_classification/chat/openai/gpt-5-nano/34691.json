The ticket refers to a candidate's surname being spelled incorrectly and asks if it can be changed on our side. It mentions that they can make the changes themselves before the candidate gets hired. This seems to relate to HR onboarding, so I'll categorize it under \"HR Support,\" although \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" could also fit. I\u2019ll finalize it as \"HR Support.\"**Determining the ticket category**\n\nThe user wants to change a surname in their system and references \"your side\" or \"our side,\" which relates to user access and identity. The categories include HR Support, which is for HR processes, and Administrative rights, for admin privileges. Although \"Access\" is an option, it might not be as fitting. Since this involves a candidate's name in records, I believe \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category for this ticket.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user mentions that they can change the surname themselves before onboarding, indicating they want to correct it prior to hiring. This might involve IT changing the name in the HR system or active directory. Since they ask about the possibility of changing the surname, it suggests an administrative role. Although \"Administrative rights\" seems fitting given the context, I believe \"HR Support\" is the best choice, as the ticket focuses on correcting a candidate's surname in HR records, not hardware or other categories.**Deciding on the category**\n\nFor this ticket, \"HR Support\" seems appropriate, but \"Administrative rights\" could fit if they're asking about permissions to change the surname themselves. The user's comments indicate they want to know if the surname can be changed on either side, touching on administrative capabilities, but it's not explicitly stated. Given the context about a candidate's name related to HR onboarding, I lean towards categorizing it as \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll prepare the output as a JSON object for clarity.**Outputting the category**\n\nI need to respond with the category in the specified JSON format. The user's inquiry about a surname suggests it falls under HR data rather than \"Access,\" which would relate to passwords or account management. So, I feel confident in categorizing it as \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll prepare the answer as simply the JSON object without extra text since that aligns with the provided instructions. Here we go:  \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
