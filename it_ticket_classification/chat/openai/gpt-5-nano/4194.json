It looks like they\u2019re asking for help with \"mobile evolution\" and configuring networking details to match existing setups. The text is pretty messy, but I can glean that they\u2019re reaching out for assistance.\n\nI have to choose from allowed categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll need to classify this ticket appropriately!**Interpreting IT request**\n\nI\u2019m parsing the user\u2019s message found in the IT ticket. It seems like they\u2019re asking for assistance with \"mobile evolution,\" possibly a project or feature. They\u2019re looking for help to configure something on the networking side, similar to existing setups.\n\nNow, I need to consider potential categories. If it's about enabling a feature, it could fit under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I'll have to classify the ticket appropriately based on that context!**Interpreting categories and request**\n\nThe mention of \"senior developer\" might suggest this relates to an internal project. This gives me another category to consider: \"Internal Project.\" \n\nOthers like \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" or \"HR Support\" don\u2019t seem to fit. The best matches could be \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nThe text points to a request for help enabling something related to mobile evolution, indicating they want details about configuring the networking side to match existing setups. I\u2019ll need to classify it thoughtfully!**Classifying the configuration task**\n\nI see that this task involves network configuration. It could fit under \"Internal Project\" since it relates to implementing something within a project. However, it might also require \"Administrative rights,\" but the user didn\u2019t mention needing permissions specifically.\n\nGiven the focus on \"enable\" and \"configuration\" on the networking side, it likely suggests a change request for a feature in a \"mobile evolution\" project. I think I'll classify it as \"Internal Project.\" \n\nI'll format the response in JSON, ensuring it's lower-case for the category.**Finalizing category response**\n\nI\u2019ve confirmed that the enum requires exact strings, so I\u2019ll use \"Internal Project\" with the capital I and P. My final answer will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nNow, let\u2019s deliver this. While the instruction specifies to respond with just the category, I think including a brief justification could add clarity. However, the guidelines emphasize that I should stick to the required format. So, I\u2019ll proceed with just the JSON object for the response."
