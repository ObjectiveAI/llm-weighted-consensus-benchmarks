Given that it's related to HR processes, it could fit under \"Access\" or possibly \"HR Support.\" I need to decide which category best represents this issue.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket related to a timekeeping issue, which seems most appropriate for \"HR Support\" since it involves timecards. While it might also touch on \"Access\" due to the gateway error, the main concern is about submitting timecards. There\u2019s a mention of a \"missing submit button,\" pointing to a possible UI issue. Given the context, I'll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and format it correctly in a JSON object for submission.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI see that I need to provide a JSON object for this IT ticket. The ticket mentions a \"gateway error\" related to timecards and a \"missing submit button,\" making it clear this is primarily about timecard issues. While \"Access\" could be a consideration due to the gateway, \"HR Support\" fits better since it directly pertains to HR processes. I\u2019ll stick to the strict format with no extra commentary and respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
