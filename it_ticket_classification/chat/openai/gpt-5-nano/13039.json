The user mentions a request for \"laptop and monitor\" on Friday PM, which is a pretty clear part. The rest is messy, with phrases about someone joining, working, and needing advice. Given that core information, I think it fits better in \"Hardware\" or possibly \"Purchase.\" It's likely centered around a request for equipment. Let's categorize it accordingly!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI see there's a request for a laptop and monitor, which clearly points to \"Hardware.\" I ruled out options like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" The categories are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the ticket is about hardware provisioning, I'll go with \"Hardware.\" To follow the prompt correctly, I need to provide it in a specific JSON format. \n\nSo, here\u2019s the output: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
