They mentioned issues with options becoming unavailable while selecting leave, which affects their ability to submit a report. This could fall under \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or even \"Administrative rights.\" The inability to submit might indicate a permissions problem, so \"Administrative rights\" could be appropriate. However, since the issue relates to leave reporting, \"HR Support\" might also be relevant. I'll assess this further.**Classifying the IT Ticket**\n\nI need to classify the IT ticket based on the provided categories. Considering the user's mention of \u201cannual leave code\u201d and \u201coptions becoming unavailable,\u201d this issue might stem from a project management tool like JIRA. \"Access\" seems plausible if there are restrictions, while \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it\u2019s a permissions issue. Since the user didn't mention hardware or storage and it\u2019s not related to payroll, I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project.\" The response format should be a JSON object with the category specified.**Finalizing the Category**\n\nI need to decide on the best category for the ticket where options in task details become unavailable for annual leave code, preventing report submission. The issue suggests it could be related to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but \u201cAccess\u201d feels like the better general choice. I\u2019ll create a single JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra commentary, since the prompt specifically asks for just the category. Let's finalize that output."
