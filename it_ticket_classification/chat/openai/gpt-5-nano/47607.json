Let's take a moment to think about the context of the ticket and pick the best fit. I want to make sure I'm getting this right to help out effectively!**Evaluating user message**\n\nThe user provided a lengthy message that's mainly about a survey rollout, including reminders and issues with view versus export, filters, and access rights. It seems to involve concerns about data management rather than HR, hardware, or storage issues. I need to confirm this understanding before categorizing the ticket correctly. It's essential to address the user's points clearly while making sure I don't miss anything important related to the survey or any outstanding concerns!**Categorizing access rights**\n\nI see that the message involves access rights, mentioning phrases like \"please have rights\" and \"if you delegated somebody please forward them.\" It also touches on survey rollout, data discrepancies, and permissions around accessing and exporting data. Given these points, it seems the best category for this IT ticket would be \"Access.\" While \"Administrative rights\" is a distinct category, the content leans more towards access concerns. I want to make sure I categorize this correctly for effective resolution!**Finalizing category output**\n\nThe ticket requests confirmation regarding the rollout of a survey, which makes me consider categorizing it as \"Internal Project.\" However, since access rights are a big concern within the content, I feel the \"Access\" category fits best. I need to output this in the specified JSON format. According to the instructions, I'm just focusing on providing the category object without any extra text. Here it goes: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
