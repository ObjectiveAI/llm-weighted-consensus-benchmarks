The testing aspect also fits here, confirming that \"Internal Project\" is the right choice. Now, I need to format my response in the required JSON structure, which looks like this: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. The final response should simply be the JSON object based on the provided instructions.**Formatting category response**\n\nThe required output structure is clear: I need to provide the category using the specified schema. So, I\u2019ll respond with {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. To be safe, I should ensure it matches the schema's expectations of an object with a \"category\" property. While I could include a brief justification, the instruction just asks for the category itself. Therefore, my final answer will be a concise JSON object stating \"Internal Project.\""
