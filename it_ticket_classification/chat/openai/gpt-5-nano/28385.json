It mentions rogue wireless networks and procedures, which suggests it's an IT security task. I have to decide between the categories: \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but I think \"Internal Project\" might fit best given the focus on evaluation and scanning. I'll need to make that call carefully!**Determining the ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"rogue wireless networks,\" suggesting it's related to security auditing, and talks about assigning tickets to members, which points to project management. The categories I'm considering include \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" and others. Given the context of scanning for rogue networks, \"Internal Project\" really seems to be the best fit. I should format my response as JSON with {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. It's clear that this aligns with the user's requirements!**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe prompt specifies that I need to provide a JSON object with a \"category\" field. The available categories include options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" among others. Based on my earlier reasoning, I\u2019ll set the \"category\" to \"Internal Project.\" I just need to make sure that I only output the JSON without any extra text. Alright, I\u2019ll deliver that now: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
