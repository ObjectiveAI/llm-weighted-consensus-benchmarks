It seems like this issue relates to access management or user permissions. The possible categories based on the system prompt are \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d Since it\u2019s not a hardware issue and primarily involves user accounts, I\u2019ll focus on those two categories for proper classification.**Determining the right category**\n\nI'm considering whether this ticket should be categorized as \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d The issue of being \u201cunable to delete users\u201d points toward access management, suggesting it may need administrative rights. While \u201cAccess\u201d is broad, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d is more specific. It\u2019ll be important to output this in JSON format, following the schema guidelines provided. I think I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" to keep it general, but \"Administrative rights\" could also work given the context. This decision seems crucial!**Selecting JSON category**\n\nI see the enumeration options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the issue is about user accounts and deleting users, \"Access\" seems like a fitting choice. However, given that a specialist manually deleted users, \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant. If I'm unsure, I\u2019ll lean towards \"Access\" as it covers access management more generally. I\u2019ll format the final output in JSON without extra text as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
