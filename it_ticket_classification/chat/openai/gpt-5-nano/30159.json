The string mentions setting CC as a project manager and backup approver for an \"Oracle Tuesday change PM.\" This ticket likely fits into the \"Internal Project\" category since it's about project management roles. I'll make sure to classify it properly. The request has a lot of repetitive phrases that indicate urgency for help, but the main focus seems to be on project management tasks.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe request is about setting CC as a project manager and backup approver, which likely involves access rights. This means it fits into either the \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights\" category. The mention of \"backup approver\" suggests permissions are needed for some approval workflow, so \"Access\" sounds suitable. However, if this is more specific to configuration roles in a project, then \"Internal Project\" might apply. Ultimately, I'll go with \"Access\" based on the focus on permissions.**Categorizing permissions request**\n\nI'm deliberating how to categorize this request. \"Administrative Rights\" would be suitable if it specifically involves permissions and approvals. However, \"Access\" is a broader term. Looking at the categories, this ticket is about setting CC as project manager and backup approver, which indeed touches on access and permissions. It also mentions \u201cOracle Tuesday change PM,\u201d suggesting it's related to a project. The focus is on changing management roles and approvals, so \u201cAdministrative Rights\u201d might be the best fit after all.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm trying to determine which category fits best for this request. \"Administrative Rights\" seems appropriate since it's about approval privileges. However, setting someone as a project manager might lean towards \"Internal Project.\" But given that the request also involves changing roles, \"Access\" makes sense too. The phrase \"backup approver\" indicates an approval workflow that requires access, which points back to \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" Ultimately, since this is about modifying privileges, I think \"Administrative Rights\" is the way to go.**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket precisely. Based on the user's request, I'll go with \"Administrative Rights\" since it\u2019s the most accurate. The format requires a JSON object, which should look like this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} and not include any extra text. The system's schema specifies exact values from the enum, so clarity is crucial. Even though \"Access\" might fit too, the emphasis on rights and approvals makes \"Administrative Rights\" the right choice. I'll deliver just the JSON response as instructed."
