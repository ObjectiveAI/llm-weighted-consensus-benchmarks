The available categories include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" both of which seem relevant. The user mentions obtaining permissions for \"jobs stored under link,\" indicating a request for access. It's likely that the best fit is the \"Access\" category, as it pertains to their need for project permissions, although \"Administrative rights\" could also be considered if there are nuances.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nIn IT ticket taxonomy, \"Access\" refers to general requests for system and application access, while \"Administrative rights\" relate to elevated privileges. The user is asking for permissions to view or edit a project, so categorizing this ticket as \"Access\" seems appropriate. However, since it mentions \"zebra jobs,\" possibly indicating a project name, it might fit the \"Internal Project\" category too. But since it's really an access request, I'd lean toward classifying it as \"Access.\"**Choosing the category**\n\nI'm deciding to categorize this IT ticket as \"Access.\" Now, I need to format my final answer in the required JSON format. The instruction is clear that I should provide a JSON object with the category field. To ensure I match the enumeration properly, I\u2019ll use \"Access\" with a capital A. The best response is just the JSON object without any extra text to meet the parsing requirements. So here\u2019s my final output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
