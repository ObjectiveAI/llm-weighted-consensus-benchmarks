The options include categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.\n\nIt looks like many phrases refer to changes in job titles and requests for transfer forms. Based on that, I\u2019d likely lean towards the HR Support category since it connects to job title changes and related inquiries. Let's proceed with that!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe content is focused on changing job titles and transfer forms, mentioning \"assistant ext,\" which hints at phone extensions. I'm wondering if this could be related to access, especially with the language about \"administrative rights.\"\n\nHowever, since it primarily addresses job title changes, I think categorizing it under \"HR Support\" makes the most sense. The transfer form likely relates to department changes, but there\u2019s no talk about access rights, so I\u2019ll stick with HR Support.**Deciding on category for ticket**\n\nI see this ticket fits well into the \"HR Support\" category due to mentions of job title changes and transfer forms. It specifically refers to \"change job title,\" which is related to HR processes. Though there's some mention of extensions, the core task is about updating job titles.\n\nSo, I'll categorize it under \"HR Support.\" Now, I need to format my response as JSON, using the required structure:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
