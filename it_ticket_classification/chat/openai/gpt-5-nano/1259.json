The content references a \"new starter\" and an \"intern\" along with an \"employment contract,\" which suggests it's related to HR onboarding. Given the options, \"HR Support\" seems like the most appropriate category. \"Administrative rights\" might also be relevant, but it feels more focused on HR onboarding. So, I think I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support\" as the best fit!**Clarifying IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nI noticed there's no specific \"Onboarding\" category in the provided options. The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given that this is HR-related, \"HR Support\" feels like the right fit, even though one might suggest \"Administrative rights\" for access needs. The user\u2019s message indicates it\u2019s about a new starter's employment contract, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" I need to make sure my response follows the required JSON format too!**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nI see that the instruction specifies a category schema for formatting the response. Since \"HR Support\" seems the most appropriate category for this ticket, I should output it as a JSON object. The response format needs to be precise, so I\u2019ll keep it simple and direct without any extra text. I\u2019ll provide just the JSON object with the category field set to \"HR Support.\" Here\u2019s how it\u2019ll look: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Simple as that!"
