It mentions multiple users being able to view their remaining leave balances, so this seems related to HR support since it's about leave policies. However, there might be a system issue affecting visibility, adding an IT context to it. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support,\" but \"Access\" might also be relevant. I should clarify which category fits best!**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m assessing the category for the IT ticket regarding user access rights, as the request seems related to visibility of HR policy data. It's a bit tricky because it might fit both \"Access\" and \"HR Support.\" The phrase \"sa la request annual leave sa\" hints it might be requesting approval for leave. Given the issue is about visibility\u2014specifically users not seeing their available leave\u2014I'm leaning towards \"Access\" since it indicates a permissions problem. \"Access\" or possibly \"Administrative Rights\" could fit better.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI realize that users not seeing their own data indicates an access issue. Between \"Access\" and \"HR Support,\" it feels like this concern leans towards HR Support due to the nature of the request. However, since it involves visibility and permissions, \"Access\" seems more fitting. The phrase \"sa la request annual leave\" confuses me a bit, but I think I'm settling on \"Access\" for this ticket. So, I'll go ahead and produce the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll just provide the JSON now!{\"category\": \"Access\"}"
