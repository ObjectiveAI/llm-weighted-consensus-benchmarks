The ticket content mentions \"new project code oracle fusion,\" which points to an ERP software and suggests it's related to project setup. The request is fragmented, but it hints at something that involves setup tasks. Given this context, it seems to fit best under the \"Internal Project\" category, though there might be elements of \"Access\" too since it mentions attaching forms. I'll go with \"Internal Project.\"**Interpreting IT ticket content**\n\nI\u2019m parsing the request about a \"new project code\" which suggests it's related to Oracle Fusion, an ERP system used for various administrative functions. The term \"pre code deck\" could signify a pre-sales or project deck. The input is a bit confused, mentioning setup and an attached form, which leans towards it being about internal project setup. While access rights could be relevant, it seems best categorized under \"Internal Project\" since it emphasizes project setup more than access.**Classifying as Internal Project**\n\nI'll classify this request as \"Internal Project\" since it's clearly about starting a new project with Oracle Fusion. The system requires a specific JSON-like format to convey this, so I need to output just the category without any extra text. I\u2019ll format this correctly to meet the specifications, ensuring double quotes are used around the keys and values. The final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let's keep it clear and straightforward!"
