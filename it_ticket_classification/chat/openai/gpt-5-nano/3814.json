The relevant categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It seems this ticket is primarily about sharing content and possibly involves access control or permissions since it mentions accepting or declining requests. So, I\u2019m leaning towards classifying it under the Access category.**Categorizing IT ticket for JSON**\n\nThe request asks to categorize an IT ticket related to sharing a kiosk demonstration video with everyone. We have several potential categories: Storage, Internal Project, Administrative rights, and Miscellaneous, but it appears to best fit under Access due to the sharing and permissions implied in the request. I think I should prepare the output in JSON format as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Providing brief reasoning might be optional, but sticking to the instruction, I\u2019ll focus on delivering just the category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
