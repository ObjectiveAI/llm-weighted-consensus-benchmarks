It mentions issues with Oracle and errors related to submission and changing status. Key phrases like \"cannot change them\" and \"please investigate\" suggest it's a request for assistance. Given the context, it could involve access issues since the user is encountering submission errors. I'll classify this ticket under \"Access\" based on the information provided.**Examining ticket categories**\n\nI need to define the best category for this IT ticket. It might involve \"Administrative rights\" since the user has submission errors, suggesting issues with permissions. The phrases \"cannot change them\" and \"cannot submit due to error\" hint at access problems. While it could also fit under \"Access,\" I'm considering \"Miscellaneous\" for any general issues. After weighing all the categories, it seems safest to classify this ticket under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\"**Choosing the right category**\n\nI need to pick the best category for this IT ticket. \"Access\" seems fitting since the user mentions submission errors and the inability to change, which likely points to permission issues. However, since \"Administrative rights\" specifically addresses those permissions, it feels like a more precise choice. The user's mention of wanting to \"investigate issue\" and \"attached\" adds some ambiguity, but overall, it seems best to categorize this ticket as \"Administrative rights\" to address the permission concerns directly.**Formatting the response**\n\nI'll provide the categorization in the required JSON format, which is straightforward: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. This is the best fit considering the user's issues with permissions. While I could consider \"Miscellaneous\" due to some uncertainty, the instructions clearly ask for categorization, and \"Administrative rights\" aligns well with the description. I feel confident sticking to the prompt and submitting just the category without additional justification. So here we go with the output: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
