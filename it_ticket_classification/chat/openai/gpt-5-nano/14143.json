There are mentions of job titles and profile updates too. It feels mainly like HR, especially with phrases like \"transfer form\" and \"admin officer.\" The categories I see are HR Support and Access. If it\u2019s mostly about HR, then categorizing it as HR Support makes sense. I\u2019ll structure it as a JSON category object.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
