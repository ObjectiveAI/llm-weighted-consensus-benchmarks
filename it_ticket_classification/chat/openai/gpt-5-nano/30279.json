The categories to choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights.\n\nLooking at the ticket content, it mentions purchase requests, keyboard, and second monitor, which points to hardware concerns. However, since it's heavily focused on purchase requests and requisitions, the best fit seems to be \"Purchase.\" While \"Hardware\" is relevant, \"Purchase\" encompasses the main focus of the ticket more accurately.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user's message seems a bit jumbled, but the main focus is on purchase requests, product catalog information, and suggestions. Given this content, I'm categorizing it as \"Purchase.\" \n\nThe instructions mention I need to provide this in a JSON format. The structure should look like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. \n\nSo, I should respond with that JSON object as the final output while ensuring \"Purchase\" is correctly capitalized. Here goes: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
