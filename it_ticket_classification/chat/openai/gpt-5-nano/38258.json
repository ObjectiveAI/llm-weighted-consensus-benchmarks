The ticket mentions an Oracle issue, and there\u2019s a reference to performance issues and application navigation. It could fall under \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but it seems there's also an HR aspect with the mention of annual leave. So, it might relate to the HR module within Oracle. Picking the most relevant category is tricky; I'll carefully consider all options.**Parsing User Ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing a user\u2019s fragmented message about an Oracle issue. It seems to point to notifications every minute, possibly indicating performance slowdowns. They mention submitting past annual leave and have navigation issues within the app. There\u2019s a note about raising a ticket for a developer, suggesting it's a software-related problem. Given the categories available, I might classify it as \"Internal Project\" if it relates to internal development, or \"Miscellaneous\" for broader issues. I need to choose wisely!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis ticket is about an Oracle software issue related to app navigation, which could fall under \"Miscellaneous\" as a catch-all. Alternatively, \"Access\" might fit if there were login issues, but the user doesn't mention that. There's also a reference to annual leave submission, suggesting some HR functionality that could categorize it as \"HR Support.\" Since they raised a ticket for a developer, it points to internal development. However, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is likely the best option if I need to choose one category.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI think \"Administrative rights,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" aren't relevant to this ticket. While \"Access\" could apply due to navigation issues, it doesn't align with login access since the user just mentioned navigating the app. Given the ambiguity overall, \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the safest option, as it's often used for unclear issues. Since the user asked me to categorize this IT ticket, I'll output a JSON object designating \"Miscellaneous\" for the category. It includes various issues like Oracle performance and app navigation.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
