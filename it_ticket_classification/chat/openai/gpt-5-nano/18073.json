The available categories include things like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the user is asking for equipment like a standing desk, keyboard, and mouse, it seems to fit best under \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll prepare the response as a JSON object with the category field set to \"Hardware.\" This response is aimed to help improve their working position!**Formatting the JSON response**\n\nI see that there's a specific category format needed for the response. It should be a JSON-like object with a \"category\" key, which must contain one of the enumerated strings: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" etc. I was initially considering \"Purchase\" because the user mentioned needing equipment, but the request seems more focused on improving ergonomics, leading me to choose \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll just ensure to output the proper JSON without any extra text.
