I should craft a JSON response that reflects this decision. The final output will simply be a JSON object stating the category as \"Access.\"**Formatting IT ticket category**\n\nI need to verify the user's text, which seems a bit jumbled but revolves around \"app details,\" \"password,\" and \"logging in to the Oracle app.\u201d It\u2019s clear this falls under \"Access.\" I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and return only the necessary JSON format without any extra commentary. The required output will simply be a JSON object stating the category as \"Access\" to align with the instructions provided. Let's produce that now."
