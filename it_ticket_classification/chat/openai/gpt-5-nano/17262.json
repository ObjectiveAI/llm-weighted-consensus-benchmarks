It seems to revolve around the leaver process and access management. The most fitting category appears to be \"Access,\" since it deals with rights and profiles. Although \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, the emphasis is on access management related to offboarding, which usually belongs in that category.**Generating JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket seems focused on maintaining access to licenses and mailboxes rather than just granting or revoking admin privileges. Therefore, \"Access\" is the best category choice. I need to create a JSON object to match the specified format, which requires a category field with an enum value. I\u2019ll make sure the output is just the JSON without any extra commentary, structured like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
