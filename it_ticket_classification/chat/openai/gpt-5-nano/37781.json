The user message indicates a software issue with Oracle notifications and unread actions. Since there's no specific \"Software\" category, I\u2019ll select \"Miscellaneous.\" It's not about hardware, storage, or purchases, and it doesn't fit the other categories well. So, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best choice here!**Categorizing IT Issues**\n\nI\u2019m considering if this might relate to \"Administrative rights\" since the user mentioned difficulty accessing notifications. However, the details suggest this is a bug in the Oracle pending notifications list, where actions show as unread despite being opened. It feels like a software issue, and since the available categories don't align well, \"Miscellaneous\" fits best. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object format showing the category as \"Miscellaneous.\" The output will be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
