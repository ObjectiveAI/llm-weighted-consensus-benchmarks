The ticket mentions phrases like \"access to instance,\" \"port opened,\" and \"same host,\" which signal it's about getting access, possibly related to network access or firewall rules. \n\nSo, I\u2019m deciding between the categories \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It definitely seems to lean more towards \"Access\" because it specifically talks about accessing an instance and opening ports. That feels like the right choice!**Categorizing ticket as Access**\n\nIt looks like the content focuses on access to an instance and open ports, leading me to consider \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The mention of \"log assign\" caught my attention, but the phrase \"access to instance\" is quite direct.\n\nI'll categorize this ticket as \"Access\" and provide the response in the required JSON format. The system expects just the category, so I\u2019ll return: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra commentary."
