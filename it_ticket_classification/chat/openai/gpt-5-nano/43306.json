The message is about issues with ServiceNow templates, particularly the inability to choose correct fields. I'll consider categories from a given list: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It seems related to user access or permissions, which might make \"Access\" or \"Internal Project\" the best fits. It's definitely not related to hardware or HR.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis IT ticket is about ServiceNow templates and issues with template creation. I\u2019m considering classifying it as \"Internal Project\" because it deals with an internal template problem. The ticket mentions the inability to choose the correct fields, which might relate to access issues or permissions. While \"Access\" could fit because it concerns field selection, it leans more toward an internal project to address template field issues rather than admin privileges.**Finalizing category selection**\n\n\"Internal Project\" feels like the right fit for this IT ticket about ServiceNow template creation issues since it relates to an internal initiative. Although \"Miscellaneous\" could be an alternative if I'm unsure, I think it's best to categorize it as \"Internal Project\" given the context of automation within that internal project. I\u2019ll output a JSON-like object with the exact format the system expects, saying: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Keeping it straightforward!"
