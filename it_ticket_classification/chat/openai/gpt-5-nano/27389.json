The text suggests it's related to onboarding a new employee, possibly involving a form for that process. Keywords like \"importance high\" signal urgency, and \"ext\" might mean external or an extension. So now, I\u2019m evaluating the best category from the options provided. \"HR Support\" seems the most fitting for onboarding, but \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could also apply.**Categorizing IT ticket correctly**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on the keywords provided. \"New starter\" clearly indicates it's related to HR, and I see that \"HR Support\" is indeed one of the categories. The \"starter form\" reinforces the onboarding context, while \"importance high\" suggests a need for urgency, though the primary task is just categorization. The output should be a JSON object with \"category\": \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll ensure it matches the required format exactly to avoid any errors. So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Preparing to respond with category**\n\nAlright, it\u2019s clear that my task is to respond simply with the category based on the enumeration mentioned. I\u2019ll provide the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It\u2019s important to keep this straightforward since the user just wants the categorization without any added commentary. I\u2019ll make sure to deliver exactly what\u2019s needed. Okay, let\u2019s go ahead and finalize that response!"
