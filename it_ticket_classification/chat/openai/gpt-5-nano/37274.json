It seems to include a request about a password reset and user access, specifically mentioning \"Active Directory.\" Phrases like \"password reset\" and \"check if active ad\" are clues that suggest this is an access management issue. Given the context, I'll classify this ticket as related to Access from the predefined set of categories.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the appropriate category for the IT ticket, which could be \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It mentions \"password reset\" and \"active AD,\" so \"Access\" seems to fit best. \"Administrative rights\" could work if it's about permissions in Active Directory, but the focus on \"password reset\" aligns it more with Access. I'll output a JSON object with the category as \"Access\" like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
