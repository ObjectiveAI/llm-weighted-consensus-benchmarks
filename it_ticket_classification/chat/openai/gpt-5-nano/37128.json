The ticket mentions an \"oracle issue\" and problems with annual leave submission, which suggests it's related to HR. It could fit into \"HR Support,\" but might also be about \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are involved. Given the context, \"HR Support\" seems like the most fitting category.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions an \"Oracle issue\" and a \"consultant lead,\" suggesting it relates to accessing Oracle and submitting leave within the Oracle HR module. It could fit into either \"HR Support\" or \"Access,\" depending on whether it's about leave submission processes or permissions. Since it's primarily about HR processes, I'll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object to reflect this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This keeps it concise with no extra details unless requested."
