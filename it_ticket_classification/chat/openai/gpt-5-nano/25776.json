The user is referring to room reservations and related locations. It doesn't seem to relate to hardware, and while it could touch on administrative rights for access configuration, I think it leans more towards \"Miscellaneous\" or perhaps \"Internal Project.\" The goal is to find the right fit for their needs!**Deciding on category for IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering the categories for an IT ticket. \"Administrative rights\" seems focused on permissions, which might not fit here since the user is primarily asking about booking new rooms. \"Internal Project\" doesn't quite match either. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too broad. However, \"Access\" could relate to issues with the booking system. The request seems to be about adding resources to Outlook, so it might be best categorized under \"Administrative rights\" for permissions tied to room creation and configuration.**Clarifying the ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s request about \"adding new rooms\" for Outlook booking is a bit messy, but that seems to be the central theme. I'm trying to decide whether it fits better under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" While \"Internal Project\" refers to IT projects, this request feels more like operational support. \"Miscellaneous\" could be a safe option for ambiguous tasks, but \"Access\" also comes to mind since it involves booking and permissions related to calendar resources in Outlook Exchange. It's tricky!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering categorizing the user\u2019s request under \"Administrative rights\" since it involves tasks related to adding new resource mailboxes and configuring booking. Their \"please help\" implies they're looking for assistance with this. Based on my analysis, it makes sense to choose \"Administrative rights\" for the operation of scheduling resources that require admin permissions. I\u2019m ready to respond in a concise way, giving them the category formatted as a JSON-like object: \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} \n\nThis should meet their needs effectively!"
