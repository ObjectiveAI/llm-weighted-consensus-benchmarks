The terms like \"change level approver\" and \"make level approver codes\" suggest this is related to access and approvals. It\u2019s likely about modifying administrative roles. Since it concerns changing approver codes, \"Administrative rights\" seems to fit best, but \"Access\" could also work. I think I\u2019ll choose \"Administrative rights\" for clarity.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI\u2019m weighing my options for categorizing this ticket. \"Access\" is too general, while \"Administrative rights\" specifically covers changes to admin rights. Since the ticket requests changing level approver codes, it seems related to modifying access control rules. It fits best under \"Administrative rights.\" Following the instructions, I\u2019ll format my output as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I\u2019ll also keep in mind that asking clarifying questions could help if anything feels ambiguous, but for now, categorization is clear.**Providing JSON output**\n\nI just need to output the category based on the user's request. There\u2019s a subtle nuance in the phrase \"Friday change level approver,\" which might imply something about timing, but it\u2019s not essential for categorization. I\u2019ll focus purely on categorizing without adding any extra commentary. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and provide the JSON object as instructed: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. This way, I can stay on task and avoid unnecessary details!"
