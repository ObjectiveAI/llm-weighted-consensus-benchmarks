The ticket mentions phrases like \"project code oracle pm code\" and \"creating code available\" which could relate to project management and code creation. \n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Internal Project,\" since it focuses on a specific project. It could potentially fit under \"Access\" if it were about gaining access to a code repository, but the details aren\u2019t explicit. So, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit!**Parsing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm looking at the ticket: \"project code oracle pm code hi please help by creating code available thank officer.\" It seems like the user is asking for help with a project, possibly related to Oracle PM, which could indicate product management. Since creating code suggests it falls under the \"Internal Project\" category, I think that fits best. \n\nI\u2019ll structure my response in JSON format as required, like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. \"Internal Project\" is a valid choice, and I won't elaborate further unless asked.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
