The ticket text is a request for a new shared mailbox, asking for options to set it up and forward messages. It seems focused on creating this mailbox and linking it to specific users. I\u2019ll parse this information to determine the most fitting category for the ticket based on its content.**Analyzing Shared Mailbox Request**\n\nThe ticket seems to focus on creating a shared mailbox, as it mentions \"new shared mailbox request\" and various options for configuration. This suggests it falls under either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, since the primary goal is provisioning a new mailbox rather than granting access rights, it aligns more with the \"Access\" category, which covers mailbox permissions and control. While \"Administrative rights\" deals with privileges, the request is mainly about the mailbox itself.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket, and I think \"Access\" fits best since it deals with mailbox access and forwarding. \"Administrative rights\" could apply if creating the mailbox requires admin privileges, but the phrase \"new shared mailbox request\" suggests it's primarily about resource provisioning. Ultimately, it should focus on the concept of multiple users accessing that mailbox. The output will be a JSON object formatted as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra explanations are needed unless they're requested."
