It discusses updating absence records and mentions locations like Germany and Colombia. Given the content, the \"HR Support\" category seems most relevant, while \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could apply in limited contexts.**Deciding Ticket Category**\n\nAlright, I need to categorize this IT ticket as either \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" The ticket discusses visibility of \"annual leave days\" in an HR or leave system, pointing toward a bug affecting visibility. Since it's about HR processes related to time-off, \"HR Support\" seems to be the most appropriate category. The instruction clearly asks for a JSON output, so I'll provide the category in that format without extra details. Here it is: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
