The user mentions suggestions for additional microphones and notes problems with audio equipment. It seems clear that this primarily concerns hardware, so the ticket should be categorized as \"Hardware.\" I don't think \"Administrative rights\" fits here. I'll return a JSON response reflecting this category choice.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI see that the instruction requires me to respond in a specific category format. I need to create a JSON object with a field value for the category set to \"Hardware.\" I won't add any extra notes or summaries since the instruction strictly asks for just the JSON string. So, I\u2019ll produce the response as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s formatted correctly without any extra text. Let's go with that!"
