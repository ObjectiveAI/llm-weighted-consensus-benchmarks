It seems related to access permissions, as they discuss clearing up access for someone who left and ensuring reporting accuracy. This could fall under either Access or Administrative rights.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI believe the appropriate category for this IT ticket is \"Access.\" The ticket discusses removing a contractor's access and clearing up ownership codes, which suggests it's about user management and access control. There's mention of ensuring reports are accurate, possibly indicating timesheet gaps, but the primary focus seems to be on access provisioning and deprovisioning. While \"Administrative rights\" relates to permissions management, \"Access\" seems like the best fit here. I'll respond with the category in a JSON-like format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
