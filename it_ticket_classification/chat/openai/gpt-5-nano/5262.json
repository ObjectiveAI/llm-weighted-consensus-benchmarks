I'll look at the predefined categories: \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase\" are the two main ones that fit here. The user's wording suggests they're requesting help with a monitor, which could either mean needing support for hardware or initiating a purchase. I need to decide between these two categories based on context.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nI see that in IT ticket systems, the \"Purchase\" category often handles procurement requests. The user's phrase about providing an additional monitor hints at a procurement need, but it could also be a request for IT support. This leaves me with two potential categories: \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" Given that it's about an additional monitor, I think I\u2019ll lean towards \"Hardware\" since that's the most relevant. I'll format my final answer in the required JSON format."
