They mention things like \"approvals on leave\" and \"track approvals,\" which makes me think this is related to HR matters. Looking at the categories, it could either fall under \"HR Support\" since it's explicitly mentioned, or possibly \u201cAccess\u201d regarding system requests. However, since it\u2019s clearly about leave, it seems most appropriate to place it in the \"HR Support\" category.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI think we should categorize this ticket under \"HR Support\" since it's focused on approving leaves. The user's message mentions \"approvals on leave,\" which highlights its relevance to HR. There's also a possibility it could fall under \"Access\" if access to an approval system is needed. But with the strong emphasis on leave approvals in the text, HR Support feels like the correct choice. I\u2019ll format it as a JSON object with the category set to \"HR Support\" as required.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
