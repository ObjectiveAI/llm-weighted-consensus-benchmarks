There's mention of \"engineer pm,\" which leans toward project management, but \"Administrative rights\" or other categories like \"Purchase,\" \"Hardware,\" and \"HR Support\" don't seem relevant here. So, it's likely \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nIf the user asks to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" I need to select the appropriate category. Given the content mentions terms like \"build pull,\" \"marketplace,\" \"instance,\" and \"trigger,\" these relate to software deployment tasks and suggest it's an \"Internal Project.\" So, I\u2019ll create a JSON object with the category set as \"Internal Project\" in the required format. The output needs to be just the JSON object without any extra text to follow the guidelines. Here\u2019s what it looks like: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Delivering the JSON Output**\n\nThe tool seems set to parse the category, so I need to present it correctly. I\u2019ve determined that the appropriate category is \"Internal Project,\" and I'm ready to deliver this information. The final output will be in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This concise format should facilitate easy processing without any extra commentary. Now, let\u2019s go ahead and provide just that!"
