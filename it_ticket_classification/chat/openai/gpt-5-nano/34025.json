The text mentions \"rectify working submitted without completing\" and includes terms like \"administrator\" and \"ext think ctrl.\" I'm trying to figure out if it fits under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" It seems to hint at needing admin privileges. But it could also apply to \"Miscellaneous\" since there's some uncertainty. I'll choose carefully since categorization matters here!**Categorizing IT tickets in triage**\n\nIn the IT ticket triage process, typical categories include hardware, software, access, and storage, but here they're more specific: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The content of the ticket mentions \"please help rectify working\" and talks about \"administrator\" and \"ext think ctrl.\" This leads me to consider \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" I need to decide and format the category as a JSON-like object for proper documentation!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions a need to \"rectify working submitted without completing working,\" suggesting some kind of adjustment. This could relate to \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" However, the inclusion of \"administrator\" strongly points to \"Administrative rights,\" indicating a request for permissions to modify something. Since it hints at an \"admin rights extension,\" I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019m ready to format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}, with no extra text."
