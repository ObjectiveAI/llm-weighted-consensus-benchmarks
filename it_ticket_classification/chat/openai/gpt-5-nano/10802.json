Overall, I think the best category to choose is \"Hardware.\" Although it might be considered an \"Internal Project,\" it leans more towards basic IT support for hardware and peripherals. This seems straightforward, and I'm confident about my decision!**Responding with category**\n\nIt looks like \"Hardware\" is the best category for this ticket, even though \"Miscellaneous\" could be a possibility. I need to respond with a JSON object that includes the category field according to the provided schema. It seems straightforward since I should output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I want to make sure I don\u2019t include any extra information and stick strictly to the required format for clarity. So, I'll go ahead with that!"
