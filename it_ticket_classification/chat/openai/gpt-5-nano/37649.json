Category options include \u201cHardware,\u201d but that's not applicable here, and \u201cHR Support\u201d isn't relevant either. \u201cAccess\u201d might fit if there's an issue retrieving results, but it suggests logging a ticket for someone else to investigate. It seems like the best fit is the \u201cPurchase\u201d category since that's a specific option. I need to respond with a JSON object based on that categorization for the IT ticket.**Creating JSON output**\n\nI need to output the category as a JSON object, which is {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. The instructions say to respond only with the category, but sometimes it's good to include a brief explanation. However, I see it only specifies delivering the category for this IT ticket, and I've confirmed that \"Purchase\" is the exact term to use. I should ensure proper capitalization and avoid any extra text. So, I\u2019ll stick with just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
