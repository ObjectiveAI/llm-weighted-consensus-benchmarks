However, the user specifically asked about deletion and didn\u2019t mention permissions. It could also relate to \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s part of a project cleanup, but that\u2019s not clear. Since \u201cData Deletion\u201d or \u201cData Cleanup\u201d aren't options, \"Administrative rights\" seems the best fit. Otherwise, \"Miscellaneous\" could be a catch-all if needed.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nThe task is to create a JSON object with a \"category\" field. I can choose \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the user wants to delete notes or comments in ServiceNow, which is likely an administrative action, \"Administrative rights\" fits well. I'll structure the final response as a JSON object according to the schema, ensuring it has the necessary elements. However, I need to remember that it needs to follow the correct format exactly, keeping that JSON structure in mind.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
