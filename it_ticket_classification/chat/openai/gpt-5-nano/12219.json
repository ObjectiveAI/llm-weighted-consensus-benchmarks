The text is about decommissioning old servers and cables, mentioning a senior engineer's involvement. The relevant categories to consider are \"Hardware,\" \"Internal Project,\" or even \"Administrative Rights.\" However, since the primary focus is on decommissioning hardware, \"Hardware\" seems like the best fit. It makes sense, as decommissioning typically relates to hardware components. I'll go with \"Hardware\" as the category.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket based on their provided text. I need to create a JSON object with \"category\": \"Hardware\" since that's one of the allowed categories. The format needs to match the specified schema. The text talks about decommissioning old servers and cables, which clearly relates to hardware. So, I can confidently categorize this ticket as \"Hardware\" and output it as a JSON object, like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Finalizing JSON Format**\n\nI'm considering whether \"Internal Project\" could also work, since decommissioning is an activity. However, it seems more straightforward to go with \"Hardware.\" So, I\u2019ll stick with that and respond using the exact JSON format required:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI need to make sure there's no extra text, just the JSON object itself. This fits the schema that specifies the type and properties. So, I'll provide just that!"
