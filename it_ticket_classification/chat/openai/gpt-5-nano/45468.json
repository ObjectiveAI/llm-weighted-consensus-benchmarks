The ticket is concerning approving annual leave flow, which seems HR-related. Although \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility, \"HR Support\" looks more appropriate since it directly revolves around leave requests and approvals. The final output will be a JSON object with the category being \"HR Support,\" fitting this ticket context perfectly.**Finalizing Category Format**\n\nThe ticket is about \"approving annual leave wrong flow\" and \"action required approval annual leave absence request,\" pointing to an HR workflow issue. Since this is IT support for HR, the best category is \"HR Support.\" I realize I need to present this in a specific JSON format. The required format is simply to show the category without any outer envelope, resulting in: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I'll format it correctly and confirm my output without any extra text."
