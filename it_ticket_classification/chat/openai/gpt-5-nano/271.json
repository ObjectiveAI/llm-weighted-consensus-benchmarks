Since they mention \"access\" multiple times, it seems most appropriate to label this as \"Access.\" It could also touch on \"Administrative rights,\" but the primary focus really appears to be on gaining access to the meeting rooms. Therefore, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" since they're asking for permissions related to booking them.**Outputting category in JSON format**\n\nThe phrase \"access to meeting rooms\" definitely points to permission needed for booking or viewing in the calendar system. So, categorizing it as \"Access\" makes sense. I need to prepare a JSON-like object in the required format. Based on the user's request, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's important to stick to the specified format without adding extra commentary, as they simply asked for categorization. I'll keep it precise and straightforward!**Preparing JSON response**\n\nIt looks like the platform needs plain text, but it also requires a JSON object for the \"category\" wrapper. So, I\u2019ll respond with the formatted JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That seems straightforward enough! Just a simple response with no extra fuss. I'm making sure everything is clear and follows the guidelines!"
