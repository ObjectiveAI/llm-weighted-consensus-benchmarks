It seems to involve an \"open door alarm\" which could relate to either access control or hardware. Since it mentions both an event notification and door security, I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the most appropriate category, but it could also fit under hardware. I'll prioritize the access aspect for this ticket.**Selecting ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for this IT ticket. \"Access\" seems the most fitting because it relates to door access or control. However, if it's about door hardware or alarms, \"Hardware\" could also apply. The mention of \"event notification\" and \"open door alarm\" suggests it\u2019s an alert triggered by someone opening the door. Since the focus is on door access, I'll confidently select \"Access\" as the category, as it clearly aligns with the provided string.{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Access\"}}"
