The ticket could fit into \"Access\" if the submit button is the core concern or \"Administrative rights\" if admin access is needed. If the content isn\u2019t clear, \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option. Since it refers to an application issue but doesn't fit \"Software,\" I have to consider the most fitting category based on context clues.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m deciding how to categorize this IT ticket based on the user's description. The mention of a \"submit button\" suggests it's related to a UI issue in the Oracle application. It could fit into \"Access\" if it\u2019s a permissions problem, but without explicit permission issues, that's uncertain. \"Internal Project\" seems off since the user's issue doesn't appear to be related to development tasks. The safest option might be \"Miscellaneous,\" given the lack of clear fit in other categories. I will format my response in JSON as required.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI see that the required schema specifies that I should output a JSON object containing a \"category\" field. Given the user's mention of a \"submit button\" issue, I'm leaning toward categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous,\" since it doesn't fit \"Access\" due to a lack of approval issues. The \"Internal Project\" category feels inappropriate too, as the user's issue isn\u2019t a project-related task. So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}. That should align with the instructions!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
