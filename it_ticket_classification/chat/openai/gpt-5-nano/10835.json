I\u2019ll have to consider which category best fits the issue described to ensure an efficient response. Let's make sure I get this just right!**Categorizing IT ticket types**\n\nI\u2019m examining an end-user IT ticket that may relate to \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" or possibly \"Access.\" The user discusses items like \"career management,\" \"organization chart,\" and modifications to views. It seems they're asking for changes to the UI or functionality of an internal directory or HR system. If it\u2019s about developing features for the organization chart, I might categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" Yet, if it\u2019s too general, \"Miscellaneous\" might fit better. Let's choose wisely!**Categorizing product requests**\n\nThis seems to be about an IT ticket requesting a product feature and a UI improvement. The user mentions elements like \"career management,\" \"organization chart,\" and \"directory.\" It\u2019s likely tied to an \"Internal Project,\" as they want to modify internal software rather than address hardware or access issues. While they mention administrative rights, there\u2019s no explicit request for rights escalation. Therefore, I think I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and format my response in JSON as needed. Let's make sure to get that right!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
