The mention of \"oracle approval issues\" and \"approval only blank opens\" suggests it may relate to either \"Access\" or \"Purchase.\" Since Oracle approvals are often associated with access processes or purchase orders, I'll likely assign it to one of those categories. It seems \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" would fit best for approval-related inquiries.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nThe phrase \"for items below approval only blank opens\" is unclear, but it hints at approval issues potentially sent on Friday. The issue mentioned could relate to \"Oracle approval issues,\" which might fit under \"Access\" if it's about permissions or \"Purchase\" if it's linked to purchase approvals. While \"Administrative rights\" is an option, it seems less relevant since this ticket is focused on approval issues. Hence, \"Access\" appears to be the best category to choose.**Finalizing ticket response**\n\nThe ticket relates to Oracle's approval process, specifically access and permissions issues that prevent items from opening due to approval constraints. I need to categorize it as \"Access.\" While I could gather more details like affected users and error messages, the user seems to just want the category. Following the prompt's format, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object structured correctly like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll keep it clear and concise, no extra text."
