It seems to focus on access rights and process ownership, which suggests it might fit best into the \"Access\" category. However, if the ticket is more about permissions and ownership, then \"Administrative rights\" could also be a good fit.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT ticket, which is focused on access to videos and location sharing. \"Access\" seems appropriate, but \"Internal Project\" might also fit because it's about an initiative and process framework. The ticket mostly discusses ownership and governance rather than hardware or storage. However, there are mentions of video access and visibility. Given that the main focus is governance and collaboration with product owners, I lean towards categorizing it as \"Internal Project.\"**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe request is centered around an internal project, so categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" seems logical. There are mentions of video access and permissions, which could suggest the \"Access\" category, but most of the content leans toward governance. Since the user likely expects one category, I\u2019ll choose \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll prepare the output as a JSON object that specifies the category correctly: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Keeping it straightforward!"
