It seems related to HR, so it could fit under \"HR Support,\" \"Internal Project,\" or even \"Administrative rights\" if it involves access requests. The ticket text is a bit jumbled, but since it references internship details, it's likely HR-related. I'll go with \"HR Support\" as my best guess, but I\u2019m open to other interpretations.**Categorizing IT tickets again**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket that discusses an \"internship program\" and \"coaches.\" Since there\u2019s no separate HR category, \"HR Support\" is the only option. The text is a bit jumbled, mentioning internship names and addresses, which makes me think it might be about creating a list, possibly indicating an \"Internal Project.\" There\u2019s also a chance it relates to \"Administrative rights\" if they need access for creating something. Asking for clarification might be the best move!**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nMy best guess is to categorize this as an \"Internal Project\" since it pertains to an internal internship program. While the content fits more under HR/business than IT, I don\u2019t have too many options. Another possible category could be \"Administrative rights\" if they need access for the internship, but it feels less relevant. I\u2019ll provide a concise response in the correct JSON format with \"category\": \"Internal Project,\" and I could offer to reclassify if needed.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
