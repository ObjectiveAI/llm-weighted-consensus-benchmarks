The first step is to read the ticket content carefully to understand its context and purpose. Once I analyze the information, I can decide which category best fits it. I want to ensure that the classification is accurate for effective processing.**Reviewing annual leave requests**\n\nIt looks like I\u2019m dealing with a long message about annual leave approvals. There are mentions of reviewing leave requests, having to accept or decline options, and some additional details about the number of days allowed versus days taken. The message also talks about ensuring requests are processed properly, updating the database, and including comments if needed. I just want to make sure I understand all the information about the annual leave policy clearly to help with the approval process!**Categorizing HR tickets**\n\nThis seems to be an HR-related issue about approving annual leave requests. I'm considering the category options and leaning towards \"HR Support\" since it fits the context best. The system requires a specific JSON format for the output, and the instruction is clear: I need to categorize this IT ticket. So, I\u2019ll create a JSON object with the category labeled as \"HR Support\" and ensure it\u2019s concise with no extra commentary. Here we go: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
