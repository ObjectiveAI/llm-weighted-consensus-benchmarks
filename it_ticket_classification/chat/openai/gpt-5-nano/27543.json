Since the ticket primarily focuses on hardware installation, I\u2019m thinking the best category might be \"Hardware.\" However, it also has a strong purchasing aspect, so \"Purchase\" is relevant too. Usually, I should prioritize the primary category, which seems to be \"Hardware\" in this case.**Classifying IT tickets**\n\nIn classifying an IT ticket that talks about installing new hardware, I should primarily categorize it as \"Hardware.\" There are mentions of \"purchase po,\" \"receipts,\" and \"items ordered,\" which suggest a purchasing context, but the main focus is clearly on the installation. I know I need to output this in JSON format based on the required category schema. Since the ticket\u2019s main action is the hardware installation, I\u2019ll settle on categorizing it as \"Hardware.\"{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
