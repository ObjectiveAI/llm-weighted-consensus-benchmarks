While \"Administrative rights\" seems off, \"HR Support\" fits since it's about overtime reports. \"Internal Project\" could be considered, but \"HR Support\" may be the most straightforward choice since it relates to employee data.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nThe user is asking for IT ticket categorization, and \"HR Support\" does seem fitting because it involves human resources data. However, since they want me to select a single category, \"Administrative rights\" doesn't quite fit and \"Access\" is also not accurate. They mention duplicates and name changes, indicating a data issue. I think \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could work, but given that it's about overtime and employee records, \"HR Support\" is the closest match. I'll provide the category in JSON format as required.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
