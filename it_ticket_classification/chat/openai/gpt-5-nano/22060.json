The options from the JSON schema are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The user's message is quite garbled but mentions things like \"pre-approved Friday PM change\" and \"change control.\" It seems related to change management, so I might categorize it as \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" It's tricky since there's no exact match.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI have several categories to work with: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The user\u2019s message is confusing, but it hints at a change process that might fit into \"Internal Project\" or be a catch-all like \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Change control\" isn't a category option. Mentioning \"wrong sn\" suggests it relates to asset management. Overall, it could pertain to change management or asset management, but it's tricky finding an exact fit.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI need to decide which category fits best for the IT ticket. Access and Administrative rights don't seem right, and \"Hardware\" isn't applicable. \"Internal Project\" seems plausible for a change request within an IT project. I could also consider \"Miscellaneous\" for a general category. Since the prompt requires me to categorize it, I think I\u2019ll output a JSON-like object with the category value, specifically: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} to match the schema requirements. That feels right!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
