The options are limited, but it seems to be primarily about network connectivity issues. I should classify it under \"Access\" as that typically covers login issues and network access. While it could also fit under \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access\" seems more appropriate since it directly pertains to connectivity. There's no mention of hardware malfunction, so it's not really a \"Hardware\" issue.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ve ruled out categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"HR Support.\" It seems the best fit is \"Access,\" especially since it's about network connectivity and permissions. Alternatively, \"Miscellaneous\" could work but isn't as specific. The user asked for a category for the IT ticket, so I'll respond with a JSON object formatted like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll keep it simple and clear to avoid any misunderstandings\u2014no extra text needed!"
