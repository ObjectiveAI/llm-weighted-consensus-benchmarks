It's about a RAM upgrade for developers, as they often run out of memory when running multiple projects. The message is a bit garbled, but I can tell it's requesting a hardware upgrade. Among the categories available, the best fit is \"Hardware\" since RAM upgrades fall under that. It\u2019s clear the user's looking to enhance their engineers' capabilities.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT ticket about a RAM upgrade. The user possibly implies a purchase, but they explicitly listed \"Purchase\" among the categories. However, since this is primarily about upgrading RAM, \"Hardware\" seems more fitting, as it's a broader categorization. The JSON response format needs to reflect that. The final response will be: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. It definitely confirms the focus is on hardware, so that\u2019s the way to go!**Finalizing response format**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I should respond with just the category in the specified JSON format without any extra explanation. It makes sense to keep it simple and straightforward. So, to be safe and effective, I'll go ahead and produce the final response as just the JSON. This way, it\u2019s concise and directly addresses the request without any unnecessary fluff. I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s ready to go!"
