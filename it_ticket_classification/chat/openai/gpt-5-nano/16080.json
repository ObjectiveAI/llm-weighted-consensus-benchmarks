The key terms relate to a \"cleaning process,\" various boards, and user administration. Since the content is focused on project management aspects\u2014like adding users, deleting boards, and standardizing performance\u2014I\u2019m leaning toward the \"Internal Project\" category. It seems to fit best given the context about organizing and managing processes related to software or project management.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to find the best category for this ticket. It mentions \"administer add users\" which seems to fit well with \"Administrative rights.\" But there\u2019s also the \"Access\" category, which could apply since it deals with permissions too. The ticket discusses a variety of project management issues like user performance and board management. I think \"Administrative rights\" is most appropriate because it emphasizes user management tasks. Ultimately, it seems to align best with handling permissions and administrative tasks.**Choosing the IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe list includes \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights\" is a sub-type under that. It seems that \"Administrative rights\" is more suited for requests like granting admin privileges. The ticket discusses user management, board actions, and next steps, which feels like it relates to something like Jira boards. Since the user requested categorization, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object. I believe the best fit is \"Administrative rights\" based on the context of managing users and permissions. \n\nSo, my response will be: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
