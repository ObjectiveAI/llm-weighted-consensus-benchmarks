The categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Given the mention of project management tasks, it appears to fit best under \"Internal Project.\" However, there\u2019s also a slight chance it could be viewed as \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Administrative Rights\" doesn't seem to apply here.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s ticket mentions phrases like \"assign queue,\" \"log under name,\" and \"engineer Friday,\" which relate to cloud project management and administrative tasks. The best fit seems to be \"Internal Project,\" as it involves managing project resources, particularly with \"decommission instances.\" While I considered \"Administrative Rights,\" it wasn't clear if those were needed. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too generic, so I conclude that \"Internal Project\" best encapsulates this ticket's intent. I'll provide the category in the specified JSON format.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
