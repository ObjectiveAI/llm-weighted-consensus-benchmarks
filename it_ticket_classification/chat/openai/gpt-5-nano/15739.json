It mentions deleting a core folder and updating a sector, along with accessibility issues regarding a chart. Terms like \"chart displayed visitors\" and \"admin rights\" point towards the Access category. I think that makes the most sense as the content focuses on visibility and permissions rather than hardware or other categories.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe mention of deleting a core folder indicates file deletion, which could align with the \"Administrative rights\" category since this request requires permission to perform such an action. However, it also touches on the visibility of a chart, making \"Access\" a contender as well. Since both categories are distinct, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Administrative rights\" because deleting a core folder is an administrative task, but the visibility aspect might suggest including \"Access\" in the mix too.**Parsing IT ticket request**\n\nThe message seems a bit garbled, but it indicates a request to delete a core folder under a sector while also asking about chart visibility. Given the focus on deleting the core folder, I think the best category is \"Administrative rights,\" as this task requires system administration and admin privileges. However, I can see how \"Access\" could fit too since it's related to the visibility of a sector chart for visitors versus personal profiles. But the main action is definitely about the deletion.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
