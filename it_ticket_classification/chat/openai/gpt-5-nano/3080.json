It\u2019s likely about \"Purchase\" since it's focused on requisition approvals. \"Access\" could fit if it were about granting access via licenses, but it leans more toward \"Purchase\" based on the context given.**Finalizing the category selection**\n\nI\u2019ve determined that the ticket doesn\u2019t fit categories like Hardware, HR, Internal Project, or Administrative Rights. \"Purchase\" seems like the best choice since it's about license approvals. I need to respond with a JSON object that matches the required format for categorization. The schema specifies an object type with a category property. Therefore, my final answer will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Let\u2019s ensure it follows the specified structure exactly as outlined!**Finalizing the response**\n\nIn previous tasks, I noticed the system expects a straightforward response: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It\u2019s important to keep it simple and only include that. So, I'm going to respond directly with that JSON object, ensuring it meets the requirements without any extra information. Succinctness is key here, so my answer will clearly be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Let\u2019s keep it neat and concise!"
