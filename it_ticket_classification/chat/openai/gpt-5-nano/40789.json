I need to pick the category that best fits!**Categorizing document upload request**\n\nThe user's request seems to center around the \"document upload\" feature and they're looking for help today. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Storage\" for documents or \"Miscellaneous\" for general IT issues. If they need permissions, \"Administrative Rights\" could also apply, but they didn't specifically mention access. Since the core problem seems to be document uploads, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Storage\" since that typically covers file storage and upload issues. I\u2019ll finalize it as \"Storage.\""
