The mention of \"input leave\" might imply it\u2019s about entering leave in a system, suggesting the \"HR Support\" category may fit well. However, \"Access\" could also apply if it relates to system access issues. Overall, it looks like HR Support is the best match.**Selecting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket. It mentions annual leave scheduling and notifications, which leads me to think \"HR Support\" is the right fit. However, if there's an issue with inputting leave due to permissions, \"Administrative rights\" could potentially apply too. But since it's primarily about leave, I think I\u2019ll stick with \"HR Support.\" I need to make sure to format it as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
