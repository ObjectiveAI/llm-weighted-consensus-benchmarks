However, given the mention of a developer, it could also relate to an \"Internal Project.\" It\u2019s a bit unclear, but I\u2019ll lean toward \"Miscellaneous\" for now since it serves as a catch-all.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to output a JSON-like category object based on the provided text, which appears to be a messy email containing \"dangerous received\" multiple times. The phrases suggest it might pertain to an attachment or investigation request. However, I\u2019m uncertain whether it relates to \"Administrative rights\" or something else. Since the content doesn\u2019t neatly fit the other categories, I think \"Miscellaneous\" would be the best choice for now. It seems to cover various possibilities!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
