It might fit under \"Administrative rights\" if assignment requires access permissions, but could also be \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Ultimately, it\u2019s about configuration and customizing filter columns, so I'll lean towards \"Administrative rights.\"**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this ticket about a project board configuration. It could potentially fit as \"Internal Project,\" but the categories feel somewhat generic. I might choose \"Administrative rights\" if the user needs permissions to configure the board since they mention \"please assign.\" This could mean assigning the issue or a user, possibly indicating access rights. Given the context, \"Administrative rights\" seems to be the best fit since configuring and setting filter columns likely requires admin privileges.**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI'm considering whether to categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project,\" but since the user didn't mention a specific project, I\u2019ll go with \"Administrative rights.\" I need to respond in a structured way that aligns with the prompt, which states to categorize the IT ticket. Following the instruction, I'll output a JSON-like format for the category: \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} \n\nThat seems straightforward!"
