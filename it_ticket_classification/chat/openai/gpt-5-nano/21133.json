The ticket is requesting to add a team member to a project and set up their absence schedule. It seems to fit the \"Access\" category, as it involves granting permissions to the project and calendar. It might also fall under \"Administrative rights,\" since that\u2019s related to granting access. Overall, the best category choice here appears to be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nIn categorizing the IT ticket, I'm considering that adding someone to a project typically involves provisioning access. \"Access\" is a more general term than \"Administrative rights.\" Since the request includes adding to a project and possibly sharing a calendar, I think \"Access\" fits best. It could also fall under \"Internal Project,\" but we need to pick one category. Following the set structure, I\u2019ll need to respond with a JSON object containing the category. The options are \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
