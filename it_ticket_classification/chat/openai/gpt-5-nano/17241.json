The Romanian part might be asking if they can come in summer. I think the ticket should fall under \"Hardware\" for the monitor risers, or possibly \"Purchase\" if they're requesting to buy them.**Determining the IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize an IT ticket. Given that \"monitor risers\" is mentioned, I think \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category. The user asked me to categorize the ticket and specified the required format as a JSON object with a single category field. So, I\u2019ll produce the output as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, since that aligns with the requirements without any extra text. I'll make sure to stick to the allowed categories listed in the prompt!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}  \nI think it's best to stick with \"Hardware\" as the category since the primary focus is on monitor risers. We could consider \"Purchase\" if they intended to buy them, but my understanding leans more towards a request for fixing them instead. The mention of \"friday pm\" suggests scheduling but doesn't affect the category choice. So, I\u2019ll keep it simple and respond with just \"Hardware\" to stay within the requirements!"
