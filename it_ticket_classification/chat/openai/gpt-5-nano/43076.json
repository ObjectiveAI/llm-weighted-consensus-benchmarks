The mention of \"high importance\" and requesting a check suggests urgency. Given this context, I believe \"Hardware\" is the most suitable category since it's likely about VoIP phones in the meeting rooms. The output should be in JSON format with the appropriate category field.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to respond with a JSON object containing the relevant category. Based on the options, \u201cHardware\u201d seems to be the most fitting choice. The schema specifies that I should include just the category within an object format. So, I'll focus on keeping it concise without any extra commentary and provide the response as:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
