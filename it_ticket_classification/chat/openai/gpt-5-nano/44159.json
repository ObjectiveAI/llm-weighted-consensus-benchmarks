They specifically mention wanting to disable a badge that\u2019s currently assigned. This clearly relates to access control, so the best category is \"Access.\" It's not about \"Administrative rights\" unless there's a need for elevated permissions, but it seems straightforward. I should respond with just that category, keeping things simple and focused.**Structuring IT ticket response**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket according to the instructions provided. It looks like the response should be a JSON object with a specific format. The allowed categories are defined, so I\u2019ll respond with something like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nAlthough I considered adding a brief justification, the instruction clearly states to output just the category object. So, I should stick to the requirement and produce only the JSON object without any extra text."
