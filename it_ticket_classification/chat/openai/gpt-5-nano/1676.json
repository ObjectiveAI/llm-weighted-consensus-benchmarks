It looks like it's about an offboarding process for someone in Glasgow, with mentions of things like mailbox access, AD rights, and mobile phone subscriptions. Since it's mainly about revoking access, I think the best category is \"Access.\" There are also references to \"Administrative rights\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Access\" seems most fitting based on the context of offboarding.**Deciding the ticket category**\n\nI see that the ticket also mentions \"hardware owned by leaver,\" which could fit under the \"Hardware\" category for decommissioning. However, since the main focus is on access rights and de-provisioning, \"Access\" seems to be the best fit. The category \"Administrative rights\" is likely for specific admin roles, but it's quite broad. Based on the offboarding context, I\u2019ll output the required JSON object as follows:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nNow I'm ensuring it matches the requested format exactly!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
