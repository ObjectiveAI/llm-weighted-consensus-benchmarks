The user's issue seems to relate to an Oracle problem where they can't open task lists, leading to empty pages popping up. So, it might fit into \"Access\" but could also lean towards \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" since it involves task assignments. If it's about permissions, \"Administrative rights\" could apply too. I\u2019ll have to consider which category best fits their situation!**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI'm trying to find the best category for this IT ticket. It seems to relate to an application issue rather than hardware or storage. It could fit into \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the user mentions problems accessing tasks, \"Access\" might work if it relates to permissions. However, if it's about not being able to open assigned tasks, that could require \"Administrative rights.\" Considering all this, I'll lean towards \"Miscellaneous\" while keeping \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" in mind as well!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user is asking to fix some problems related to an Oracle issue. If I had to categorize, \"Internal Project\" could work, but it's more of a general IT ticket, so \"Miscellaneous\" might be a safe choice. However, \"Access\" seems relevant too since they're unable to open certain details. The mention of tasks that should be assigned hints at access issues as well. Overall, I think \"Access\" is the best fit for this ticket! I'll respond with the appropriate category in the required format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
