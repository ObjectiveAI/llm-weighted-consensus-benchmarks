It includes terms like \"enrollment,\" \"discounts,\" and \"upcoming batch information.\" So, it doesn\u2019t really fit hardware or access. \"HR Support\" could potentially relate to human resources. This needs sorting!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like the ticket includes phrases like \"human resources finances required,\" \"risks,\" and \"view more benefits,\" but it primarily discusses a training program in Macedonia, mentioning aspects like \"best price,\" \"largest certification training offer,\" and \"enrollment.\" \n\nIt doesn't touch on IT access or systems, making it seem best suited for the \"Purchase\" category since it relates to enrollment, pricing, and discounts. \"Internal Project\" could also apply, but it\u2019s likely a purchase. So, I'll prepare a JSON response with the category \"Purchase.\"{\"category\": \"Purchase\"}"
