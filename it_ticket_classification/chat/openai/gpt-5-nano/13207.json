I\u2019m wondering if \"PM starter form\" refers to project management, but I\u2019ll stick with the closest categories.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI think the best category for this IT ticket is \"Hardware,\" since it mainly concerns \"new starter hardware.\" However, the mention of a \"starter form\" makes me consider \"HR Support,\" as onboarding forms are typically associated with HR.\n\nStill, the primary request is for hardware. Although filling out the form is an action item, the main focus is on the new equipment. So, my final categorization will be \"Hardware,\" with a JSON-like object to represent this.**Formatting the category output**\n\nI need to provide the output in a specific format, which is a JSON object. The required structure has \"category\" as a property that can take specific enum values like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" etc.\n\nEven though the instructions mentioned just giving a category string, I think it's clear that I should return the format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This aligns with the schema and ensures that I\u2019m following the guidelines properly while being concise. So, the clean final answer will be this JSON object reflecting the category.**Finalizing the category choice**\n\nI need to make a decision about the category for the IT ticket. While \"HR Support\" is a possibility due to the onboarding aspect of the starter form, the phrase \"new starter hardware\" is very clear. Since the user specifically asked to categorize this ticket, I think \"Hardware\" is the most fitting choice.\n\nAlthough there could be multiple categories, the format only supports one. So, I\u2019ll proceed with \"Hardware\" as the final selection."
