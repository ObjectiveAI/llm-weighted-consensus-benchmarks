The user's request mentions \u201cOracle days\u201d and a \u201cdelete feature,\u201d which is unclear. However, it seems focused on deleting something\u2014maybe data deletion in an Oracle database. If it relates to permissions for deletion, \"Administrative Rights\" could fit. But if it\u2019s about the deletion feature itself, then \"Storage\" might be the right choice.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to categorize the IT ticket based on the user's request. The phrase \u201ccannot control over days delete feature\u201d suggests they may need \"Administrative Rights\" to manage the delete feature. If it's an unusual request, I might lean toward \"Miscellaneous.\" However, if this relates to the development of a new feature, it could be \"Internal Project.\" The mention of \"delete feature going available\" implies it might fit under \"Storage.\" I'm really trying to find the best match!**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user's message is a bit jumbled, but they seem to ask about \"Oracle days\" and a \"delete feature.\" I need to categorize this IT ticket in JSON format, based on provided categories. Since they\u2019re requesting a delete feature to be available soon, it sounds like a feature development request, which would fit under \"Internal Project.\" Alternatively, if it doesn't fit any category well, I could consider \"Miscellaneous.\" However, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best choice here.**Outputting Category**\n\nThe user wants us to categorize something, and I should provide only the category in the specified format. So, I\u2019ll generate a JSON object that looks like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It's important to ensure I'm formatting this exactly as required, using the category field with a string value from the allowed options. I\u2019m getting it all ready to answer correctly!"
