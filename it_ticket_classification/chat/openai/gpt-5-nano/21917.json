I need to decide which category fits best, focusing on the aspect of approval workflow mentioned in the ticket.**Deciding on category**\n\nI\u2019m debating the best category for the ticket. It could fall under \"Administrative rights\" if it's about changing admin privileges, or \"Access\" for general access. The mention of \"approver change\" usually relates to access control in project management. \"Internal Project\" might fit too since it's about project-specific access. However, given the focus on changing approvers in an Oracle system, I think \"Access\" is right. But on reconsideration, \"Administrative rights\" feels more accurate as it pertains to privileges and approvals. It's a bit tricky right now!**Choosing the right category**\n\nThis ticket involves changing an approver, which relates to permissions, typically categorized as \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" Given the user's reference to \"pm approver change,\" it suggests a change in who can approve project manager actions. Since this fits under permissions, I lean towards \"Administrative rights,\" which directly addresses privileges. I\u2019ll format the response as requested, returning exactly: `{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}`. This keeps it clear and concise!"
