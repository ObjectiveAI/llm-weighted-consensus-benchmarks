The user has asked me to categorize the ticket, which means I\u2019ll need to look through the ticket description to identify which category it fits into best. Once I\u2019ve determined the appropriate category, I'll output the information in JSON format.**Parsing ticket content**\n\nLet's break down this ticket content\u2014I see it revolves around the \"update metrics\" module and has a lot of repetition in phrases like \"assigned\" and various statuses such as \"done,\" \"resolved,\" and \"unresolved.\" The message is pretty cluttered, mentioning issues with moving tasks between statuses and some specific requests for actions and fixes. I\u2019ll need to pick through this messy text to identify key points and better understand what action needs to be taken.**Categorizing ticket issue**\n\nThe ticket discusses aspects like \"move statuses,\" \"tickets,\" and \"visual issues,\" indicating it's related to an issue tracking workflow\u2014possibly focused on administrative or project management aspects. I'm considering categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Internal Project\" feels more fitting since it relates to the \"update metrics\" module and internal tools. The content doesn't quite match hardware, HR, access, storage, or purchase categories, making \"Miscellaneous\" another option but less likely than \"Internal Project.\"**Finalizing category selection**\n\nSince the ticket isn't about granting \"Administrative rights,\" I\u2019m settling on \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category. I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format, making sure to use the correct capitalization for \"Internal Project.\" The output needs to be straightforward and concise, just as the guidelines specify. I\u2019ll structure the response as a JSON object with the category field, which should look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. No extra text\u2014just that JSON!"
