They mentioned uploading an attached file and mapping it to relevant fields, which sounds like it relates to managing surveys and roles. There are also phrases about delivering workshops and client services, which might not fit neatly into a specific category. It seems like \"Administrative rights\" could work best, considering the context involves managing and updating workflows and surveys.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket is likely related to data mapping, surveys, and internal projects. Possible categories include \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" The mention of uploading and mapping fields suggests it is not about hardware, storage, or purchases. Since it involves processing tasks related to a survey, the \"Internal Project\" category seems the most appropriate. I can respond with a JSON category object, as the request is specifically asking for a categorized output.{\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}"
