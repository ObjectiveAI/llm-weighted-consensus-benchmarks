However, since it also mentions \"administrative rights,\" it could potentially fit there too.\n\nAfter reviewing the definitions, it seems most appropriate to categorize it as \"Access\" since it primarily concerns user access management.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nThe ticket concerns cleaning up new members in Active Directory (AD) and syncing, which involves managing access by adding members and updating their statuses. It could fit under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, since it focuses on provisioning new members rather than granting admin rights, it seems more fitting to categorize it as \"Access.\" The emphasis is on managing AD membership rather than specifically granting administrative privileges. So, I will categorize it as \"Access.\"**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, so I need to output a JSON object with the appropriate category. Based on the earlier analysis, it fits best under \"Access.\" \n\nI\u2019ll ensure that I follow the required format stated in the system message, which specifies the enum values and proper casing. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll be providing this response:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI\u2019ll keep it straightforward, as the instruction says it only needs to be the category."
