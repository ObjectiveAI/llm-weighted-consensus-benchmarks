It mentions that ports have lost their custom settings and difficulties with devices connected to them. \n\nGiven the options, it seems that the most fitting category is likely \"Hardware,\" as the ticket mostly discusses physical ports and their functionality. I need to clarify that it focuses on hardware issues.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm sorting through an IT ticket that mentions using ports for builds and problems with devices connected to them. It has some unclear phrasing, like \"default ports floor receive guest.\" \n\nI think the issues relate to hardware or possibly network access. Since \"receive guest\" implies access control, it might fit in the \"Access\" category, especially if they need help configuring network settings for guest devices. However, \"Hardware\" could work too, as it pertains to physical ports. \n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"Access.\"**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm reviewing the categories for an IT ticket regarding physical ports. It seems that the ticket mainly involves login, permissions, and network access for devices connected through those ports. \n\nWhile \"Access\" could fit due to network control, \"Hardware\" feels more appropriate since it's focused on physical ports and their configurations. Other categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" don\u2019t apply here. \n\nGiven everything, I think it makes sense to categorize this ticket as \"Hardware.\"**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI'm considering whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Access\" or \"Hardware.\" The mention of \"issues regarding access\" and the \"guest\" network indicates it might relate to network access. However, the text also references \"local support ports\" and losing customization, which suggests physical port problems. \n\nSince the user simply wants a category, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" to cover those physical networking issues. Now I\u2019ll provide the response in JSON format:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
