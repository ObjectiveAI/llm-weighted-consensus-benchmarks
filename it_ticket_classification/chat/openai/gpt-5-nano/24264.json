It highlights storage and possibly access issues since it mentions needing to download from somewhere unusual. My best guess for the primary category is \"Storage,\" and \"Access\" might apply as well. \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant due to the installation aspect.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking to fit a request into a category. The user is asking for installation instructions for a package on Macs and where a pro package is stored outside the usual locations. It doesn't fit neatly into hardware, HR, or purchase categories, so I lean toward \"Miscellaneous.\" However, \"Storage\" feels like the best match because of the storage inquiry. I think I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Storage\" and finalize the answer as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I\u2019m also wondering if \"Internal Project\" is relevant since it involves a project.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user provided a request regarding a \"project pro\" storage location and installation instructions for a package on Macs. It seems to involve inquiries about where the pro package is stored and how to download distributed storage. Because of this context, I think the \"Storage\" category is the best fit. Since the instructions specify that I should produce a JSON object, I\u2019ll format the answer as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. It\u2019s essential to follow the prescribed schema for categories.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
