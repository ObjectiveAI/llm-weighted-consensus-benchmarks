The ticket text mentions \"leave code,\" \"insert records,\" and \"provide code,\" which suggests it's likely related to HR leave codes. It seems messy but seems to imply some database operations. The mention of \"senior tester\" at the end might just be a signature. Overall, the focus appears to be on leave-related queries, specifically with codes and records.**Deciding Ticket Category**\n\nI need to find the best category for this ticket. It seems to fit \"Internal Project,\" especially if it relates to a code module for leave management. Although \"HR Support\" isn't one of the given options, \"Administrative rights\" might be relevant if permissions are needed. Since the ticket involves programming tasks such as \"leave code\" and database operations, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" Finally, I\u2019ll create a JSON object to represent this category clearly as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
