Given that it's likely an issue with network access or permissions, I think the best fit is the \"Access\" category. It might also touch on \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Access\" seems more appropriate based on the content.**Outputting category as JSON**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object based on the category schema, which requires a specific format including a \"category\" key. The ticket clearly falls under \"Access,\" so I should output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. \n\nIt's essential to ensure that the final output matches the required format exactly. Even though they might want a simple string sometimes, the schema requires the full object. So yes, I\u2019ll provide only the JSON response with \"Access.\""
