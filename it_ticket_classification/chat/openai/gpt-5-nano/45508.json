The mention of \"cable work\" and \"help\" strongly points to a hardware issue. So, it makes sense to select \"Hardware\" from the allowed categories, as it's the most fitting. Although \"Miscellaneous\" could also apply if it were unclear, the specifics in this case clearly suggest that hardware is the best choice. Administrative rights, access, or storage aren't relevant here.**Formatting the category response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object for the category based on the schema provided. The prompt indicates I should categorize this IT ticket, specifically outputting \"category\": \"Hardware.\" I'll ensure proper capitalization as \"Hardware\" is the exact allowed value. It\u2019s essential to present it correctly as a JSON object with the right formatting. Therefore, the final output will be: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. I'll include a space after the colon, according to the schema example.**Finalizing the JSON output**\n\nI need to decide between two formats for the JSON output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} or {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. The instruction indicates I should closely follow the schema, but I realize the schema snippet is just a reference. The essential output is simply a JSON object with the category string. To be on the safe side, I'll go with the format that includes a space: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. Now, I'll deliver this formatted output!"
