I need to choose one, but I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" since it involves users adding content and permissions. However, since it involves training and setup, it could also fit under \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket is about setting up Confluence and user permissions.**Selecting a category for Confluence**\n\nI'm trying to narrow down the appropriate category for this ticket about Confluence. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too broad, so I'm leaning towards \"Administrative rights,\" which relates directly to permissions and administration tasks. The ticket asks about setting up Confluence, user permissions, adding content, and refresher training. While \"Internal Project\" could fit if it\u2019s for a specific initiative, \"Administrative rights\" best aligns with the focus on permissions and settings. So, I'll categorize it as \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to respond in a specific JSON format for categorization. The requirement is to create an object that includes a \"category\" string from the allowed enums. After considering the content, I\u2019ve decided to categorize it as \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nSo my response will be concise: just the JSON object itself without including the full schema. I\u2019ll finalize it as: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. This keeps it clear and to the point!"
