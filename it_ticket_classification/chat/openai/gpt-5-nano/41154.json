The ticket mentions a tape inventory failure and an empty slot in the library. Given the context, it seems to relate to either \"Storage\" or \"Hardware.\" I'll lean toward categorizing it as \"Storage\" due to the focus on tape library operations and inventory concerns.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nIn classifying the IT ticket, it clearly relates to hardware storage with terms like \"tape library,\" \"tape inventory,\" and \"drive.\" Given that it discusses storage systems, it seems appropriate to categorize it as \"Storage.\" To comply with the format requirement, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON response containing the category field as instructed. While \"Hardware\" could also fit if focused on the equipment issues, \"Storage\" feels more aligned given the context about inventory and empty slots. I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
