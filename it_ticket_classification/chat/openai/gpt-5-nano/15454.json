Since the categories list includes \"Access,\" which fits the content about managing access for these leavers, I think \"Access\" is the appropriate category for this ticket. Let's go with that!**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nThe user mentions phrases like \"please log,\" \"attached recent requests,\" and \"leavers,\" which feels a bit muddled. Still, the appropriate category seems to be \"Access.\" It could also relate to \"Administrative rights,\" but that\u2019s not necessary here. Since it's about Oracle changes involving offboarding and access revocation, I'll confirm that \"Access\" is correct. I need to respond with a JSON object formatted correctly, so it\u2019ll be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's stick to that!**Finalizing IT ticket response**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether this ticket could fall under \"Administrative rights,\" but it seems more focused on revoking access for leavers. So, settling on \"Access\" feels best. I\u2019ll just respond with the JSON object reflecting that. It\u2019s straightforward: no extra details are needed. Let\u2019s craft the final response accordingly!"
