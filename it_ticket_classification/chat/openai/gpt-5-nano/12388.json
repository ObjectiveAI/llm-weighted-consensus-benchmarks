The ticket content is filled with technical terms: timestamps, VPN, crypto policies, pre-shared keys, and more. It appears to involve setting up client details and managing VPN connections, which falls under network admin tasks. This complexity suggests it might best fit into the \"Access\" category, since it\u2019s related to establishing secure connections.**Determining Category for Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out the best category for the IT ticket, considering options like Access or Internal Project. The ticket discusses VPN access, pre-shared keys, and authentication, which leans toward \"Access.\" While it's not just a simple project, it relates closely to infrastructure and networking. Since there isn't a dedicated Networking or Security category, Access makes the most sense. I need to respond with a JSON-like object, specifically: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
