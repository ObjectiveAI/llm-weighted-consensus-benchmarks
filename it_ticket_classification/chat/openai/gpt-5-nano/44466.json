The ticket mentions deactivating AD accounts, termination, and an end date for a contractor, which strongly indicates it fits in the \"Access\" category. While it could also touch on \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights,\" the main focus seems to be on access control for user accounts. So, I\u2019m leaning towards classifying it as \"Access,\" since that\u2019s the most relevant category here.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket details, which mention updating AD accounts and the need to deactivate them due to a contractor's termination. It seems best categorized under \"Access,\" since it\u2019s primarily about disabling accounts. While \"Administrative rights\" could also apply if there are privileges involved, \"Access\" is the most fitting. \n\nNow, I need to format my response as a JSON object. So, I'll write it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"} to match the required structure."
