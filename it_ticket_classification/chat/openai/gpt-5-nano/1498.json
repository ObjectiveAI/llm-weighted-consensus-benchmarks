First, I need to identify which category it fits into from the list provided: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It seems like it relates to HR processes, specifically regarding reports when a colleague is on maternity leave. So, I\u2019ll likely categorize it under \"HR Support\" and format the output as a JSON object.**Finalizing HR Support Category**\n\nThe ticket clearly pertains to HR processes with mentions of \"maternity leave,\" \"updating records,\" and \"submitting reports,\" indicating it fits under \"HR Support.\" So, I\u2019ll categorize it appropriately. I need to ensure I'm using the exact terms from the enumeration, specifically \"HR Support\" with the correct spacing. I\u2019ve confirmed this is the best fit, and I\u2019ll present the result as a JSON object without any additional commentary. Here it goes:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
