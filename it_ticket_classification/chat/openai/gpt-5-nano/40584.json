The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket mentions a \"referral tool error\" involving an uploading issue, which sounds like an IT matter. I\u2019m considering \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" since it\u2019s related to a tool. It seems more fitting as \"Internal Project\" if it's an internal tool bug. So I should prepare a structured JSON response with the appropriate category.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe instruction asks me to \"Categorize this IT Ticket\" and specifies that the output should be a JSON object with a category. Given the ticket describes a \"referral tool error,\" it seems to fit best in the \"Internal Project\" category, as it's an issue linked to an internal tool. So, I need to format my final response as a JSON object with \"category\": \"Internal Project.\" However, it\u2019s a bit unclear since the instructions say to respond with the category only.**Producing JSON response**\n\nI see that the instruction clearly states to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" and I have a JSON schema to follow for the response. The final output needs to be a JSON object that includes the \"category\" field. So, I\u2019ll ensure the response is exactly: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nThis aligns with the specified format, and it seems I shouldn't include any extra text. Let's keep it simple and straightforward!"
