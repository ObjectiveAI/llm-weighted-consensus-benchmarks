I\u2019ll have to carefully read through the details and see which category fits best. Let\u2019s see how I can best organize this ticket!**Interpreting IT request**\n\nI\u2019m looking at an IT ticket that discusses access to a dedicated wireless guest TV and the reservation of a port for several days. It mentions configuration changes for an application and some urgent needs due to an event. There are also references to databases, MAC addresses, and emergency applications running until Thursday morning. I think this ticket is about providing dedicated access and a project that needs quick attention. Let\u2019s figure this out!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket appears to fit best in the \"Access\" category, given it mentions terms like \"granted,\" \"dedicated port,\" and \"application needs accessed.\" There's a focus on access management and network port reservations, particularly for an emergency application running. While \"Internal Project\" could work due to the kickoff event aspect, the primary focus seems to be on access control. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nIt\u2019s crucial that this is the only content to follow the instructions.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
