It mentions holidays, requests, and a line manager, so it seems related to HR or possibly Access. \"HR Support\" looks like the best fit since it addresses leave requests, but \"Administrative rights\" could also apply. However, it's not about IT access rights.**Categorizing holiday booking ticket**\n\nI have a ticket regarding a holiday booking issue, and the content is quite messy. The main points are that requests were submitted but not received by the line manager, leading to a resubmission and a need for assistance. It seems clear this fits under HR Support. To follow the system's JSON schema, I need to respond with a structured object. I'll format it as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That feels right!**Providing a clear JSON response**\n\nI need to ensure clarity in responding to the user's request to categorize the IT ticket. Since they specifically asked for a category classification, I should respond strictly with a JSON object containing just the category field. The provided category is \"HR Support,\" which fits with the holiday booking context mentioned. I won't add any extra text or commentary. My response will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That keeps it concise and to the point!"
