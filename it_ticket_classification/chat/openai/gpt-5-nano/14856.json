The phrase \"provide same level\" suggests access at the same level as someone else. \n\nSo, I think I\u2019ll stick with \"Access\" as the generic choice. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON-like object with the key \"category,\" reflecting this decision.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nThe user\u2019s prompt specifically asks for a response in a JSON object format, so I\u2019ll provide that for the category. Based on my previous reasoning, I\u2019m going to use: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nWhile it's possible they just wanted the string, the request is clear about needing a JSON object. I\u2019ll keep it minimal to avoid any ambiguity. Adding a brief note may be nice but isn't necessary, given the straightforward instruction. So, I'll stick with just my crafted response. Done!"
