There are two potential categories: \"Access\" for the Oracle access request and \"Administrative rights.\" Given that the request is specifically about access to the Oracle system, the \"Access\" category seems the most appropriate. However, I might need to consider if it also falls under \"Administrative rights\" as they could be related. Let's go with \"Access\"!**Clarifying IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket clearly requests access to the Oracle October PM platform and mentions saving entities for VAT returns. The user is looking for help with the accounts payable platform, which emphasizes the access request aspect. The \"Access\" category seems suitable given it's mainly about getting access to Oracle. \"Administrative rights\" might apply if elevated privileges are required, but since this is primarily about access, I'll stick with categorizing it as \"Access.\" The \"pm\" could imply project management, but it's unclear."
