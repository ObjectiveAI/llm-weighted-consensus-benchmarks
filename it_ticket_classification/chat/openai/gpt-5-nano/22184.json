The ticket requests a new server for a Kafka environment and mentions various related changes and fixes. Considering the provided categories, it seems most fitting to label it as \"Hardware\" due to the request for server provisioning. However, it could also fit under \"Purchase\" or \"Internal Project.\" I'll go with \"Hardware,\" as it aligns best with acquiring new server hardware.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI have to categorize a server provisioning request, and I see that the options include \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Internal Project.\" The user\u2019s ticket mentions an environment for a Kafka application, and they're looking for server provisioning. Since the request is focused on acquiring a new server, \"Hardware\" seems like the best fit. Although it could also be categorized as \"Purchase,\" I think sticking with \"Hardware\" aligns better with the context of provisioning. I'll output this in a JSON object format!**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nThe instructions indicate that we need to respond with a JSON object containing a \"category\" key of type string with specific values. I initially thought about \"Internal Project\" since it involves creating environments for an application, but given the ticket specifies a \"new server request,\" it clearly relates to hardware. So, I've decided to go with \"Hardware\" as the category. I\u2019ll format the response as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any extra text."
