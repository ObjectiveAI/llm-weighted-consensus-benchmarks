Given the context, this ticket should likely fall under either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" depending on the level of access they're seeking. Let\u2019s make sure to select the most appropriate category!**Categorizing access request**\n\nThis is a request for access to a location, specifically in People Operations. The category \"Access\" seems to be the most fitting here. While \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if they were asking for admin privileges, the text doesn't indicate that; it's simply about accessing a location. So I'll confirm this by using the category \"Access.\" The response will be formatted correctly in JSON as: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text."
