The details indicate problems with the request submission and missing information like status columns and approvers. This sounds HR-related, and since \u201cHR Support\u201d is one of the categories listed, that seems like the right choice for this ticket. I\u2019ll go ahead and categorize it as \"HR Support\" for clear tracking.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize an IT ticket related to the leave request system. It\u2019s not a hardware or access issue, but it sounds like there's missing information like status and approvers. The \u201cHR Support\u201d category seems most suitable since the problem involves HR processes. While \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option, \"HR Support\" aligns better. I\u2019ll format the response in a JSON-like structure to clearly communicate the category: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Formatting response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that includes the category field. I\u2019ll finalize it as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It's essential to follow the required format correctly, ensuring that \"HR Support\" has the right spacing and matches one of the allowed categories precisely. I'll keep it concise and to the point, ready to deliver this response. It's just about ensuring all details are in check for clarity!"
