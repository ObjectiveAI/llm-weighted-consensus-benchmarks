It makes sense to consider whether this fits into Access or Storage. Given the focus on folders and user management, I think it leans more towards Storage since obsolete folders are a primary concern. However, Access may also apply. I\u2019ll decide whether to classify it under Storage or Access based on the context.**Analyzing folder and user audit**\n\nI'm looking at the request regarding folders and their naming, mentioning duplicates and obsolete ones. The phrase \"touch several leaders\" is unclear to me, and it asks for a person to be responsible for multiple tasks spread over weeks. The focus seems to be on performing a folder and user audit. While it might fit under Internal Project, it\u2019s more centered on operational tasks related to Access, considering the emphasis on user access and folder management. I\u2019ll need to clarify the intention.**Classifying the folder audit task**\n\nThe user\u2019s request mentions renaming folders and addressing duplicates, which points to a need for organization and management. Phrases like \"touch several leaders\" suggest involving multiple stakeholders. This task is about planning for an audit of folders and users and assigning responsibilities over several weeks. While it could relate to Administrative rights, it seems more aligned with governance, making \"Internal Project\" the most fitting category. \"Access\" could apply, but the focus is on management rather than access rights, so I'll choose Internal Project.**Categorizing the audit request**\n\nThe user mentions a \"folder and user audit,\" which connects to both folders and user accounts, leaning towards Access. However, given that this is about planning over several weeks, the best fit might be \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019m considering the available categories\u2014like Hardware, HR Support, and the rest. Although \"Administrative rights\" might suggest assigning permissions, it isn\u2019t mentioned directly in the ticket. Ultimately, \"Internal Project\" seems to capture the essence of the audit and scheduling the tasks effectively.**Formatting the IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, specifically focusing on an access review project. Many IT systems have an \"Internal Project\" category to group tasks like this. The instructions also mention responding with a JSON-like format, which leads me to believe they expect the category in a specific structure. So, while it seems simpler to just output the category string, I\u2019ll follow guidelines and respond with the complete format.\n\nHere\u2019s the final format I\u2019ll provide: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
