The ticket mentions \"temporary monitor request,\" \"additional monitor,\" and \"relocated tower,\" making it clear that it's about hardware. I\u2019m debating between classifying it as \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase,\" since it involves requesting hardware. However, since it focuses on needing an additional monitor for use, it makes more sense for it to be classified under \"Hardware.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the IT ticket, which mentions needing an \"additional monitor today.\" It hints at a loaner monitor, meaning it's related to hardware. Although it could also be a procurement request, the urgency suggests it's for immediate internal use. I\u2019m ruling out categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" and \"Internal Project,\" and while \"Miscellaneous\" could fit, \"Hardware\" is the best choice since it directly relates to the monitor. So, I\u2019ll output this as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
