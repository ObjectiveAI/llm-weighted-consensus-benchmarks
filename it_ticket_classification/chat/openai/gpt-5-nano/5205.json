The damaged cards should be destroyed, so I wonder if it falls under \"Access\" or \"Hardware\". Given that it specifically mentions access cards, it seems heading under \"Access\" is the most appropriate category, although \"Security\" could also apply but isn't listed. I\u2019ll ensure to respond with just the category in the required JSON format as specified.**Outputting JSON for categorization**\n\nI've got a schema provided for categorizing an IT ticket that emphasizes using \"category\": \"Access\". The final output must be a JSON object following this structure: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to keep it simple and only include what's required, meaning no extra text should be added. The instruction is clear, focusing on the specific category. I'll ensure to follow the schema correctly, so my response will be just the JSON object with the category.**Categorizing damaged cards**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the content which mentions damaged cards belonging to leavers, stating they should be destroyed because they're damaged again. While \u201cHR Support\u201d might be relevant due to the context of leavers, this ticket specifically addresses the need to handle ID badges, which means \u201cAccess\u201d is the most fitting category. I'll keep things simple and respond with just the necessary JSON output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Time to deliver that!"
