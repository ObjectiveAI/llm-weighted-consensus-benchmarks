The user keeps mentioning \"fresh OS install\" and \"drive without OS,\" so it's likely about storage or hardware. If the issue is strictly about drives, \"Storage\" fits well. However, since it relates to installation and possibly access rights, I should also consider \"Administrative rights.\" But I think it's primarily about the drives.**Selecting IT ticket category**\n\nI need to select a category for this IT ticket. The best choice seems to be \"Storage\" since it's about the drive and the missing OS. While it's not necessarily a storage device failure, the mention of \"drive without OS\" indicates a drive that should have an OS but doesn\u2019t. Since the user's context supports the idea of an installation issue on a drive, I'll go with \"Storage.\" I'll format my response as requested: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
