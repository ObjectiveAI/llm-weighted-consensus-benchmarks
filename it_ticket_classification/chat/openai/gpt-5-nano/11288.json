The ticket contains a messy message about Windows servers needing updates related to an upgrade and decommissioning. Given the frequent mentions of upgrades and infrastructure, I might lean towards categorizing it under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Hardware.\" It seems complicated, but I\u2019m trying to find the best fit!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the content of this ticket, which involves decommissioning, upgrades, and OS versions related to virtual machines. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project.\" While \"Hardware\" versus \"Software\" isn't directly applicable, it feels like the software-related aspects lean more toward \"Internal Project.\" This ticket seems to center around program changes and the needs tied to upgrade tasks. Ultimately, I think \"Internal Project\" fits best, though \"Administrative rights\" could work if it's about requesting elevated access.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions phrases like \"input required,\" \"decommissioning,\" and \"upgraded OS version,\" but doesn't explicitly state access rights. While \"Maintenance\" could be a possibility, it's not on the list provided. I think \"Miscellaneous\" could work as a catch-all, but it\u2019s better to choose a specific category, so I'll go with \"Internal Project.\" The required output format is a JSON object, so I\u2019ll ensure it matches the schema exactly and respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nI\u2019ll keep it straightforward!"
