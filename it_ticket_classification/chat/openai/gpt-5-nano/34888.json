The text indicates a recurring problem with network connectivity, which is urgent since they can't work without it. The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It seems \"Access\" might fit, but \"Miscellaneous\" could also apply for this general IT troubleshooting. I'm considering how best to classify it.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nIt seems the ticket is about an internet connection issue, likely falling under \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The repeated phrase \"open connection\" suggests urgency about network access. I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate category since it's directly related to connectivity. \"Storage\" and \"Purchase\" don't fit, and \"Hardware\" could apply only if it's specifically about network hardware. Since I need to respond with a JSON object, I'll format it to include the category as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
