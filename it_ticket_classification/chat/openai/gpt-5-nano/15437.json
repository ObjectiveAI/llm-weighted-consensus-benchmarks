The ticket's text is pretty messy, but it mentions terms like \"access,\" \"maternity leaver,\" and \"disable accesses.\" It seems related to access management for employees on leave, particularly focusing on which accounts remain active and issues with access cards. Considering these details, the most appropriate category for this ticket would be \"Access.\"**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether the right category for this ticket is \u201cHR Support\u201d because it mentions maternity leave and unpaid leave. But upon reviewing the content, terms like \u201cdisable accesses\u201d and \u201caccounts remain active\u201d suggest this is more about IT security and access management. Given this context, I believe \"Access\" is the best fit. I'll respond with a JSON object for categorization: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, along with a brief justification about it being related to access issues.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
