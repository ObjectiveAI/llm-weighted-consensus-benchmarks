The ticket relates to enabling an AD account for a maternity leaver and mentions unlocking or suspending employees' maternity leave. This suggests that the relevant category is either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" since it deals with access rights. The main focus seems to be on enabling the AD account, so I would categorize it under \"Access.\"**Determining category format**\n\nI\u2019m considering that \"Administrative rights\" could refer to permissions management. However, since the request primarily involves enabling a user account, it\u2019s safer to categorize it as \"Access.\" The output needs to be formatted as a JSON-like category object following the system prompt. So, I'll produce the required JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra text\u2014just the exact format. I\u2019ll make sure the final output contains only that JSON object."
