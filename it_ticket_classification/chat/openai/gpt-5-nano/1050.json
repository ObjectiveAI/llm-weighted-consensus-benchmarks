It mentions people who have left and the need for tracking sheets, which suggests an issue related to access. Since it\u2019s about access rights or account status for those leaving, the appropriate category is likely \"Access.\" It appears to tie into both HR and access issues, but leaning more towards access rights seems right.**Evaluating IT ticket content**\n\nThe user\u2019s text revolves around confirming who has left, which is needed for marking a quiz tracking sheet. It mentions reminders about a refresher quiz and bounce-back emails, suggesting a need to update access for those who are no longer with the company. While it leans towards HR or administrative processes, this ticket fits better in IT under \"Access\" since it's about managing user status and preventing unnecessary reminders.**Categorizing IT ticket as JSON**\n\nI've determined that the best fit for the category is \"Access\" since the request involves confirming leavers to adjust access and prevent sending quiz reminders. Even though there are hints of administrative work, \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" don't apply well here. So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object, specifying the category as \"Access.\" The output will be straightforward and just show the category, along with a minimal explanation. Here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
