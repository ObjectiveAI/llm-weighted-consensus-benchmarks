It leans more toward \"HR Support,\" as it's about checking leave balances. \"Access\" could apply if they need access to the leave module, but it\u2019s mainly a query about the system\u2019s correctness. It mentions problems with the module, which relates to IT support for HRIS.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
