It seems to touch on licenses expiring and managing them, hinting at severe consequences. I need to decide among categories like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the text is unclear, I should select the category that fits best. It looks like \"Access\" might be the most appropriate choice based on the context. Let's go with that!**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nLooking at the text, it talks about licenses allowing access to dashboards and mentions expiration, which points to licensing management. This context suggests that it falls under the \"Access\" category since it's primarily about access control and permissions. \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant but appears to be more about admin privileges. Given the focus on license management and access, I think \"Access\" is the best choice. I'll format this as a JSON object with the category included.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
