The potential categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and more. It seems this ticket primarily relates to HR Support due to its focus on maternity leave and approval changes. I'll also note the user's various requests for assistance in different contexts presented in their lengthy message. This will help ensure I classify it correctly!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThis message likely pertains to an IT helpdesk request involving Oracle Fusion PM allocations and changes, particularly regarding an approver and maternity leave. The user mentions needing to change approvers and account details, which suggests I classify it under \"Administrative rights\" since it deals with permissions. However, it could also fit under \"Access\" if they're looking for system access changes. Given the content and context, \"Administrative rights\" seems like the best category choice for this ticket.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s message includes phrases like \"cannot add pm two codes\" and \"change approver,\" indicating issues with user permissions in Oracle Fusion. I think \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit for this ticket since it deals with access and changes to approvers. While \"Internal Project\" might be an option for project management, it's not about project creation. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" and respond with the appropriate JSON format. Here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
