Given the repeated mention of backup and storage, \"Storage\" feels like the best fit. However, I\u2019m also considering whether it could fit under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the content closely relates to backup management, \"Storage\" seems most appropriate for this ticket.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions terms like \"backup,\" \"monthly,\" and \"server backup,\" which makes me think it aligns closely with the \"Storage\" category. It could also suggest an \"Internal Project\" if it relates to ongoing maintenance. The presence of \"monthly controllers\" and \"reoccurring\" hints it involves regular tasks. While \"Hardware\" could make sense due to controllers being physical devices, the strong emphasis on \"backup\" suggests \"Storage\" fits best. \n\nI should provide the JSON output as {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Outputting JSON for IT ticket**\n\nSince the system needs a specific category, I'll choose \"Storage\" because it relates to backup management. I'll prepare the JSON output accordingly: \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"} \n\nSometimes, if things are unclear, \"Miscellaneous\" could be considered. However, with \"backup\" mentioned multiple times, it's clear that \"Storage\" fits best. The instructions indicate that the output should be in a format ready for parsing by code or displaying in an app, so I will stick to just delivering the JSON object as requested."
