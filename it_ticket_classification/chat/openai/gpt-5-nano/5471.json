It's clear from the keywords like \"leaver form,\" \"leave date,\" and \"location\" that this ticket is focused on processing the departure. There are various fields that indicate deprovisioning items such as AD rights, personal mailbox, and mobile phone subscriptions. The most appropriate categories seem to be \"Access,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe details indicate that the ticket involves deprovisioning access rights, like AD rights, personal mailboxes, and tokens. Given these elements, it\u2019s likely focused on \"Access\" provisioning or deprovisioning. While \"HR Support\" is a possibility, this seems more aligned with IT deprovisioning. The instructions say to format the response as a JSON object, so I\u2019ll finalize it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It fits perfectly within the allowed categories.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket involves several items, such as mailboxes, roaming profiles, AD rights, and tokens, which all relate to overall access deprovisioning. The general category \"Access\" fits well here. So, I'll simply output it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Keeping it straightforward with no extra text is best!"
