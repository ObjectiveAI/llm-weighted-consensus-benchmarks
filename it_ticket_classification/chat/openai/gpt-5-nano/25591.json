The ticket mentions a change of project manager and has some messy notes about approvals and transfer forms. It seems relevant to HR Support, as it's about personnel changes, but it could also touch on Administrative rights or Internal Project access depending on context. I\u2019ll have to think carefully about how to categorize it based on project management and approval aspects.**Classifying the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user wants to categorize this IT ticket. The details mention updating an approver, a transfer form submitted, and a change of project manager. The \"Administrative rights\" category typically deals with user access, but I think \"Internal Project\" fits better since it's focused on project management changes. It doesn\u2019t relate to hardware, storage, or purchases directly. So, I'll classify it under \"Internal Project\" and respond in JSON format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let's keep it clear and concise!**Preparing the Category Response**\n\nI need to make sure I format the category response correctly. The required format is a JSON object with the property \"category\" as a string. So, I\u2019m set to output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This keeps it neat and straightforward. I\u2019ll go ahead and proceed with that format, ensuring it's exactly what\u2019s needed for clarity. Let's stick to the plan and deliver it smoothly!"
