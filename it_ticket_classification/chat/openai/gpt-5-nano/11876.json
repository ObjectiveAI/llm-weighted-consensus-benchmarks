Each category seems distinct, so I want to ensure I'm placing it in the right one to facilitate resolution. Okay, let\u2019s get this sorted out!**Analyzing user text for action items**\n\nThe user provided a lengthy message concerning the Oracle Fusion expense report approval process, focusing on actions required and specific details about expense reports due on various dates. They mentioned adjustments that need to be made, as pending approvals will remain until those changes take effect. There\u2019s also talk about the display of various reports and updates related to status and violation tracking, which seems crucial to managing the expense reporting effectively. I'll need to break this down for clarity!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis IT ticket appears to be about a change in the expense report approval flow within an application, likely Oracle Fusion. It includes details like actions to approve or reject, assignee, report period, and various status updates. I could categorize it under \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but since this is related to modifying an internal application workflow, \"Internal Project\" seems the most fitting. The other categories don\u2019t apply directly here. Let\u2019s finalize that!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI think the best label for this IT ticket is \"Internal Project\" since it revolves around the change in the expense report approval flow and requires action, along with details like assignee and status. This suggests that it\u2019s a change request for the expense report workflow in Oracle Fusion, which fits under internal system modifications. I could consider \"Administrative Rights\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but those don\u2019t quite fit. I\u2019ll finalize this as: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
