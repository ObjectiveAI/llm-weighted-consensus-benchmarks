Given this context, I don't think it fits categories like hardware or access, but it seems to relate best to \"Miscellaneous.\"**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out the right category for this ticket, which seems to deal with access to \"stories.\" If the user can't see them, it could fit under \"Access,\" particularly about permissions. Yet, it might also be \"Miscellaneous\" if the issue is unclear. The mention of \"not sent Tuesday\" complicates things but could refer to an email. I\u2019m leaning towards classifying it as \"Access,\" since visibility likely involves permissions for seeing specific items.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe user\u2019s note \"appear be visible what's deal\" suggests that stories aren\u2019t visible, while \"not sent Tuesday\" might refer to a missing email. This leans towards \"Access\" since it's about visibility and permissions. \"Administrative rights\" could fit if it's about viewing permissions, but since the user wants me to categorize the ticket, I should focus on the best fit\u2014\"Access.\" \n\nI\u2019ll provide a JSON object just as required: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll make sure that\u2019s the only content."
