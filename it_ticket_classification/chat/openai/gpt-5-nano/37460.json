They wrote about shared document links expiring too soon and want the expiration set for at least a month. I\u2019m debating whether this fits under \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" or even \"Administrative rights.\" While it's not about hardware, HR, or any purchases, it seems like \"Access\" fits best since it directly relates to document access. I might also consider \"Administrative rights\" if they're requesting changes to settings. For now, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\"**Generating JSON output**\n\nI'm focused on categorizing the IT ticket correctly, and since this request involves modifying the shared links expiration policy, it fits best under \"Access.\" So, I'll format my response as a JSON object according to the given schema. The necessary format includes a \"category\" field, and processing this instruction will result in:{\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to keep it concise and straightforward, without any extra comments. Here\u2019s my final output!"
