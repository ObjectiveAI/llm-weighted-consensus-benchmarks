Since this email mentions onboarding, it seems related to HR support. However, it likely involves access provisioning and creating a new user account. The \"Access\" category fits best here as it directly pertains to what needs to be done for the new employee. I'll classify this ticket under \"Access\"!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm considering the best category for the IT ticket based on the message about a new starter. While \"HR Support\" could be relevant, it seems to focus more on user accounts and access. The ticket mentions creating user accounts, email, VPN, and system access, which fits the \"Access\" category. This makes sense, especially since it\u2019s about granting access to IT resources for a new employee. So, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access\" and format the answer in JSON!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
