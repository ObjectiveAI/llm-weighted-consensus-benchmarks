It sounds like they're having trouble with screen sharing, which probably points to a hardware issue. The categories provided are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and a few others. Since this situation relates directly to a TV connection, I'll go with \"Hardware.\" I should prepare to output this in a JSON format, detailing the category clearly.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nThe prompt indicates I need to respond with a JSON object that includes a category field. Based on the user\u2019s description about the TV connection issue, I'm categorizing it as \"Hardware.\" The phrasing regarding the connection being non-functional is a bit unclear, but it reinforces that the issue is indeed hardware-related. I\u2019ll format the response simply as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any extra explanations, just sticking to what\u2019s necessary. Let's keep it concise."
