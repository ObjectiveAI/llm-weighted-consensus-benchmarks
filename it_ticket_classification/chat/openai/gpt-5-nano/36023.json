I\u2019m considering whether to categorize it as \"Access\" since it discusses approvals, but it could also relate to \"Administrative rights.\" It\u2019s a bit of a gray area, but I'm leaning toward \"Access.\"**Classifying the Ticket**\n\nSo, I'm considering the categories for this IT ticket. \"Administrative rights\" stands out as it's specifically about admin privileges. \"Access\" could also work since it generally deals with user access. The mention of \"change approval issues\" clearly suggests an access control issue, as someone seems to be able to approve changes without proper authorization. Since the ticket is most about the permissions for approving changes, \"Administrative rights\" seems to fit best here.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
