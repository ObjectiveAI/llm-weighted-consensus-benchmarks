It mentions specific issues like borrowing equipment and changes made without notification.\n\nIt seems to focus on access permissions for meeting rooms, which makes me think \"Access\" is the best fit. While \"Administrative rights\" is also an option, it pertains more to system admin rights. So, \"Access\" it is!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
