The phrase \u201ccard leaver\u201d may refer to \u201ccard bearer\u201d or an access card issue, especially with mentions of \u201cupdate\u201d and \u201cbadge.\u201d The context suggests it's about updating an access card or employee badge before December, so it likely fits into the \u201cAccess\u201d category. It could be \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d but that seems less probable.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIt might be related to \u201cAdmin rights\u201d if the context involves updating badge access. However, \"card leaver\" could complicate things, but it seems more connected to access control due to the mention of \u201cbadge.\u201d So, I think categorizing this as \u201cAccess\u201d is appropriate. The required format is a JSON-like structure. I need to ensure I provide just the category correctly, resulting in: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. So, I\u2019ll keep it to that!"
