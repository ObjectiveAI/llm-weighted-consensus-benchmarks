It references terms like \"complete,\" \"please find attached,\" and \"completed form.\" This suggests it's mainly about HR onboarding, so \"HR Support\" seems fitting. However, since it also mentions \"new starter\" and \"administration officer,\" there\u2019s a chance it relates to setting up accounts and access rights, so I may consider \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I need to choose one category.**Choosing the IT ticket category**\n\nI see that the text includes \"administration officer\" and \"completed form joining.\" This suggests that the ticket could fit under \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, \"Access\" is another specific category available. Given that it talks about onboarding a new starter in Bogota, I may lean toward \"HR Support\" since it relates to joining forms. But technically, it could also belong under \"Access\" because granting account access is essential before starting. I need to decide on one category.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThere's no specific \"Onboarding\" category available, so I believe the best fit is \"HR Support\" since the ticket mentions a new starter and a completed form. Another option could be \"Administrative rights\" if it involves granting access, but that's not clearly stated. Since the user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, I see that I should respond with a JSON-like structure. The output should simply be: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`. I might think about providing a brief justification, but the instructions say to categorize only.**Providing the IT ticket category**\n\nThe required output should be a JSON object that includes the \"category\" property, so I'll respond with: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`. I\u2019m checking for any biases in interpreting the ticket text. It mentions \"new starter,\" \"completed form,\" and \"joining,\" which I think clearly points towards HR onboarding. Therefore, I'll confidently provide the category without adding extra text."
