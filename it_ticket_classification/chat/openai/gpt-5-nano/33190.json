The phrase \"polls suspended but up\" might come from a monitoring tool. I have categories to choose from, and it looks like \"Hardware\" or \"Storage\" would be appropriate for this ticket.**Categorizing Performance Issue**\n\nThe ticket mentions high CPU usage, which suggests a performance issue likely related to hardware since CPU, memory, and swap are all hardware resources. In various ITSM categories, performance issues often fall under \"Hardware\" or \"System Performance.\" Given the context of a virtual machine, the most fitting category seems to be \"Hardware,\" as it directly references CPU usage and swap. I'll create a JSON object to finalize this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That should align perfectly with the required format!**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI need to clarify that the ticket mentions \"report polls suspended but up,\" which seems less relevant. The main focus is really on CPU usage and swap within a virtual environment. I could think about proposing subcategories, but since the required format only asks for the main category, I\u2019ll stick with that. So the final category is \"Hardware.\" Now, let's deliver this concise categorization!"
