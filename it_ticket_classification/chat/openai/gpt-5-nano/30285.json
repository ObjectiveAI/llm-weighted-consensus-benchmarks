The message is quite jumbled, but some key topics stand out, like \"install,\" \"license key,\" and \"PC.\" It seems to suggest requests for software installation and permissions. I might categorize it as \"Access\" since it mentions approval and perhaps administrative rights. However, given the confusion in the message, I'm considering if \"Miscellaneous\" might also be appropriate due to its vague nature.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m examining the categories, and \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d appears to be a subcategory under \u201cAccess.\u201d The ticket content references requests for software installation, PC setup, and mentions a license key, CD key, and procedures. It could fit under \u201cInternal Project\u201d or \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d While \"Hardware\" might come into play since it involves PC installation, I think the most fitting category could be \u201cAccess\u201d due to the need for administrative rights and the general installation request.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on categorizing the IT ticket based on its content. Although \"Software installation\" isn\u2019t a category, \"Hardware\" might fit since it involves a PC installation. Still, the request mostly centers on obtaining license keys and installation. While \"Administrative rights\" seems relevant due to the requests for approval, it doesn\u2019t explicitly mention needing admin rights. However, the installation process likely requires them, suggesting I should categorize it as \u201cAccess\u201d since that involves gaining necessary permissions.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
