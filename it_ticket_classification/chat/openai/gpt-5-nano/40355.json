The ticket mentions \"intense CPU intervals\" and struggles to work, which indicates a performance problem. I should examine the provided categories: Hardware, Software, or Miscellaneous seem relevant. Given the context, it looks like a performance issue tied to hardware. I\u2019ll sum up the ticket content and output it in the required JSON format as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Deciding on category**\n\nI'm considering categorizing the IT ticket. The user highlights high CPU usage, which points towards hardware issues, and there\u2019s no mention of software explicitly. Since we don't have \"Software\" as a category, \"Hardware\" seems the best fit based on performance problems. \"Miscellaneous\" could apply if it were unclear, but it feels more like a hardware issue due to the CPU usage. So, I\u2019ll finalize the JSON output as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
