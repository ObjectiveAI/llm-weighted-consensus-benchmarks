The message includes terms like \"change contract opportunity,\" \"SOW,\" and mentions about NAP teams in July. This suggests it's related to either a purchase, an internal project, or perhaps something miscellaneous. The user doesn't specify clearly, so it\u2019s a bit tricky to determine the exact category. I\u2019ll need to choose one that fits best from the available options.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nIt seems like the user's request is about modifying an opportunity in a Sales CRM related to a contract or SOW. The mention of \"nap teams July link\" could indicate an internal project, but since they're discussing contracts and procurement, it leans more towards \"Purchase.\" This category fits best as it covers contracts and SOW modifications. I\u2019ll create a JSON object with the category set to \"Purchase\" to respond correctly as instructed. \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI see that I need to provide a response in a specific JSON format. The system requires a category type, and it looks like I should just respond with: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nI should keep it concise and make sure there's no extra text, adhering strictly to the JSON format as instructed. Alright, I\u2019m all set to proceed!"
