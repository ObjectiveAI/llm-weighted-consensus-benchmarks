This connects to network access and security, suggesting the category \"Access\" is most fitting. While \"Internal Project\" could also apply, since it involves a defined procedure, the focus is on network detection. I think I\u2019ll go ahead and craft a final response in the requested JSON format, categorizing it as \"Access.\"**Formatting the response as JSON**\n\nI see that the required output format is a JSON object that specifies a \"category\" field with predefined values. I should respond with something like `{\"category\": \"Access\"}` based on the user's request. Although there's a chance \"Internal Project\" could apply since it involves an attached procedure and assigning tickets, the primary focus is on scanning for rogue wireless networks. So, I think it's best to stick with \"Access\" for clarity and relevance.**Categorizing for clarity**\n\nI\u2019m looking to categorize the ticket based on its content. Since \"Internal Project\" might fit if it's part of an internal initiative, but the task seems more administrative and focused on processes. The mention of assigning tickets relates more to a procedure than direct end-user issues. There\u2019s no category for \"Security\" or \"Project management,\" so \"Access\" appears to be the best option. I\u2019ll keep the response simple and just use JSON for clarity."
