It seems clear that this is primarily about access issues and Excel, so I'll categorize it under \"Access.\" Let\u2019s ensure it\u2019s handled appropriately!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the best category for this IT ticket. It primarily involves access issues, especially with password prompts and writing access. However, there\u2019s also a mention of \"administrative rights,\" which could fit if it pertains to write access. The user\u2019s message includes requests for IT steps, like deleting the browser cache and updating policies. Given the focus on password issues, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" but consider it could also relate to \"Administrative rights.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
