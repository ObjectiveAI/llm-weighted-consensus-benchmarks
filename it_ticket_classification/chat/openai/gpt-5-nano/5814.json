They mentioned things like a new purchase order and device allocation, which sound relevant to either Purchase or Hardware categories. Based on the details about a mobile subscription and device inclusion, I think Purchase is the most fitting. Administrative rights don't seem applicable here. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as Purchase, focusing on the aspects of purchase orders and allocation of devices.**Choosing the category for JSON output**\n\nI think the best category for this IT ticket is \"Purchase\" since it's focused on purchase orders, allocations, and devices. \"Hardware\" could fit too, but it leans more toward procurement processes. I need to format the output as a JSON object with just the category field. The correct format would be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text outside of the JSON structure, just the category as required."
