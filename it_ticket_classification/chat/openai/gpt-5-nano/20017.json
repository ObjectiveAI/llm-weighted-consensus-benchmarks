The text mentions a \"new purchase,\" installation tasks, and the need for mandatory receipts. Keywords like \"purchase order\" and \"purchased spare\" suggest it relates to procurement. I wonder which category fits best: \"Purchase,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" Since it emphasizes installation as well, it leans towards \"Purchase,\" but I should weigh the options carefully before making a decision.**Categorizing purchase request**\n\nThe main theme of the request is about a new purchase order and installation, mentioning key aspects like receipts and video features. It sounds like it's asking to log a purchase order, so I should categorize it as \"Purchase.\" While \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous\" might seem relevant, they don't quite fit as well as \"Purchase.\" I'll ensure the output is formatted correctly as a JSON object using \"Purchase\" with a capital P. Here\u2019s the final response: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
