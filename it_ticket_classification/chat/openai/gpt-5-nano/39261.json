The user is trying to enter timecards but receives an error. This seems to involve HR support, particularly related to timecard submissions. There are two potential categories: HR Support and Access. Since it likely pertains to HR/payroll, HR Support seems to fit best, but it could also be an access issue.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nBased on the ticket content, it looks like HR Support is the most fitting category since it deals with annual leave and submitting timecards, which relate to HR policy. It could potentially fall under \"Administrative rights\" if there are permission issues, but the error specifically mentions Oracle. So, I'll categorize this as HR Support. The proper JSON response format is: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I'll ensure to format it correctly and deliver just the JSON object as requested."
