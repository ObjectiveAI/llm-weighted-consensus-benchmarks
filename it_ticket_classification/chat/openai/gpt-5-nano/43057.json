The user mentions problems like \"cannot access server,\" which clearly indicates an access issue. The mention of members being able to access it except yesterday also points to the Access category. While there\u2019s a hint about \"Administrative rights,\" it fits better under Access overall since the main focus is on access issues. I'll respond in JSON format using the specified category.**Formulating JSON response**\n\nI need to provide a JSON object with the key \"category\" and a value from the allowed list. Based on the user\u2019s request to categorize the IT ticket, the most straightforward response is {\"category\":\"Access\"} since the text indicates an access issue. There\u2019s some nuance regarding \"Administrative rights,\" but since the user didn't ask for an explanation, it's best to stick with \"Access\" and respond with just the required JSON format.**Delivering JSON response**\n\nI realize there\u2019s a risk that the user might want a short explanation along with the category. However, since the instructions clearly state to follow the specified format, I\u2019ll stick to that. The final response will be a valid JSON string: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's important to make sure the output is formatted correctly, so I\u2019ll deliver this response as required!"
