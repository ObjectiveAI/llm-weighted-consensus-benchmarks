It seems clear that this is a hardware-related issue, so I\u2019d go with \"Hardware.\" While there is some mention of ergonomics due to neck pains, the main focus is on the installation itself. It\u2019s not about accessing rights or purchasing since they're asking for help with installation, so the best choice here is definitely \"Hardware.\"**Finalizing category response**\n\nI\u2019m thinking it\u2019s best to categorize this ticket as \"Hardware\" since it\u2019s about installing a monitor riser. I considered \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" but those don't quite fit the focus on hardware. Since it\u2019s about the installation, I\u2019m confident in choosing \"Hardware.\" \n\nNow, I'll format my response as a JSON object according to the instructions for categorization. Here's what I\u2019ll provide: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That should do the trick!**Delivering category output**\n\nI\u2019m thinking it might be helpful to keep the response clear and straightforward since the instruction emphasizes outputting only the category. It\u2019s probably best just to deliver the JSON object without any additional notes. I\u2019ll make sure to follow this instruction carefully to ensure the user gets exactly what they need. So, I\u2019ll finalize my response with just the JSON object for the category. Here we go!"
