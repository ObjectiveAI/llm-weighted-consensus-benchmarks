The message likely involves onboarding a new employee. Given this context, I should classify it into one of the categories available. Since it mentions \"new starter,\" this should fit under HR Support or Onboarding. I'll go with HR Support since that aligns best with the ticket content.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out if this ticket fits better under \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" It mentions \"starter form,\" which suggests onboarding paperwork, and the phrase \"he starting next tx\" likely means \"next Tuesday.\" The reference to a center schedule further points to a new employee's IT onboarding process, including account creation and access rights. While both categories relate to the ticket, it seems \"HR Support\" is the best fit due to the focus on onboarding forms.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019d categorize this ticket as \"Access\" since it involves a new starter needing setup for system access and possibly filling out onboarding forms. I should craft a concise classification indicating it's about onboarding and access provisioning. So, I\u2019ll return a JSON object clearly specifying the category as \"Access.\" This response format is specified for parsing, and I'll ensure it meets the outlined schema requirement. Let's go with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
