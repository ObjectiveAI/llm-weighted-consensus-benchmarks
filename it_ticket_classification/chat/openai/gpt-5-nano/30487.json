I\u2019m considering how to format this as a JSON-like object. The categories available include \"Storage,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights,\" which seem relevant to the user's needs. Based on the request, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Storage\" since it talks about shared locations and quotas. Let's confirm that choice!**Finalizing the category selection**\n\nI'm thinking through the best category for this IT ticket. \"Access\" could be relevant due to rights for shared locations, but the focus seems to be more on storage. \"Storage\" appears to be the best fit since it's about sharing files, videos, and the corresponding quota. It aligns perfectly with the user's needs. So, I\u2019ll stick with the decision to categorize it as \"Storage\". I\u2019ll present it simply as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. No extra commentary needed!**Confirming the final output**\n\nI need to ensure that I present the final answer correctly through the appropriate channel. The response will simply be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. This is straightforward, and I'm glad to keep it clean and concise. It's nice to know I can wrap this up without any extra fluff. So, yes, I'm all set to provide that clear output now!"
