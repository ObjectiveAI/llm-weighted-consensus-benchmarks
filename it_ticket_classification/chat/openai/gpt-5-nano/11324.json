It's not straightforward, and I\u2019ll pick the best match accordingly.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this IT ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it includes terms like \"database,\" \"azure,\" and \"developer,\" which relate to project tasks. \"Storage\" could refer to \"KB\" and \"MB\" as file sizes or knowledge base references. The mention of \"hard copy\" suggests printing, while \"merge copy\" likely indicates merging documents. Since there's no \"Cloud\" category and the ticket is somewhat unclear, I\u2019ll output it as a JSON object with \"category\": \"Internal Project.\" Here\u2019s the response format I\u2019ll use: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
