The ticket content mentions a replacement for a second display because the monitor keeps turning off, which indicates it's a hardware issue. I'm considering using either \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase\" as the category, depending on whether it's about the hardware issue or ordering a replacement. Ultimately, it seems like \"Hardware\" would be the most suitable category.**Deciding the category**\n\nI think we should categorize the IT ticket as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. However, I also wonder if \"Purchase\" might fit since they want to replace a broken item. The ticket mentions \"replacement for second display,\" which indicates they\u2019re requesting a replacement rather than planning to purchase a new display. It mainly relates to a hardware issue. Since there aren't separate categories for \"Requests\" or \"Repair,\" \"Hardware\" seems like the most appropriate choice overall.**Creating the final output**\n\nI'm going to create the final output in JSON format with the category field. It seems like including a brief note might add value, but the main instruction focuses on formatting the category object properly. So, I\u2019ll go with just the essential information. I\u2019ll format it like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Now, let\u2019s deliver this output clearly!"
