The content suggests it's an access request, particularly related to access rights. While \"Administrative rights\" also appears as a category, it seems like the best fit is \"Access,\" since that directly relates to the user's request for information about accessing the work planning tool. So, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe text highlights a request for \"access to work planning\" related to people managers. While it might reference a \"work planning discipline file\" or even \"agile,\" the primary focus seems to be on access. I need to categorize this correctly. The choices are \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since the phrase doesn't explicitly seek elevation of admin rights, it appears to be more about accessing a file or system. Therefore, I conclude that \"Access\" is the appropriate category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
