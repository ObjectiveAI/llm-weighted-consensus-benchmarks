The categories I can choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. It seems like the ticket is related to internal processes, possibly involving changes to an approval workflow. The mention of \"unblock\" suggests an access issue, so I\u2019ll consider the best fit among Internal Project, Administrative Rights, Access, or Miscellaneous.**Determining the right category**\n\nIt looks like there\u2019s no specific \"Workflow\" category, but \"Internal Project\" could work for a ticket about changes to an internal process, like improving an approval flow. \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d might apply if it were about user access, but that\u2019s not clear here. There\u2019s also \"Access\" listed. The user\u2019s message is a bit confusing. They mention changes related to Oracle and an approval flow. Since it\u2019s about a request for process changes, \"Internal Project\" feels like the most fitting category.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering the categories for this IT ticket, which are meant for triage. While \"Administrative rights\" relates to elevating permissions, it doesn\u2019t quite fit here since the focus is more on a process change than user rights. \"Miscellaneous\" might be an option if things are vague. However, \"approve flow\" suggests that \"Internal Project\" could be the best category, especially since the changes relate to an Oracle project. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and respond with a JSON object to match the required format.**Preparing the output**\n\nThe instructions clearly ask me to respond with a category based on the user's request. Since I need to provide a direct answer, I\u2019ll present a JSON object with the category specified. The user wants it formatted properly, so I\u2019ll ensure it looks like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI won\u2019t add any extra text; I\u2019ll stick to the required format. Alright, let\u2019s go ahead and get that done!"
