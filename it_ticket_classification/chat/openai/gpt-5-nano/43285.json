Let\u2019s go with that!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's ticket mentions \"oracle error\" and issues related to software task management, like \"reject card,\" \"bulk update,\" and \"task object input.\" It seems to fit within the realm of an internal project, and I think \"Internal Project\" is the best category. \n\nSince we're required to format the output as a JSON-like object according to the schema, I'll return it as: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}}. That's the plan!**Outputting category selection**\n\nAlright, I need to clarify the output format for the category. The schema provided outlines the structure but what they actually want is the value assigned to the category. The user needs a JSON object representing this, specifically: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.\n\nI think this matches the requirements, so I\u2019ll make sure to provide just this JSON object without any extra commentary to keep it clear and concise. Let's go with that!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
