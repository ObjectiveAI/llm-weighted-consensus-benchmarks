The user's message is quite garbled, but it seems to center around purchasing, specifically with purchase orders, receipts, and the allocation of devices under their name. I see mentions of \"new purchase,\" \"refurbished links,\" and a few unclear parts. I\u2019m thinking this likely falls under the Purchase category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis request revolves around hardware purchases for Apple refurbished items, along with Nexus and Galaxy links. The admin wants to manage the allocation of devices and ensure mandatory receipts are included. Since it clearly relates to new purchase orders, the best fit here is the \"Purchase\" category. I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} while making sure there's no extra text. Let's keep it focused and clear!"
