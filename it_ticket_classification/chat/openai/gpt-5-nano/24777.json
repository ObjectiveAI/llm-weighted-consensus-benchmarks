The provided categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nThe ticket seems to focus on scheduling public holidays, which could involve altering the scheduling system. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit if it pertains to access changes, it feels more like a feature request related to the scheduling system.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to evaluate the best category for the IT ticket. The options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nThe ticket talks about updating schedules with public holidays, which suggests it's related to software or system administration. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit if admin privileges are needed, it feels more like a task connected to an \"Internal Project,\" focusing on scheduling as a feature implementation. If it doesn't fit any, \"Miscellaneous\" could work too.**Analyzing IT Ticket Request**\n\nThe user's request doesn't mention access or hardware, so it feels more like a scheduling process. \"Internal Project\" suits ongoing tasks, while \"Administrative rights\" might apply if they were asking for permissions, which they aren\u2019t\u2014they just want assistance.\n\n\"HR Support\" could apply if it were a direct HR request related to holiday calendars, but it\u2019s more tied to the IT system for scheduling. If it's uncertain, \"Miscellaneous\" might work, but I'd lean towards \"Internal Project,\" as it aligns best with adding public holidays to schedules.**Parsing the IT Ticket Request**\n\nThe user wants to add public holidays to schedules for Friday in December, though the request is a bit mixed up. I think the best category for this task is \"Internal Project\" since it relates to updating the scheduling system. Although \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if they needed permissions, the user isn't asking for that\u2014they're requesting assistance with the task. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" and prepare to output a JSON object with this category. Simple and clear!**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, so I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object. I\u2019m going to create it like this: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}.\n\nWhile I could add some reasoning, it\u2019s not required, and the format specifically expects just the category. The instructions have made that clear. So, I\u2019ll deliver this JSON object as it is, keeping it simple and direct!"
