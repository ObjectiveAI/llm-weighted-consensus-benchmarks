The potential categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the mention of \"maternity leaver form,\" it seems most appropriate to classify this under \"HR Support.\" It aligns with the topic of maternal leave and related administration, making it the best fit.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket deals with a maternity leaver form and references an Oracle approver, which feels like an HR process tied to system access or integrations. It aligns well with \"HR Support\" since it\u2019s about maternity leave. However, the mention of \"Oracle approver\" hints at possible access issues related to the Oracle HCM system. While \"Access\" might fit, it\u2019s also not strictly an admin rights request, so categorizing it as \"HR Support\" looks like the best choice overall.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI need to categorize the ticket, and there are a couple of approaches. One option is \"Access,\" since it deals with the Oracle approver and related permissions or approvals. Alternatively, \"HR Support\" is valid since it involves HR forms, specifically maternity leave. Given that the help desk might handle HR issues, I think \"HR Support\" aligns well. However, because \"Oracle approver\" is a key phrase, I\u2019ll ultimately categorize it as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll respond in the required JSON-like format too!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
