It's important to make sure my response adheres to the expected schema, so I'll provide the full object version too: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Providing the JSON object**\n\nI need to create a final answer with just the category in a JSON object, without any extra fluff. The instructions specify that the output may need to be parsed by code, and there's an existing JSON schema to follow. Since the user only asked to categorize, I'll stick to that and simply respond with: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. No additional comments or suggestions are necessary\u2014I'm focused on delivering exactly what the user requested."
