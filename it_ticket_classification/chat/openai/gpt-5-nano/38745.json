The user is asking for the ticket to be categorized. It seems clear that this is related to purchasing a device, so \u201cPurchase\u201d looks like the best fit. While \"Hardware\" also fits since it\u2019s about a device, \"Purchase\" is more specific to buying it, making it the preferred category.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket refers to an \"Apple device\" and mentions a \"used one,\" as well as how costs are distributed. It clearly revolves around procurement, so the best category is \u201cPurchase.\u201d I\u2019ve ruled out others like \"Internal Project\" or \"Access,\" which don't fit. I need to format my response correctly as a JSON object with the category string value. So, I'll output this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. This meets the requirements while specifying the needed format!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
