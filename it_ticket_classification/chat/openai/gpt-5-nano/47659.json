It seems to be related to network issues since they mention \"connections sent Thursday\" and request an examination because \"none of them work.\" Our closest category options are \"Access,\" which relates to user connectivity, or \"Miscellaneous\" if I'm uncertain. Given the context, \"Access\" appears to be the most suitable choice!**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI see that this is an IT ticket about connectivity issues. The category \"Access\" seems to fit best since it's related to network resource access. Other options like \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Purchase\" don't apply here. I should respond with a JSON-like object to specify the chosen category. The correct format will be {\"category\":\"Access\"} to follow the given instructions precisely. So, let's ensure I keep it clear with no extra text in the response!"
