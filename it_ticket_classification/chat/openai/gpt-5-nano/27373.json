The user mentions updates to Git and an attached document, which includes information about members and a new column in a table. \n\nFrom the categorization options available, it seems that \"Internal Project\" might fit best since the ticket revolves around updates and document changes. I\u2019ll format this as a JSON object with the chosen category field, as specified in the prompt.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI need to identify the right category for an IT ticket related to updating a Git repository and a table. I\u2019m considering options like \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since it\u2019s about internal project tasks or code updates, \"Internal Project\" seems most fitting. There's no access request, which rules out \"Administrative rights.\" So, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object stating the category as \"Internal Project\" without any extra text, just as instructed.**Outputting category JSON**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to output a JSON object with just the category. I want to make sure I'm following the platform's requirements correctly, as it expects a specific format. The category is \"Internal Project,\" which fits the context given. So, I'll go ahead and deliver the JSON in the correct format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let's ensure that's clear and concise!"
