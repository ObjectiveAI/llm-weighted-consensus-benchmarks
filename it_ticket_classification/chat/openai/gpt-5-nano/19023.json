The request is about creating a new list for a project named \"thursday march pm\" and involves creating an alias and adding an owner. This seems to fit into either Access, Administrative Rights, or perhaps Internal Project. Given the mention of \"create alias,\" it might be related to administrative tasks involved in project management, so that's what I'll consider for categorization.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nIt looks like they're asking to create an alias and add an owner, which seems like an administrative task. The allowed categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Since \"alias\" could refer to an email or user alias, it would most likely relate to Access or Administrative Rights. Given the request for an alias and owner, it lays more towards user management tasks, so I might classify this as either Access or Administrative Rights.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
