They mentioned needing help with a \"starter form\" for a new starter in March PM, which indicates an onboarding need. I have category options like \"HR Support\" that fit perfectly here. It clearly connects to HR onboarding, so the correct category for this ticket is indeed \"HR Support.\" This seems straightforward as the user is asking for assistance with a form related to their onboarding process.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket, and it seems \"HR Support\" fits perfectly based on the user's request. I should respond with a JSON object that has the category field. The required format specifies that I need to provide just the \"category\" property, which should be one of the enumerated types. So my final output will be {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}, without any additional text. Let's make sure it's clear and concise."
