The user mentions changing an approver for December and references leave requests, which suggests it could relate to HR Support or possibly Access or Administrative Rights. The terms \"approver\" and \"leave requests\" imply this is legitimately about approval changes within an HR context. So, I'm leaning towards categories like Access or Administrative Rights for classification. Let's clarify that this ticket seems HR-related!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the IT ticket about changing an approver, which means it\u2019s related to granting or managing permissions. It could fall into either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" The phrase \"PM\" might refer to \"project management\" or \"performance management,\" and since the user references leave requests for a consultant, it seems to relate to permission management. The single best category to use from this context appears to be \"Access,\" as it's about granting access to approvals.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI see the mention of \"approver,\" relating to assigning roles and access within the HRIS module. It could fall under \"Administrative rights\" since it's about changing who has the rights to approve requests. However, \"Access\" seems simpler and more direct for adjusting permissions. Given that the user requests changes to who can approve leave requests, it ultimately seems like an authorization change. Therefore, I'll categorize this as \"Administrative rights\" since it involves a privileged role change.**Preparing category JSON**\n\nThe prompt is asking me to categorize the IT ticket, and the system outlines specific categories to choose from. I'll focus on the category \"Administrative rights\" and format it as a JSON object, like this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.\n\nEven though the instructions emphasize just categorizing, I wonder if a short note might add clarity, but the format strictly requires JSON only. So, I'll go ahead and output the JSON as required!"
