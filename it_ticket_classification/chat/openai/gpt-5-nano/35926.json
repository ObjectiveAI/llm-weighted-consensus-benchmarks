It looks like they're asking for help regarding an extract related to employee absences or analytics. \n\nSo, I'll output a JSON object with a category property. Given the options, it seems reasonable to categorize this ticket under \"HR Support,\" as it appears to involve employee absence data and potentially some reporting tool. I'll prepare that JSON now!**Determining the IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the user's message, which seems connected to HR data extraction or absence tracking. \n\nThe options include \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Given the focus on absences and text filters set by the owner, the most suitable choice looks like \"HR Support.\" While \"Access\" could apply if it's about filter displays, the primary concern is the absence data extraction. So, my final output will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
