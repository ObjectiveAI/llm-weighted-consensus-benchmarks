The ticket seems to be about difficulties in building an OS image from a recent submission, mentioning task sequences failing, which points to IT infrastructure. I'm considering a few possible categories, such as Administrative Rights, Internal Project, or Hardware. Since \"image\" likely refers to a disk image and involves SCCM, it could possibly fit under Internal Project if it\u2019s specifically related to project automation. I'll clarify this soon!**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the IT ticket categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. This issue seems technical, likely related to building a deployment image. It could be \"Administrative Rights\" if it involves permissions, but \"Internal Project\" fits well for IT tasks. The mention of \"zone\" by the senior engineer is a bit vague, but it suggests this is in IT Operations. I'll go with \"Internal Project\" since it typically involves investigating image build problems.**Formatting category output**\n\nI'm considering the right category for this IT ticket, analyzing the options. \"Administrative Rights\" could apply if permissions are the issue, but it\u2019s not clearly stated. \"Miscellaneous\" works as a catch-all, but isn't precise. I need to respond with a JSON-like object as instructed, placing it within the required structure. Given that the ticket pertains to building an OS image, \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
