It's essential to choose the right category to ensure it gets routed correctly. I'm considering the specifics of the ticket to make sure I select the most appropriate option. Let\u2019s sort this out and ensure everything goes smoothly in the process!**Examining Ticket Content**\n\nI need to look closely at the content of this ticket, which involves issues with closing tasks that generated duplicate tickets. It mentions a request for a hardware data wipe in the Kale building, with multiple tickets created unnecessarily. One ticket seems to have been generated after trying to close another. I should review the details thoroughly to ensure we take the appropriate actions regarding the double tickets and any necessary fixes from the engineer. Let's sort this out!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket is related to a hardware data wipe, so the \"Hardware\" category seems like the best fit. I considered categories like \"Administrative Rights\" or \"Access,\" but since it primarily deals with a data wipe, I'll stick with Hardware. \n\nI need to respond using a JSON format for the category field. The instruction states that the output should be structured as a category object, but I'm noticing some confusion about the schema. I just need to provide the category as a string within that JSON object.**Crafting Final JSON Response**\n\nThe specification indicates that I need to output a JSON object with a \"category\" property, which should have a value from one of the enumerated strings. While the schema details might seem excessive, my focus is on delivering just the required content. \n\nTo comply accurately, I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. No need to include extra details or commentary; I just want to make sure I follow the instructions precisely!"
