The key themes refer to Excel, invoicing, and a data connection, but the categories don\u2019t explicitly match anything like \"Software\" or \"Application support.\" The best fit could be \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or even \"Purchase.\" I\u2019m feeling a bit uncertain about the best choice here, but I\u2019ll go with what seems closest.**Parsing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the phrase \"create new Excel connection for invoicing.\" It seems like it could fall under \"Software support,\" but that category isn't available. The best match might be \"Miscellaneous\" as a general IT ticket. However, \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if it involves access or permissions. There\u2019s also mention of technical details, so maybe \"Access\" applies if it\u2019s about a data source connection, but it\u2019s likely more of a software task for that Excel connection.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nAmong the available categories, \"Miscellaneous\" seems best since there's no specific category for software or IT support. Another option could be \"Internal Project\" if this relates to a project. The ticket mentions creating a new Excel connection and invoicing details, which might lean towards being an internal project. However, based on the context, I think it\u2019s wiser to categorize this as \"Miscellaneous,\" since it doesn\u2019t really fit hardware, access, or storage. Clarifying questions could also help narrow it down further!**Creating category output**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket and provide a category label in a specific JSON format. I need to output the category as a JSON object, adhering strictly to the required schema: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}\n\nI can double-check that everything is correctly capitalized\u2014\"Miscellaneous\" with a capital \"M\" and the others in lowercase. It seems like a straightforward task, but I want to make sure I\u2019m meeting all the specified requirements. I'll stick to just the JSON string without any additional text."
