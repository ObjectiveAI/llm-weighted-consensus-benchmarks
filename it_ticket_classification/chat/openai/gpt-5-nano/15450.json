It might fit in either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it pertains to sending permissions, I think \"Access\" is the best fit, but \"Administrative rights\" could also be specific.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user has mentioned terms like \"within rights,\" \"authorized,\" and \"resolver.\" I think this is about permissions to send announcements, which makes me lean towards categorizing it as \"Access.\" I need to respond using the specified JSON format. The category options are provided in the schema, so I\u2019ll create the JSON structure accordingly.
