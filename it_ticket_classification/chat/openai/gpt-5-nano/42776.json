The available categories are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. My job is to classify the ticket into one of these categories. The user is asking me to categorize it, so I\u2019ll have to ensure my output is in JSON format with the chosen category from the provided enum.**Categorizing a messy IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket contains a description about an \"error with the starter template\" and mentions logging calls and weekly starters, which suggests HR processes. It refers to \"starters\" and \"leavers,\" which typically relate to onboarding and offboarding in HR, so the \"HR Support\" category seems appropriate. However, there\u2019s also a chance it could fit under \"Access,\" especially if it revolves around templates and login issues. I\u2019ll need to choose the best category for this ticket.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on the unclear part of the ticket that mentions \"line manager name\" and \"snow tickets name.\" The ticket highlights terms like \"starter template\" and \"log weekly starters,\" which indicate HR onboarding and offboarding processes. Given this context, it makes sense to classify it as \"HR Support.\" \n\nI'll generate the output in the required format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I need to stick to just this JSON format\u2014no extra text or justification since that wasn't requested.**Confirming category for ticket**\n\nThe instructions mention that my output needs to be in a format that can be parsed by code, which includes returning just the JSON object. I\u2019m considering whether the ticket might be categorized as \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" but terms like \"log call\" and \"starter template\" relate to HR processes. The mention of \"starters\" indicates new hires, so I think categorizing it under \"HR Support\" is the right choice. I'll stick to that!"
