I need to respond with a JSON object as per the required format that specifies the category. I'll ensure it aligns with the schema provided, like this: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI need to ensure the \"category\" field in my JSON output is a string that matches the enumerated values. So, I\u2019ll use: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.\n\nWhile providing a brief justification could be helpful, the prompt suggests that only the JSON is necessary. I\u2019ll focus on delivering just that format. It\u2019s clear the ticket is about a nomination for the Your Zone Award, which clearly points to HR involvement. Therefore, \"HR Support\" is the right choice. I\u2019ll just produce the final JSON!"
