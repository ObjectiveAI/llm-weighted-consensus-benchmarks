The provided categories are \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and a few others. The mention of hard drive capacity and storing big files is closely related to storage. Overall, it seems that the most precise category is \"Storage,\" as it covers issues like disk space and upgrading drives. So, I'll categorize the ticket as Storage.**Responding with JSON format**\n\nI need to respond with the required JSON format for the category classification. It should follow this structure: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} based on the user's request to categorize an IT ticket. However, there's a schema that defines a \"category\" property within a JSON object. It indicates that I should output a nested object following the specified structure while still ensuring it contains the appropriate category value. So, I\u2019ll confirm that the output must look like {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Storage\"}}.**Crafting the final JSON answer**\n\nThe final response should simply be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. However, the schema specifies that the structure must include type: object and properties: category. While I remember previous tasks needing just the category string, it's safer to stick to the required output format. The ticket indicates storage issues, so \"Storage\" clearly fits best. I\u2019ll ensure not to include any internal reasoning. The final answer will just be the JSON object without extra text."
