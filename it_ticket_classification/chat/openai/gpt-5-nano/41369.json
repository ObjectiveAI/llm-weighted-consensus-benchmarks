The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. Given that the issue revolves around hardware, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" as the classification. The relevant JSON object could be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It makes sense since it's a clear hardware problem, and I want to keep it concise without over-explaining.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI need to follow the instruction to output a JSON object that categorizes an IT ticket. The allowed values include categories like \"Internal Project,\" but \"Replacement\" isn't one of them. Since the issue is about hardware, \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate category. I want to ensure proper formatting, so I'll respond with just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It's straightforward, and it aligns perfectly with what the user requested!"
