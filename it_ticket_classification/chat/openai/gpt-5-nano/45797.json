The categories to choose from include \"HR Support\" and \"Access.\" I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" since it's about time cards, but \"Access\" might apply if they can't get to it. I'll clarify and see which fits better.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's message about \"Manage Cards\" suggests there\u2019s a function in Oracle related to a missing time card. I think \"HR Support\" is the right category for time card issues. Other categories might include \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" but it seems more fitting for HR because time cards are generally tied to payroll. I\u2019ll provide the answer in the specified format: a JSON object with {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That keeps it clear and concise!"
