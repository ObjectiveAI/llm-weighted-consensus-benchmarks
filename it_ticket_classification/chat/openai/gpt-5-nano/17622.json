They mention things like \"new starter,\" \"starter form induction,\" and \"assist completion attached return form,\" which strongly indicates HR onboarding tasks. This leans more towards \"HR Support\" rather than IT hardware. However, \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could also be possible. Given the context, it seems best to classify this ticket under \"HR Support\" for onboarding.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT ticket. While \"Internal Project\" doesn't fit, \"Administrative rights\" pertains to granting admin access, and there's no clear mention of that here. The content strongly suggests HR involvement with phrases like \"new starter\" and \"starter form induction.\" I think the most accurate category is \"HR Support,\" given that it relates to onboarding. \"Access\" could also apply, but there's no mention of setting up accounts, making \"HR Support\" the best choice.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
