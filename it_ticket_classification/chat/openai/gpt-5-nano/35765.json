The ticket mentions issues related to changing a line manager and problems with submitting changes. \n\nThe available categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\u201d \n\nIt seems this ticket relates to HR matters around a line manager change, but it might also touch on access rights, so I should lean towards \"HR Support.\"**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI think the ticket primarily revolves around changing a line manager in an HR context. The user mentioned needing help with a system to submit changes but only being able to save them, suggesting a potential issue with administrative rights. \n\nSince the categories provided include \"HR Support,\" it seems to be the most fitting choice for this ticket. It\u2019s all about the organizational structure, so I should go with \"HR Support\" for categorization.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nIt looks like the ticket mainly concerns a line manager change and possibly access rights related to submitting changes. Since the user might be a screening officer wanting help with the line manager update, \"HR Support\" seems like the best category choice here.\n\nI need to format the response as a JSON object due to the prompt instructions, so I\u2019ll respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI should adhere to the requested format without adding extra explanations, since the user just needs the category categorized.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
