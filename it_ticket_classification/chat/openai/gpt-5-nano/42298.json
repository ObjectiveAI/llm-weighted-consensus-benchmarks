The user mentions a Mac mini losing network connectivity once locked. It sounds like it relates to an automation testing server that should receive external connections. There's a puzzling phrase about \"lock your loose,\" which is unclear. They also mention Apple framework versions and have a wired connection. Overall, it seems like a mix of hardware and access issues.**Categorizing Network Issues**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this ticket about a network issue on a Mac mini that loses connectivity when locked. It seems to be related to an automation testing server needing to receive external connections, which leans toward \"Access\" or \"Hardware.\" Since it mentions network losses linked to hardware functionality, I think \"Hardware\" makes the most sense. However, \"Access\" could work too since external connectivity is involved. Overall, I recommend categorizing it as \"Hardware.\"{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
