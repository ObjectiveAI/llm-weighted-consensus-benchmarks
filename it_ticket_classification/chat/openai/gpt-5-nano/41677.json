The categories include things like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and so on. \n\nThe issue revolves around uploading documents, which could relate to \"Storage\" or \"Access.\" Since the user is having difficulty uploading files, it's likely an \"Access\" issue. I'll go ahead and output a JSON object with \"Access\" as the selected category. Let's structure that properly!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize an IT ticket about a file upload issue. The user mentioned they're \"unable to upload files,\" which suggests it might be a \"Storage\" issue since that typically relates to file uploads. However, there\u2019s also the possibility that it could relate to \"Access\" if it\u2019s a permissions problem. But the ticket text doesn\u2019t directly indicate denied access. Overall, I think \"Storage\" is the best fit based on the repeated mentions of upload difficulties.**Settling on the category**\n\nI\u2019m weighing the category options for this IT ticket. There\u2019s an \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d category if the issue stems from lacking permission, but there\u2019s no clear indication of a rights denial in the user\u2019s message. While \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d could be a fallback, I think \u201cStorage\u201d is the best fit since it directly relates to the uploading files issue. I\u2019ll respond with a properly formatted JSON object: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}\u2014keeping it straightforward and to the point!"
