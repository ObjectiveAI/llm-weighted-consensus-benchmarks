The format requires using JSON, specifying a type and properties with defined categories. The text mentions a \"special leave approval issue,\" which likely falls under the \"HR Support\" category since it addresses leave scheduling. The user's request indicates they need help checking this status. So, HR Support seems to be the right fit for this ticket.**Clarifying JSON format**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on provided options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights. \"HR Support\" seems to be the most suitable category. \n\nThe format requires outputting a JSON object, specifically: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. There\u2019s also mention of a schema with \"type\":\"object\" and properties. However, since the task specifies to respond with the category, my final answer should simply be {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} without any additional text. I\u2019ll make sure to avoid using a code block for this."
