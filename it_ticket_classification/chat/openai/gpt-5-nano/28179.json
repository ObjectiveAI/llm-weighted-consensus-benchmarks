From the options available like Hardware, Purchase, and Access, it seems like the ticket mostly relates to Purchase and Hardware. The user is specifically mentioning devices to be installed under a username. Now I just have to choose the best category among these to fit the ticket!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m noticing the ticket is messy but clearly revolves around a new purchase order related to Galaxy devices and installation under a user name. While \"Hardware\" seems relevant due to the focus on devices, \"Purchase\" also fits. The main request is to install the device, suggesting it involves \"Access\" too. However, since the focus leans more towards the hardware aspect, I think \"Hardware\" is the best category. I will categorize it accordingly in the required format!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
