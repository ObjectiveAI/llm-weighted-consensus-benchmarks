The most fitting categories appear to be \"Access\" since it pertains to adding user access, or \"Administrative rights\" if it involves granting admin privileges.**Clarifying IT Ticket Request**\n\nThe user seems to be requesting to add a member to the Change Advisory Board (CAB) for a ServiceNow application related to July PM. I\u2019m a bit unsure if \"PM\" stands for \"Project Management\" or \"Problem Management.\" Their message suggests they want to add a member to this CAB application. The grammar is a bit unclear, but the best categorization looks like it could be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it revolves around adding user permissions.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nAccess usually means adding users to systems or applications, while administrative rights relate specifically to granting admin privileges. Being a CAB member isn't inherently an admin role; it's more about participation in meetings. Still, \"add to snow\" suggests adding someone in ServiceNow, which may imply granting access. I think \"Access\" is the best category since it involves user management. Although \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" are options, they don't feel as precise. So, let's go with \"Access\" and format that for the response.**Formatting the Response**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to respond in JSON format. The category I believe fits best is \"Access.\" I'll format the response like this: \n\n{\"category\": \"Access\"}\n\nI won't include any extra explanations or justifications in the response. It needs to be precise and follow the required formatting exactly as JSON. Let's make sure it\u2019s clear and concise!"
