The user's message looks quite messy but seems to be related to adding a new starter in Bogot\u00e1 to Active Directory. Given the phrasing \u201cadd to ad,\u201d I interpret this as falling under the Access category. It\u2019s definitely a unique request, but I think I\u2019ve got a handle on it!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"provisional joining,\" \"senior engineer,\" and \"compliance officer,\" suggesting it relates to HR onboarding. Terms like \"new starter\" and \"form completed\" imply it's about getting someone set up, likely involving Access to Active Directory. Given the categories, \"Access\" stands out as the most appropriate, considering it's about user provisioning. While \"HR Support\" could also be relevant, I think sticking with \"Access\" is best since it focuses on adding this new starter.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond using the required JSON format for the \"category\" schema, specifically: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The schema indicates that it should be an object, so I need to make sure I follow that. The system expects just the category field without any extra explanation, but I want to ensure I\u2019m correct. \"Access\" fits best since the ticket is about provisioning for adding to Active Directory, which doesn\u2019t necessarily involve administrative rights. So, let's finalize this!"
