From the provided categories, it looks like this is about access rights. \"Access\" seems to be a general category for permissions, while \"Administrative rights\" refers to more elevated privileges. Since they want access to a time management system, it could be either. Since this request is for a specific access, I'm leaning towards \"Access.\"**Determining the ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s request includes \"under section report head digital,\" which hints they might want this placed in a report. However, granting access is the primary action here, so I need to categorize it as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since this seems to involve general access, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\". It seems they might be a coordinator based on the context. I'll format my response as a JSON object for the selected category: \n\n{\"category\": \"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
