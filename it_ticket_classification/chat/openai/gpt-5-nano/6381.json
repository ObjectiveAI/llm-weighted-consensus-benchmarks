The provided categories don't specifically mention \"Maintenance\" or \"Change Management.\" The closest options seem to be \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but I'm not entirely confident. \"Miscellaneous\" could work too, but it seems off. Since this is related to server maintenance and scheduling, I think \"Internal Project\" might fit best. I should respond in a JSON format.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to create a category object with a \"category\" field based on the user's request. The content mentions \"maintenance on server\" and \"change scheduled tomorrow,\" which indicates it's about server maintenance. While \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best for ongoing tasks, I considered \"Miscellaneous\" too. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" aren\u2019t relevant here, and \"Hardware\" might apply to some extent, but without more details, \"Internal Project\" feels most appropriate for this IT ticket about scheduled changes. I'll format the output as `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`.**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nThe phrase \"scheduled tomorrow Saturday\" clearly indicates a planned change, and \"attached file\" suggests they want to include an attachment. Based on standard IT ticket categorization, I think this would fall under \"Internal Project.\" Since the prompt asks for a straightforward categorization, I need to format my response strictly as a JSON object without extra commentary. The final output should simply be `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`, which aligns perfectly with the given categories. So, here it is!"
