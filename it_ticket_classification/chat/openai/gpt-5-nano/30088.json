The category \"Access\" seems appropriate since it pertains to access provisioning for a new starter in Bogota, Colombia. However, it could also relate to \"HR Support\" due to compliance forms noted in the ticket. The user asked me to categorize it, so I'll focus on \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" based on internal processes.**Selecting Access Category**\n\nI'm deciding on the best category for an onboarding task, and I think \"Access\" is the safest choice since it commonly encompasses such tasks. I need to format my response as a JSON object. The required output structure is straightforward: I should include a \"category\" response as a type object with the string \"Access.\" So, the final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll make sure it's correctly structured and succinct."
