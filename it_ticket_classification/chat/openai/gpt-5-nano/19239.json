The content suggests it's related to onboarding, especially since it mentions a starter form and an administration officer. This makes me consider categories like \"HR Support\" and \"Access,\" as it could involve creating accounts or access rights. \"Administrative rights\" might also fit. Ultimately, I believe \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category for this ticket.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nThe text mentions \"fill starter form starting return both,\" which makes me think \"starting return both\" could refer to a starting date. The mention of a new starter in Bucharest in March suggests onboarding instructions. I need to categorize this, and \"HR Support\" feels like the best fit since it's about onboarding. While \"Access\" might seem relevant for provisioning, that doesn't seem requested here. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize the ticket as \"HR Support.\"**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that follows the required category schema. The instruction specifies a category object with a \"category\" field. Based on my earlier decision, I\u2019ll output:  \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}  \n\nIt\u2019s crucial that I ensure the formatting matches exactly how it\u2019s specified. The prompt indicates they expect this in JSON format, so I won\u2019t include any extra commentary\u2014just the necessary response. I'll keep it straightforward!"
