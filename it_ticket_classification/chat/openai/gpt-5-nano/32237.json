The challenges include uncertainty about a meeting room being booked, references to \"milky way\" as possibly a room name, and ongoing problems with booking. While this could touch upon access to the calendar, there isn't a clear login error mentioned. I think it best fits under the \"Access\" category based on the context.**Classifying meeting issues**\n\nThis ticket is about booking a meeting, and it mentions that the calendar shows empty or has failed. If the user cannot access the booking system, it could fit under \"Access.\" The ticket includes phrases like \"calendar room empty\" and \"problem continues,\" which adds to the confusion.\n\nI don\u2019t think it falls under \"Administrative Rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" and it\u2019s unrelated to hardware concerns. So, I am leaning towards categorizing it under \"Access\" for clarity.**Determining the right category**\n\nThe user's ticket mentions resources like \"meeting room\" and phrases such as \"meeting room not certain\" and \"calendar room empty,\" indicating possible booking issues. It seems likely that they're trying to book the \"Milky Way\" room for Wednesday but can't because the calendar shows it as empty. \n\nWhile \"Access\" is the strongest fit for issues related to booking and calendar access, \"Miscellaneous\" could work for unclear issues. Ultimately, I'll categorize this under \"Access\" since it relates directly to system access for booking the meeting room.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
