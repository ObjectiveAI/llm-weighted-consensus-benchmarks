It mentions \"certifications monitoring,\" which might relate to \"Monitoring certificates.\" The request could fit into several categories, such as \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Access\" seems likely if it involves access to a monitoring system, while \"Administrative rights\" could suggest a request for admin permissions. The phrase about adding monitoring and providing technical details adds some complexity to the categorization.**Categorizing Certification Monitoring**\n\nThis ticket could relate to operational monitoring of certificates, possibly SSL/TLS or SSO certificates. The mention of \"certifications monitoring\" suggests it might be linked to an internal program. The phrase \"leader ext\" seems to hint at an extension, but it's vague. I think it could fit under \"Internal Project\" if it's about monitoring features in a project. Alternatively, it may require \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" if they\u2019re asking for changes or permissions. The need to \"add certificates monitoring\" indicates it might involve system administration tasks.**Categorizing Certificate Monitoring Request**\n\nIt looks like the user is not asking for access rights but instead requesting \"technical details\" and to \"add monitoring.\" This suggests that \"Internal Project\" is a fitting category since it relates to adding a monitoring feature for certificates. The mention of \"friday july pm\" seems to indicate scheduling, but that's not in the categories. Given the context, I believe it\u2019s best categorized as \"Internal Project\" since it pertains to an IT project task. I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object for this.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
