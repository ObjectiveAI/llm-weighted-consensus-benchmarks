The phrase \"new starter\" suggests it's related to onboarding a new employee, which indicates it might fit under \"HR Support.\" Other phrases related to forms and returning documents hint at the same.\n\nI\u2019m torn between \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It seems like a ticket for HR Support would be the most appropriate choice, given the context around setting up accounts and access to systems.**Categorizing IT onboarding tasks**\n\nThe ticket involves onboarding for a new starter, which relates to HR processes. To categorize it properly, I\u2019m considering \"HR Support\" because of phrases like \u201cfill starter form\u201d and \u201cnew starter Friday PM.\u201d However, it also includes hints of \"Access,\" referring to creating accounts and system access.\n\nGiven the overall context, I think \"HR Support\" is the best category here since it focuses on onboarding tasks. But I'm mindful that this is an IT ticket and the directive is to categorize it accordingly.**Formatting category output**\n\nI need to provide a category for the IT ticket in a specific JSON format based on the given schema, which includes fields like \u201ccategory.\u201d The possible options are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. \n\nSince this ticket pertains to new starter onboarding, I think \"HR Support\" is the right choice. So the final output should simply be the JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It looks like I\u2019m ready to deliver that succinctly!**Finalizing category output**\n\nThe prompt clearly instructs me to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" which suggests that I should focus solely on providing the category itself. While it would be possible to elaborate on the reasoning, the best approach is to keep it simple. \n\nSo, my final output will just be the JSON string representing the category. I\u2019ll stick with that straightforward requirement to ensure clarity and conciseness!"
