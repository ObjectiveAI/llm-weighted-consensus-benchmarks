The categories provided are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since there's no explicit \"Network\" category, I should consider whether this fits better under \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Hardware,\" as it relates to network connectivity issues. I think \"Hardware\" may be the most relevant choice.**Finalizing category for IT ticket**\n\nCategorizing this IT ticket, I've realized that the terms \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" aren't appropriate here since they relate to rights rather than network issues. \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be my best bet for this ticket, but I wonder if \"Internal Project\" fits better if it's about a specific task. Since the request is to categorize, I'll follow the JSON format provided. My final output will be:  \n{\"category\":{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}}.**Delivering category for IT ticket**\n\nThe user has requested that I categorize the ticket. I want to provide just the necessary information, so I\u2019ll focus on returning a JSON object. The ticket describes network connectivity issues affecting Hangouts and ceremonies, which I categorize as \"Miscellaneous.\" However, I cannot include any extra text or justifications. The required format is clear, so my final output will simply be:  \n{\"category\":{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}}."
