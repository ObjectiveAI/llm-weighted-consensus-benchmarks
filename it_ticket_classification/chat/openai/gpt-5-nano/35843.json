The options are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It seems like the ticket involves change requests, mentioning outstanding issues that can't be closed. I wonder if the term \u201clow\u201d refers to low priority. Overall, this ticket likely falls under Miscellaneous or Internal Project, but I\u2019ll double-check to confirm.**Classifying change requests**\n\nThe user refers to \"CR owners\" and moving completed change requests. This could indicate it's about an internal project or access permissions. The mention of \"permit logging\" seems linked to permission issues concerning change requests. I initially thought it might be \"Administrative rights,\" but that doesn't quite fit. Based on everything, I believe this ticket likely falls under \"Internal Project,\" since it deals with the workflow of outstanding change requests that need completion.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nGiven the context, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit since the ticket is about change requests and project workflow. \"Administrative rights\" could fit if it's about permissions, but there\u2019s no direct mention of that. The phrase about \"permit logging\" might be unclear, but it suggests logging permissions. Overall, I think I should categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project,\" since it revolves around change requests.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe ticket mentions outstanding change requests that can\u2019t be closed due to process changes, indicating this is a process improvement effort. So, it aligns well with the \"Internal Project\" category. I need to format the response as a JSON object with a \"category\" field. Based on the instructions, I\u2019ll go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nEven though \"Miscellaneous\" might be safer if I'm uncertain, I believe \"Internal Project\" is the right choice here. The instructions focus on categorization, so I don\u2019t need a lengthy explanation.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
