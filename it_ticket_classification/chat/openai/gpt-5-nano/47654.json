The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket is about low network bandwidth issues in a meeting room. There are mentions of a cable and screen sharing problems, which seem related to IT infrastructure. The closest categories might be \"Hardware\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll suggest those options.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI'm considering the available categories for this IT ticket. Given the mentions of \"cable\" and \"screen sharing,\" \"Hardware\" seems like a reasonable fit, but \"low bandwidth\" leans more towards network issues, which isn't quite hardware. I ruled out options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase.\" Maybe \"Miscellaneous\" is a backup choice. The ticket content is quite messy, but it highlights a recurring issue that\u2019s significant for work and client relationships.**Identifying the root cause**\n\nThe issue here centers on network bandwidth problems in the meeting room, with mentions of using a cable and screen sharing for video. The user described it as a common issue and wants to determine the root cause. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Hardware\" since it involves cables and equipment, but since it's essentially a network problem, it complicates things. If I'm uncertain, \"Miscellaneous\" could be another option, but I feel \"Hardware\" might still be the best categorization.**Justifying the category choice**\n\nI\u2019m trying to justify the category choice based on the ticket details involving IT infrastructure in the meeting room and network bandwidth issues. The mention of cable and screen sharing makes \"Hardware\" a fitting option. However, other categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" won't work. The user emphasized the importance and potential delays, which may not factor directly into the category. Therefore, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object specifying the chosen category, which is \"Hardware.\"{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
