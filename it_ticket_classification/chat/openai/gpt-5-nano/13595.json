It seems most relevant to the \"Access\" category due to these authentication and rights issues linked to the source code.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis IT ticket focuses on access control and credentials, leading me to consider categorizing it as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Both fit, as there's a login/password reset for access and mention of \"granted him rights\" regarding access control. However, it seems best to categorize it as \"Access\" since the main issues revolve around authentication failures and Git access. Even though \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant, I believe \"Access\" captures the primary concern accurately. So, I\u2019ll format it as a JSON object with the category set to \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
