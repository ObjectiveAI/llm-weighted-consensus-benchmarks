I'm confused since \"HR Support\" isn\u2019t one of the categories available. I'll finalize it under \"Access\" since it fits better than others.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI'm reviewing an IT ticket about \"maternity leave access card\" and references to forms. It touches on various phrases like needing to fill out maternity leave forms and expected dates. While I think it might relate to HR actions, since it mentions \"access card,\" it could also align with the \"Access\" category. I have to choose one category, and while \"HR Support\" seems fitting too, \"Access\" seems more appropriate for this ticket.**Determining the category output**\n\nThe ticket appears to involve IT actions related to access during maternity leave. While phrases like \"please fill maternity leave form\" suggest an HR process, the mention of \"access card\" indicates that it relates more to access. Since the user asked to categorize the IT ticket specifically, I\u2019ll classify it under \"Access\". I will prepare a simple JSON object to respond with just the category: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No additional text is needed!"
