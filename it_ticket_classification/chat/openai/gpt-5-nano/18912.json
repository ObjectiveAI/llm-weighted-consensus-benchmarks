I think \"Access\" fits best.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering which category to assign this IT ticket. It could fit under \"Internal Project\" if related to the audit, but \"Administrative rights\" seems more appropriate since it deals with forbidden software and installation rights. There's also a mention of compliance, which strengthens this choice. While \"Access\" relates to system entry, it doesn't capture the issue of illegal software usage. I think \"Administrative rights\" is my best pick for this case. I should prepare a JSON object to clarify the category selection.**Responding to IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket within a specific taxonomy, and I need to output a JSON format. The proper category here is \"Administrative rights,\" based on the context of forbidden software and compliance. I\u2019ll craft the response in the required JSON format: {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}. While a brief note could be helpful, the instruction emphasizes just providing the categorization, so I'll stick to the JSON output. Let's go ahead with that."
