The ticket mentions access cards usage, likely referring to who used them. The message is a bit messy, but it seems like the user is asking about ordering access cards and defining control for cards used over a certain period. Based on the content, \"Access\" seems to fit best, with \"Administrative rights\" as another option.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nThis ticket is about access cards usage, likely needing clarification on which cards have been used beyond a certain period or to order cards. The category should be \"Access.\" I need to create a JSON-like category object as per the provided schema. It specifies that the category field must map to \"Access,\" so I\u2019ll format it correctly. The response should be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019m focused on being concise in this output!"
