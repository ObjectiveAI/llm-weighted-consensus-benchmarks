The ticket seems to relate to employee offboarding, mentioning aspects like access rights and mailbox. It appears that \"Access\" best fits the ticket due to the focus on permissions and rights. However, it could also fall under \"HR Support\" since it involves a leaver. It's a little tricky, but I think \"Access\" is the most suitable choice.**Analyzing offboarding ticket**\n\nThe content outlines a detailed leaver form with information on the leaving date, mailbox forwarding, roaming profile, and various rights that need to be managed. It reads like a typical offboarding ticket with tasks related to deleting a mailbox, managing AD rights, and inventory details. Given its focus on access rights and permissions, I think categorizing it as \"Access\" fits best. However, \"Administrative rights\" could work too, but the offboarding element leans towards \"Access.\"**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that fits the required category schema. The user is asking to categorize the IT ticket, and it looks like \"Access\" is the appropriate category. So, I\u2019ll format it simply as: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. The schema is just a reference for what\u2019s expected, but the response only needs to include the category field. I\u2019ll make sure to provide this in a clean JSON format without any extra text.\n\n```json\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n```**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI see that the instruction specifies avoiding heavy formatting and allows for bullet lists, but in this case, it\u2019s fine to present plain text JSON. Since the category I need to provide is \"Access,\" I\u2019ll just deliver it in a simple format: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. \n\nIt seems straightforward, so I\u2019ll go ahead and provide that. There\u2019s no need for extra details here.\n\n```json\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n```"
