They describe interruptions while using it, leading to connection issues and lost work, and they're asking for an investigation and a fix. Since it involves software problems and data loss, it should fall under a relevant category, but options like \"Software/Applications\" aren\u2019t available. I may need to categorize it more broadly, perhaps under \"Miscellaneous.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the IT ticket further to choose the best category. Given the issues related to data loss from a software bug in the \"Confluence wallet,\" the closest category would be \"Storage\" since it directly relates to losing saved work. However, \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is also a possibility if it seems more fitting. I\u2019ll conclude that \u201cStorage\u201d is the best option and output it in JSON format as {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. It feels good to categorize accurately!**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI'm thinking through the categorization of this IT ticket due to data loss from connection interruptions. I believe \"Storage\" is the most appropriate category since it directly relates to the issue. The instructions are clear: I need to respond with a JSON object. So, I\u2019ll output {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. While it\u2019s tempting to add more context, I\u2019ll stick to the concise request and provide just the category as instructed. Time to finalize it!"
