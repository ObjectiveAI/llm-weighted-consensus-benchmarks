It seems they're requesting to \"end project setup form Oracle Tuesday July PM\" and asking for something to be attached today. This might relate to \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it references a setup form and Oracle. I'll determine which category applies and format it as a JSON object according to the provided schema.**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt looks like the user is requesting to attach a setup form related to Oracle, which could be a system, and they want to end a project. I'm considering the category options: Access, Administrative rights, Internal Project, or Miscellaneous. \n\nAccess pertains more to systems and credentials, while Administrative rights relate to privileges. Based on the mention of a \"setup form\" and \"end project setup,\" it sounds like this is best categorized as \"Internal Project.\" The emphasis is on setting things up rather than explicitly requesting access.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
