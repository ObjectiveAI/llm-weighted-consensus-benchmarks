The allowed categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" This ticket seems to be about a software issue related to approval flows, which might fit as \"Internal Project\" or perhaps \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Access\" could work too if it's about granting authorization related to approvals.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like the issue is described as an \"approval flow error\" and involves a \"one timecard task for approval,\" which suggests it relates to a workflow in a system, like timecard approvals. I want to categorize this as \"Miscellaneous\" if nothing else fits perfectly, but \"Internal Project\" seems better since it relates to internal software processes. Also, the mention of terms like \"flow,\" \"blank content,\" and \"ctrl null\" signals a software bug. So, I\u2019ll respond with the category: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
