The goal is to set up a git repository for interns' work and create user stories and corresponding tasks. I need to add a colleague who will assist in this process. It's crucial to simulate a real teamwork environment, and I have to consider how access is managed, especially since some client code may be deleted after the internship. I really want to ensure everything is organized!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to categorize this IT ticket related to an internal project for the internship program. It includes aspects like repositories and user access, so I\u2019m considering categories like \"Access\" and \"Storage.\" However, \"Storage\" usually pertains to hardware issues, and the ticket focuses more on project setup. Given the focus on the internship project and git repositories, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit for this situation. I\u2019ll categorize it accordingly!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
