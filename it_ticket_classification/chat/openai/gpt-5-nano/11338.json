The options include things like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and more. The text mentions dated tasks and project management, which points to it being related to \"Internal Project.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could apply, there's no clear mention of permissions issues in the text. \"Purchase\" and \"Hardware\" are irrelevant, and \"Access\" doesn't fit either. Overall, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best categorization.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe ticket discusses ownership of tasks, updates, and extensions of dates, focusing primarily on task dates and bulk fixes. So, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit for this ticket. We need to respond with a JSON object following the provided schema. The correct format will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I just need to ensure there is no extra text, so the final output will be strictly the JSON object."
