The user provided text seems a bit garbled, but it includes phrases like \"new starter\" and \"Bucharest,\" which suggests it might relate to onboarding, particularly in HR. The mention of \"please fill date\" implies it could also concern administrative tasks.\n\nI\u2019m evaluating the categories: Hardware doesn\u2019t fit, so HR Support stands out as a possibility. Given this, I should categorize this ticket under HR Support since it relates to onboarding employees.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to categorize this IT ticket. \"HR Support\" might seem relevant, but could \"Access\" be a better fit since it mentions \"new starter,\" suggesting onboarding access credentials? The term \u201cadministration officer\u201d at the end makes me think the sender may be linked to the request. \n\nThe mention of attachments and filling forms might lead to \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d but it feels more like an access issue. I lean toward categorizing this ticket as \"Access\" because it pertains to new starter account provisioning.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
