It seems to involve a monitor, mentioning physical hardware, evaluations, and possibly a purchase requisition. The main theme points towards hardware issues, specifically with monitors. Even if it hints at purchasing, I think the best category is \"Hardware\" due to the focus on assessment and remedial action related to the monitor. So, I\u2019ll confirm the category as \"Hardware\" in the designated format.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe prompt asks me to categorize an IT ticket based on user-provided text. I need to ensure my response follows the required schema, which specifies that only a JSON object with a \"category\" field is necessary. The best fitting category here is \"Hardware,\" referring to mentions of monitors and related hardware issues. I just want to make sure I get the capitalization right. So, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any extra explanation."
