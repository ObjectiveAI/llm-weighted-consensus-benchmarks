It's uncertain what they mean by \"replacing with amp,\" and their mention of CPU usage oscillating indicates a technical issue. I'll need to provide a structured JSON-like output with a category type based on this information.**Selecting category for IT ticket**\n\nThe prompt instructs me to format my response as a JSON object, specifying a category type. The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The user mentions CPU usage linked to \"amp,\" which raises questions about whether this is a hardware or software issue. \n\nI think the best fit is \"Hardware\" since CPU usage relates to resource management, but it might also indicate a software problem related to \"amp.\" I'll navigate these distinctions to select the most appropriate category.{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}}{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
