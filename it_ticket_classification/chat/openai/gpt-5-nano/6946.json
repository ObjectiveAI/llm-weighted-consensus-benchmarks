Initially, I thought it might fit under \"Administrative rights,\" but that's not quite right. It could possibly be \"Internal Project,\" or maybe even \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll need to decide which fits best.**Evaluating IT Ticket Categories**\n\nThe categories for this IT ticket are pretty limited. I initially thought it could be \"Administrative rights\" since it relates to contract execution and records, but I also considered \"Miscellaneous\" because of the change in stage statuses. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any request for access or HR support. It might fit \"Internal Project\" based on contract workflow. After checking all categories, I need to pick the best fit, focusing on the contract aspects mentioned.**Assessing IT Ticket Classification**\n\nThe ticket could relate to procurement workflow, considering that \"Purchase\" involves purchasing processes. It mentions contract executions and draft changes, which hints at contract management. However, it isn't about hardware or software purchases. I could also consider \"Internal Project\" if it's project-related. \n\nWhile \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t fit since there's no mention of permissions, the safest bet might be \"Miscellaneous.\" Yet, the ticket's focus on contract workflow leans towards classifying it as \"Internal Project.\" I'll choose the best option based on this context.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe categories notably include \"Internal Project,\" which fits because the ticket discusses changes in contract stages and draft management. It seems most relevant since it's centered on workflow adjustments within a contract management system. However, if it's specifically about purchase contracts, \"Purchase\" could also apply. The text is a bit messy, and while clarification would be great, the user's request was straightforward. I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" as the best fit and provide a brief rationale when responding in JSON format.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
