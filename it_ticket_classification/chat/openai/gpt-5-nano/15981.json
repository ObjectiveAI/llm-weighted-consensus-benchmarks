The message is pretty messy, but it mentions \u201ccode removal\u201d and \u201cdelete code\u201d several times. This makes me think it could be related to \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d since they might need permission to remove codes.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s also the reference to \u201cproject code,\u201d which complicates things a bit. I\u2019m leaning more toward assigning it to \"Administrative rights,\" but it could also fit \u201cInternal Project.\u201d Let\u2019s decide!**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI'm thinking about how to categorize this messy IT ticket. There\u2019s a lot of mention about \u201cproject code removal\u201d on Wednesday afternoon, and they are asking for help in deleting codes. Since they mention costs, it tosses in some ideas about \"Purchase\" or \"Internal Project,\" but the focus on deleting codes makes me think it\u2019s leaning towards \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d\n\nThey might be looking to gain admin rights to remove a project code from the system. It's a bit convoluted, but I\u2019ll go with that!**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m pondering the details of this IT ticket. The user talks about \"removing code\" and \"deleting code\" but doesn't specifically mention \"granting rights.\" \n\nIt seems the \u201cInternal Project\u201d category fits well for project management tasks, specifically for creating or deleting project codes. However, since they mention wanting to stop using codes, \u201cAccess\u201d could also apply if it involves permissions. Still, my final thought is that \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. \n\nLet\u2019s respond with the required JSON format:  \n{\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
