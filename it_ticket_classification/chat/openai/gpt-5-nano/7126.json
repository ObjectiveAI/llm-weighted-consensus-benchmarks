The mention of \"Galaxy\" might refer to a device or network. Overall, it points toward an access problem needing resolution. I'll assign the \"Access\" category for this ticket.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the ticket, and the most relevant category seems to be \"Access\" since it mentions being locked out of the laptop, likely due to incorrect password attempts. It could also relate to \"Hardware\" if the device is physically locked, but that feels less likely. There's not really a case for \"Internal Project\" or \"Storage,\" and \"Miscellaneous\" is a fallback. Given the urgency in the request, I'll format my response as a JSON object with the category as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
