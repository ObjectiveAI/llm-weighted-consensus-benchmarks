The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nThe user seems to be saying they can't create a new issue, only existing ones, and it feels stuck in progress mode without attachments. Based on this, it seems like this ticket relates to Access. \n\nI'll format the output as a JSON-like object.  \n{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Determining the access category**\n\nI'm viewing this as an Access or Permissions issue since the user can't create new issues. It could go in \"Internal Project\" for project management tools or \"Administrative rights\" if it relates to permissions. However, given the inability to create issues, \"Access\" seems most fitting. The user mentioned being stuck in progress mode, which might hint at a bug, but \"Access\" captures the essence. I'll format the output correctly as a JSON object: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
