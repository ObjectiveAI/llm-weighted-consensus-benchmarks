I'm debating if this falls under Administrative rights or Miscellaneous.**Interpreting the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket is likely about administrative tasks, specifically updating a calendar or appointment with an address. I think \"Administrative rights\" might pertain to permission changes, but that doesn't seem to fit here. \n\nParsing the available categories, the ticket message indicates that they want to \"add address to Tuesday February PM,\" which suggests editing a meeting. This feels more like an administrative task, so I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as either Administrative rights or Miscellaneous.**Categorizing the ticket properly**\n\nI realize that \"Administrative rights\" typically refers to granting privileges within a system, but this ticket seems more related to an administrative task\u2014specifically editing an entry. The task isn\u2019t about permissions, so while \"Administrative rights\" is a category, it may not be the best fit here. \n\n\"MISC\" would cover ambiguous tasks like editing an event well. Since the request is about adding an address, I'll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\nThe output format should be a JSON object, so I'll prepare that.  \n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
