The user's message mentions \"new starter admin\" and \"starter form date,\" which suggests it's related to onboarding a new employee. There are phrases like \"please attached colleague\" and \"helping out,\" indicating admin tasks. Since the categories available focus on things like HR Support, Administrative rights, or Access, I think the best fit here would be HR Support for this ticket. It aligns the closest with onboarding.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the content mentioning \"starter form date\" and \"fill enclosed her date,\" which suggests it's about forms for a new starter. It might relate to provisioning access for a new hire, thus fitting into the Access category. The request isn't very coherent, but it\u2019s clear it deals with onboarding tasks. While \"Administrative rights\" pertains to granting admin privileges and isn't specifically mentioned here, HR Support seems to match due to the onboarding aspect.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nAlright, I need to categorize this IT ticket related to new starter onboarding. Usually, these tickets fall under Access, Administrative rights, or HR Support. The message mentions \"new starter admin\" and various repetitive phrases about filling a starter form and an attached colleague. While it's not explicitly about hardware, the context strongly suggests onboarding. Therefore, I think \"HR Support\" is the best category because it directly relates to supporting the new starter with forms.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nThe system is asking me to categorize this request for routing to the correct team, whether it\u2019s HR, Access, or Admin. In IT, onboarding typically involves \"Access\" approvals, but since the message focuses on \"starter form date\" and an \"attached colleague\" without mentioning accounts, it seems safest to choose \"HR Support.\" This aligns with onboarding and form processing. Now, I\u2019ll format this as a JSON object with the category value set as \"HR Support.\"{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
