The issue involves a printer jam on the floor. Although it might seem like it could fit under \"Facilities,\" it's clearly a technical issue with the printer, so I'm deciding on the \"Hardware\" category. Since the user specifically mentions the printer jams, I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Formatting final response**\n\nThe final output needs to be a JSON-like object, following the user's prompt to \"Categorize this IT Ticket.\" Given that the issue is related to hardware, I'll clearly state: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It's essential to check for spelling accuracy to ensure \"Hardware\" is exactly right, with no extra commentary. So, I'll confirm that's what I'm delivering: a straightforward JSON object. Here we go: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Yes, that works!"
