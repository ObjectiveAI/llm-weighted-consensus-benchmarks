However, since it's unclear, it might be best to categorize it as \"Miscellaneous.\" I think asking for clarification could help as well!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user's text, \"please remove from hi,\" doesn't quite make sense, and the rest of it\u2014\"please more than captured picture please ones beginning\"\u2014is similarly unclear. Maybe they're asking to \"remove more than captured picture,\" but it's just too ambiguous. I think the best choice is to categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" since that acts as a catch-all. Based on the required format, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} to keep it simple and compliant!"
