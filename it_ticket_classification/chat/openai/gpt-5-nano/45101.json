The options include categories like \"HR Support\" and \"Access.\" Since this seems related to absence and HR policy, \"HR Support\" could fit. However, since it mentions visibility in the system, \"Access\" could also be appropriate. It's tricky because it combines aspects of HR policy with system functionality. I'll have to decide which category fits best.**Selecting HR Support category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize the IT ticket about annual leave visibility. Since it clearly pertains to HR data display, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit. I\u2019m also thinking about \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access,\" since visibility issues might relate to access permissions, but due to the existence of a specific \"HR Support\" category, that\u2019s my choice. I\u2019ll respond with the proper JSON format for the category, ensuring it's structured correctly without extra text: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
