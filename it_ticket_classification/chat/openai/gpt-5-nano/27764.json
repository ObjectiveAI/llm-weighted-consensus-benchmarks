It could either fall under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project,\" but without clear project details, \"Miscellaneous\" seems safer. The ticket involves sending invites for an internal project kickoff, but the focus is on event planning, not strictly IT service. I think \"Miscellaneous\" captures it well. Now, I'll prepare a JSON object with the category set to \"Miscellaneous.\"**Formatting the JSON output**\n\nI need to format the category schema as a JSON object with the required structure. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"...\"} and specifically include the \"Miscellaneous\" category. I want to ensure it's concise and valid, without any extra quotes or text. Since the system expects this specific JSON format, I\u2019ll provide just the essential output. So, I'll prepare the final JSON object to be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} and keep it straightforward!"
