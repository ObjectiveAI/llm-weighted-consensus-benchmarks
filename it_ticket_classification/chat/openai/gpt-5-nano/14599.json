They provided options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. The text mentions expense submissions, attachments, and some related notes. Based on the context, I\u2019m thinking the best fit might be \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Administrative rights.\" However, there\u2019s also talk of submitting expenses, so \"Purchase\" could work too since there\u2019s no specific Finance category. It\u2019s a bit tricky.**Categorizing an IT Ticket**\n\nThe user's ticket mentions issues with submitting train expenses and attachments. It could relate to \"Access\" if they're unable to submit because of a memory limit or email issues. There's also mention of attachments getting stuck in a junk folder, which points to possible deliverability problems. Considering the categories available, \"Storage\" seems the most appropriate since there\u2019s a clear issue with memory limits. I think the final category should be \"Storage\" based on this context.**Formatting the Response**\n\nI need to respond using the JSON format for categorizing, specifically: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. The instructions mention that bullet lists are acceptable, but the tool requires a precise category format. According to the guidelines, I have to ensure the output is just that JSON object as specified. There's a possibility of adding a brief note, but it seems best to stick to just providing the category in the JSON format directly. So, I\u2019ll deliver: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}."
