Based on the context, it looks like the ticket fits best under \"Storage,\" \"Access,\" or perhaps \"Administrative rights.\" The user's request indicates they need help with their mapped drive.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding whether to categorize the IT ticket as \"Access\" or \"Storage.\" The user speaks about drive permissions and mapping issues related to network drives, which typically falls under \"Storage\" for devices and mapping persistent drives. Their mention of rebooting to map a folder indicates an access issue tied to a storage resource, so \"Storage\" seems like the most appropriate choice. I\u2019ll choose \"Storage\" for the categorization and plan to respond with a JSON object containing the category field.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
