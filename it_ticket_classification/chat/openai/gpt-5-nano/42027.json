I see keywords like \"error,\" \"trying to submit for last week,\" and \"can someone help or provide instructions.\" This could fall under \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or possibly \"Access\" since it mentions submission for a developer. However, since there isn\u2019t a hardware issue and it's more of a general error inquiry, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the best fit here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for an IT ticket based on the text provided. \"Internal Project\" could work if it relates to an internal submission, and \"Administrative Rights\" if it\u2019s about needing permissions. It mentions a general error when submitting, and \u201cdeveloper\u201d suggests it's for an internal project. Since specific details are missing, categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a safe choice. I\u2019ll prepare the output in JSON format with the chosen category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm evaluating a ticket about an error when submitting something. The classification options include categories like \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the user mentions \"developer\" and asks how to submit for them, it indicates a workflow concerning an internal project. Given that context, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll prepare the response in JSON format without any extra explanations since the instructions specify just to categorize the IT ticket. Here's the format: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}**Formatting the response**\n\nI\u2019m checking the required response format, which needs to follow a specific schema for categorization. It includes categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" etc. I see that the final answer should be a simple category object, so I\u2019ll go with: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nThis format is concise and meets the system's expectations.
