I think \"Administrative rights\" or \"HR Support\" might fit well, considering the context around adjusting approvers. It\u2019s definitely related to HR processes and workflow access.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing an IT ticket that involves adjusting the approvers list for annual leave requests. This relates to access rights in the holiday approval workflow. I think \"Access\" is the right category since it focuses on who can approve requests. While \"Administrative rights\" also fits, it seems more precise to go with \"Access\" since it\u2019s about permissions for a workflow. So, I\u2019ll output this as a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Preparing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket. I need to provide the category in the required format, which is a JSON object. To produce this, I\u2019ll make sure it includes the necessary details and adheres to the structure they expect. Alright, let\u2019s finalize that! I\u2019ll be ready to output it as a clean JSON object for the user. Let\u2019s get this done!"
