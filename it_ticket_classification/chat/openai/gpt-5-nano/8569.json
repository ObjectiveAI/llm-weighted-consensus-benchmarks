The ticket is about cable adapters for meeting rooms, which seems to point toward the \"Hardware\" category. The user is asking for the re-equipping of adapters, so it looks like a hardware request. I wonder if the \"Purchase\" category could also fit if the request involves replacing those adapters. Ultimately, it seems most aligned with hardware procurement or repair.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket about cable adapters. It seems to point toward \"Hardware\" since it involves hardware components. However, there\u2019s also a \"Purchase\" category for procurement. The user seems to be asking for a re-equip of the meeting room adapters, which feels more like a maintenance request. Although it involves obtaining equipment, \"Hardware\" is likely the best fit based on the context. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware\" and respond in JSON format.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI need to format the output as a JSON object with the category set to \"Hardware.\" The instructions are pretty clear that I should respond with something like: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.\n\nIt seems there\u2019s some confusion about whether I need to include the top-level type. The simplified version seems fine since the category field is already a string with specified values.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll stick with the simplest format and succinctly provide it as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That meets the requirements well!"
