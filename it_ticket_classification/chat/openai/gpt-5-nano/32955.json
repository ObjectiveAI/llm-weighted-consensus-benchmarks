The user mentioned \"project access,\" \"test link,\" and included \"tester\" in their request, indicating they likely want access. This suggests the best fit is the \"Access\" category, as it directly relates to their need for a test link. However, since it pertains to a specific project, \"Internal Project\" could also be relevant. So ultimately, \"Access\" stands out as the primary category.**Categorizing access requests**\n\nThe user's request is about providing a test link, which indicates it's related to access for a project. So, I\u2019m deciding on the \"Access\" category. I need to format my response as a JSON object since that seems to be what's required by the instruction. The correct output should be simple and contain only the category. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with the structured JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s neatly formatted with no extra commentary."
