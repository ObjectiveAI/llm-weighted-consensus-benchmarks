I\u2019m considering that it could fit under \"Access\" if it\u2019s about system access, or possibly \"Internal Project\" since it references a new project and an Oracle PM template. \"Internal Project\" feels like the best match based on the context.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing this IT ticket as \"Internal Project.\" It doesn\u2019t mention \"Administrative rights,\" \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Purchase,\" so those are out. \"HR Support\" and \"Miscellaneous\" don\u2019t seem fitting either. The text suggests a client setup, possibly needing access to a project management tool. The mention of \"new project codes\" and \"Oracle PM\" points toward project deployment. I\u2019ll justify my choice by noting the project specifics, forms, and templates involved.**Formatting the Final Answer**\n\nI need to make sure the final answer follows the required JSON format, which requires a \"category\" field that maps to a string. It looks like the inner category will be \"Internal Project,\" since that seems to fit best based on the context. I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. \n\nThe schema indicates it should be an object type with a string value. If needed, I could add a brief note, but I\u2019ll keep it concise to align with the instruction to categorize the IT ticket directly."
