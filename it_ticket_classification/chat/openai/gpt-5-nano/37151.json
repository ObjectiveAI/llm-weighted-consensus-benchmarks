The ticket addresses connection issues related to TLS/SSL certificates, server verification, and certificate management. It\u2019s possible that the category could fall under \u201cAccess,\u201d \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d or even \u201cInternal Project,\u201d since it involves managing keys and permissions. I\u2019ll structure my output as a JSON-like object with the selected category. Let\u2019s pinpoint the best match!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI see that the issue revolves around managing keys and certificates, indicating an access or permissions problem. The user\u2019s phrasing suggests they possess some rights but struggle with managing keys. \u201cAccess\u201d typically concerns system or account access, while \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d specifically relates to performing admin tasks. Given the context, the ticket seems to deal with troubleshooting connection issues due to certificate management. If I have to choose, I think \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d is the better fit for this category.**Formatting the response**\n\nI believe categorizing the ticket as \"Administrative rights\" is the best option. Based on the instructions, I need to output this category in JSON format, specifically as a category object with the string included. So, I\u2019ll keep the response simple and make sure there\u2019s no extra text. The JSON output will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
