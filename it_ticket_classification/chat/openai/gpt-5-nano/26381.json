It mentions a \"new starter,\" which makes me think about onboarding and potential issues. Terms like \"credentials\" and \"Active Directory\" suggest this relates to user access.\n\nConsidering the categories provided, it seems like this ticket fits best under \"Access\" because it's centered on credentials and user group additions. Let's categorize it as such!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nIt looks like the user's ticket is about onboarding, AD group membership, and credentials. Given the content, I think it best fits under either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, since it primarily involves creating a user in AD and adding them to groups, I lean towards categorizing it as \"Access.\" The phrases like \"new starter\" and \"please find credentials\" really point to provisioning.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format for the category. Here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
