It looks like this falls into HR-related issues, and the relevant categories are \"Access\" and \"HR Support.\" Since the user seems to need help managing their access card while going on maternity leave, I'll classify this ticket appropriately. It seems clear this is an HR-related request regarding their access during this time.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m weighing the best category for this IT ticket. It could be \"Access\" since it's about managing an access card, or \"HR Support\" due to the maternity leaver form request. The user is asking for help with filling out the form, which leans towards HR processes. Still, since the message is an IT ticket, categorizing it under \"Access\" makes sense for the access card management, while noting \"HR Support\" as a secondary option could also be valid.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize this IT ticket. It touches on both HR and Access topics. The main action seems to be filling out the leaver form, which is an HR task. The user's request for help indicates they need assistance with that. However, the mention of \"maternity leaver access card\" suggests there's also an IT task involved, like returning the access card. If I must pick one, \"HR Support\" feels like the best choice since it directly relates to the leaver form.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the typical IT ticket categories. The user needs this IT ticket categorized as either \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\" The mention of \"maternity leaver form\" isn\u2019t related to hardware or storage, so it\u2019s more relevant to the \"Access\" category, which deals with access cards. I think the best approach is to decide on \"Access\" since it relates directly to the access card involved in the maternity leave process. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object containing the category value.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
