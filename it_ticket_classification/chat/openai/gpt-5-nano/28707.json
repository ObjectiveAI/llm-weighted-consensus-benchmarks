The sign-off from a senior software developer indicates it's a professional request. While it could fit into the \"Purchase\" category, there's no clear pricing or procurement information. Still, the \"Hardware\" category seems most appropriate for devices like monitors. So I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\"**Determining Category for IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket that discusses an \"additional monitor\" request. There are typos, but it\u2019s clear they're asking for additional hardware for their tower. I need to decide between \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase,\" but \"Hardware\" seems the safest choice as it directly refers to a device. Other categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Access\" don\u2019t fit. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object stating the category. My final response will simply be the JSON: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
