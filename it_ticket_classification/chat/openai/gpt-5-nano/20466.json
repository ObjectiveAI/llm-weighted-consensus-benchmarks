They specifically asked for the best category for the IT ticket. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" don't quite fit, and \"Miscellaneous\" is too vague. \"Internal Project\" appears appropriate given the context of configuring job fields. So, I\u2019ll craft a JSON object to classify it correctly.**Setting project category**\n\nI\u2019m going to categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" The instruction specifies I need to respond with just the category, likely in a JSON format. I think it\u2019s important to keep it concise, so I'll just present the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I'll double-check that the format is correct and that no extra text is included. This should meet the requirements nicely!"
