I need to figure out which category best fits the ticket in question. It's essential to choose the right category to ensure it goes to the appropriate team for faster resolution. Let's dive into the details and make sure we cover everything!**Interpreting purchase request**\n\nThe user provided a somewhat jumbled string that seems to relate to a purchase request for IT. It mentions that a purchase has been approved, specifically for a \"galaxy back cover screen protector,\" and includes requests to log the item and details about installation. There are also references to user names and further communication about the purchase. I think categorizing this under \"Purchase\" seems to be the right way to go!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
