The ticket mentions issues with proxy authentication and computers locking after a restart. It seems like it might fit under \"Access,\" given the login and authentication context. While \"Administrative rights\" might not apply, \"Hardware\" could be relevant due to the lockups. I'll lean toward \"Access\" as the most appropriate category for this issue, focusing on the login and authentication aspect.**Categorizing IT Issue**\n\nI\u2019m determining the correct category for this IT issue, which revolves around proxy authentication and access control problems. The description clearly highlights an authentication issue tied to the proxy. I think \"Access\" fits best, but \"Miscellaneous\" could work if it were less clear. Since it\u2019s a clear authentication situation, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" Now I need to format my response as a JSON object as instructed, so I'll finalize it with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
