The ticket is about creating a user AD for git access and adding it to the appropriate Active Directory in a July repository. It's clearly requesting access, so I think \"Access\" is the right category. It might relate to Administrative rights too, but \"Access\" seems most fitting. I should return a JSON object with that category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
