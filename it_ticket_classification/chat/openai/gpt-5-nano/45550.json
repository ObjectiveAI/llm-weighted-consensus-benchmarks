The provided string is quite garbled, but it seems to relate to issues with connecting either wirelessly or wired. There's a hint about working remotely and receiving an error. It could be about VPN access since it mentions connecting directly. I need to pick a category from the given list: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights.**Interpreting IT ticket issue**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket and provided some text that needs parsing. It sounds like they might have a VPN issue since they're referencing connection problems when working remotely. They mention that everything works fine when connected directly, but there's an error when trying to connect via VPN. I need to clarify if this could relate to licensing or something else since that might explain why they can't access it remotely.**Classifying access issue**\n\nI\u2019m interpreting that the user's ticket likely refers to remote access troubles, possibly related to VPN. They\u2019ve mentioned an error that suggests the system only works when directly connected. This indicates it\u2019s primarily an access issue, so I should categorize it under \"Access.\" I\u2019ll skip categories like Hardware, HR Support, or Miscellaneous since they don\u2019t apply here. The ticket's details point clearly to issues with remote connection, so I\u2019ll prepare to respond in the required JSON format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
