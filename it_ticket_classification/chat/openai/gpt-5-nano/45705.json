They specifically mention owners and permission levels. Given this detail, it looks like the best fit for this ticket would be both \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\"**Determining the ticket category**\n\nIt looks like the issue falls under \"Access\" since it's about permissions, but \"Administrative rights\" seems like a better fit because it's specifically related to granting various permission levels. The user mentions terms like \"added owners\" and \"full control permission levels,\" alongside their main problem of not finding the option to create a list in SharePoint. Since the focus is on ownership and access, I would categorize this ticket as \"Administrative rights.\"**Formatting the response**\n\nTo respond correctly, I need to provide the categorized category in the specified JSON-like schema. The format should state: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}. \n\nSo, I'll simply output the JSON object with the category field as: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I\u2019ll be careful to ensure the formatting is proper and stick to just the required category without extra text."
