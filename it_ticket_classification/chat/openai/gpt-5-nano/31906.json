I need to figure out how to categorize this IT ticket from the options provided: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the content relates to HR matters like leave approvals, \"HR Support\" makes sense. However, I\u2019m wondering if the user specifically wants it categorized that way.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user wrote a confusing message that mixes annual leave, public holidays, and resubmission requests. It seems they're looking to categorize this ticket possibly as \"HR Support\" since it's related to time off. Administrative rights don't apply here. I suppose \"Miscellaneous\" could work if it's unclear, but I see HR support is a better fit. Now, I need to respond in a JSON format that specifies the category, as that's what the prompt requires.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
