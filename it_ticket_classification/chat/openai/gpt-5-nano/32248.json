Given the mention of \"new project Oracle Fusion,\" it's likely an \"Internal Project.\" The request for \"attached code\" could hint at Access or Administrative rights, but I'll go with \"Internal Project\" since it most closely fits.**Categorizing IT request**\n\nThe user's request mentions attaching code, but it doesn't clearly indicate an access request. The phrase \"new project Oracle Fusion\" suggests it relates to an \"Internal Project.\" Meanwhile, \"unum\" could refer to a user number or something else, but it's unclear. Given the context, I think categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" best fits because it involves a new project and a potential code attachment. I'll format my response as a JSON object with the appropriate category.**Formatting category response**\n\nThe schema specifies that I should respond with a JSON object, where \"category\" contains the chosen category. It looks like the structure should be straightforward: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. While I think about whether \"Oracle Fusion\" might suggest an \"Access\" request, the safest choice seems to be \"Internal Project\" since it relates to a new project. I'll keep it clean and respond with just the JSON object without any extra comments. Here\u2019s my final answer: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
