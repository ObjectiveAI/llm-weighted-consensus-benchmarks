The issues described relate to noise from conditioning rooms that affects conference calls, along with microphones picking up outside noises. This seems to point toward \"Hardware\" since it involves audio equipment, but it could also fall under \"Internal Project\" if it's part of a larger initiative. If it doesn't fit neatly into those categories, maybe \"Miscellaneous\" would work better.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm sorting through categories for an IT ticket: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Since it's about microphones and sound equipment, I think \"Hardware\" makes the most sense. However, it could also qualify as \"Internal Project\" since it involves a consultant dealing with an issue. I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" because it clearly relates to the equipment involved. Now, I'll prepare a concise response and include the category in a JSON format.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
