The user is requesting a review of attached screenshots and is experiencing issues related to entering time and a change of assignee in their profile. It looks like it might fit into categories like \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" since it mentions profile changes and access issues. However, I think \"Access\" is the best choice because it focuses on those login and profile concerns.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe user is experiencing issues related to entering time and mentions amending their profile, which suggests administrative rights might be necessary. However, since they specifically refer to problems like not being able to enter hours for certain days and changes to their assignee, this seems more aligned with an access or permissions issue. I believe the best category for this ticket is \"Access,\" given the focus on login and profile changes. I'll respond with the JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
