However, it could also refer to an approval workflow where the order of approvers is adjusted. Okay, since we need to categorize this, it seems like \"Administrative rights\" fits best because adding an approver involves modifying permissions. But \"Access\" could also work here.**Categorizing access and approvals**\n\nI'm looking at this ticket that seems to deal with granting access or adding an approver in an Oracle system. It might fit under \"Access\" because it involves approvals, but \"Access\" usually covers login issues while \"Administrative rights\" focuses on privileges to manage the system. The request mentions information on approval, which could be vague and a candidate for \"Miscellaneous.\" However, since \"add approver\" pertains to access control, it seems more accurate to categorize it under \"Administrative rights.\"**Outputting category JSON**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to output a JSON object with the category field. The category here is \"Administrative rights,\" and I must ensure it matches the exact enum value. So I'll format it as {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.\n\nAlthough I wonder if I should add a justification, it seems the request only asks for categorization. Since the system requires a specific format, I'll stick to the JSON output and not text. Alright, I'll proceed with the JSON format."
