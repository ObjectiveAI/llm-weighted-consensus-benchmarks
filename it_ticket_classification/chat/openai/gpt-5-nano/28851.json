The key terms include \"new project,\" \"pm setup,\" and \"importance high,\" which makes it a bit tricky! \"PM\" might refer to \"project management\" or \"setup form.\" It seems fitting for the \"Internal Project\" category because it\u2019s about creating code as requested. There\u2019s also a chance it could fall under \"Access\" if they\u2019re asking for credentials or \"Administrative rights\" if they're requesting those.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the phrase \"costs move,\" which seems a bit odd. I need to pick a fitting category from the options available. \n\nAfter looking through them, \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Storage\" clearly don't apply. \"Access\" might work, but they didn't mention login credentials. While \"Purchase\" links to \"costs,\" the request for code creation suggests it's mainly an \"Internal Project.\" \n\nSo, I think the best choice is \"Internal Project,\" given all the references to project setup and forms. Now we need to present this as a JSON category object!**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that includes the category type for the IT ticket. Based on my analysis, I\u2019ll provide:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nThat fits perfectly! I might consider adding a brief note, but since the instruction specifically says to \"categorize this IT Ticket,\" I should keep it strictly to just the category value in the proper format. It\u2019s important to make sure the quotes and everything else are correct. So, I\u2019ll stick with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
