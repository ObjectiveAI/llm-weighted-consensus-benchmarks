The mention of \"maternity leave\" suggests the \"HR Support\" category as the most applicable. However, \"Administrative rights\" and \"Miscellaneous\" are also possibilities. Overall, \"HR Support\" seems to fit best.**Classifying the request**\n\nThe phrase \"re maternity leave\" indicates it's likely a request to update inventory, possibly regarding staff on maternity leave. It seems to lack an explicit IT element, so I need to decide between \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it doesn't mention access or credentials, \"HR Support\" fits best. Even though it's outside typical IT categories, the user wants it categorized, so I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\u2014minimal text as required."
