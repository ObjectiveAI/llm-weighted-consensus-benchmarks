I need to select from several categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It sounds like the ticket relates to internal project management since it mentions decommissioning resources and logging calls. I might lean towards classifying it as \"Internal Project\" but could also consider \"Administrative rights\" if access rights are involved.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe text provided isn\u2019t well-structured, but the focus is clearly on decommissioning resources and logging calls, possibly related to an October project management task. I see two main options for categorization: \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if admin privileges are needed, there\u2019s no explicit mention of that. \"Storage\" doesn\u2019t seem correct either. I feel \"Internal Project\" fits best, so I\u2019ll respond with that category in the required JSON-like format."
