The key phrases suggest it's related to a leaver center and leaver form. I'm considering \"Access\" due to the canceled accounts, and \"HR Support\" since it involves an intern leaving. Although it doesn't perfectly fit, \"HR Support\" is the closest option we have. So, I'll likely categorize this ticket under \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\"**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nIt looks like I need to categorize a ticket related to processing an intern's departure and revoking their accounts. \"Access\" would fit because it concerns access revocation, but \"Administrative rights\" could also apply as it relates to access management. However, since this involves notifying about canceled accounts, I think \"Access\" is the best choice here. It seems the user is asking for it to be categorized as an IT ticket, likely under \"Access.\" I'll prepare a JSON category object in response as instructed.**Formatting Category Response**\n\nI need to respond based on the prompt, which specifies a JSON format for the category. The required structure is an object keyed by \"category\" containing a string value from the defined enum. I\u2019m thinking the response should look like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. However, I also need to consider if \"HR Support\" might be a more fitting option since the ticket pertains to an intern. But I'll stick with the simpler response to keep it clear.**Determining Final Output**\n\nThe ticket states details about an intern's accounts being canceled, indicating it's a deprovision request. Given the references to \"leaver form\" and \"intern,\" the most precise category seems to be \"Access.\" While the system might use \"HR Support\" for HR-related processes, this particular ticket is clearly IT-related. So, I\u2019ll stick with \"Access\" and respond with just the required JSON object:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
