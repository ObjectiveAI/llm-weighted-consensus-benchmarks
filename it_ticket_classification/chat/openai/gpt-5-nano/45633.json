The issues raised include an \"invalid sign information\" error, which suggests it could relate to access issues. Since it seems like a software-related problem rather than hardware, I\u2019m leaning toward the \"Access\" category. The user mentions errors when trying to input data, which reinforces this idea. I'll be sure to classify it accordingly!**Finalizing the category output**\n\nI\u2019m working on categorizing the IT ticket, and \"Access\" seems to fit best since it involves authentication and login issues related to the Oracle problem. Although \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could be considered, \"Access\" is the most appropriate choice for the error described. \n\nI need to respond with the correct JSON format. So, the final output should be: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I\u2019ll ensure that\u2019s precise and meets the expected format!**Delivering the JSON output**\n\nI see that the schema specifies the object type with a category property, so I\u2019ll go ahead and provide the needed output. I\u2019ll make sure not to include any extra text\u2014just the JSON. \n\nThe final response will be: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. This way, I\u2019m following the format strictly and delivering exactly what\u2019s required. Let\u2019s deliver that cleanly!"
