The available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the user is requesting a new mouse, I\u2019m inclined to categorize this under either \"Hardware\" for device issues or \"Purchase\" because it involves procurement. However, I think the best fit here is \"Hardware,\" as it indicates a request for a replacement device.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI'm deciding on the category for the IT ticket requesting a new mouse due to an issue with the old one. The \"Hardware\" category feels most appropriate since it's about a hardware device. If they wanted to track procurement separately, they could choose \"Purchase.\" Given the nature of the request, I'll go with \"Hardware\" for the faulty mouse replacement. Finally, I'll respond in JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Keeping it concise without extra text!"
