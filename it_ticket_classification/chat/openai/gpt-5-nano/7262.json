They want it sorted into one of the categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nThe ticket is filled with IT terms related to network configuration and VPNs, which suggests it fits in the \"Access\" category. I'll respond with a JSON object containing the appropriate category.**Identifying category for network setup**\n\nThis ticket seems purely about technical network setup, and I need to find the best category. It's not hardware, HR, or access-related. It might fit as an \"Internal Project,\" since it's a network configuration for a specific project. However, it could also relate to \"Administrative rights\" if it involves authorization. The content includes some jumbled phrases about client management and VPN configurations, making it tricky. Given the context about VPN setup, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit.**Deciding on the Access category**\n\nIt looks like this ticket is primarily about \"Access,\" since it involves user access and establishing VPN connections. The mentions of remote authentication, pre-shared keys, and tunnels make it clear. Key phrases throughout the ticket, like \"set up required\" and \"authentication,\" all suggest it's focused on VPN access for a client. So, categorizing it as \"Access\" seems appropriate. I'll respond with the JSON format required: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's make sure that formatting is perfect!"
