The text mentions a new purchase and some specifics about logging the allocation and mandatory receipts. I need to choose from several categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. Since the content is related to a purchase, I think it fits best under the \"Purchase\" category. So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object stating: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket text talks about a new purchase order for a professional backpack, including instructions on logging allocation and considering mandatory receipts. It seems primarily related to purchasing and asset management. While there are various categories like \"Administrative rights\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" the best fit is \"Purchase\" since this is what the request is focused on. There isn't a direct category for procurement, making \"Purchase\" the most accurate choice.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
