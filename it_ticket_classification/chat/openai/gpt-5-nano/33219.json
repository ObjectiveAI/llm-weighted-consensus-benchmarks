The categories available are: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nThe ticket text seems to describe a scheduled outage notification. It might relate to \"Change management\" or \"Maintenance window,\" so it likely fits into the \"Hardware,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access\" categories due to its focus on an outage notification affecting equipment. \n\nI need to make a clear choice here!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe content mentions a \"scheduled outage,\" \"equipment room,\" \"engineer,\" and \"electric center,\" which leads me to consider categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the categories are fixed, we might lean toward \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" A scheduled outage likely relates to maintenance, which isn't explicitly listed.\n\nWhile \"Access\" seems relevant for permission control, the focus here is on operational IT maintenance. This ticket could fit nicely in \"Miscellaneous\" as a catch-all for uncertain categorization.**Choosing a category for the ticket**\n\nI need to select a category for this ticket that mentions a \"notification of scheduled outage.\" It feels like it's directed toward building administrators, which makes me think about \"Maintenance,\" but that's not an option. \n\nGiven that the details are ambiguous, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a safe choice. However, considering that outages affect network access, \"Access\" might also fit, but it doesn't explicitly mention access either. The references to the equipment room and electrical center lead me to lean toward categorizing it as \"Hardware.\"**Outputting the category in JSON**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket that indicates an outage. Since \"Maintenance\" isn't available, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best option. \n\nI'll suggest \"Miscellaneous\" and include a justification while asking for confirmation or alternative suggestions if I'm wrong. The prompt is really clear about the format\u2014it wants a JSON output. \n\nI'll produce it as `{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}` to match the required schema exactly. So, my final answer will be that JSON object!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
