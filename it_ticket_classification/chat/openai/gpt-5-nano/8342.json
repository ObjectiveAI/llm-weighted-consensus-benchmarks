The phrases about \"applicants,\" \"students,\" \"courses,\" and \"prepare materials\" suggest it could relate to creating educational content. I\u2019m considering whether to classify it as an \"Internal Project\" since it seems like a project request, or potentially as \"Administrative rights\" if that's relevant. It might also fit under \"Miscellaneous\" if it\u2019s too unclear.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the IT ticket, and it seems to involve creating courses for students and applicants, suggesting it's related to an \"Internal Project.\" This matches better than any other category given the context. I need to organize the response in a JSON format, clearly indicating \"Internal Project\" as the category. The correct format for this would be a JSON object with \"category\" set, so I\u2019ll structure it like this: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. That's the direction I should take!**Clarifying JSON Format**\n\nI\u2019m double-checking the schema for the IT ticket response. It specifies that I need to create an object with a \"category\" property of type string and defined possible values. However, it doesn't clarify the exact output format beyond that. \n\nBased on previous tasks, I should produce a clean JSON object like: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. I need to ensure I'm using the exact string, so I'm set to respond succinctly without any extra commentary. The final answer is simply: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
