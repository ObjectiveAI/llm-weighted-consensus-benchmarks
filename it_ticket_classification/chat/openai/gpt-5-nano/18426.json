The available categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket mentions various hardware devices and adapters, as well as a purchase order. Given the keywords like \"purchased devices,\" \"thunderbolt adapter,\" and \"installation,\" I think categorizing this ticket under \"Hardware\" seems most fitting. \"Purchase\" is another potential category due to the mention of \"purchase order.\"**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the eight available categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket mentions installation, devices, adapters, and purchase orders. Since it focuses on devices and installation, I think \"Hardware\" is the best category. However, \"Purchase\" might apply due to the mention of \"purchase order.\" Still, the emphasis seems to be on action regarding hardware management. So, I\u2019ll classify this ticket under \"Hardware\" and format the response as a JSON object.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
