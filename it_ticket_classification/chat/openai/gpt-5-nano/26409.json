There are hints toward HR and onboarding tasks, which makes me lean towards \"HR Support.\" However, since it involves equipment, \"Hardware\" could also be relevant. There's a mention of \"Access\" for provisioning credentials. Overall, it seems most likely that this ticket falls under \"HR Support\" or \"Hardware\" due to the focus on onboarding.**Evaluating IT ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. The content mentions \"starter form\" and \"prepare his equipment,\" which points to onboarding tasks. It could be \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but since it\u2019s an IT ticket, \"Access\" for setting up accounts might also be relevant. However, given the context and focus on onboarding, \"HR Support\" seems to be the best fit despite some garbled wording in the ticket.**Analyzing IT ticket content**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"prepare his equipment,\" which clearly refers to hardware provisioning, and \"starter form,\" indicating tasks like filling and returning forms for a new starter. If I have to categorize this into a single category, \"Hardware\" seems most fitting due to the focus on equipment. While \"Access\" could apply for provisioning accounts, it\u2019s not explicitly mentioned. The onboarding aspect suggests \"HR Support\" too, but ultimately, I believe \"Hardware\" is the best choice given the context.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
