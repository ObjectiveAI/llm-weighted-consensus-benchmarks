The content suggests it\u2019s about adding a user and setting an Active Directory (AD) owner. This likely falls under either Access or Administrative Rights since both relate to user account creation and permissions. Considering the details mentioned, the appropriate category for this ticket seems to be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Let\u2019s go with that!**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nThe phrase \"add ad owner\" likely refers to assigning an Active Directory owner, which could mean granting AD owner rights. I\u2019m weighing whether to categorize this under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" If the ticket involves adding a user, it typically falls under \"Access provisioning.\" However, the mention of \"AD owner\" suggests an administrative role in managing access rights. Since both categories are relevant, I\u2019ll lean towards \"Administrative rights\" since it involves granting permissions at an admin level.**Finalizing the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the ticket since it mentions adding a user and an AD owner. The straightforward interpretation leans toward \"Access\" since it involves user addition. However, the \"AD owner\" complicates things, suggesting it also relates to \"Administrative rights.\" If there\u2019s any ambiguity, I can categorize it as \"Access\" since the main focus seems to be on provisioning a user. So, I think it\u2019s safest to categorize this as \"Access\" to reflect that primary action.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
