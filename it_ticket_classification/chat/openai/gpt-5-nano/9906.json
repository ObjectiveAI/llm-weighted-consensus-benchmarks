Given the context, my best guess is \"HR Support,\" as it relates to onboarding processes for new interns. Let\u2019s structure that in the JSON format!**Choosing the Best Category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize the IT ticket regarding new starters and interns. It seems to fall under \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Administrative rights,\" depending on whether it\u2019s about onboarding or access rights. However, the phrase \"hi please fill\" leans towards filling out forms, likely related to HR processes. Since the user\u2019s message is about onboarding new starter interns by Thursday, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"HR Support\" to best match its intent.**Preparing the JSON Output**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object categorizing the IT ticket as \"HR Support.\" The instructions are clear: only provide the exact JSON object without any additional comments. I\u2019ll format it correctly to ensure it\u2019s valid. The correct output will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This matches the category enumeration provided and keeps everything concise. I'll make sure there\u2019s no extra information included\u2014just straightforward JSON!"
