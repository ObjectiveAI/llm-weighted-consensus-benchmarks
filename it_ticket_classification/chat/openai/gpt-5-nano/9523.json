However, I also recognize that \"Hardware\" applies as it refers to a physical item. I'll conclude that \"Purchase\" is the most appropriate category for this request.**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nThe user is asking for a categorization of their ticket, specifically to \"provide bag,\" which I see as a procurement request. This means I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase.\" The system requires a response in JSON format, so I need to ensure I adhere to the proper casing and structure. The final output will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nI won\u2019t include any extra explanations since the user didn\u2019t request them. Time to finalize this!"
