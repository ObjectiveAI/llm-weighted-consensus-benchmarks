The ticket refers to an employee leaving, mentioning things like a leaver form, mailbox, and AD rights. It looks like the main aspects involve offboarding tasks like accessing and managing accounts. I\u2019m considering which category fits best: \u201cAccess,\u201d \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d or \u201cHR Support.\u201d It seems pretty clear that \u201cAccess\u201d could be the most appropriate choice for this situation.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking to categorize this IT ticket, which seems focused on offboarding tasks like managing mailboxes, roaming profiles, and access rights. While \u201cHR Support\u201d might fit the offboarding aspect, this ticket is more about IT-related actions, making \u201cAccess\u201d a better choice. There\u2019s also mention of \"Administrative rights,\" but the overall focus on access deprovisioning points me back to \u201cAccess.\u201d Finally, I\u2019ll format this as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. That should do the trick!"
