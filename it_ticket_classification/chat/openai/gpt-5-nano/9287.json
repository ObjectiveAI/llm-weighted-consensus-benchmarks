I consider \"HR Support\" for onboarding or \"Access\" for user access provisioning. I need to decide which category fits best for this IT ticket.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nIt looks like this request is about onboarding form completion. The phrase \"starter form complete\" suggests that the onboarding form is done, while \"please help completed form joining nj\" may indicate a request for assistance. Since it's related to HR onboarding, \"HR Support\" seems fitting. However, since it\u2019s an IT ticket, I wonder if \"Access\" might apply due to access provisioning. Still, the focus seems to be on completing the form, so I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it under \"HR Support.\"{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
