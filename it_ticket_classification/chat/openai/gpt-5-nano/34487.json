The ticket mentions issues like login errors, password changes, and access rights. This all points towards an Access issue. The user is trying to log into Oracle and seems to need help with their credentials and login process. While \"Administrative rights\" might be relevant, since the focus is on accessing the system and the training session, I'll categorize it as Access.**Crafting IT Ticket Response**\n\nI need to provide a concise answer for categorizing the IT ticket, and I\u2019ve decided on the category \"Access.\" The instructions call for a specific format, similar to JSON, with a clear \"category\" field. So, I will respond simply with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to avoid any extra commentary and just focus on delivering the required output in the right format. Let's make sure everything is properly quoted and ready for submission."
