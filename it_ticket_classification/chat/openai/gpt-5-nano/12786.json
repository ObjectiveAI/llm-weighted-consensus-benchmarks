The ticket text is a bit jumbled, mentioning a request for moving VC equipment from the Fuji floor with a deadline of Friday. It appears to be about video conference equipment. Once I clarify that, I can determine the right category for the ticket.**Interpreting IT ticket request**\n\nI\u2019m interpreting a request to move VC equipment, asking for help by Wednesday, July. It seems they're looking to transfer video conference equipment from the Fuji floor to another location called Pulp Fiction. They need it functional until Friday, suggesting it's a hardware issue primarily. I think the best category for this ticket is \"Hardware.\" However, there's a chance access might be involved, but primarily it's about relocating equipment. I\u2019ll respond with the correct JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user requested to categorize an IT ticket, so I\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like output. The schema specifies that the category must be a string from an allowed list, like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. Given the request relates to moving video conference equipment, I believe \"Hardware\" is the appropriate category. I\u2019ll keep it concise and format it correctly: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. No extra text needed!"
