It might fit into \"Access\" if the focus was on booking holidays in the system, but there's no mention of \"login\" or \"permissions.\" The user seems to be asking if employees in Germany can book holidays like others. It looks like HR policy content, so I\u2019m leaning towards \"HR Support.\" Administrative rights seem less relevant here. I'm confident the best label is \"HR Support,\" and I\u2019ll format my response accordingly as a JSON object.**Finalizing category choice**\n\nThe ticket is definitely falling under \"HR Support.\" Even though it wasn't explicitly asked, I'm confident that aligns best with the content discussed. I need to finalize this decision and prepare the response. It\u2019s clear that this relates to HR policies, particularly around holiday booking. Now, I'm ready to present it clearly in the required format. So, let\u2019s just go ahead and submit it!"
