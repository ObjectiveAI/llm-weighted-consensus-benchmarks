It mentions attempts to approve weeks but is unclear. The categories I have are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It seems related to either access to the Oracle system or possible HR support with timesheets. I\u2019ll need to decide on the best category.**Categorizing Oracle issues**\n\nI'm analyzing a ticket about Oracle software, which mentions issues with \"approving Oracle not working\". This likely relates to months' timesheet approvals in Oracle's systems. I have categories to consider: Access, Administrative rights, Internal Project, and HR Support. However, it seems more IT-related than HR. The most fitting category looks to be Access, since it relates to permissions needed to approve timecards. The user seems to have difficulties with that approval process.**Categorizing IT ticket in JSON**\n\nIn considering the ticket, it could fall under \"Internal Project,\" but given it's a general IT inquiry, the best fit is likely \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The phrase \"approving Oracle not working\" suggests issues with permissions for approvals in Oracle. Therefore, I\u2019m concluding that \"Access\" is the right category. \n\nTo respond correctly, I\u2019ll format this as a JSON object. The user only needs the category output. So, it\u2019ll be structured like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
