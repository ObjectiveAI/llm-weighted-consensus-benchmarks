There might be a specific list of items to guide me in this process. I wonder if I have all the necessary information or if I need to ask the user for more details. It\u2019s important to ensure it goes to the right place! Let's get this categorized properly.**Determining the Best Category**\n\nI'm trying to find the best fit for categorizing this IT ticket, which involves periodical tasks like weekly cleanup and updates tied to infrastructure. The options are limited to Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Since the ticket seems related to ongoing tasks, I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project,\" but \"Miscellaneous\" could also work as a catch-all. It\u2019s a bit tricky to decide, but I'll pick the most relevant option!**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize this IT ticket, and it's a good idea to propose a category based on the content. It mentions \"infrastructure,\" \"weekly,\" and \"periodical tickets,\" indicating it deals with ongoing project management. \"Internal Project\" fits best because it refers to recurring tasks. I'll go ahead and format my response as a JSON object for clarity: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. That seems like the most appropriate choice!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
