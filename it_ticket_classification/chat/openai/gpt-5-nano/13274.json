The categories provided include options like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the ticket specifically mentions network hardware like switches and ports, \u201cHardware\u201d seems to be the best fit. The system categories are limited, but I\u2019ll classify it as \"Hardware\" because it's focused on network infrastructure issues. Then, I\u2019ll prepare the JSON output with the category field.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe prompt requires me to categorize the IT ticket and respond with a JSON-like object. I see that it should include a \"category\" field with a string value that's an enum. So, I\u2019ll create the response as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll need to avoid any extra commentary and just deliver the JSON in the required format. The system allows for \"final\" channels, so I\u2019ll go ahead and respond with the JSON object."
