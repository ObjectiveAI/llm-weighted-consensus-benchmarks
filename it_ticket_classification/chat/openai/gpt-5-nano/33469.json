The ticket asks for immediate action, which suggests it's about access control. There are two possible categories: \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since this request is specifically about revoking user access, it leans more towards the \"Access\" category. However, \"Administrative rights\" also fits since it entails managing account permissions. I'll have to choose the most precise option between the two.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket is focused on disabling an Active Directory account, which is primarily about access management. I think \"Access\" is the right category since it relates to revoking access rather than altering administrative rights. While there\u2019s a mention of \"Administrative rights,\" the request specifically emphasizes disabling the account, not modifying privileges. Since it includes a timeframe too, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" Now I need to respond with a JSON object showing this category clearly.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
