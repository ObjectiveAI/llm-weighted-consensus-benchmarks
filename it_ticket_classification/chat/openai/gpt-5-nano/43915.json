The ticket text seems a bit jumbled, but it looks like it's discussing changes to an approval flow for projects. It might fit under \u201cAdministrative Rights\u201d if it's related to access or approvals, or \u201cInternal Project\u201d since it mentions an approval flow change for a project. Let\u2019s see how best to classify it!**Classifying approval request**\n\nIt seems this ticket is about a request for approval changes. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it under \"Administrative Rights,\" but it might also fit \"Internal Project\" since it discusses project workflow changes. The phrase \"codes still go instead\" could relate to approval codes. This doesn\u2019t seem to involve hardware, storage, or purchases. \"Access\" also doesn't quite fit since it\u2019s more about the approval flow than user access. I think \"Internal Project\" is the most suitable category here.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI believe the best categorization for this request is \"Internal Project,\" as it suggests a change or enhancement to the internal project workflow. \"Administrative Rights\" could apply if admin access is needed to modify the approval flow. The ticket indicates urgency with \"please let know when be done,\" pointing to a disruption caused by the approval change requested in November. Given that it concerns the project approval flow, I\u2019ll go ahead and categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" Now I'll format it as JSON.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
