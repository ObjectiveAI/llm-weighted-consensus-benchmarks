It seems related to hourly employment changes mentioned. I need to provide a clear JSON object that fits the required schema. The structure needs to be \u201ctype: object\u201d with the specified properties and categories. Let me organize that and ensure the JSON format is correct according to the guidelines provided, focusing on the HR aspect since that feels most appropriate.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI need to format the output correctly. The required output is a JSON object that specifies the category, which I\u2019ve identified as \"HR Support.\" The standard format looks like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. The task is straightforward since the system expects this structure without any additional commentary. So, I\u2019ll just return the categorized output directly as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} and avoid any extra text, keeping it clear and concise!"
