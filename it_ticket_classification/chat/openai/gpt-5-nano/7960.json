The choices are somewhat limited, like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and a few others. Since there's no \"Software\" category, it seems to fit best under Hardware because OS installation relates to hardware setup, even though it's technically software. \"Internal Project\" might work if it's project-related, but in this case, Hardware appears to be the most fitting choice.**Formatting JSON for IT ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"traceability reasons\" alongside \"within discussed\" hints at project governance, but I have limited category options. I need to format my response as JSON, specifically under the category \"Hardware.\" The structure requires that I include the \"type\": \"object\" wrapper defined in the schema. Ultimately, I should produce the following JSON output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This indicates that the request pertains to hardware setup, which is the most fitting choice given the context. A brief justification could be helpful too.**Delivering the category in JSON**\n\nThe prompt is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket. While I could just provide the category name, the format requires a JSON object. There are mentions of \"macs\" and \"OS installation,\" which point towards IT work. Although \"Internal Project\" could be relevant for traceability, the core task here is about installing the OS on two Macs. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" and output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
