This leads me to think it falls under \"HR Support,\" as it's related to hiring interns and filling out a form. So, checking the options, \"HR Support\" definitely seems like the best fit for this ticket.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm considering categorizing an IT ticket based on the details provided. The ticket mentions onboarding interns and filling out forms. \"HR Support\" seems to best fit this context, even though \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" could also apply. Since it's clearly about hiring and onboarding, I will go with \"HR Support.\" Plus, I need to craft the output in a specific JSON format that will include the chosen category. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
