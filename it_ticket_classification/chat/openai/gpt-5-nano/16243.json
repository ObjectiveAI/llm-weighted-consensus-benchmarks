Given the categories available, \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware\" seems appropriate. I'll need to output this in a JSON format with the property \"category\" reflecting my choice. Let\u2019s get this sorted!**Deciding on a ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that the best category for this ticket is likely \"Hardware,\" since it\u2019s about a laptop being needed for an intern. However, it could also fall under \"Purchase,\" since it requests procuring a laptop. Many IT systems categorize such requests this way. The phrase indicates provisioning a laptop rather than a purchase order. Given the internal nature of the request, it seems more appropriate to classify it as \"Hardware.\" Now I just need to format my output!**Formatting JSON output**\n\nIn many IT ticket systems, requests for new hardware are categorized as \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" Since the user asked to categorize this ticket, I\u2019ll choose \"Hardware.\" The required output format indicates that I need to provide a JSON object with a \"category\" property.\n\nI\u2019ll confirm that the capitalization is correct before finalizing my output. So, I'll go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nNo extra text, just the JSON format as instructed!"
