It mentions \"return from maternity\" and seems related to preparing access for equipment, which makes me think it could fit into \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since the user talks about a work order and an attached form, I need to decide which category best matches. I\u2019m leaning toward \"Access\" because it seems to focus on enabling access for equipment and accounts.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m assessing whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The phrase \"equipment accesses\" indicates that it\u2019s likely about access to equipment or systems, making \"Access\" the right choice. They mention \"Oracle,\" which might be a system reference, but it\u2019s not crucial. Since they want a completed form for access and are returning from maternity leave, I conclude that \"Access\" is the best fit. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object stating: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ll output simply: {\"category\":\"Access\"} since the instructions indicate that I should respond with just the category. The system's schema specifies that I provide a JSON object that includes only the category. It's essential to make sure the capitalization is correct, as it must exactly match the enum value. While I briefly considered \"Administrative rights,\" the user\u2019s mention of \u201cequipment accesses\u201d leads me to conclude that \"Access\" is the appropriate category. So, I\u2019m set with {\"category\":\"Access\"}!"
