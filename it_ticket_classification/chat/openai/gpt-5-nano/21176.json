It's important to classify the ticket based on its content accurately. I'll look closely at what the ticket says and match it to the best-fitting category. This way, it can be handled properly and efficiently!**Clarifying the ticket content**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a complex text that includes terms like \"leaver,\" \"unblock,\" \"urgent,\" and references to a brother returning a card. It appears to focus on deactivating or unblocking access for a leaver or contractor, including concerns about returning a card, access management, and possibly extensions in Active Directory. Given the context and key phrases, it seems that categorizing this ticket under \"Access\" is the most fitting choice. I'll make sure to handle it accordingly!**Formatting the JSON response**\n\nI need to create a JSON-like object based on the given schema. It specifies that the output should have a \"category\" property with allowed values like \"Access.\" The final format should be concise and free of extra text. So, my response will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This matches the requirement perfectly! I\u2019ll make sure to stick to this format and keep it clear and straightforward."
