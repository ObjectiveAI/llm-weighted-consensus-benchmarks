The main issue is that Outlook crashes when connected to the network, and since there\u2019s also a browser status involved, this could point to a software issue. The allowed categories are limited, and \"Software\" isn't one of them. Considering the options, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the best fit for this ticket, as it encompasses a range of related issues.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m narrowing down the IT ticket categorization. I ruled out options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase.\" \"Access\" might work since the issue talks about crashes when connected, hinting at possible web access problems. However, since the main issue revolves around Outlook crashing, I lean towards \"Miscellaneous\" since \"Software\" isn\u2019t listed. This seems like the safest choice given the context. So, I'll output a JSON object with the category set to \"Miscellaneous.\"**Building JSON structure**\n\nI need to provide the JSON structure according to the category schema. The required output format is: {\"category\": \"...\"}. Since the best categorization for this IT ticket is \"Miscellaneous,\" I\u2019ll produce the output as follows: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.\n\nWhile a brief note could be helpful, the user specifically asked just for the categorization, so I\u2019ll focus solely on delivering that JSON. I want to ensure that I match the exact casing, so it\u2019ll be \"Miscellaneous\" exactly. Let's respond with that!"
