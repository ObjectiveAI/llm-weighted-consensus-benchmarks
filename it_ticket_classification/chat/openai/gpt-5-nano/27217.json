Given that it's regarding onboarding a new starter, \"HR Support\" stands out as the most suitable choice. Phrases like \"complete form\" and \"compliance officer\" hint at HR procedures, while \"Access\" could be relevant if access to systems is needed. However, there are no specific mentions of passwords or accounts. So, I\u2019ll categorize the ticket as \"HR Support\" and prepare to output a JSON-like object for it.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
