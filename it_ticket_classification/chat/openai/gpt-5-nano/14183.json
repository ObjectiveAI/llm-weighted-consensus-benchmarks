It looks like it falls under categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights\" since they mention wanting to share information with the project manager. Given that it specifically mentions sharing related to hiring, I\u2019m leaning towards \"HR Support.\" So, I'll format my output as JSON: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt looks like the user is asking about sharing hiring interview assessors related to the testing discipline with the PM. This could involve access rights to calendars and scheduling layouts, particularly the phrase \"accept decline layouts\" suggests something about managing invite responses. I think it's best categorized as \"HR Support\" since it specifically focuses on hiring processes. Given the context, I\u2019ll go ahead and respond with the JSON output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Generating JSON output**\n\nI need to focus on delivering the required output clearly and concisely without any extra text. The instruction asks for a category format, so I\u2019m going to respond with a JSON object that indicates the appropriate category. Based on the context, I\u2019ll present it as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It\u2019s a straightforward task, and I\u2019ll make sure to keep it clean and clear. Let's get that output formatted properly!"
