I\u2019ll avoid any extra text since it's specified to keep it clean and straightforward.**Formatting the category object**\n\nI need to follow the allowed format for the output, which is a \"category\" object containing a property called \"category\" with a specific string.

I should stick to this straightforward result, without any additional analysis or text. Just keeping it clean and to the point!"
