The ticket mentions \"oracle mobile expense password,\" the \"mobile expense app,\" and something about being \"registered under number\" and \"subsidiaries separate entity.\" It seems related to access issues with the Oracle Mobile Expense app, likely needing a password or resetting one. So, I'm considering whether this fits better under the \"Access\" category or \"Administrative rights.\"**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI think this ticket relates to accessing an Oracle mobile expense application, probably about passwords or login credentials, which would place it in the Access category. The user's message is quite garbled, but there are key phrases like \"oracle mobile expense password,\" \"installed mobile expense app,\" and \"registered under number.\" While Administrative rights is another possibility, it seems less likely. I'll go with Access, so I need to respond with a category JSON object.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
