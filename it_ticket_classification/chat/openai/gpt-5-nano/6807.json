I could consider \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Access\" is the best fit. I'll respond with a JSON object for the category.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nThe required format is clear: a JSON object containing a \"category\" field with a string from the allowed options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Access.\" Based on the ticket details, I\u2019ll output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI think it might be good to include a brief justification, but the instructions seem to emphasize only providing this JSON object. I\u2019ll keep it concise and ensure there\u2019s no extra commentary. The focus is solely on delivering the correct structure."
