The user provided several details like leaver dates, mailbox information, access rights, and inventory storage. It clearly relates to \"employee offboarding.\" I\u2019ll choose the most fitting category from options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. This involves determining the best fit for aspects like AD rights, roaming profiles, and leaving details.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nThis IT ticket likely falls under \"Access\" since it mentions AD rights, mailbox, and roaming profiles related to permissions and access removal. It could also fit \"Administrative Rights\" as AD rights are administrative in nature, but \"Access\" feels more general. The ticket discusses offboarding, including terms like \"leaver form\" and \"leave date.\" While HR Support might seem applicable, since this is an IT ticket, I\u2019ll categorize it as {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
