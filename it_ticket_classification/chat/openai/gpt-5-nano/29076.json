The user wants to know which category to assign from the allowed list. Since the ticket is about connecting a PC to the network, it likely fits best under Access or Network connectivity, but we don\u2019t have a specific \"Networking\" category.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the categories\u2014Hardware, Access, Storage, Administrative rights, Miscellaneous, Internal Project, Purchase, HR Support. The request is about connecting a PC to the network, which fits well under the Access category. The phrase \"si share la folder\" suggests sharing a folder, relating to network shares or permissions, which could also imply Access or Storage. However, since the main request involves connecting the PC, I think \"Access\" is the best choice. I need to respond with a JSON object showing this category.**Outputting the category**\n\nI\u2019m considering if we should provide a justification alongside the category. The task is to respond with a category in JSON format. I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\": \"Access\"}, which seems accurate because it reflects user access rights related to the network. While \"Storage\" might also apply due to the \"shared folder,\" the main focus is on connecting to the network, which aligns best with \"Access.\" So I\u2019ll just deliver that JSON without any extra text."
