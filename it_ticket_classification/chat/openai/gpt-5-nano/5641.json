I think categorizing it as \"Access\" makes sense because it's about password expiration. It could be \"Administrative rights\" if it's solely about changing the password, but I lean towards \"Access.\" Now, I'll format the output in JSON. \n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Access\"}}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
