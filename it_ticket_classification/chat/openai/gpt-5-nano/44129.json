The user mentions they\u2019re being asked for credentials repeatedly. There are categories available, like \"Access\" which fits since it relates to login issues and password requests, and \"Administrative rights\" which pertains to needing admin privileges. I think \"Access\" is the best choice here, since the main focus seems to be on credential access.**Categorizing as Access**\n\nI think the best category for this ticket is \"Access,\" since it's related to prompts about credentials and login issues. I need to respond with a JSON object to meet the required format. The instructions say to output just the category, without any extra commentary. So, I'll format my response as: {\"category\":\"Access\"} ensuring there are no unnecessary characters. I\u2019m keeping it straightforward and clear. Here goes!"
