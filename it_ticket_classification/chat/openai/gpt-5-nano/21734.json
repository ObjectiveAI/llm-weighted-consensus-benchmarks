The format requires a specific JSON object structure. So, I should provide: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}}. I\u2019ll just include the category as \"Access\" in the needed format.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to format the response correctly. The main thing is to output the category as just {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Even though there\u2019s a schema specifying \"type\":\"object\" and \"properties,\" I need to stick to the simple format required for the answer. Now, while it might be nice to add a justification, the instruction indicates that I should only categorize. So I\u2019ll go ahead and finalize just with the category as mentioned."
