It looks like they\u2019re asking to process an employee's off-boarding since their last day is tomorrow. The user mentions \"leaver\" and seems to be the infrastructure manager. I think the main focus is on removing access, so the appropriate categories would be \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\" Given that it\u2019s about processing a leaver and removing access, I'll go with \"Access.\"**Finalizing the category response**\n\nI\u2019m thinking through the ticket categorization again. While \"HR Support\" could relate to off-boarding, it's more of an IT request for access removal. The phrase \"process leaver his last tomorrow\" clearly indicates an off-boarding task. \"Access\" fits best, as it's more general for deprovisioning, even though \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, it's not specifically about rights. I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
