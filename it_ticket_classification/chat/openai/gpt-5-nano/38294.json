They want to know why the estimated value field is locked and mention needing to update it. It really seems to be about access rights or locked fields in the system. So my best guess is that it fits into either the \"Access\" category or \"Administrative rights\" category since it's about unlocking a field or adjusting permissions.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm trying to figure out the best category for the ticket regarding the user's issue with a locked field. \"Administrative rights\" is about privileges and actions, often linked to granting permissions, which fits their request to \"check why estimated value field locked.\" However, this seems focused on access control, leading me to think it might fit better under \"Access.\" \n\nSo, to format my final response as requested, it could be either: {\"category\":\"Access\"} or {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. It feels like \"Access\" might be the better choice based on the context.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI need to decide on the right category for this ticket. It primarily asks why fields are locked and mentions the ability to update, which points towards \"Administrative rights\" since that relates to permissions for making updates. Although \"Access\" also fits access issues broadly, being more specific feels right here. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" and format my response simply as: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I'll keep it minimal since that\u2019s what\u2019s required!"
