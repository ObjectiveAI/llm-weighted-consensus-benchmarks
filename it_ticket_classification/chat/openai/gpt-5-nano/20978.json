The text isn't very clear, but I see keywords like \"adding a user,\" \"tuesday,\" and \"please add requisitions.\" \n\nGiven this information, I think the best category would be either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" since it involves user access. I'll finalize this classification based on the provided content.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nThe user is asking to add someone, likely granting access, and mentions requisitions, which might be requests related to access. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" are two possible categories here. The ticket suggests adding a user to something related to \"tuesday february pm,\" which could indicate a meeting or group. The wording isn't very clear, and phrases like \"hello please add requisitions\" seem a bit jumbled, but I think the most fitting category is \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
