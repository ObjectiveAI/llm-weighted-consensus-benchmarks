The content mentions approval delegation, rights delegation, and holiday-related issues. It seems to fit within the \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" categories.

This ticket definitely highlights a need for understanding how to delegate approvals and manage rights during holidays, so I\u2019ll categorize it accordingly!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI see that the user\u2019s string includes phrases like \"delegate his rights\" and \"delegate approvals,\" indicating it\u2019s about managing approvals and rights in a system. This leads me to think it fits well under \"Access,\" or more specifically, \"Administrative rights.\" Given that we're looking for the most precise category, I\u2019ll go with \"Administrative rights\" for this IT ticket. I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format for clarity.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
