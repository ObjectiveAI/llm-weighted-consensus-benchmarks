The categories provided include \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" and others. Given that the ticket mentions both a desktop and TV screens, it's reasonable to categorize it under \"Hardware.\" However, if it's more about acquiring the TV screens, \"Purchase\" could fit too. In this case, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" for the classification.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"desktop for its area\" and \"provide TV screens,\" which indicates it's about hardware, likely making \"Hardware\" the best category choice. The reference to \"wonder cube\" suggests they want a display area similar to something already in place, further supporting the hardware classification. Given the prompt, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object with the category as \"Hardware,\" ensuring it aligns with the required output format specified in the instructions.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nThe system indicates that I need to output a JSON object with a \"category\" key. Given the context, the best choice for the category is \"Hardware.\" I will format my response without any extra commentary, adhering strictly to the provided schema. Following the instructions, I\u2019ll simply respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI want to ensure everything is correctly formatted, so there\u2019s no confusion. Let's finalize this!"
