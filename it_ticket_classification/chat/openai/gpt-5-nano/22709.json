I considered if it could fall under \u201cPurchase,\u201d but since it\u2019s requesting a cable, the \u201cHardware\u201d category feels like the best fit. I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object that reflects this decision, maintaining the required structure.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket about a monitor cable. The clearest fit seems to be \"Hardware,\" since it's specifically about hardware. I had a slight hesitation thinking it could be \"Purchase,\" but since the user is requesting additional cables rather than explicitly asking to buy them, \"Hardware\" makes more sense. The wording is just a bit jumbled, but the context points to hardware being the main focus here.**Preparing the JSON response**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to choose \"Hardware\" as the category for the ticket. Now, I\u2019m getting ready to prepare the JSON object. It looks like the correct format is just the category, so it should be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nSince the system specifies this format, I\u2019ll respond with that JSON and no extra text. It\u2019s clear and straightforward, which is perfect for the user\u2019s request!"
