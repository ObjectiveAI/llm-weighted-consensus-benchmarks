The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, and more. The user's message is quite garbled but mentions deleting, a candidate, and requisition. It seems related to HR, possibly about deleting a candidate's profile. However, if it\u2019s about administrative rights for deletion, that might fit another category too. I think \"HR Support\" is the most likely choice, but I\u2019m unsure.**Parsing IT Ticket Request**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the user's message about deleting something related to a candidate. It\u2019s a bit jumbled and includes several phrases like \u201cdeleting,\u201d \u201cjuly pm,\u201d and \u201cplease help.\u201d It seems like they\u2019re asking to delete a candidate with a specific ID in an HR system. \"HR Support\" appears to be the right category since it involves candidate deletion. However, if they need specific rights to do that, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d might also fit. So, I\u2019m leaning towards \"HR Support.\"**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories for the IT helpdesk. Since the question is about the HR system, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit, unless it\u2019s related to administrative rights for deletion. There's no mention of hardware or other categories. I need to prepare a JSON object for the category response. The correct format is crucial, so it should be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to output only this JSON object without any additional commentary.**Preparing IT Ticket Response**\n\nThe user requested that I categorize an IT ticket. After reviewing the information provided, I\u2019ll respond with the category: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It's good to double-check that \"HR Support\" is one of the allowed categories, and it is. So, I\u2019m all set to finalize this response without any extra commentary. I\u2019ll make sure the format is exactly right!"
