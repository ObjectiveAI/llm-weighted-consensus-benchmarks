However, \"Administrative rights\" could also fit. The content is a bit messy, but at its core, it really revolves around sending messages to all staff.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like I need to categorize the ticket as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \n\n\"Access\" would work for general permissions issues, while \"Administrative rights\" fits better for requests involving owner-level permissions. The phrases \"owner permissions\" and \"permissions ask owner\" indicate the user is requesting specific admin-level access. So, I\u2019m deciding to categorize this as \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nI\u2019ll format my response in JSON as required: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I'll make sure to follow the strict output format.**Following response instructions**\n\nThe instructions indicate I need to respond with a JSON object that has a single property called \"category.\" This property is a string that must be one of the specified options. \n\nSo, I will format my response as: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I'll keep it simple and direct without any extra text, just getting right to the required format."
