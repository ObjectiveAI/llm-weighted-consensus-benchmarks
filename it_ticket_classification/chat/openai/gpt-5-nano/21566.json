The portion about \"change friday february pm\" suggests a request to change something scheduled for February on a Friday. Since it mentions \"android developer,\" it might relate to software development. Looking at the provided categories, I'm thinking \"Internal Project\" would likely fit best for this ticket. Now, I\u2019ll output a JSON object with the selected category.**Analyzing IT ticket details**\n\nThe text mentions \"android developer,\" which could indicate a role or an access issue. The phrase \"change friday february pm\" likely suggests a schedule change for that afternoon. I'm wondering if this request pertains to assigning an Android developer or relates to an internal project. Since the wording is a bit unclear, it might involve access to Android development tools or even permissions. I think I should make my best guess for categorization but also consider asking for clarification to ensure accuracy.**Proposing category for IT ticket**\n\nSince this is a classification task, I\u2019m thinking if the request is about assigning an Android developer for Friday afternoon, then the categories might include \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access\" for resources. It seems best to propose a guess with justification and ask for confirmation. The allowed response format is a JSON object, so I\u2019ll output something like {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019m leaning toward \"Internal Project\" because it relates to the developer assignment or schedule change. Alternatively, I could consider \"Access\" for resource access.**Deciding on category for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m parsing the Romanian text, and while \"si la care aria va va android developer\" isn't entirely clear, it's a bit confusing. The phrase \"change Friday February PM\" suggests a schedule change for an Android developer on that Friday afternoon. This sounds like it fits best under \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object since the instructions say to categorize the IT ticket. I\u2019ve decided on {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, as adding extra text isn\u2019t necessary."
