They want it classified into categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. The details mention submitting a leaver form and reminders related to HR processes. It seems to fit best under \"HR Support\" since it relates to offboarding tasks rather than strictly IT issues like hardware or access. So, \"HR Support\" feels like the right choice!**Finalizing Category Format**\n\nThe user mentioned \"Administrative rights,\" but this ticket is primarily about the leaver form related to the HR offboarding process, so I should go with \"HR Support\" as the category. I'll format it as a single category field in JSON: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`.\n\nNow, I need to confirm the format is correct for their request, since they seemed to expect a JSON object. A brief note isn't necessary, as they simply asked for categorization.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
