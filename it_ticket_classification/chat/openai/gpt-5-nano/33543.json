The user's message is quite messy, but it seems related to new starter access card provisioning. They mention interns becoming employees and changing account credentials to a permanent status. This definitely relates to user onboarding and access issues. So, it looks like Access or Administrative rights would be the appropriate categories for this ticket.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI need to choose between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" for this ticket, focusing on access provisioning and account credentials for new starters. While \"HR Support\" could apply to onboarding, this ticket really pertains to IT access provisioning when converting interns to employees. Thus, \"Access\" is a better fit. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON formatted object: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and might add a brief note to clarify it's for access provisioning."
