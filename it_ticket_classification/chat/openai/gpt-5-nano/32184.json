It mentions things like \"video surveillance is working and recording\" and refers to recorded videos and user equipment. This makes me think it could relate to hardware, storage for the recorded videos, or access issues with the surveillance system. So, I'll have to choose a category from the list: Hardware, Storage, or Miscellaneous seem like potential fits for this ticket.**Evaluating IT ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s message mentions \"configured store recorded videos,\" suggesting the video surveillance system is functioning and that recordings are stored. The phrase about \"issues once users' equipment moved starting Friday COB\" implies some logistical changes. I see a strong case for categorizing this as \"Storage\" since it pertains to how recorded videos are kept. While \"Hardware\" might also apply, it seems less relevant. \"Access\" could fit if retrieving videos was an issue, but I'll lean toward \"Storage\" for clarity.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object to categorize the IT ticket as \"Storage.\" The required format specifies that I should provide a structured response, following the schema mentioning a \"category\" key. So, my final output will simply be {\"category\":\"Storage\"} with no additional text, as that's clearly indicated in the prompt. I believe this is the right classification based on my earlier analysis of the user's message!**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket discusses the functionality of the video surveillance system, stating it's working and recording, along with references to \"configured store recorded videos.\" I initially considered \"Hardware\" due to the surveillance cameras but realized that the focus on stored videos points more toward \"Storage.\" Since the mention of changes starting Friday suggests a new issue related to video retention or storage location, the most fitting category seems to be \"Storage.\" So, my output will be {\"category\":\"Storage\"}."
