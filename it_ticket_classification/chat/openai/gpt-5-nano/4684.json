It could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" if it relates to admin lists. If I can't pinpoint it, \"Miscellaneous\" might work too. I'll reflect on these categories to find the best match for this ticket.**Deciding ticket categorization**\n\nThe user's request to \"remove people from list\" likely pertains to user lists, group memberships, or distribution lists. In IT support terms, this seems related to access or permissions changes. I\u2019m thinking I should categorize it as \"Access,\" since it concerns access to a resource. \"Administrative rights\" might fit for admin privileges, but that's more specific. Given that the request isn't clearly for admin rights, \"Access\" feels like the best choice for categorization.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m working with a category schema that defines valid options such as \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. For this ticket, I\u2019m deciding to return a JSON object that indicates the category as \"Access.\" Since the request is clear, my response will be concise: I\u2019ll just provide the JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I think it\u2019s fine to follow the instruction closely and only output this JSON without additional notes. Let's finalize it!"
