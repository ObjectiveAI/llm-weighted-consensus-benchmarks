The user wants me to select a category from options like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It seems like the request is mainly about gaining access to create a shared mailbox. \"Access\" seems appropriate, but \"Administrative rights\" could also work since creating a mailbox typically requires those permissions. I guess it depends on how it's related to internal projects too.**Classifying a mailbox request**\n\nI'm looking at a ticket about a shared mailbox for trainers. The user has mentioned the need for creating a shared mailbox multiple times, indicating it's likely an IT request related to access or permissions. I need to decide between classifying it as \"Access\" since it's about accessing a shared mailbox, or as \"Administrative rights,\" given that creating it might require those rights. This feels like a case where both categories could apply! I'll weigh which fits best.**Choosing a ticket category**\n\nThe ticket is asking for help in creating a shared mailbox for trainers, which leads me to think it should be categorized as \"Access.\" Although some might argue it could fit under \"Internal Project\" for standardizing training communications, that's not the primary focus here. This is an IT support request, so I\u2019ll stick with \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object to match the required schema. Here\u2019s how it looks: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
