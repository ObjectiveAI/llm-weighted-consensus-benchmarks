The user has mentioned attachments, administration, and protecting against viruses, which makes me think it's related to onboarding and managing file safety. I'm considering whether to classify it under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" Since it seems centered on the new starter form and policies regarding attachments, I think \"Administrative rights\" is the best choice for this categorization.**Analyzing ticket categories**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, but \"HR Support\" isn't in the predetermined list. Let's evaluate the options:  \n\n- \"Hardware\" doesn't apply here.  \n- \"Access\" might fit since it discusses the new starter form and attachments, which relates to access control.  \n- \"Administrative rights\" seems good due to its focus on policies, forms, and handling attachments securely.  \n- \"Miscellaneous\" could also be an option if none of the others match well.  \n- There's also a chance it could relate to an \"Internal Project\" for onboarding, but that\u2019s uncertain.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI think \"Administrative rights\" could be the best choice since it relates to permissions and managing attachments, though it's not purely about rights. The \"Access\" category could work too, considering it discusses how attachments are handled, which relates to control. However, the handling of attachments doesn't strictly fit that definition. If I'm unsure, I could always use \"Miscellaneous\" as a fallback. Ultimately, I need to select the most appropriate category for this IT ticket and prepare the JSON output.**Parsing the ticket details**\n\nLooking at the text, it mentions a new starter and a form that needs to be filled out. There's also an administration officer involved and specifics about file attachments and virus protection. It seems to revolve around setting up a new starter form and policies for handling attachments to prevent viruses. This leads me to consider categorizing it under \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous,\" depending on the best fit.**Finalizing the category output**\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this ticket as \"Administrative rights\" since it addresses policies related to handling attachments and virus protection. Hardware, storage, and purchase options don't apply here. While \"Internal Project\" might fit if this relates to onboarding, it's not explicitly mentioned. \"Access\" seems less relevant since it's not about permissions. I'll prepare the JSON output for this category as specified, making sure to follow the required format without additional text. Here\u2019s the output:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
