The prompt to categorize includes a request for close codes related to the service, and it mentions issues with closing incidents. Given the provided categories, it seems the best fit would be \"Administrative rights\" since the request involves administrative actions related to incident management. I'll go with that category. This will help in processing the ticket correctly!**Parsing the IT ticket**\n\nI need to parse the content regarding close codes for a maintenance system and understand the issues raised. The user seems to be unable to close incidents, which suggests they might lack the necessary permissions. Given the categories provided, \"Administrative rights\" seems to be the most fitting choice, as it directly relates to permissions needed to manage incidents effectively. The details point clearly towards administrative access issues!**Selecting the category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket and \"Administrative rights\" seems to be the most appropriate option since it involves closing incidents and permissions. Other possible categories could be \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Administrative rights\" is explicitly linked to security and permissions. The instruction emphasizes providing the category in a specific JSON format, so I\u2019ll craft it as {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}. It's essential to ensure the format is precise, so I\u2019m ready to deliver!"
