The ticket mentions critical alerts regarding a server, recovery points, and an error related to a protected computer. \n\nGiven the context, it might fit into \"Administrative rights,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll have to carefully consider which category best matches the details presented.**Determining Backup Issue Category**\n\nI suspect this is related to a backup or restore problem based on the user's details. The mention of \"non-writer computer\" and issues with recovery points suggests that there may be a backup job failing because of a protected server. The categories don\u2019t include a direct \"Backup\" option, but \"Storage\" could fit well. \n\nGiven that \"recovery points\" pertains to the storage of backups, I think \"Storage\" is indeed the most appropriate category here.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering if this might be about \"Administrative rights\" due to the mention of opening the administrator console to review alert details. However, the core issue relates to backups and recovery points, which points to \"Storage.\" \n\nSo, I\u2019ll categorize the ticket as \"Storage.\" I\u2019ll present the response in JSON format, as indicated: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. This keeps it concise and aligned with the instructions, offering just the category without extra commentary."
