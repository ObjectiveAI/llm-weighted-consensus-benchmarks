Given the context, it seems like the most fitting category for this ticket is \"Purchase,\" since it relates to an order and items received.**Classifying a purchase request**\n\nIt looks like the message is mainly about a new purchase order, specifically mentioning a backpack and installation logs, along with terms like \"mandatory receipts\" and \"multiple items.\" \n\nGiven all this, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Purchase.\" Although there's a chance it could fit \"Hardware\" if the backpack involves some hardware components, the focus on procurement processes makes \"Purchase\" the likely choice. Also, the mention of a video feature for selecting items hints at instructional content, reinforcing the purchase context. So, \"Purchase\" seems like the safest option.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
