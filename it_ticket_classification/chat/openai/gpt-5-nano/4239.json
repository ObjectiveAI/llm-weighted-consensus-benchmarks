The ticket mentions \"external user removal\" and \"Active Directory user removal.\" This likely falls under either the \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" category. Since it's more about access management, I think \"Access\" is the best fit. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also work if it's about user privileges. Given the request's context, \"Access\" seems the most appropriate choice for this ticket.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether the request should fall under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it relates to removing a user from Active Directory, it\u2019s really about account deprovisioning and access revocation. For ticket systems, \"Access\" seems most suitable. I need to respond with a JSON-like object that includes just the category. The final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll keep it minimal without extra text because that\u2019s what the task calls for.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI'm confirming that \"Access\" is indeed the right choice based on the text, which clearly indicates the need for external user removal and Active Directory user removal. This means it relates to access management. So, I\u2019ll return the response as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019m going to keep it straightforward and only provide this JSON object without any extra commentary."
