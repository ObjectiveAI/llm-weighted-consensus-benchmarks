They want to sort it into categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. The ticket seems to be about modifying extensions for all users, possibly related to telephony or email. They mention modifying digit extensions and adding front digits. Overall, it looks like a request to adjust extensions during a migration process. I\u2019ll determine the best category now!**Categorizing IT task**\n\nThis ticket seems to involve a project focused on modifying extensions for all users, possibly part of a migration process. The task includes adding a front digit to each extension number, which suggests internal system configuration. Among the categories provided, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best fit since it's specifically about this IT modification. Though \"Administrative rights\" might come into play, the ticket doesn\u2019t directly ask for those rights, so I'll definitely categorize it as \"Internal Project.\"**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object based on the specified format for the category. The instructions clearly describe that I should present it as an object with a \"category\" field. So, I\u2019m planning to output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That seems fitting since I've categorized the ticket accordingly. I\u2019ll make sure to follow the instructions closely and avoid including any extra explanations\u2014just the JSON output as requested. Let\u2019s get that ready!"
