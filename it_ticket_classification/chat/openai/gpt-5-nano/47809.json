The user provided some details related to Oracle Fusion improvements, specifically for requisitions. The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I think \"Purchase\" fits best, given the focus on requisition approvals and enhancements. \"Internal Project\" doesn't seem right, and \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" aren\u2019t applicable either. \"Miscellaneous\" might be a fallback but isn\u2019t necessary here.**Outputting JSON Category**\n\nI need to respond to the user with a JSON object for categorizing the IT ticket they've provided. The prompt specifies that my output must be in a specific format with \"type\": \"object\" and a \"category\" field. Given the ticket is about Oracle Fusion and requisition view improvements, I believe \"Purchase\" is the correct category. \n\nSo, I'll output:  \n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.  \n\nI\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s exactly formatted according to the schema. This will be straightforward!"
