It seems related to an employee leaving, possibly handling a leaver form, so I'm considering whether it falls under \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The mention of \"leaver form\" indicates it's likely an HR process, but offboarding might involve access removal too. I'll weigh my options.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the instruction provided, which asks for a JSON-like object. The categories include \"HR Support,\" which seems suitable since the ticket mentions a \"leaver form,\" suggesting it's an HR process. However, it also raises the possibility of \"Access\" if the ticket is about removing access for an employee leaving. Given the content, I'll go with \"HR Support\" as it aligns best with the overall context!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe phrase \"consultant contractor\" suggests a contractor is leaving, potentially indicating an offboarding date with \"for Friday.\" In IT support, offboarding often requires disabling access, which aligns with the \"Access\" category. While the user asked me to categorize this IT ticket, I think \"Access\" is the best choice here. Although there's mention of a \"leaver form,\" that seems more HR-related, but given the IT ticket nature, I've decided to go with \"Access.\" I'll format my response as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Delivering category object**\n\nThe user has asked for a straightforward categorization without any explanation needed. Since that's the case, I\u2019ll focus on providing just the category object. This means I need to keep it concise and deliver exactly what\u2019s requested. I\u2019ll ensure the response is clear and follows the expected format without any extra fluff. Alright, let\u2019s go ahead and deliver that category object!"
