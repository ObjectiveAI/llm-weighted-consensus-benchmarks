The text suggests this isn't related to hardware or access, so I'm considering \"Miscellaneous\" since it fits best. While I could think about \"Administrative rights\" if changing the settings requires admin access, the user didn't mention any specific permissions or access issues. So, it seems \"Miscellaneous\" is the most fitting category for this request.**Outputting Category JSON**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the IT ticket as \"Miscellaneous.\" I need to respond with a JSON object containing the category field formatted correctly. The system requires that this object match the specified schema, which includes a top-level \"category\" key. Based on the user's request, I'll simply output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I\u2019ll stick to the format without any additional commentary, even though the user's message had some grammatical issues. Here goes!"
