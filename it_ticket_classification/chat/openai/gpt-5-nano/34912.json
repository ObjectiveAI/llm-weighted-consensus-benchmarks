The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I\u2019ll create a JSON object with a field for category, following the prompt's format: \"Please categorize this IT Ticket.\" \n\nIt should look something like {\"category\":\"Storage\"} or another suitable option. I\u2019ll carefully determine the best fit for this ticket.**Parsing IT ticket text**\n\nI want to parse the ticket text, which seems pretty garbled. It mentions terms like \"critical alert,\" \"data source,\" and \"computer,\" along with a description related to backup job termination due to a reboot. The mention of \"recovery points\" makes me think this could be tied to storage or hardware issues or possibly administrative rights. The crux of the issue seems to be a critical alert about a backup job that unexpectedly terminated.**Choosing the right IT category**\n\nThis ticket seems related to IT infrastructure. I think \"Storage\" makes the most sense because it involves recovery points and backups. While \"Hardware\" could apply if a reboot caused the issue, the alert's root cause is still unclear. The alert suggests usage in backup software, which aligns with storage. Given the categories, \"Storage\" is indeed the best fit. I'll be sure to output the JSON object correctly, like:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"} with the right formatting and no extra text."
