The ticket has critical alerts regarding a disk device that cannot be detected or is unresponsive, leading to protection activities failing. It includes details about disk failures and issues with data sources. Given the context, it seems this ticket should definitely fall under the Storage category.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nThis ticket involves disks, recovery points, replication, data sources, and backups, so \u201cStorage\u201d is the best fitting category. I considered \u201cHardware\u201d for the disk device, but since the issue is about the disk being undetectable and relates to backups, \u201cStorage\u201d makes more sense. The output should be in JSON format with just the category field. Following the required schema, I\u2019ll respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}  \n\nNo extra explanation needed, just the category!"
