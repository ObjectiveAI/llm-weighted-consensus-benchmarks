This seems centered around Exchange calendar issues, particularly invites not arriving, which could affect meetings. It might fit under \"Access\" if the user's unable to access invites, but it looks more like invites aren\u2019t being sent or received correctly. I should clarify if they mean notifications are lacking or if invites show up only on certain devices.**Clarifying calendar invite issues**\n\nThere's clearly some confusion regarding intermittent issues with calendar invites on both phone and laptop. It seems invites might show up on one device but not the other, possibly due to VPN or network problems. This situation doesn't neatly fit into a category. \"Exchange issues\" hints at a software problem, but it doesn't lean toward hardware. Options like \"Access\" seem plausible if we're discussing access to invites, while \"Miscellaneous\" works for unclear cases. The user also mentions issues related to copying and meeting invites.**Determining category for calendar access**\n\nI need to categorize the issues related to accessing calendar invites through Exchange, which involves both phone and laptop access. Given that the ticket focuses on the delivery of Exchange calendar invites, it\u2019s clear that \u201cAccess\u201d is the most fitting category. I\u2019ll output it as a JSON object since the instructions specify that format. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll present the final result clearly as: {\"category\":\"Access\"} with no additional text needed. Let's go ahead with that!"
