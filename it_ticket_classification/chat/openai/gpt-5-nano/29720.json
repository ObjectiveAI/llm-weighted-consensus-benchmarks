This seems to relate to an internal workflow, suggesting it might fit under \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Administrative rights.\" However, it could also be categorized as \"Miscellaneous.\" Let\u2019s determine the best fit!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this ticket. It seems like it could fall under \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" especially since the user mentioned an \"intra code flow.\" This suggests an internal workflow process, so \"Internal Project\" feels appropriate. However, the mention of modifying an approval flow could also relate to access permissions. Still, since the request isn\u2019t about accessing a resource, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" This seems to align best with the context.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe ticket is requesting to \"add intra code flow\" to an approval flow, which seems to imply modifying a workflow configuration. This likely falls under \"Internal Project\" tasks since it's a change related to internal processes. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object that specifies this category. According to the instructions, I should provide just the category in the exact format required. So, I\u2019ll output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nThis keeps it clean and straightforward!"
