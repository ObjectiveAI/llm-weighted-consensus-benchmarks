The ticket mentions creating a shared mailbox and references a design lead. Given the nature of the request, it seems to involve access and permissions related to mailboxes. \n\nLooking at the category options provided, I think \"Access\" fits best because it's about setting up a shared mailbox, which typically involves managing user access. I'll respond with a JSON object indicating that category.**Categorizing Shared Mailbox Request**\n\nI'm thinking about categorizing a ticket related to creating a shared mailbox. The best category seems to be \"Access\" since it's mainly about mailbox creation and access rights. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also apply if the creation involves special permissions. Still, there's no explicit mention of that in the request. It definitely doesn't fit \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Storage,\" and \"Internal Project\" feels unlikely. Overall, \"Access\" appears to be the most fitting choice for this ticket.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
