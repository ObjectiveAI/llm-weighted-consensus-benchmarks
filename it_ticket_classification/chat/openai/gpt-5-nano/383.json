                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing IT ticket details**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket based on a rather messy message from the user. It looks like they\u2019re discussing Oracle, project managers, and expenditure items. They mention wanting to change something related to who the PM is charged against, and there are phrases about making changes and approvals. I wonder if this pertains to access or something internal to their project. I'll need to sort that out for proper categorization!**Choosing the right category**\n\nThis ticket touches on \"Oracle,\" \"PM,\" \"expenditure items,\" and \"rules.\" It might belong in the \"Applications\" category, as \"Oracle\" is a system, possibly involving a table of project managers. I need to select a category from the provided options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context about modifying rules and charges in Oracle, it seems most fitting under \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project.\"**Parsing user request**\n\nLet\u2019s break down this message, which is pretty messy but mentions \"expenditure items,\" \"rules,\" and \"PM table charged against.\" It seems the user is requesting an assignment related to which project manager (PM) is charged for certain expenditures and to change the rules that apply. This request likely involves a configuration change in Oracle. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Administrative rights\" due to the rule changes, or \"Purchase\" because it involves expenditure charges. Which category fits best?**Determining the best category**\n\nI\u2019m considering if \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d would fit, since it covers changes to who can edit the rules in the system, but this case isn\u2019t just about user permissions; it\u2019s about associating a project manager (PM) with charges. The \u201cAccess\u201d category seems more about user access issues. Since the user wants to change how PMs are charged in Oracle, it might best fit under \u201cInternal Project,\u201d as it relates to cost allocation. However, \u201cPurchase\u201d could also be relevant because it deals with financial policy adjustments, even though expenditure items aren\u2019t necessarily purchases.**Choosing the category for the ticket**\n\nI think the best category for this ticket is \"Internal Project,\" since it relates to project managers (PMs) and charges associated with expenditures, likely for cost allocation. The mention of which PM is charged supports this too. While \"Administrative rights\" would fit if it were about modifying access to PM mappings, the user didn\u2019t specify rights\u2014they just requested a change. I\u2019ll confirm the category as \"Internal Project\" and format my response as a JSON object, like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
