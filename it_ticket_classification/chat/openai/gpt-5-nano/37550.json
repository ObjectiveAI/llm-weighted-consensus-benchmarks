While it could fit in \"Storage\" because of the references to recovery points and data source, it might also touch on \"Administrative rights\" since it mentions opening the administrator console. However, the main focus is definitely on recovery points and synchronization.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories available: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The \"Storage\" category seems to fit best because this ticket is focused on backups and recovery points. It doesn\u2019t relate to hardware, HR, or access. I need to respond with a simple JSON object specifying the category as \"Storage.\" It\u2019s important to consider if \"Administrative rights\" applies, but since it's mainly about recovery, I'll stick with \"Storage.\" So, my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}."
