It sounds like the issue could be linked to HR processes or possibly access to the HR portal. Given that the user is asking for help with this error, it makes sense to categorize it as \"HR Support,\" since that's more fitting for issues surrounding annual leave in an HR context.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories for the IT ticket and seeing \"HR Support\" is relevant here. Since the issue involves an error related to requesting annual leave, it fits well under HR tasks. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. The instructions say to provide just the category, so I won\u2019t add any extra notes or explanations. Time to finalize this!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
