There\u2019s mention of a joiner policy, OS image, and installations. The available categories include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the ticket focuses on access to resources and policies, it seems most fitting to classify it under \"Access.\" The content indicates this is about user onboarding and ensuring everything is assigned correctly.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the right category for this ticket, which deals with policy assignments and access to resources for a new joiner. While \"Administrative rights\" seems applicable, it\u2019s more about access itself. Therefore, the best choice is \"Access.\" I need to generate a JSON object that specifies this category clearly, formatted as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll finalize my response without any extra text to keep it straightforward and to the point."
