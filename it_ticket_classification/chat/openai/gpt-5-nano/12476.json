The phrase \"hello cards\" might refer to a project or a tool, though I'm not completely sure. The user seems to be requesting this change in the context of an administrative HR matter. I think it falls under \"HR Support,\" as they\u2019re seeking to make adjustments regarding their management structure.**Categorizing the request**\n\nI\u2019m realizing the request is more about reporting lines rather than administrative access rights. So, it makes sense to categorize this under \"HR Support.\" I need to format my output as a JSON object, adhering to the prompt's guidelines. This means I should keep it minimal and straightforward. I\u2019ll output the category like this:  \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}  \n\nYes, I'll ensure that's exactly how I present it!"
