It doesn\u2019t seem to relate to hardware, storage, HR, or purchases. It might fit in \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or even \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are involved. Maybe \"Internal Project\" works too, depending on the context of ServiceNow implementation. Let\u2019s decide!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket concerns ServiceNow approvals and notifications. I think \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit since it addresses a bug in the software platform. \"Access\" could work, especially if it pertains to approval issues, but the problem seems to focus on the formatting of the approval button. There's no specific \"Software/Platform issue\" category available, so I'll go with \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll format my response in JSON like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}  \nI'll ensure that the user gets the most appropriate category!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
