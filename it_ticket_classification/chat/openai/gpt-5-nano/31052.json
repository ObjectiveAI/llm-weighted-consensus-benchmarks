It includes mentions of purchase order requisitions, a flash drive installation, and various details like assignee, supplier, and attachments. After considering the multiple phrases, I think \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category since the content heavily revolves around purchase orders and supplier-related information. It's clear this ticket is focused on the purchasing process.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the categorization of an IT ticket that includes references to flash drives, purchase orders, suppliers, and tax justifications. It seems like the best fit might be \"Purchase,\" given the heavy focus on purchase order requisitions. The user specifically asked me to categorize this ticket, so I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object. I'll provide the category as \"Purchase\" to ensure clarity and correctness in the output. Here\u2019s what it will look like: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Formatting output correctly**\n\nI need to ensure I'm outputting the category JSON object without any extra text or analysis. The required format specifies that I should use a string enum for the category. So, I\u2019ll simply provide the output as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It\u2019s important to stick to this format and keep it clear and concise, focusing on delivering exactly what\u2019s needed without any added commentary. Let\u2019s get it done!"
