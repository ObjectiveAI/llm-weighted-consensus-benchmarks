It seems like the user is asking for help with ticket routing based on their request. I\u2019ll make sure to assign it appropriately!**Categorizing phone installations**\n\nThe content mentions multiple requests to \"install the phones in Trio meeting rooms,\" and it looks like the user wants to log separate tickets for each room: Milky Way, Mercury, Times Square, Tower, Palace, and Alley Classics. Since this is about installing phone systems, it relates to hardware installation. Out of the categories available, \"Hardware\" seems to be the best fit, with \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" as less suitable options. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\"**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI'm focusing on the nuance here: the request is about phone installations in meeting rooms, and since the user wants to log separate tickets, it definitely suggests multiple entries. Still, the category remains \"Hardware.\" We need to respond in the required JSON format based on the schema provided.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll prepare my response as a JSON object: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to include nothing extraneous, just the JSON object as instructed. Let's finalize that response!"
