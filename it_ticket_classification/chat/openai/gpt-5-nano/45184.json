The text mentions issues with editing a timesheet and error messages, so it seems to revolve around HR. Even though \"Administrative rights\" could be a consideration due to potential permission issues, it primarily pertains to HR processes. Therefore, I determine that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category since the user is seeking advice about their timesheet editing error.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI see \"HR Support\" is the best fit for the ticket category, even though there's no specific \"HR\" category. The user mentions issues with editing their timesheet, and while \"Administrative rights\" could suggest a permissions problem, the text doesn't explicitly say that permission was denied. Given the context, categorizing it as \"HR Support\" makes the most sense. I need to respond with a JSON object stating {\"category\": \"HR Support\"} to confirm this categorization accurately.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
