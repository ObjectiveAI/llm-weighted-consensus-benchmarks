The user has provided text indicating an issue that may involve selecting a competency, possibly relating to permission or access control in a system. There\u2019s mention of \"manager frankfurt main,\" which could refer to a location or user. I should decide whether it falls under \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" It seems this ticket primarily revolves around access permissions concerning the competency selection.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nThe request mentions an issue about permissions related to selecting a competency, which seems to point toward either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" If it's about needing higher privileges to select any competency, then \"Administrative rights\" could apply. However, the phrase \"can select any competency\" suggests a more general access issue. It seems like the user is looking for broader permissions rather than admin rights. So, the best category to label this ticket would be \"Access.\"**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI need to output a JSON object that categorizes the IT ticket. The prompt gives clear categories, and it looks like the required output format is a JSON-like structure with a \"category\" key. The categories I can choose from are predefined, and since I've determined the best category for this ticket is \"Access,\" my final JSON response should be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI won\u2019t include any extra text\u2014just the JSON. So I\u2019m set to respond with that!"
