Given the content about a colleague starting, it looks like HR Support is the most fitting category here.**Preparing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the user's request to categorize an IT ticket. The phrase \"new starter\" clearly indicates that this is about onboarding, which often requires setting up accounts and access. Given the categories listed, \"Access\" seems relevant if it\u2019s about providing this new starter with the necessary access. It seems I need to respond with the category in a JSON format. I should create a JSON object like: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} since that fits best with onboarding processes.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI should output the category as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. However, choosing between categories is tricky. The phrase \"new starter for Thursday\" hints at onboarding, which fits with \"HR Support.\" But since it's an IT ticket, I\u2019m considering \"Access\" for provisioning accounts for the new starter. The request indicates additional info may be needed, suggesting both HR and IT aspects. Ultimately, given the context, \"Access\" might be the safer choice since it pertains directly to enabling access for a new employee.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
