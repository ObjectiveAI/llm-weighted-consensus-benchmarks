It seems mainly related to onboarding, so it might fit under \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Also, there\u2019s reference to \"configuration,\" which could hint at \"Internal Project,\" but that feels less likely.**Deciding on Category**\n\nI'm pretty sure we should categorize this ticket as \"HR Support\" since it revolves around a new starter form and employee onboarding. It could also fit under \"Access,\" but the text doesn't explicitly mention systems access, just the starter form. \"Administrative rights\" seem unrelated here, as that focuses on permissions, while \"Internal Project\" doesn\u2019t seem to apply. So, I'll stick with \"HR Support\" and respond with a JSON object indicating this category as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Providing Category Format**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to respond with the categorization in a specific format. It says to categorize the IT Ticket and requires the output as a JSON object. So, I\u2019ll provide that directly. \n\nThe category is \"HR Support,\" so I\u2019m going with the simple format: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nThat's all that\u2019s needed!"
