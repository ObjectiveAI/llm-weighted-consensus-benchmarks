Let's categorize it accordingly!**Selecting IT ticket category**\n\nI'm weighing the options for classifying this IT ticket about a new starter and their start date. \"HR Support\" seems fitting, but it's less common in IT. \"Access\" could work for provisioning accounts or permissions, while \"Administrative rights\" might apply too, since there's mention of filling in a start date. The phrase \"administration officer\" leans toward an admin action, making \"HR Support\" more relevant in this context. So, I'll go with \"HR Support.\"**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering the appropriate way to categorize this ticket. It seems to involve updating the start date for a new employee, leading me to think \"HR Support\" fits best because it relates to onboarding and administrative tasks. I'll output the category as a JSON object, specifically: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. The instruction clearly asks for the category in the specified format, and I want to ensure I follow that requirement precisely while keeping my response concise."
