The ticket mentions \"adapter required\" a lot, which sounds like it relates to hardware. \n\nI\u2019m weighing between \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase\" as the most fitting category, especially since there\u2019s a request to \"order\" this adapter. Ultimately, it looks like this ticket aligns more with the \"Hardware\" category due to its focus on a hardware item.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nWhen classifying an IT ticket, it's important to distinguish between hardware installation requests and procurement ones. Since this ticket involves obtaining an adapter to connect a monitor, it leans more towards \"Purchase.\" The text indicates a need to order an adapter, suggesting they want assistance with procurement.\n\nAlso, the mention of scheduling for \"Friday July\" adds context. Overall, it seems clear they are requesting an adapter for their docking station and monitor setup, emphasizing a purchasing need.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe user needs an adapter for their docking station to connect a monitor and wants to assign someone to order it. This clearly relates to procurement, which leads me to think the category should be \"Purchase.\" Although \"Hardware\" might work because it's about a physical accessory, I feel \"Purchase\" is more accurate since they specifically mention ordering. So, let's categorize this ticket as \"Purchase.\" I should respond in a JSON-like format since that seems to be the required structure.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
