It mentions things like \"oracle link,\" \"starter form attached,\" and a request for filling it out, which suggests it's connected to onboarding. The options are limited to categories like \"Access,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019m leaning towards \"HR Support\" since it seems most relevant, but \"Access\" could also fit due to the context of new starter access.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI think \"Access\" makes the most sense for this IT ticket since it involves an Oracle link and a starter form, likely for account provisioning. \"Administrative rights\" feels a bit too specific, and while \"HR Support\" fits HR tasks, this is more related to IT onboarding. The user mentions \"new starter,\" which aligns with access provisioning, so I\u2019ll go with \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format this as a JSON object returning with the specified structure.**Returning category as JSON**\n\nThe user has requested to categorize the IT ticket, so I will generate a JSON response. I\u2019ll make sure the value matches the allowed category, which is \u201cAccess.\u201d I\u2019ll keep it concise and straightforward, as the user prefers, without any extra text. The final output will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
