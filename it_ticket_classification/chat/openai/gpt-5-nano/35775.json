The ticket itself mentions problems with builds failing and issues related to a certificate that seems to have expired. It describes failures in the deployment pipeline, server issues, and potential configuration changes. \n\nGiven the chaotic nature of the ticket, it likely fits under \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" due to its various technical aspects about build failures and certificate problems.**Categorizing IT Ticket Options**\n\nThe ticket mentions certificate expiry and access issues, so I\u2019m considering categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" and \"Access.\" The predefined categories include options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others.\n\nBuild failures suggest that \"Internal Project\" may apply as it concerns internal project builds. While \"Access\" could relate to needing access to the certificate, I think \"Internal Project\" fits best overall due to the focus on builds and releases within a project context. I want to offer a precise category, so I choose \"Internal Project.\"{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
