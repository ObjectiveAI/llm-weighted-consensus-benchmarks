It mentions wireless networks, scans, engineers, and rogue access points. My options include \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the focus is on security related to wireless networks, it aligns more closely with access issues tied to network security. However, the provided categories don\u2019t have a specific one for \"Network Security.\" I might need to go with \"Access\" for this ticket.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think the most fitting category for this IT ticket might be \"Internal Project\" as it's about a task involving rogue wireless networks, including a procedure for scanning and detection. However, it doesn\u2019t strictly relate to access rights. It mentions assigning tickets and dealing with multiple locations, which seems project-oriented. Although \"Miscellaneous\" could work as a catch-all, given the specifics about scanning, \"Access\" might be relevant too if it pertains to network access or rogue access points. Overall, \"Internal Project\" seems reasonable.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to respond in a JSON format for the IT ticket categorization. The prompt specifies, \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" with a schema that requires a category field. This field can only have certain values. I'll format my response as a JSON object with the category set accordingly. \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit due to the ticket's references to security monitoring and procedures, even though \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback if it's unclear. My final output will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
