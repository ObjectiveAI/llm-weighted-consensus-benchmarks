It looks like they want to share this with \"ion,\" possibly referring to a person or entity. The mention of \"July PM\" might indicate a deadline, and the emphasis on \"confidential\" suggests that the information is sensitive. Given the details, it seems like this ticket could fall under the \"Access\" category since it's about sharing documentation and possibly access rights.**Categorizing access requests**\n\nI need to decide on the right category for this ticket. Looking at the user's request about sharing map documentation, I'm considering \"Access,\" since it seems to involve granting permissions. There might be two separate requests involving \"with ion\" and \"July PM,\" but it's unclear. The mention of \"accept/decline\" suggests notification workflows, especially since \"information confidential\" indicates sensitive data. So, \"Access\" seems the best fit, but \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it involves granting admin access to documents.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
