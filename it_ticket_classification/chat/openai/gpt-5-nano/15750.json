They've mentioned wanting to modify the text summary of their weekly scheduled tasks, specifically changing \"restart.\" Looking at the categories I have, it's not a hardware, HR, or access issue. It seems to fit under \"Miscellaneous.\" So, I'll categorize this ticket as Miscellaneous since it deals with updating documentation rather than a specific service or request type.**Categorizing IT tasks**\n\nThe user wants to modify a text summary related to their scheduled tasks in ServiceNow, which seems to involve updating a description\u2014specifically changing \"restart.\" The available categories include \"Administrative rights,\" which pertains to access, and \"Miscellaneous,\" which feels like a catch-all. Since this doesn\u2019t seem to fit neatly into those categories, I'll classify it as \"Miscellaneous,\" since they're essentially asking to adjust a task label rather than changing permissions or initiating a project.**Choosing the right category**\n\nIt looks like the request is more about changing a summary text\u2014possibly a minor edit\u2014so categorizing it under \"Administrative\" or \"Miscellaneous\" makes sense. The user hasn't indicated it's part of a specific project, and it's clearly not about accessing rights. \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a good catch-all for this scenario since it's not hardware, HR, or any other defined category. I'll go with \"Miscellaneous\" for this ticket, given that it\u2019s a simple text modification.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
