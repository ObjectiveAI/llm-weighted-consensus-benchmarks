This is primarily about granting access to the portal, so I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category. While \"HR Support\" could also apply, it's more specific to user access provisioning. The mention of \"please add followings\" might indicate they want to update more than just access, though.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user wants to add two new team members to the client portal, so I should likely categorize this under \"Access.\" It's possible to consider \"Administrative rights,\" but it seems more straightforward to go with \"Access.\" I need to format my answer as a JSON-like object that aligns with the specified schema. So, my response will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s clear and to the point with no extra commentary."
