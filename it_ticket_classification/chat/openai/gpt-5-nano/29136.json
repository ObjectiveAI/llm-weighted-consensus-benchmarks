The user mentioned wanting a \"new git project,\" as well as some automation related to it. Looking at the categories provided\u2014like \"Internal Project\" and \"Access\"\u2014it feels like \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since this request is about setting up a new project and automation. However, I wonder if \"Access\" could also apply if they need Git access.**Determining the category in JSON format**\n\nIt looks like the best category for this IT ticket is \"Internal Project\" since it's about internal tooling for Git automation. I need to respond in JSON format, which means I\u2019ll create an object with the category field set to the string \"Internal Project\". I\u2019ll make sure it matches exactly with the provided enum. \n\nWhile \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could also fit, the message doesn\u2019t explicitly ask for those rights. So, I\u2019m sticking with \"Internal Project.\"**Finalizing the JSON response**\n\nI've decided that \"Internal Project\" is the best category for this IT ticket. Since the instructions specifically say to categorize it, I'll respond with just that in a JSON object format. The response will look like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI don\u2019t think I need to add any extra commentary; the instruction seems to imply that the final output should just be the JSON. I\u2019ll make sure it's valid and deliver it as is."
