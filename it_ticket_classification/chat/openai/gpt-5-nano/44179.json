I\u2019ll provide a structured JSON object with the category field reflecting this choice!**Outputting JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the provided instruction, which says to return a JSON object with a \"category\" field. It allows specific values, and since the ticket relates to access, I'll go with {\"category\":\"Access\"} as the output.
