It doesn't fit hardware, HR, or internal project categories. \"Miscellaneous\" and possibly \"Access\" come to mind, but I'm not entirely sure. I really want to get this right for the user!**Categorizing IT Issue**\n\nThe user is facing a certificate security pop-up related to an SSL certificate issue in Outlook. The categories provided are limited, and \"Miscellaneous\" seems the best fit for general IT issues not otherwise categorized. The mention of the user still being able to send and receive emails indicates that access isn't the main problem. Since there's no specific category for security or Outlook, I'll categorize this as \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll prepare the output in the required JSON format."
