There\u2019s also \"Wednesday,\" suggesting it could relate to scheduling. \"Floor blvd district\" seems to hint at a location, but that part isn\u2019t entirely clear. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it under \"Internal Project.\"**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm looking at the IT ticket categories, and \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best given the ticket context. The phrase \"include into project management\" suggests they want to add something to an internal project, pointing me toward that category. \"Administrative rights\" isn't necessary here, and others like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Purchase\" don't apply. It makes sense to categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" So, I\u2019ll create a JSON object returning this category.**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nI need to provide the category as a JSON object. The format requires a wrapper with \"type\":\"object.\" It seems like the answer should just be the category object. I\u2019ll include the \"category\" field as \"Internal Project\" since that's what we determined fits best. I\u2019ve got it clear now: I\u2019ll respond with just the JSON like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there's no extra text\u2014keeping it neat!"
