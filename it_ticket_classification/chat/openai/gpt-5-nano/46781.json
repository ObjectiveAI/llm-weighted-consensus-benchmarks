They mention problems with accessing a link using Safari and Chrome, and someone suggested using Internet Explorer. I'm thinking the best fit for this situation is the \"Access\" category, as it directly pertains to permission issues. So, I'm going to format it as a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe user is having trouble accessing a \"starter form\" they were sent in October. They mention being unable to connect using Safari and Chrome and ask if they need Internet Explorer to download it. Since this is primarily about access to a form link, I think it fits best in the \"Access\" category. Although it could also relate to \"Administrative rights\" if they need permission to download software, I still lean toward \"Access\" for its clarity.**Confirming Category for IT Ticket**\n\nThe request is about confirming whether they can download Internet Explorer, indicating an issue with access and browser compatibility rather than hardware. So, the best categorization for this ticket would be \"Access.\" I need to respond with the category in the required format. Following the instructions, I\u2019ll output it simply as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access.\"} It looks like I can keep it straightforward and concise like that!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
