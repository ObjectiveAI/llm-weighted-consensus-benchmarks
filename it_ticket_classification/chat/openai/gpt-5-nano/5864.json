The ticket content is a bit jumbled but seems to concern onboarding a new starter and their hardware needs. It mentions the starter form, hardware like a laptop and monitor, and information about the work location and seating. Given all this, I think the most appropriate category would be Hardware, as it relates to provisioning new equipment.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket appears to be about requesting hardware for a new starter, along with seating and work location details. I'm considering if it should be categorized as \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" The phrases related to ordering hardware suggest procurement, but \"Hardware\" fits better for equipment provisioning. Since the instructions likely call for a single category label, I'll go with \"Hardware\" to accurately reflect the provisioning aspect. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object:\n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}}**Providing JSON Output**\n\nThe task is to categorize the IT Ticket, and I need to provide a specific JSON object. The prompt indicates I should return just the category field. Following the schema, it seems I should output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Although the schema outlines the format, the actual response should focus on the category itself. So, I'll keep it simple and respond with just the category of \"Hardware\":\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
