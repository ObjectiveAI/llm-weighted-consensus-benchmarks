I\u2019m considering which category fits best from my list. It seems like this could relate to \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d or \u201cInternal Project,\u201d since they\u2019re referencing changes and approvals which are common in project management.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m narrowing down the ticket category and think \u201cInternal Project\u201d is the closest fit, as it involves changes to a project and a project manager. \"Administrative rights\" could also apply if it\u2019s about managing permissions, but it feels more about an internal change than access issues. The user's request suggests a desire to approve a change in the project manager role. I\u2019m planning to respond with a JSON object indicating \u201cInternal Project\u201d as the category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
