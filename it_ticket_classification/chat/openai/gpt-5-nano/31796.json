They mention trying different browsers and encountering issues, which indicates this might relate to application access. \n\nLooking at the options available, this ticket seems to fall under \"Access,\" as it involves an inability to access tasks within the Oracle application. I\u2019ll go ahead and categorize it as such.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket. Since the user can't access tasks in Oracle, \"Access\" seems to be the right category. However, \"Miscellaneous\" and \"Administrative rights\" are options too, particularly if it's a permissions issue. \n\nThe user mentions problems with Chrome and a \"blocker site,\" which suggests the issue might also be related to security or a blocked site. Overall, \"Access\" appears to be the most fitting choice here.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
