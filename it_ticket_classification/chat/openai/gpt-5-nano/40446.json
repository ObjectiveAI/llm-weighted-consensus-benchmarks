The ticket involves issues around exporting contacts and view bugs, which appears to relate to a software application (CRM). I think it might fit into \"Internal Project\", \"Access\", or \"Miscellaneous\". Given the context, I should choose the most appropriate category and output it as a JSON object.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket discusses multiple issues related to a \"contacts chart opportunity forecasting view\" in an application, covering export, fields, permissions, and bugs. \"Internal Project\" seems like a suitable category since it pertains to internal software functionality. \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant if access or permissions issues exist, but the main focus seems to be on the application's functionality. I'll go ahead and produce the JSON object with the category \"Internal Project\" formatted correctly. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
