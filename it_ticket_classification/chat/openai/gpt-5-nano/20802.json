It seems to be about removing access for \"leavers,\" which suggests an access control issue, possibly related to rights for those who left on a certain date. I should choose between \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" as the most suitable category. Given the context, \"Access\" appears to be the best fit. I\u2019ll need to output a JSON structure including this category.**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket is about removing access for leavers, indicating a general access control issue, making \"Access\" the right choice. While \"Administrative rights\" refers to privileged access, it\u2019s not explicitly mentioned here. I think it fits better as \"Access.\" I also considered \"HR Support\" because it\u2019s related to leavers, but ultimately \"Access\" fits the purpose. Now, I\u2019ll output the JSON object as required without extra commentary:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
