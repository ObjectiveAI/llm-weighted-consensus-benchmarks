The message mentions a starter form and assistance with its completion, which suggests this falls under HR support. The presence of terms like \"head testing\" and \"officer\" adds some context, but overall, it feels like an onboarding request. So, I\u2019m going to categorize this ticket as \u201cHR Support\u201d for clarity.**Formatting the Response**\n\nI need to create a JSON object to categorize the IT ticket. The required format includes a wrapper indicating the type as \"object\" and then defining properties, which seems a bit complicated. But the main need is to specify the category as \"HR Support\". So, I should stick with the response format that looks like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}, which aligns with the schema given. I'll make sure the content fits properly.**Delivering the Category Object**\n\nThe ticket refers to terms like \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" \"induction,\" and \"assist completion,\" focusing on onboarding processes. This clearly falls under HR support rather than IT hardware or access, even though onboarding might sometimes need access provisioning. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and avoid unnecessary comments. So, I'll provide the response in the required format as a category object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Now, I'm ready to deliver that!"
