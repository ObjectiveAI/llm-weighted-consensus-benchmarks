It also mentions a \"forgot dial pin,\" which adds to the confusion. I\u2019ll work on extracting meaningful details from this text to assign the appropriate category from the allowed list.**Categorizing Meeting Access Issues**\n\nIt sounds like the user has issues with meeting invites, dial-in numbers, and PINs for platforms like Zoom or Teams. This seems to fall under the \"Access\" category since it deals with joining by phone and permissions related to meeting invites. The mention of \"adding Italy\" and finding dial-in numbers suggests it's all about calendar invites and possibly adding different countries. So, it makes sense to categorize this as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
