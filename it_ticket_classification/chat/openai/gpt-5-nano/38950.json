Since it mentions trying to receive a PO and encountering an error, I think the best category here is \"Purchase.\" There are elements like \"ensure proper tracking\" and \"raise ticket,\" which further reinforce that it\u2019s related to IT issues in the purchasing system. So, \"Purchase\" is definitely the right choice!**Responding with JSON category**\n\nI need to focus on responding with just the category for the IT ticket based on the provided schema. The ticket mentions a \"po receive error,\" which clearly fits into the \"Purchase\" category. So, I\u2019ll create a JSON object that contains this. I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s formatted correctly by using the right capitalization, like \"Purchase.\" There\u2019s no need for extra text; I\u2019ll just send: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. This should align perfectly with the expectations!"
