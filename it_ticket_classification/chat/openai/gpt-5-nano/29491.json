The ticket mentions someone unable to cancel a request after a recent update, probably due to a change in the UI. Since it's about a cancellation issue, it's not related to hardware, storage, purchasing, or HR. It seems more like a Miscellaneous or possibly an Internal Project issue. But I have to stick to the fixed categories.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI think \"Administrative rights\" may relate to permission issues for cancelling a request, but it seems more about a UI function instead. \"Miscellaneous\" appears to fit best for this generic IT issue. I need to output a JSON category structure according to the instructions given, using the specified schema. So my JSON object will be set up with the category marked as \"Miscellaneous.\" The final output would be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. That should satisfy the request!**Finalizing the response**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to respond with the category in the specified JSON format. So, based on my previous reasoning, I'll output just the JSON line without any extra text. The final response will be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Keeping it straightforward like this should meet the requirements perfectly!"
