It talks about a security incident involving an alarm that was disarmed with a code to take a laptop, and the alarm was triggered afterwards. I need to classify this into the appropriate category from my options, which include Access, Hardware, and Security incident. Given the focus on access control and alarm disarm codes, the most fitting category seems to be \"Access.\"**Providing IT ticket category**\n\nOkay, usually I just send out the category value, but this time the instructions are asking for a specific format. The user asked me to categorize the IT ticket. So I need to respond with a JSON object that clearly indicates the category. I\u2019ll keep it concise and straightforward without any extra explanation. The final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That way, it\u2019s clear and to the point!"
