The ticket discusses various terms like \"server snapshot\" and \"zone issues.\" It seems like this primarily revolves around managing snapshots, which I think would fit best under the \"Storage\" category, since that relates closely to storage operations. Although \"Internal Project\" could be relevant if it involves migration, I still lean towards categorizing it as \"Storage\" for clarity.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket details, which seem to indicate a storage operation related to a backup or snapshot. The mention of a scheduled snapshot for Wednesday suggests a planned activity. There are aspects like assigning a technician, logging the issue, and dealing with potential DNS zone issues. It seems clear to categorize this as \"Storage\" since it focuses on snapshots and backup operations. I'll respond with the required JSON format, specifying the category as \"Storage.\" \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}**Finalizing JSON format**\n\nI need to ensure that I follow the exact requirements for the response format. The system expects a JSON object with a \"category\" property. My final output will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. This matches the required schema for the system. I think it's best to keep it straightforward by only including the necessary content. So, I\u2019ll deliver just that JSON object and leave it at that.\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
