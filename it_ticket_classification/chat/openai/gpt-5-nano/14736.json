They mention that the calendar view seems to be gone and they need to delete entries and resubmit. From this, it looks like the problem relates to the time management system, focusing on the calendar view of timecards. Since it's about visibility and updates related to timecards, I\u2019ll likely classify this ticket under \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d**Categorizing IT ticket further**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket focusing on mentions like \"delete these entries\" and \"resubmit via manage cards view,\" which point to issues with timecards and possibly authorization. The user notes the calendar view is missing, raising questions about access. Among the categories of Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights, it\u2019s evident this relates to internal HR processes. Since \"HR Support\" fits best, I\u2019ll go with that option, as it\u2019s the most relevant category.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI believe the best fit for this IT ticket is \"HR Support,\" since it revolves around timecards and managing entries. The user talks about the \"manage cards view\" for deleting and resubmitting entries, which ties into HR-related tasks. While \"Access\" could be a consideration if permissions were an issue, the focus here is more on the support side. \n\nNow, I\u2019ll respond with the appropriate JSON-format category by structuring it this way: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. This keeps it clear and concise."
