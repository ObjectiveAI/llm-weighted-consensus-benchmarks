Alternatively, it could be \"Administrative rights\" related to changing script settings, but I don't think that's applicable. The allowed categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others, so finally, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Let's stick to delivering just this JSON."
