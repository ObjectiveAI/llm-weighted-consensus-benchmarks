The user mentioned \"oracle fusion expense,\" which hints at software issues, particularly around configurations and possibly code changes. \n\nIt's not related to hardware, so that\u2019s out. \"Change code\" could tie into development or access. The \"pre sales for other client\" part may indicate it's tied to an internal project. Overall, it seems like it could fit under either \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project,\" depending on how the user interprets it.**Categorizing Ticket as Internal Project**\n\nI'm looking at this ticket about the Oracle Fusion Expense and code changes for another client. It feels linked to an internal software development project, fitting the \"Internal Project\" category. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if permissions were involved, that\u2019s not mentioned here. \n\nI don't think \"Access\" is relevant, either. Since they're dealing with multiple clients, it suggests it's a coding customization. Ultimately, categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" seems best. I'll wrap it up in JSON format.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
