The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nThis request definitely revolves around HR processes, so either HR Support or Administrative rights could fit, especially since it involves approval changes. However, I think HR Support is the most suitable category since it relates directly to the HR process of approving annual leave.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to provide a JSON-like output with the category. The allowed category that fits best is \"HR Support,\" since the ticket relates to leave approval, an HR function. While it could potentially be classified under \"Administrative rights\" due to a request for changing the approver in the system, the main focus here is on annual leave, so HR Support is the most suitable choice.**Finalizing category output**\n\nThe phrase \"application senior engineer\" might suggest that the applicant is a senior engineer, but I still lean toward categorizing it as HR Support. I\u2019ll present the response in the required format without any extra text, just as instructed. So, the final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
