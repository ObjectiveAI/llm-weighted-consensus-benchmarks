The ticket talks about decommissioning a server, updating archive databases, and restoring backups. I\u2019m thinking the most relevant category could be Storage since it involves databases, archiving, and backups. Internal Project or Administrative Rights could fit too, but it doesn't seem to mention access or accounts directly. \"Storage\" seems like the best choice here!**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Storage\" or \"Internal Project.\" The message mentions decommissioning a server and updating archive databases, emphasizing tasks like backup and restore. Since the focus is heavily on \"archive databases,\" it makes the most sense to go with \"Storage.\" I\u2019ll create a JSON object for the output with the category property set to \"Storage.\" It looks like the format should be straightforward, so I'll finalize that now.**Outputting IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user requested to categorize the IT ticket, and I need to respond using the specified JSON format. I\u2019ll create a JSON object that matches the required schema, which includes the category as \"Storage.\" So my final output will be as simple as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I want to make sure I stick to the strict format without any extra information or commentary. Let\u2019s go ahead and provide that now!"
