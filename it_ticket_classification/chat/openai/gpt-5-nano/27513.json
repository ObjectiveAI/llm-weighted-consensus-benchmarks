The key phrases like \"share folder,\" \"where add folder,\" and \"restricted advice\" suggest this is related to access control and folder management. The relevant categories seem to be \"Access\" and \"Storage,\" and possibly \"Administrative rights\" due to the restricted nature of the request. Overall, the focus is primarily on access and storage issues.**Assessing folder request**\n\nThis seems like a request to create a folder in a shared drive for reports with limited access. I\u2019m considering the best category, which could be \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since they mention sharing and**Interpreting the ticket**\n\nThe user's message is a bit unclear, but it seems to be about sharing a folder and possibly adding a folder for reports with restricted access. There are phrases indicating they might need administrative rights, especially since they\u2019re asking about creating a folder and assigning access. So, I think categories like \"Access\" and \"Storage\" could both apply, depending on whether the focus is more on permissions or the act of storing files. It's a bit of a puzzle!**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nBased on typical IT ticket categories, I see \"Access\" as the right fit for permissions and resource access, while \"Storage\" would apply to file-related issues. Since the user mentions creating a folder, it's indeed a storage operation, but the \"restricted advice\" part suggests it relates more to access control. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" to reflect those permissions. In response, I\u2019ll format it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Keeping it concise seems best, and I could also ask for clarification if needed.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
