The phrases indicate that a new project is needed, alongside travel arrangements. There\u2019s mention of forms and adding multiple users, suggesting it's about creating new projects and user access. Given the context, \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems like the most fitting category since it primarily revolves around a new project. However, \u201cAccess\u201d could also work due to user additions and assignments. It's a bit tricky!**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nThis is about creating a new project and adding users, so it doesn\u2019t fit under hardware. The mention of travel suggests arrangements, but it's still an IT ticket. The available categories include: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.\n\nGiven that it\u2019s primarily about a new project, \u201cInternal Project\u201d is the most suitable category. I need to respond with a well-formed JSON object to confirm this categorization. So, it will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}**Finalizing Response**\n\nI\u2019m considering if \"Travel needed\" is relevant to categorizing the ticket. However, the primary focus appears to be on creating a new project, which still leads me to conclude that \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category. Now, I need to ensure that the response only includes what\u2019s necessary without any extra commentary. Let\u2019s finalize it properly:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
