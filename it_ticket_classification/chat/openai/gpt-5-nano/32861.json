The user's message is pretty scrambled, mentioning things like booking a holiday and some legal-sounding terms. The categories I can choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nBased on the message, it seems like it's primarily about HR support related to holiday booking. So, I\u2019ll classify it under \"HR Support\" and output that in JSON format as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Classifying Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket seems to relate to HR topics, specifically about holiday booking and public holiday options. I think it might fit under \"HR Support,\" but I also considered \"Administrative rights\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\nHowever, the main focus is definitely on booking holidays. Although there\u2019s a mention of corporate structure, the overall theme circles back to HR. Therefore, I feel confident categorizing it as \"HR Support.\" It checks out with the allowed categories.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
