Given the context, the most fitting category is likely \"Access\" since it pertains to a connection request for network or login access, or maybe \"Administrative rights.\"**Categorizing connection requests**\n\nIt seems like the user is requesting a connection to an \"application\" consultant. Based on standard IT ticket categories, a \"connection request\" typically falls under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it's about login or access, I think it\u2019s safest to categorize it as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object formatted as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This keeps it straightforward and adheres to the schema without any extra text.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize the IT ticket: \"connection request December pm la va la application consultant.\" While \"application consultant\" could hint at \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" I believe that \"connection request\" clearly fits under \"Access.\" Since the user is specifically asking for a categorization, I don't think asking clarifying questions is necessary. Therefore, I'll respond simply with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's concise and straightforward!"
