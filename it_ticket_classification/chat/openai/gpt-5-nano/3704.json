The mention of \"password reset\" and being unable to perform something suggests it\u2019s related to access issues. \n\nSo, I think \u201cAccess\u201d fits best, but it might also connect to \"Administrative rights\" if they need those to reset their password. Ultimately, I will categorize it as \"Access\" and create a JSON object accordingly.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to create a JSON-like object for the IT ticket categorization. The required format specifies that I should include a category field, and based on the user\u2019s mention of \"password reset,\" it seems clear that \"Access\" is the right classification. \n\nI\u2019ll format my response as {\"category\":\"Access\"}, adhering to the defined JSON schema while avoiding any extra words. It's all about sticking closely to the instructions!**Providing JSON response**\n\nI need to keep my response simple and concise, as the instruction states that it will be parsed by a system. So, I\u2019ll generate just the necessary JSON object for classification. \n\nThis means I\u2019ll present the output as {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any additional text or explanation. Keeping it minimal and to the point is the way to go here!"
