The ticket text mentions wanting access to documents and refers to a library link that needs to work properly. It seems to be a request related to document access, which likely falls under the \u201cAccess\u201d category. Since it also mentions permissions, it could lean towards \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d but \u201cAccess\u201d seems to be the best fit overall.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions a phrase about \u201capprove accept decline,\u201d indicating some sort of approval process, likely related to the user's assignment needing access approval. It fits best in the \u201cAccess\u201d category, since it\u2019s not hardware, storage, purchase, HR, or internal project-related. It doesn't explicitly ask for administrative rights either, although it hints at needing permission to access documents. Given that the main focus is accessing documents, the category will clearly be \u201cAccess.\u201d I should format this as a JSON object with \"category\": \"Access.\"**Formatting JSON output**\n\nThe guidelines require me to provide a JSON object with a category field. The prompt clearly asks to categorize the IT ticket and mentions valid categories. I need to stick to the schema given, which indicates I should output just a minimal JSON object. So, my final output will simply be {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra commentary or information. That's definitely the simplest and clearest way to provide the answer!"
