The available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket content is quite garbled, trying to convey issues about access and possibly mobile registration. I'll need to interpret this information effectively to determine the best category. It seems like an access issue, so I might lean towards that.**Categorizing IT ticket access issues**\n\nI see key clues in the note, like \"not working,\" \"trying access locations,\" and \"unit manager mobile.\" This seems to suggest potential access issues, likely concerning a VPN or internal system. Since it mentions login troubles, the \"Access\" category fits well for this ticket. There could be some nuances around mobile devices and permissions for subsidiaries, but to keep things simple, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format it as a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
