The text is a bit messy, mentioning terms like \"remove project code,\" \"oracle,\" and \"upcoming holiday.\" It seems related to a project, so \"Internal Project\" could fit. However, it might also concern \"Administrative rights\" since it mentions removal and access. I'm unsure where to place it, as there are multiple interpretations of the content! I'll need to decide carefully.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m parsing the user\u2019s request, which mentions various terms like \"remove project code,\" \"oracle,\" and \"upcoming holiday.\" It sounds like it could relate to an \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Access\" if it's about removing access. The mention of \"oracle\" might imply a specific product or system. Given the context of removing a project code, I think \"Internal Project\" is the safest bet, as it closely aligns with the main topic. Alternative categories like \"Miscellaneous\" don\u2019t fit as well here.**Formatting category response**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to respond using the required JSON format for categorization. The user wants the output as a structured JSON object indicating the category. Based on what I've determined, \"Internal Project\" fits well, and I need to ensure it matches the specified enumerated values. I\u2019ll format it correctly as `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. Hmm, it looks like I should keep it succinct and just provide this object as the response."
