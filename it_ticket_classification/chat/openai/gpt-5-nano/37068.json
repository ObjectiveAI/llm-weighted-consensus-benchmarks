The user mentions phrases related to crashes, panic reports, and technical terms like kernel and CPU, which suggests it's a bug report for an Apple device. It seems related to a system crash or driver issues. Given the context, the best fit might be Hardware, but I\u2019m also considering Software since that applies here. Let's clarify.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019ve determined that \"Hardware\" is the best fit for this system crash ticket. Although it could point to an \"Internal Project\" if related to internal systems, typical classifications for crash logs lean towards Hardware or Software, and since Software isn't an option here, Hardware works. Given the kernel panic details and references to CPUs and drivers, categorization as Hardware makes sense. I\u2019ll create a concise response in the required JSON-like format.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
