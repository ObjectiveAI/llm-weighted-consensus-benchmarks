The focus seems to be on access or permissions. It could likely fit under the \"Access\" category, as it pertains to user management and permissions. However, if it's specifically about granting elevated privileges, it may belong in the \"Administrative rights\" category. \u201cAdd id\u201d hints at managing user IDs as well.**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt seems like the request is about adding a user to a group or calendar, possibly a \"Friday PM\" team. That suggests access management, so I\u2019m thinking \"Access\" is the right category. \"Administrative rights\" sounds like it\u2019s more about granting additional privileges, which might not apply here. The mention of \"add id\" could indicate adding a user ID to the system. Overall, \"Access\" fits best, so I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object with that category specified.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
