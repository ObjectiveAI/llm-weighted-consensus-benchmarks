The user description mentions \"cannot add cancellation reason\" several times and indicates a possible issue with the system functionality. It could fall under \"Administrative rights\" because it might require specific permissions, or \"Access\" due to the inability to access a feature. I\u2019m also considering \"Miscellaneous,\" but I think \"Administrative rights\" seems most fitting given the context. I'll finalize my classification based on the details.**Determining ticket categories**\n\nIf the user can't add a cancellation reason due to permission issues, it likely falls under \"Administrative rights.\" However, the text doesn't specify permissions clearly. There\u2019s also that mention about being able to add a reason previously, which adds confusion. I\u2019m considering categorizing this as \"Internal Project,\" especially if it's related to an incident management feature. \u201cCannot add cancellation reason\u201d could suggest a bug, but \"Miscellaneous\" might be more fitting if it\u2019s less clear. Still, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could be relevant if permissions are at play.**Outputting category as JSON**\n\nThe user asked for a categorization, so I need to respond with a JSON object that includes a \"category\" field. Based on the clues in the ticket, it seems like a permissions issue, suggesting \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit. The required format is specific, and I should just provide the JSON without needing an explanation. So, I'll output just the JSON: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. That should meet the requirements clearly and effectively."
