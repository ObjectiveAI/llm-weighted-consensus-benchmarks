The ticket text seems a bit jumbled; it talks about someone wanting to add a column in Oracle. This could relate to either \"Internal Project\" representing project-specific changes or \"Administrative rights\" if it's about permissions. I'll want to make sure I categorize it correctly since it involves structure changes!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm seeing the ticket contains phrases like \"assign,\" \"approve,\" and \"please proceed,\" along with specifics about a \"tax exemption\" column in what seems like a CRM or ERP system. This suggests it's about adding a column to track tax exemptions, which might involve updates in the reports section. I need to select a category for this ticket. \"Internal Project\" feels like the best option since it relates to system changes in a project context. I'll create a JSON object with the appropriate category field!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project\" because it looks like it involves feature development or changes to an Oracle column within a reporting module, which is typically part of internal work. Although I considered \"Administrative rights,\" there\u2019s no explicit request for permissions\u2014it's focused on data structure changes. Given this context, I believe \"Internal Project\" is the most appropriate choice. Let\u2019s go ahead and finalize this JSON output!"
