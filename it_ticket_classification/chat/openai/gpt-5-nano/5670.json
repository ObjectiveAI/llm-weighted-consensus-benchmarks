From the context, it sounds like the best category might be \u201cStorage\u201d since they're discussing moving files and ensuring they have enough space for the upgrade. Leading with this understanding should help me classify correctly and assist the user effectively.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm examining the ticket's details, which focus on a Windows fresh install, the upgrade process, and drive space issues.
