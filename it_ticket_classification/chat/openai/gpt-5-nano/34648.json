The user mentions slowness due to an amp endpoint and high CPU usage during downloads and installs. This ticket could fit several categories: \"Internal Project\" seems appropriate if it's about a specific internal system. \"Miscellaneous\" might work if it doesn't align directly, and \"Hardware\" could be relevant if hardware performance is the issue. I\u2019ll determine the best fit for output as a JSON object.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user mentions \"CPU\" and \"amp endpoint,\" which might refer to a service. They're requesting assistance with slow build operations. This does not seem related to access, storage, purchases, or HR, which helps narrow it down. I think the category \"Internal Project\" fits best, as the issue relates to software performance in an internal system.\n\nTo meet the requirement, I\u2019ll output a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It aligns with the given schema, focusing only on the category key.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
