The key phrases like \"password reset,\" \"unlock,\" and \"Administrative rights\" point toward the \"Access\" category. The text's mention of \"per procedure\" and \"follow instructions\" suggests it's about access control. Overall, it seems like it fits best under Access or potentially Administrative rights. I should confirm the categorization to help resolve this IT request efficiently!**Outputting JSON for Category**\n\nI need to output a JSON object representing the category for the IT ticket. The best fit seems to be \"Access,\" considering the mention of \"password reset\" and \"unlock.\" It could also be \"Administrative rights\" if that entails additional permissions. However, given the context, \"Access\" works well as a generic term. So, I'll format my response as {\"category\": \"Access\"} to align with the required structure and keep it concise without any extra text.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI need to follow the instruction to output a JSON object containing a single key for the category. The schema indicates that the category must be a string from a specific set of allowed values. Given what we've discussed, I\u2019ll specify the category as \"Access.\" So, my response will be formatted as {\"category\":\"Access\"} to align with the required structure. Yes, that seems right, and I'm ready to provide the answer."
