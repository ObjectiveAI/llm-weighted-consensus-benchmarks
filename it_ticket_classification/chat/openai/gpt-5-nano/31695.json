The ticket mentions several keywords, such as \"access,\" \"validation,\" \"induction training,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Although the content seems garbled, \"access\" and \"Administrative rights\" stand out as relevant categories. Since the user asked me to categorize it, I should go with \"Access\" as it seems to fit best given the context. So, I'll proceed with that choice!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to select \"Access\" for this IT ticket because it mentions \"access to Thursday PM\" and also brings up \"induction training.\" While \"Administrative rights\" is related, the primary focus here is access. The text also includes \"experience working Zephyr,\" which is less clear, but I think the main context points toward access. So, I\u2019ll format my output as required. It should look like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nNow, let\u2019s produce that!"
