The user's request mentions creating an HR screening job title for a Senior Engineer role involving Oracle. This points clearly to an HR-related task. Among the categories available, \"HR Support\" stands out as the most fitting. The user explicitly mentions \"HR screening,\" which solidifies the decision. So, it looks like I'll categorize this ticket as \"HR Support\" to ensure it's accurate and aligned with their needs.**Responding with JSON format**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object to categorize the IT ticket correctly. The instruction is clear: I should provide the categorization in a specific format. So, my response will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI notice that it\u2019s best to keep it concise and straightforward, without adding any extra text or commentary. The focus is solely on delivering what's required. Let's make sure it\u2019s clean and exactly as instructed!"
