The user mentions adding an external contact but seems to be facing some restrictions due to a policy. I think this might fit as an \u201cAccess\u201d issue since it relates to access control. There\u2019s also a possibility it could be classified under \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d if the user lacks the necessary permissions to add the contact. But it definitely doesn\u2019t seem related to hardware, storage, or purchases.**Determining the right category**\n\nI'm thinking about categorizing the ticket as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" If the user can't add an external contact due to a policy restriction, the \"Access\" category seems fitting. However, \"Administrative rights\" might be more appropriate since it specifically relates to needing permission for admin tasks. Given the user\u2019s mention of a policy enforcing the restriction, it really suggests a need for permission to modify the system. So, I lean towards \"Administrative rights\" for clarity on requesting those permissions.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nI need to format the response as a JSON-like object. The content indicates that the user is trying to add an external contact but is running into a restriction due to policy. Since this is an access-related issue, I\u2019m considering whether to classify it as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, given that it\u2019s about policy restrictions rather than a technical issue, I think \"Access\" is the safer choice. So, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
