The phrases like \"obi report,\" \"creation report,\" and references to candidates suggest it relates to some reporting feature, possibly in HR. Terms like \"active inactive\" and \"filter\" reinforce that notion. The HR Support category seems the most fitting. However, I'm still pondering if it could fit another category, like Access, but HR Support is likely the best choice here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions a \"new obi report,\" and it seems the user wants to create this report, likely about candidates, mentioning both active and inactive statuses and filtering by experience. This points strongly toward an HR reporting feature. Given that context, the HR Support category appears most appropriate. While I considered \"Internal Project,\" it doesn\u2019t seem to fit as well. I'll format the output simply as a JSON object with the chosen category. \n\n{\"category\": \"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
