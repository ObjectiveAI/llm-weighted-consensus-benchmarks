The mention of \"extend his allow lock building\" suggests someone needs to stay late, and we may be dealing with access rights. I think \"Access\" is the right category, but it could also fit under \"Administrative rights.\" Since the focus is on building access, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" and respond with a valid JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Delivering JSON category**\n\nI see the instruction tells me to categorize the request into a specific schema. It looks like I need to output a JSON object with the category set to \"Access.\" While I could include reasoning, the instruction emphasizes a focus on the category, so keeping it minimal is best. The content hints at extending access to a building, so that reinforces my choice. Thus, I'll deliver: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
