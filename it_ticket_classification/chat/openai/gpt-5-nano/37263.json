The text is quite messy, mentioning issues with \"slave\" and waiting for executors, which likely refers to the CI/CD pipeline context. I\u2019m considering the category options: Internal Project, Miscellaneous, or possibly Hardware if these \"slaves\" are servers. Since it doesn't directly indicate access issues, I\u2019m leaning toward Internal Project or Miscellaneous as the best fits.**Determining the category**\n\nIt looks like the issue involves CI build slaves waiting for an executor, signaling an internal project problem with the CI pipeline. Given this context, \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category. I could consider \"Miscellaneous\" if I'm unsure, but since there's a specific category for Internal Projects, I\u2019ll go with that. I need to respond in a JSON format, specifically: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, following the required structure of the object.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
