The phrasing suggests an issue with a device like a projector or conferencing system. There are indications of intermittent problems and possible hardware or power issues. Since the category options include \"Hardware,\" it seems appropriate to classify the ticket under that category. I'll go ahead and assign it to \"Hardware.\"**Choosing the category**\n\nI see that \"Hardware\" is the best choice since it directly relates to the equipment not working in the meeting room. While \"Miscellaneous\" could apply, hardware is more specific. I need to respond with a JSON format as instructed, complying with the required schema. That means I'll produce a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I'll ensure to follow the guidelines and only include the necessary information in the response.**Finalizing the output**\n\nI'll go ahead and output the JSON: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. The user's mention of a \"room for meeting\" definitely points to equipment typically found in a conference room, like a projector, screen, microphone, or speakers. That solidly confirms my choice of category. It\u2019s straightforward, so I think it\u2019s best to stick with this clear output. Let\u2019s proceed with just the JSON response."
