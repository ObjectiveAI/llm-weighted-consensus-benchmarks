Keywords like \u201crestore location,\u201d \u201cexpected outputs,\u201d \u201cforms,\u201d and \u201cwork instruction\u201d reinforce that this relates to recovery and testing processes. Given the context, it seems best to categorize this ticket under \u201cInternal Project\u201d as it aligns with recovery and testing workflows.**Determining the IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at category options for the user\u2019s IT ticket: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights. Considering terms like \u201crestore\u201d and \u201ctest,\u201d this ticket resembles an internal project, especially since it involves disaster recovery testing. The phrases like \"work instruction\" and \"documentation layouts\" suggest it\u2019s about creating templates for that project. While \u201cStorage\u201d might fit due to restoration and backup links, \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems most suitable based on the overall context.**Finalizing the category response**\n\nI\u2019m concluding that the best category for this IT ticket is \"Internal Project.\" The output needs to be structured as a JSON object with a category field. The format should be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Although the schema shows a more complex structure, they only need my chosen category. Since the user requested a category without an explanation, I\u2019ll stick to just providing that. I'll confirm I\u2019m all set to output the final JSON response!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
