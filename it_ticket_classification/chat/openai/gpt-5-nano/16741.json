It looks like the ticket is related to project management, possibly referring to code or software. Although it could relate to \"Access,\" since it mentions recognition issues, it might also fit \"Purchase,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll need to map this to the most appropriate category from the provided list.**Parsing ticket phrases**\n\nI'm breaking down the user's phrases to understand their request better. The user seems to want to change a code start date to Wednesday PM, suggesting a scheduling adjustment for a project. There\u2019s also a request for an earlier start date. They mention not recognizing an invoice, which could link to a client extension or mobile. Since the main focus is on changing the code start date, the best category appears to be \"Internal Project,\" although \"Purchase\" could be relevant too due to the invoice mention.**Deciding on a category**\n\nThe user's message contains two main tasks: changing a start date and recognizing an invoice. Even though the invoice might indicate a billing issue, the core request is about the project's schedule, making \"Internal Project\" the best fit. Although \"Purchase\" could apply to the invoicing aspect, the primary focus is on changing the start date. I need to format the response as a JSON object, confirming the category as \"Internal Project.\" If more detail is needed, I can clarify later!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
