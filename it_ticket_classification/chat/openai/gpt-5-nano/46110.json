They mention an urgent issue with their notebook where the mouse pointer jumps to the top right corner, making the machine unusable. This seems to point toward a hardware issue, likely related to the mouse or a display driver glitch. Since there\u2019s no software category, I\u2019ll lean toward classifying it as \"Hardware,\" since it relates closely to device malfunctions like the mouse.**Deciding on the category**\n\nThe issue with the mouse and touchpad makes me think it\u2019s likely a hardware problem. Since the pointer is moving by itself, it could relate to a screen or touchpad glitch. I'll categorize this as \"Hardware\" because that fits the device issue description. Other categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access\" don't seem applicable. Based on the urgency of the issue, I\u2019ll respond with the following JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
