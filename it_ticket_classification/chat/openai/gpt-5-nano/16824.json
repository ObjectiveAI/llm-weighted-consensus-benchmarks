The categories available are various, like HR Support, Access, and Administrative rights, among others. I want to pick the category that best fits this ticket. It seems like HR Support might be the most appropriate choice.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nIt looks like \"HR Support\" is the right category since the ticket concerns a leavers notification. The message mentions \"please due leaving announcement\" which could imply a request to add to the leavers notification list. Although \"Access\" might fit if it involved terminating access for those leaving, the text doesn\u2019t directly mention that. \u201cInternal Project\u201d and \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d don\u2019t seem applicable here. \"Miscellaneous\" could work if it's unclear, but I want to stick to the most fitting category!**Formatting Response**\n\nThe instruction directs me to respond with a JSON object containing a \"category\" field that matches one of the allowed values. Given the user's ticket mentions \"leavers notification,\" \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit since it's clearly an HR process. Although \"Access\" could be relevant for access removal, the content doesn't mention that specifically. So, I\u2019ll go with:\n\n{\"category\": \"HR Support\"}\n\nI'll make sure to format it correctly for the final response!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
