The content hints at creating codes and needing more details, which makes me think \"Internal Project\" fits best. While \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could also be options, the specific mention of a new project setup leans me towards \"Internal Project.\" It\u2019s about an internal setup, and the categories are quite limited. So, I\u2019m concluding with \"Internal Project.\"**Finalizing IT ticket classification**\n\nI'm thinking about whether to classify this IT ticket under \"Administrative rights\" since it mentions creating codes, but it feels more focused on project setup than just access rights. \"Access\" could apply if they need Oracle Fusion login rights, yet the wording doesn't specify that. \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit. I need to respond with a JSON object like: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} to meet the schema requirements. It looks like a note isn\u2019t necessary, since the instructions focus on that specific object.**Finalizing response format**\n\nThe instructions are clear that I need to categorize the IT ticket and respond solely with a JSON object. There shouldn't be any extra commentary or information. So, I'll ensure the output is exactly this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Keeping it straightforward and precise is essential here, so there\u2019s no confusion. Alright, let\u2019s go with that."
