They mention wanting access rights or app creation, so I\u2019m debating between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since it\u2019s focused on granting access to Sonar, \"Access\" might fit best.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize this IT ticket as \"Access\" since it deals with user access and permissions. Although \"Administrative rights\" could be considered if elevated privileges were involved, the request seems focused on granting access to the Sonar wallet for users. The phrase \"please rights order\" likely means they want access rights. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and make a note about granting access to Sonar wallet. I need to follow the required format for output, which looks like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Finalizing the category output**\n\nFor this task, I\u2019m sure we should output just: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I've considered whether \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" might fit, but since they\u2019re explicitly asking for access to a system, and it doesn't relate to hardware, storage, or purchase, \"Access\" is definitely the right choice. The response needs to be strictly the JSON format, without any extra text. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and provide just that!"
