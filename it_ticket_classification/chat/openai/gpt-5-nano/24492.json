The categories I have are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nGiven the references to \"new project code\" and \"create code,\" this ticket seems related to an internal project. Although there's a possibility it could pertain to Access or Administrative rights, there\u2019s no direct mention of access issues. So, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit here.**Finalizing category output**\n\nIt's clear now that \"Internal Project\" is the best category for this ticket because it relates to project codes and creation. The phrases like \"new project code\" and \"create code\" point to internal project issues. I'll go ahead and provide a JSON response that fits the required schema. \n\nSince the instruction specifies to output just that JSON object with \"category\": \"Internal Project,\" I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra commentary. Here\u2019s the output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Deciding on category**\n\nThe ticket text is a bit messy, but it seems clear enough to categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" This is based on its focus on new project codes and creating code. I feel confident that \"Internal Project\" is the right choice here. Now I\u2019ll go ahead and return that categorization! It\u2019s straightforward, and that makes it easier for the user to understand."
