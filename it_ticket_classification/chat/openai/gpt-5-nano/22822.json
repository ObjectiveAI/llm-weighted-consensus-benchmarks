The string includes phrases like \"maps not available\" and \"old file folder,\" but also has some unclear sections. The user has provided specific categories to choose from, and based on the mention of maps, the best fit might be \"Access\" or \"Storage.\" I'll analyze the fragments further to ensure the right choice.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user's ticket seems to revolve around maps not being available, along with mentions of an old file folder. This leads me to consider several categories: it might relate to \"Storage\" since it involves file storage, or \"Access\" since it could be about permissions. There\u2019s also a chance it could fit under \"Administrative rights\" or even \"Internal Project.\" The mixed language\u2014English and Romanian\u2014adds another layer of complexity. I'm leaning towards \"Access\" for best fit.**Translating the message**\n\nI\u2019m trying to make sense of the mixed message: it starts with \"maps not available\" and mentions an old file folder. My rough translation attempts to capture the essence, but it seems pretty incoherent. I get bits like needing to note something about maps and old sites, but it\u2019s all jumbled together. I guess this adds to the challenge of determining the right category for the IT ticket since clarity is lacking here.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe common IT issue seems to be about maps not being available on the new system, alongside mentions of an old file folder. This might indicate a need for categorization around file storage and access. Based on the phrasing, I\u2019m leaning towards the \"Storage\" category since it concerns the availability of files (maps) in the new system. However, it could also relate to \"Access\" if it\u2019s more about permissions. Responding with a JSON-like format for the category sounds like a good plan!**Preparing the JSON response**\n\nThe user's prompt is to categorize the IT ticket. I need to respond with a JSON object that specifies a category like \"Storage.\" It might be tempting to consider \"Internal Project\" if it involves migrating maps as part of that. However, since the focus is on files and folders, \"Storage\" seems like the safer choice. The instructions are clear: I should stick to the format. So, I\u2019ll respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"} \n\nwithout any extra text."
