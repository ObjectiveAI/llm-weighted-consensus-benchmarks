The ticket is about the quality of Oracle attachments uploaded from Android devices, specifically related to expenses. The user is asking for advice on improving the image quality of these documents. It seems to be about \"quality of attachments\" and \"Android\". While it could fit under \"Storage\", I'm also considering \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" since it's not a perfect match.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, and \"Administrative rights\" definitely isn't relevant. \"Access\" doesn't fit, so I'm considering \"Miscellaneous\" since it's about the app feature quality. However, it might relate to \"Hardware\" due to the image quality from a camera or phone. The ticket focuses on \"attachments uploaded from Android expenses\" and suggests improvements, hinting it could be an \"Internal Project\" involving Oracle attachments. Overall, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the safest option, but \"Internal Project\" might fit if it's about an ongoing module improvement.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nIn categorizing this IT ticket, I'm weighing \"Internal Project\" against \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it specifically mentions the Oracle attachments module, \"Internal Project\" could fit if it's about improvements. However, the user has asked to categorize, so I need to return a JSON-like object. The category has to be an enumerated value. Given that the ticket discusses imaging quality on Android and isn't strictly about hardware or storage, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a better fit. I'll respond with {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
