The key issue is that they\u2019re encountering an error connected to server access. The provided categories include \"Access,\" which seems the most fitting since the user is struggling with login issues. Although they mention being a test lead, the primary concern revolves around accessing the quiz, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \u201cAccess\u201d and prepare to respond in a JSON format.**Formatting Response**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket into JSON format as specified. The category type is clearly outlined, so I'll format my response as { \"category\": \"Access\" }. This means I should keep it concise and stick strictly to the requested category without adding extra troubleshooting notes or information. I\u2019ll ensure the capitalization matches by using \"Access\" as given in the enum. It\u2019s essential to follow the instructions closely, so I\u2019ll produce the JSON object accurately."
