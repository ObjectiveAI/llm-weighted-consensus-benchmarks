It seems like access is the core problem because of the authentication hurdles. While I could consider \"Hardware\" due to mobile configuration, \"Access\" really captures the essence since it's mainly about authentication. I think responding with a JSON-like object is necessary, so I'll format it with \"category\": \"Access\" for clarity.**Formatting the IT ticket response**\n\nOkay, I need to remember that the required format for categorizing the IT ticket is just a JSON object with the category field. The instruction specifically says, \"Categorize this IT Ticket:\" followed by the necessary output. I\u2019ll be careful to ensure proper quoting and avoid any extra text. The enum has \"Access\" capitalized, so I\u2019ll use \"Access\" in the response. Now, I\u2019ll return this formatted JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
