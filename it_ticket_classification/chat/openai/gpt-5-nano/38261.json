It doesn\u2019t suggest anything about access or permissions directly. The context seems to point toward Oracle applications or databases, so perhaps \u201cInternal Project\u201d is the closest match, even though I'm not entirely sure.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI'm trying to figure out how to categorize this IT ticket based on the details provided. It might fit into \"Miscellaneous\" since there isn't enough information to pinpoint it exactly. \"Internal Project\" could also work because it relates to Oracle issues, but it\u2019s not clearly about a project. The mention of \"sheet\" could refer to Oracle tools, but it's vague. Since \"Software\" isn't an option, I think the best choice is \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll output that in a JSON format.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nThe required format for the category is clearly defined. I need to structure it as a JSON object that specifies the category in the allowed options. I\u2019ll choose \"Miscellaneous\" for this ticket. The key is to ensure the response follows the schema, which requires the category to be part of an object. I\u2019ll respond simply with just the JSON, avoiding any extra text, to keep it concise and clear. Here\u2019s the final structure: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
