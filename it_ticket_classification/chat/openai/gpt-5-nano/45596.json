The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the mention of submitting off days and the Oracle system, this seems most closely aligned with \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Access.\" I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the best fit. I\u2019ll output the category in JSON format.**Categorizing Oracle issue**\n\nThis ticket seems to refer to an Oracle issue related to the HR system for timesheets. Phrases like \"submit off days\" and \"hours entered below your scheduled hours\" suggest a problem with timekeeping. The closest category is \"HR Support,\" given its HR context. \"Access\" might be relevant too, but there aren't clear indications of login issues. If it\u2019s unclear, it could land in \"Miscellaneous.\" Still, let's go with \"HR Support\" and format the JSON to reflect that. I\u2019ll ensure it matches the specified format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
