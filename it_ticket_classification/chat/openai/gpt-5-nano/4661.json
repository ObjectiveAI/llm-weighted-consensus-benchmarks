There\u2019s a reference to helping an \"addresses leader,\" but it's not straightforward. I'll need to consider categories like Access, Administrative rights, or Miscellaneous since it's definitely not a hardware issue. I still need to select the most appropriate category.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT ticket. It could fit into \"Administrative rights\" if it involves installing something. However, since the details are unclear, \"Miscellaneous\" might be a better label. I could also think of \"Internal Project\" if this relates to an internal address project or \"Access\" if they need permission to add an address. Since the content is ambiguous, my best guess for the category would be \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll provide the output in the required JSON format.**Selecting the category**\n\nFor this unclear complaint, the safest categorization seems to be \"Miscellaneous.\" It might also fit \"Administrative rights\" if adding an address requires special permissions, but that's uncertain. If it's related to departmental address deployment, \"Internal Project\" could apply, but again, there's not enough clarity. Therefore, I'll provide the JSON output with the category labeled as \"Miscellaneous,\" keeping it simple without additional notes, just as the instructions state. Here\u2019s the output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
