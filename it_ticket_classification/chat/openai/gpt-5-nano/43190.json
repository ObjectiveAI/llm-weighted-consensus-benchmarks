The mention of \"tape library\" and \"slots\" indicates it's related to storage. While \"Hardware\" could fit too, it\u2019s better suited to classify this incident as \"Storage.\" The ticket text is messy but highlights that it\u2019s definitely about storage hardware.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI need to format a JSON output according to the provided specifications. It requires creating a category object with a single key called \"category\" and the value must be one of the allowed options, like \"Storage.\" So, I\u2019ll respond with:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}  \n\nI need to make sure I follow the formatting precisely without adding any extra text. Just delivering the JSON object as specified is the goal!"
