The user can connect initially, but after they enter their credentials, the connection fails. This makes it an IT support issue related to remote access, particularly authentication. I think the best category for this ticket would be \"Access\" since the user is experiencing a login issue. \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, but it feels more centered around access.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
