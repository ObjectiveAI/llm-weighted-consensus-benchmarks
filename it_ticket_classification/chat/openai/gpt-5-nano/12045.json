The options for categories are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket references terms like \"project manager management,\" \"timecards,\" and \"approver.\" Given these terms, it seems to fit under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" perhaps even \"Internal Project\" since it relates to project management. However, none clearly fit HR or timecard categories.**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket, which discusses an approver for a timecard process but comes across as quite garbled. It mentions terms like \"approver,\" \"timecards,\" and \"proposal,\" hinting it relates to the timecard submission flow. It might fit \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The term \"Approver\" suggests a need for access rights, making \"Administrative rights\" a solid choice. Still, since it refers to improving a process, I wonder if \"Internal Project\" could be relevant too.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
