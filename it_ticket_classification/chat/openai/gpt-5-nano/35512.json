The ticket mentions terms like \"technical consultant,\" which might also hint at access issues. The provided categories are fairly general. I think it could either fall under \"Access\" if it's about deleting something, or \"Miscellaneous\" for general IT inquiries. It seems to relate to a software issue, specifically with time entry. Let\u2019s clarify it!**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe phrase \"delete for thanks\" suggests the user might want something removed, and \"ext\" could mean extension. It's likely this ticket is about an Oracle error encountered while entering hours. Since there's no mention of login issues, it seems less about permissions and more like a software problem. Thus, I think \"Miscellaneous\" fits best. I\u2019ll go ahead and format the response in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Let's keep it straightforward!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
