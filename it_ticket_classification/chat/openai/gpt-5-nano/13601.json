It's a bit tough to interpret clearly. I think it primarily relates to reporting, which leans towards \"Internal Project,\" but it might also fit \"Miscellaneous\" due to its generic nature. Categories like \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Hardware,\" and \"HR Support\" don't seem relevant here.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nIt seems the best category for this ticket is \"Internal Project,\" especially since it relates to a report and an extract template. Phrases like \"attached template,\" \"additional information,\" and \"thanks engineer\" reinforce this idea. While \"Administrative rights\" seems tempting, it doesn't quite fit. I also considered \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Internal Project\" aligns better since it connects to the process of import progress, not hardware issues. So, I'll go with \"Internal Project\" for this ticket.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
