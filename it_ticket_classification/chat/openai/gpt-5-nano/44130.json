The ticket mentions issues with Oracle and problems with requisition approvals, which seem to lean towards administrative issues. The categories I have to choose from are like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. To classify it correctly, I'll output a JSON-like object with the most fitting category, likely \"Administrative rights,\" since it deals with approval and requests. Let's do that!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket that includes issues with Oracle related to procurement, specifically around requisitions and purchase requests. It looks like the user is having trouble deleting a canceled requisition and creating a new purchase request with the same amount. While I considered both \"Purchase\" and \"Administrative rights,\" the focus seems to align more with the purchasing process. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Purchase,\" since it pertains to issues with the procurement workflow.**Formatting the output correctly**\n\nI\u2019ve determined that I should output a JSON object for the ticket category, which is \"Purchase.\" The required format dictates it needs to follow the schema provided earlier. I need to ensure I present it correctly as a JSON object without any additional text. So, the final answer will be succinctly formatted as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll stick to this structure to meet the user\u2019s needs and convey the information clearly!"
