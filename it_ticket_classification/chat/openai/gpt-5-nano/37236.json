The text mentions issues accessing forecast files and problems opening Excel files through Explorer and Chrome. Given the emphasis on high priority due to invoicing, it seems primarily related to access problems. I think the best fit would be the \"Access\" category, but it might also align with \"Administrative rights\" depending on the permission aspect.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to clarify the issue with the IT ticket since it doesn't mention problems with permissions, just that the user can't open files from links. Since it revolves around accessing files, \"Access\" seems like the right category. It's definitely not hardware, storage, purchase, internal project, or HR. The output needs to follow the JSON format, so I\u2019ll structure it according to the provided schema: category as \"Access\". That should meet the required format!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
