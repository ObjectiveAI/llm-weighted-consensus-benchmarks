The ticket includes mentions of survey notifications, user access updates, and filter amendments. It also discusses access control and permissions. Since it primarily revolves around access rights and filters, it seems appropriate to categorize it as \"Access.\" This seems like the best fit given the content outlined in the ticket.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
