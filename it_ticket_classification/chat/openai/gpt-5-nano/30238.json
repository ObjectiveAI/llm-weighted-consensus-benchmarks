There's a mix of languages, with terms like \"cleaning staff access cards audit\" and \"updated personnel\" standing out. Given the context, it seems best to classify it under Access since it relates to auditing access control cards. It also mentions personnel details which might touch on HR, but Access appears to be the primary category here.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to present the response as a JSON object that includes a category field. After reviewing the ticket, \"Access\" seems to be the most fitting category since it deals with access cards for cleaning staff and personnel updates. Although there might be HR implications, the IT ticket classification is clear. Thus, I'll provide the response strictly in the required format without any extra text: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
