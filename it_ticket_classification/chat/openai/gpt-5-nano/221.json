The ticket mentions a backup issue, logs, and storage systems, which suggests it relates to storage. Options like \"Infrastructure\" aren't available in the specified categories, making \"Storage\" the most appropriate choice. I think outputting the category as JSON is the right way to respond.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI need to output a JSON object, setting the category field to one of the specified strings. In this case, it will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I should make sure there\u2019s no extra text included because clarity is key. So the final response should simply be {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.
