It appears to be a request related to Oracle Fusion HCM, which is part of HR processes. I'm thinking that \"HR Support\" fits best since the topic relates to grades, but it does suggest human resources. Alternatively, \"Access\" might apply if permissions are involved, and \"Administrative rights\" is about admin capabilities.**Categorizing IT request**\n\nThe user\u2019s request involves changing a grade for Oracle Fusion, and \"grade\" here likely refers to job grades or performance review levels in an HR context. I think \"HR Support\" is the best category for this since it pertains to human resources. There isn\u2019t a specific category called \"HR,\" but \"HR Support\" exists in the list. I\u2019ll classify it under HR Support and format the output as a structured JSON object accordingly. Here\u2019s how it should look: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nThe user prompt indicates that I should provide only the category value as a JSON object matching the given schema. Based on the request about changing a grade for Oracle Fusion, it's clear that this fits into the \"HR Support\" category. The schema specifies how to format the response. So, my output will just be: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text\u2014just the JSON!"
