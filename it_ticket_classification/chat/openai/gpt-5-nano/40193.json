They use phrases like \u201cpull request merges clones be rejected or queued\u201d and mention urgency. The available categories are varied, but it seems like this ticket aligns best with \u201cStorage\u201d due to the focus on storage capacity and scaling server limits. However, I\u2019m also considering \"Hardware\" since it relates to infrastructure. Overall, \u201cStorage\u201d feels most fitting!**Parsing the ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket that mentions reaching resource limits and has high urgency. The language isn\u2019t perfectly structured, but I can see it's about requesting more space to avoid issues with git operations like pushes and merges being blocked. The focus on resource limits suggests that it fits best under the \u201cStorage\u201d category rather than \u201cHardware.\u201d Therefore, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON-like object with the category set to storage: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} to follow the required format. Yes, that works!**Preparing the response**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to provide a brief note or reasoning for the category, even though the instructions don\u2019t require it. The focus is simply on showing the category for the IT ticket in the specified JSON format. The evaluation expects a valid JSON object that matches the schema, and the safe approach is definitely to present it as {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text in the response since the prompt specifically states to categorize the ticket only. Let\u2019s finalize it!"
