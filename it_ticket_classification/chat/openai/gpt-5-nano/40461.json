It seems like they can't proceed with approvals because the next approver is on holiday until July 5th. I'm considering whether to classify this as \"Administrative rights,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access.\" Since the user is asking for help with deleting proposals, that leans towards \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Let's figure this out properly!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe action here is to delete proposals, which hints at needing \"Administrative rights\" since deleting items usually requires certain privileges. Even though the ticket asks for assistance, the best category seems to be \"Administrative rights,\" as this aligns with the need for permissions to delete. Alternatively, it could fit under \"Internal Project\" if it's related to internal workflows. Considering the overall context, it\u2019s likely not \"Procure\" or \"Purchase,\" and I don't think \"Access\" directly applies unless it's about gaining permission to delete. I'll finalize the categorization based on this reasoning!**Formatting JSON for Ticket Category**\n\nI need to create a JSON object with a \"category\" field based on the user's request to delete submitted proposals. Since this involves an administrative task of modifying or deleting, it aligns best with \"Administrative rights.\" It doesn\u2019t fit \"Access,\" as it\u2019s not about gaining access to a system. While \"Miscellaneous\" could also work if I'm uncertain, \"Administrative rights\" is the best choice. I\u2019ll craft the final output to only include the JSON object with the selected category!{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
