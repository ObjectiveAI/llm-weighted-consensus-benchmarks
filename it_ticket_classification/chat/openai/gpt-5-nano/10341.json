They mention things like \"Oxford closure Thursday,\" \"wallpapers received,\" and \"allocate relevant Oxford location site.\" The ticket seems to deal with infrastructure and possible updates related to a specific location. This makes me think it could fit into categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or even \"Hardware.\" I need to clarify which classification best fits the essence of the user's request.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI see there's mention of wallpaper distribution and a possible closure of a site related to Oxford. It looks like the user is talking about delivering wallpapers to devices and the allocation of an Oxford location. I need to categorize this effectively. The ticket seems about infrastructure changes, so \"Internal Project\" could be a good fit. \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" doesn\u2019t seem right since access isn\u2019t explicitly mentioned. Thus, choosing \"Internal Project\" feels most appropriate.**Creating JSON response**\n\nThe user\u2019s request mentions \"infrastructure\" and \"site,\" which makes it clear that \"Internal Project\" is the right category. I need to create a JSON object with this category. The instructions specify that it should follow the schema provided, so I\u2019ll ensure to format it correctly as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It's important to stick to the exact structure the user expects, and I won't add any additional text. Let\u2019s make it concise! Here\u2019s the output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
