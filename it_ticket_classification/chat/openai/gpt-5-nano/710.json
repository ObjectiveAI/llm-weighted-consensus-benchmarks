They mention a \"new starter starter form\" and seek help with completion. Looking at the category options, this seems related to onboarding a new employee. It likely fits under \"HR Support\" since it\u2019s about HR onboarding forms. Though \"Access\" is another possibility, there\u2019s no clear mention of systems access. So, \"HR Support\" feels like the right choice for this ticket.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the ticket as \"HR Support\" since the onboarding process involves HR. While I briefly considered \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" they don\u2019t fit as well. The user's message about needing help with a \"starter form\" clearly indicates this is about completing HR-related onboarding. While \"Access\" could technically apply if it involved access to systems, the main focus is on form completion. So, I'll stick with \"HR Support.\"**Formatting the response correctly**\n\nI see the instruction specifies a JSON object format for the category. It seems they want a clear and straightforward response, so I\u2019ll definitely stick with that. The category asked for relates to the ticket request, and based on our discussion, it will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. \n\nExtra notes might be tempting, but since the instructions emphasize categorizing without additional commentary, I\u2019ll keep it simple and just provide the JSON object as is!"
