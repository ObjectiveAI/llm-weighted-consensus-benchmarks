I have predefined categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" and others. It sounds like they\u2019re referring to a hardware issue since \"cord extender\" is hardware-related. They mention \"shielded\" and \"provided,\" which reinforces that it's about hardware, not purchasing. So, I\u2019m deciding to classify this ticket under \"Hardware.\"**Responding with JSON**\n\nI see that we shouldn't classify this under \"Internal Project.\" The instructions show that I need to respond with a JSON object for the required category. Based on the mention of \"cord extender,\" the appropriate response would be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nIt's clear the user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, so I want to present only this content. I\u2019ll ensure my quotes and overall structure are correct. So, I\u2019ll provide just that JSON response!"
