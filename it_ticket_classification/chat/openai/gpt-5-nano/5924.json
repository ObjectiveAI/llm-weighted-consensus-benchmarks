I\u2019m wondering if this could fall under \u201cPurchase\u201d, but that doesn't seem right. I think it might relate to \u201cAccess\u201d if it\u2019s about user permissions, or possibly \u201cInternal Project\u201d since the user refers to commercial processing for managing client data. \u201cAdministrative Rights\u201d could be relevant if they want admin access. I need to decide which category fits best!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket is about entering client data on the mercury site and includes terms like \"control persons\" and \"restricted other employees.\" This suggests it's concerning access control, meaning it's likely about who can access or manage client information. I think it fits best under the \"Access\" category since it relates to permissions and role assignments. I'll make sure to format this correctly as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That seems straightforward enough!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
