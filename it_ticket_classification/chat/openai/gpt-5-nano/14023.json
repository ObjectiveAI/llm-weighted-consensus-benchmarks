The request is to add a member to a mailing list. This seems like an access or permissions issue. I\u2019m leaning towards the \"Access\" category since it deals with list membership rather than granting admin privileges, which would fit under \"Administrative rights.\" So, \"Access\" seems like the best choice here!**Categorizing IT requests**\n\nIt looks like the task is simply adding a member to a mailing list, which falls under granting access to a distribution list. Therefore, \"Access\" is the right category. While \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous\" are options, they don't seem as fitting. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object that only includes the necessary category, as instructed. The format should be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI need to make sure to stick strictly to that format without any extra text!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
