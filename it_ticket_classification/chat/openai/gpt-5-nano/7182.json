It includes phrases like \"action required approve requisition\" and \"approver.\" This seems strongly related to requisition approval for a purchase request, mentioning terms like \"amount,\" \"requester,\" and \"components.\" Given the context, I\u2019ll assign it to the Purchase category because it clearly centers around the requisition approval workflow. Seems like a straightforward categorization!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket and provide a JSON object with the category key as required. The schema indicates that the category should be a string, so I plan to output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I want to make sure there's no extra text in my response since the instructions suggest it should be just the JSON. While I considered \"Access\" due to references about \"identity,\" the core theme is still about requisition approval for a purchase. So, Purchase it is!"
