However, \u201cStorage\u201d usually covers different issues like quotas and archiving, and the user hasn't mentioned hardware or internal projects. Therefore, it seems like \u201cAccess\u201d is the most appropriate category for this situation.**Categorizing the issue**\n\nThe ticket is concerning access to a shared mailbox, specifically related to retrieving moved folders. I\u2019ve decided to categorize it as \"Access.\" I need to format my response correctly as a JSON object that simply includes this category. The required output is straightforward: it should just be {\"category\": \"Access\"}. Since the instruction only calls for the category, I won\u2019t add any extra notes. Valid JSON is crucial, so I\u2019ll ensure that's what I deliver."
