The user provided a garbled email text that seems like a confidentiality notice, mentioning things like \u201cclassified,\u201d \u201cconfidential,\u201d and \u201cproprietary information.\u201d These keywords suggest that the ticket likely relates to \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I should focus on ensuring it's categorized correctly to address the confidentiality aspects mentioned. Let's make sure to label it appropriately!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI see the ticket mentions terms like \"new starter,\" \"head communication engagement,\" and \"proprietary information.\" These phrases hint it's not about hardware or storage but rather a confidentiality issue tied to email communication. It might be categorized under \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it involves onboarding and confidentiality notices. However, none of the given categories explicitly represent information security. I'll likely lean towards \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights\" as the best fit for this situation.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT Ticket based on provided text. The details indicate it\u2019s a confidentiality notice, mentioning terms like \u201cclassified\u201d and \u201cproprietary information.\u201d Since the content doesn\u2019t fit hardware, storage, or other specific categories, I think it might belong under \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d if it relates to compliance. However, since it seems more like a general request about confidentiality, I believe \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit as a catch-all category.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
