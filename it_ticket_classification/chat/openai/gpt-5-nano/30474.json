The ticket mentions a \"new intern\" and seems focused on HR aspects like leave days and starter forms, indicating it's about HR support. Looking at the schema options, I think \"HR Support\" fits best. So, I\u2019ll output: \n\n{\"category\": \"HR Support\"}**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket, which could be \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The mention of \"oracle\" has me thinking it relates to the Oracle HR system. The ticket discusses onboarding interns, updating their regular plans, and recording leave days, which suggests it's all about HR processes rather than technical issues. So, \"HR Support\" seems like the most fitting choice here, unless there\u2019s an access issue regarding Oracle, but that isn\u2019t clear.**Producing JSON Category**\n\nThe IT ticket mentions \"attachment starter forms interns,\" which points clearly to HR tasks. I need to focus on producing the required JSON category format without any extra information. The allowed categories include \"HR Support,\" and since that's relevant here, the output will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to keep it clean and straightforward, as the system expects proper JSON without any additional text or formatting. I\u2019m ready to finalize this!"
