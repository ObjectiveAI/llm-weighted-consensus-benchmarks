I\u2019ll prepare the output in JSON format with the appropriate category selected.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize the ticket based on the user's request. It seems like it\u2019s mainly about mailbox delegated access, not really about admin-level rights, so I\u2019ll classify it as \"Access.\" The phrases in their request clearly indicate that it\u2019s about delegating access to shared mailboxes. \n\nNow, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object as specified in the prompt, including the category field. The final output will be concise, confirming that \"Access\" is the suitable category.**Finalizing Response for IT Ticket**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize the request and respond with just the category. Since it falls under \"Access,\" I\u2019ll create a JSON object with that specific detail. \n\nSo the final output will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text or unnecessary information. Keeping it concise is key!"
