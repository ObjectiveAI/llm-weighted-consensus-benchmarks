I\u2019ll need to assess the specifics of the ticket to assign the most appropriate category. Let\u2019s take my time to figure this out!**Categorizing a ticket**\n\nThe user provided a long, confusing ticket that mentions various topics like \"submission type for net members,\" \"weekly submission flow,\" \"holidays,\" and \"workflow updates.\" I'm trying to understand the main issues here. It doesn\u2019t seem to fit under \"Administrative rights,\" so I\u2019m considering whether to categorize it as \"Access\" instead. I need to ensure I pick the correct category to address the user's concerns effectively. Let's carefully analyze this before making a decision!**Clarifying ticket categories**\n\nThe ticket mentions various topics such as approvals, flow updates, holidays, and submission types, but it doesn\u2019t seem to fit under hardware, storage, or purchase categories. It might fit \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but the category should be one from the provided list. \"HR Support\" is unlikely since it\u2019s not explicitly about HR issues. Given the context of changes and approvals related to access rights, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Access,\" which makes sense with the ticket's content.**Determining the best ticket category**\n\nLooking at the provided categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights, I need to pick the best fit for the ticket content, which addresses \"submission type,\" \"weekly submission flow,\" and \"approver holidays.\" It appears to be a workflow or process change request. The mention of \"approver\" ties in with Access rights, but it might also relate to Administrative rights or even be classified under Internal Project depending on the specifics of the potential process changes.**Choosing a category**\n\nI\u2019m considering categorizing the ticket. \"Miscellaneous\" could be a safe choice for vague text, but I really want to find the best fit. Given the topics of \"submission flow\" and \"holidays,\" the \"Access\" category seems appropriate since \"approver holidays\" hints at changes in approval permissions. However, it might also fall under \"Administrative rights\" as that\u2019s a subset of Access. Since it seems more about process automation, I\u2019m leaning toward \"Internal Project\" for the internal process changes. So, I\u2019ll go with that and respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
