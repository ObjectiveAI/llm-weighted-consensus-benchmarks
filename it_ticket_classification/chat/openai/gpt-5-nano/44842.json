The issues mentioned, like hearing a continuous tone during calls, suggest it could be a phone or hardware issue. It might fall under \"Hardware\" or \"Access,\" but it seems more related to a phone system outage. Since the user logs in and out, it further indicates a telephony issue. I'll classify it accordingly within IT support.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe categories don\u2019t include \u201cTelecom\u201d specifically, but \u201cHardware\u201d seems the best fit since the user reports phones not working, indicating a hardware issue. The continuous tone suggests it could also involve telephony. \"Access\u201d and other categories like \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d or \u201cInternal Project\u201d don\u2019t apply here. I should output this in a JSON-like format, so I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Maybe I can also include a brief note about the hardware issue!**Confirming output format**\n\nThe instructions are clear that I need to provide just the category object. So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object without any extra text. Since the user asked to categorize the IT ticket, I'll stick to that requirement. The exact output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Simple and straightforward, just as it should be!"
