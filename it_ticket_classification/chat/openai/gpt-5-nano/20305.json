It\u2019s important to choose the right category so that it gets addressed correctly. I\u2019ll evaluate the specifics of the ticket to determine the best fit. Each option has its implications, and I want to ensure everything is organized properly for efficient resolution.**Deciphering ticket content**\n\nI need to read through this ticket, which is quite garbled but seems to reference an \"eel tool\" developed for identifying the location of each team member in the building. It involves moving people to different desks, managing joiners\u2019 names and assigned dates, as well as handling change requests and approvals from the head of department. There are also mentions of maximum granting and rejecting proposed moves, which seem to be part of the update process for these changes.**Evaluating the ticket's purpose**\n\nThis ticket appears to focus on desk and capacity management, specifically regarding a process for moves, changes, and approvals. It might involve access to the internal tool called \"eel,\" which helps identify employees' locations. I\u2019m considering how the user wants to add a button link to maps, likely to enhance functionality. The categories I have to choose from include Administrative Rights, Internal Project, Miscellaneous, and Access. Overall, this ticket seems to be a request for improvements to the \"eel\" tool.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe ticket discusses processes and procedures for moving employees within the office, mentioning aspects like assigned names, dates, and reasons for moves. It could fit under \"Internal Project,\" focusing on the internal tool and moving processes. There's a hint of \"Administrative Rights\" if the focus is on permissions for these moves, but it doesn't fully fit access rights. Given the context about internal tool development and mapping, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best category for this ticket.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
