Given the context, the \"Purchase\" category feels most appropriate. While \"Administrative rights\" could also fit if it involved access, it doesn't seem to, so I'll classify it under \"Purchase.\" The output should be in a JSON format.  \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe instruction is to categorize the IT ticket, and I need to respond with a JSON object that includes a \"category.\" Based on the ticket details, which mention \"purchase requisition,\" \"temporarily,\" \"permanent,\" and \"allocation,\" it looks like it's focused on procurement. Given this context, \"Purchase\" is clearly the right category. No extra text is needed, so I'll respond directly with the JSON format.  \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
