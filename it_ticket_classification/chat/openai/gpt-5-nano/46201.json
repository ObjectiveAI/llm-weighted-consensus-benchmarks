It looks like an access issue since they can't show the content screen and are referring to needing credentials. The mention of \"room\" might indicate something is missing. Overall, I think the best fit is the \"Access\" category since it relates to login and authentication credentials. Let's move forward with that categorization.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI think the \"Access\" category fits best since the user's ticket is focused on access credentials and their inability to show content on screen. They mention needing credentials, which aligns with login issues. While \"Internal Project\" could relate due to their role as a senior software developer, it's more about administrative privileges. Given the context, I'm leaning toward \"Access.\" Now, I can format the response as a JSON object with the category field for clarity.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
