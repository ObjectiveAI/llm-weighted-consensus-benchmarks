It mentions a starter form and asking for help filling it out. It seems to fall under HR onboarding, so I'm thinking either \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" for permissions related to the new starter. The user is requesting a specific classification for an IT ticketing system, so I\u2019ll ensure it fits one of the available categories.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm reviewing the content that mentions \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"filling out starter form.\" I'm debating between \"Access\" and \"HR Support.\" While it might imply access requests, it's primarily about onboarding. Although \"Administrative rights\" was an option, it's not relevant here. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too generic, and \"Internal Project\" doesn't fit either. Ultimately, \"HR Support\" seems the best match since it's about onboarding. \n\nSo I\u2019ll prepare the response as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Preparing to Output JSON**\n\nI think the user might be expecting a short note along with the category output. The instructions specify I should only provide the category in a JSON object, so I need to be careful not to add anything extraneous. Validity is key, so I want to ensure the JSON format is correct. \n\nAlright, I\u2019ll just focus on delivering the pure JSON response without any extra text. Let's go ahead and answer!"
