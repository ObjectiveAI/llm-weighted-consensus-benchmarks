It mentions things like \"new starter\" and \"starter form complete,\" which suggests it\u2019s related to onboarding. \n\nThe categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, and a few others. Given the context, I think \"HR Support\" is the best fit since it involves onboarding processes and might also touch on \"Access\" for account provisioning. Let\u2019s go with HR Support to align with standard practices.**Evaluating ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s content suggests they might be submitting a new starter form related to an employee in Bogota. The phrases like \"starter form complete\" and \"joining\" point more towards HR than IT. However, since it's categorized as an IT ticket, I need to consider \"Access\" for provisioning accounts or \"Administrative rights\" if it relates to privileges. The closest fit seems to be \"HR Support,\" since it\u2019s about a new starter but also involves IT's role in account setup. It\u2019s a bit tricky, but I\u2019ll lean toward HR Support.**Identifying the right category**\n\nIt seems the best-fit category for this ticket is \"Access,\" as it relates to user access provisioning. \"Administrative rights\" might apply if they specifically need admin access, but that's less likely. The text suggests an email about a new starter process in Bogota, mentioning a completed form and possibly an attached image of it. This points toward an HR onboarding process. For categorization, I think we should go with \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\"**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nThis ticket revolves around completing a form for HR purposes, not explicitly about IT systems. In typical IT triage for a new employee, I would create a ticket under \"Access\" to set up their accounts. However, since this is for categorization, the better option seems to be \"HR Support\" given the context. The phrase \"re starter form complete\" indicates it's about onboarding. While \"Access\" could also work for provisioning, there's no direct mention of access issues. Therefore, I'll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and format that in a JSON object.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
