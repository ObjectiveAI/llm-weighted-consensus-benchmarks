It mentions aspects like initial setup costs, OS, and CPU cores, comparing it to existing infrastructure. The \"Purchase\" category is suitable since it\u2019s clearly about procurement, and \"Hardware\" could also fit because it relates to server hardware. However, it primarily focuses on cost estimation rather than a direct request to purchase, making \"Purchase\" seem most appropriate.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIn ticketing systems, the \"Purchase\" category often relates to procurement requests or budget estimations. The user, a senior engineer, is asking for cost estimates regarding a server, including details like OS, CPU cores, and initial setup costs. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Purchase\" since its focus is on procurement and budgeting. However, \"Hardware\" could also fit due to its relevance to server hardware. The absence of context for an \"Internal Project\" makes it tricky, but \"Purchase\" seems most precise overall.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nThe ticket requests a cost estimation for a server, which indicates a procurement task. The \"Purchase\" category fits well since it covers requests related to acquiring hardware or software. Including \"initial setup costs\" makes it even clearer that this relates to the total cost of ownership. Following the format specified, I\u2019ll output a JSON-like object with a \"category\" key. So, the response will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}, and I\u2019ll keep it concise by not adding extra text."
