There's a request to fill in a start date, possibly needing admin rights. It seems to be an administrative task related to onboarding. Although \"Onboarding\" isn't one of the categories provided, the closest fitting category is \"Administrative rights\" since this task seems to fall under HR or administrative support. I'll categorize it accordingly!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI see the content mentions a \"new starter,\" which is clearly related to HR. The available categories include \"HR Support.\" Initially, I was unsure because it seemed to address filling in a date, perhaps for access setup or orientation. The reference to \"re attached Wednesday pm\" might imply an attachment regarding this new starter. Given the context leans toward the onboarding process, I think categorizing this ticket as \"HR Support\" is the best choice.**Creating JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON-like object according to the system requirements. The prompt informs me that I should output something like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nThe key here is that I only need to include the category selection without any extra text. While I might also consider \"Administrative rights,\" the safest option based on the information is \"HR Support.\" So I\u2019ll produce the final output as:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s clear and concise!"
