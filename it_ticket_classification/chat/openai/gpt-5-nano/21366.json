This could relate to Storage. However, since it addresses policy, it might also fall under Administrative rights. I'll categorize it appropriately based on that context.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe ticket references a \"zip archive file too large,\" which suggests it relates to the category of \"Storage\" because it involves large files. It could also fit under \"Internal Project\" or \"Access\" if it's about site access, but the focus is on the policy regarding large files. Since it mainly discusses how to handle oversized attachments for third-party sites, I\u2019m concluding that it should be categorized as \"Storage.\" I'll finalize this in a JSON object format.**Finalizing JSON format**\n\nI need to present the IT ticket category in the required JSON format, which the system specifies. The category must be one of the enumerated options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since \"Storage\" is valid and fits best, I'm going with that. The instruction emphasizes responding with just the category, so my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I\u2019m double-checking that the quotes are correct for proper JSON formatting!"
