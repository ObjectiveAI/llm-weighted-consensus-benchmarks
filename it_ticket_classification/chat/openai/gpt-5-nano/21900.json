The focus on induction and hire dates supports this categorization as well.**Deciding on the category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket, which centers on hardware allocation for a new starter. While it also relates to \"HR Support\" due to mentions of induction and hire dates, the primary action involves assisting with the completion of the starter form and provisioning hardware. \n\nSince the main focus is on hardware, I will categorize it as \u201cHardware.\u201d So, the output should be a JSON object structured correctly: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.
