The ticket includes phrases like \"access to procurement folder,\" \"myself rights folder,\" and \"approve,\" which all suggest a need for permissions. This seems to fit best into the \"Access\" category, but I also see \"Administrative rights\" being relevant since they\u2019re asking for specific rights. Ultimately, I think \"Access\" is the primary category here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe main theme involves access to a folder and the associated rights, so I think it fits best under \"Access.\" It's not related to hardware, storage, internal projects, purchases, or HR. According to the required format for categorization, I need to provide a JSON object. The system specifies that it should include the category field, so I'll respond simply with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to keep it minimal, just the JSON object as the final answer."
