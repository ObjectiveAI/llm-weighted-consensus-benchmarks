Given the available categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and so on, it seems best to place this ticket in the \"Purchase\" category, particularly if it's about purchase requisitions for hardware or software. If it's about development, it could go under \"Internal Project.\"**Categorizing the requisition ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"requisition\" appears multiple times, along with phrases about assigning something that recently returned. There are hints of different languages and the urgency implied by \"urgent.\" It seems to focus on requisition approvals and the assignment of these requisitions. The best fit is the \"Purchase\" category since requisitions are typically related to procurement. I should output just the category in the required JSON format. So, I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
