The user text is a bit messy but mentions terms related to access and dashboards. It appears the user is asking for changes to be made regarding access to specific dashboards and teams. Given the context, this likely falls under the \"Access\" category. I'll classify it accordingly.**Categorizing IT access issues**\n\nThe ticket mentions removing access and refers to dashboards, roles, and approvals, which fits well in the \"Access\" category. While there's a mention of configurations that sound like they could fall under \"Administrative Rights,\" the primary focus here is on user access to dashboards, permissions, and group configurations. So, I think categorizing it as \"Access\" is the best choice. I'll format my response as JSON with the category labeled as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
