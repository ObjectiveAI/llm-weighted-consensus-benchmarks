They mention \"new purchase\" and \"purchase order,\" along with terms like \"log installation\" and \"receipts.\" Thus, it seems related to purchasing and installation. My best guess is that it fits under the \"Purchase\" category since it heavily hints at new orders. However, I'm also considering if it could relate to hardware regarding a monitor or video. But there's only one category allowed.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket content from the user, which is quite jumbled, but it seems focused on a \"new purchase.\" Since they specifically ask for a category, I think \"Purchase\" is the best fit here. Now, I need to format the response as a JSON object. \n\nThe required output will just be: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. No extra information is needed, just the clean JSON. So I'll keep it succinct and straightforward!"
