I need to categorize this ticket using a predefined set of categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Considering it refers to creating a new project code and mentions attached forms, it likely fits under \"Internal Project.\" \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" are also possibilities, but \"Internal Project\" seems most suitable.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nThe IT ticket mentions creating a new project code, likely for project accounting, which suggests it may fall under \"Internal Project.\" However, I'm also considering \"Administrative rights\" in case they need admin privileges, but the content doesn't clearly indicate that, just mentioning \"create code\" and \"attached form.\" Given the limited categories available, I\u2019ll choose \"Internal Project\" since it best fits the context. Other categories like Hardware, HR, and Storage don't apply here.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the request: \"new project code for account pas wednesday pm code hi please refer attached form create code thanks.\" It seems to be a request for creating a new project code, aligning with internal project management. Therefore, I should categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" The instructions specify that I need to output this as a JSON object. So, I\u2019ll format the response as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, ensuring that I follow the requirements without additional commentary."
