It\u2019s essential to stick to the specified format of the response type. Let\u2019s get this organized!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe content mentions \u201ctemporary phone allocation for on-call duty,\u201d indicating it relates to providing mobile phones to employees. I\u2019m debating whether it fits under \u201cHardware,\u201d \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d or \u201cPurchase.\u201d Given that it's about mobile phone provisioning, \u201cHardware\u201d seems like the best fit. It could also fall under \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d if it doesn\u2019t quite fit any specific category. However, the focus on allocating devices makes me lean toward categorizing it as \"Hardware.\" Let's finalize that!**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI\u2019ve concluded that the most suitable category for this ticket is \u201cHardware.\u201d Now, I need to format this into a JSON object according to the specified structure. The schema points out that I should have a \u201ccategory\u201d key with the value being one of the allowed categories. \n\nIn this case, I\u2019ll output it as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This keeps the response concise and straightforward, just as required!"
