It seems to relate to hardware, particularly network hardware, so I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit. The details suggest it isn\u2019t about HR, access, storage, or anything else beyond that, though it might hint at an \"Internal Project\" if it's project-related.**Determining the service request category**\n\nThis is a service request for hardware replacement, and the categories we can use are \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", and others. I\u2019ll definitely choose \"Hardware.\" I think we need to respond with a structured JSON-like object to specify the category. The instruction says to use a JSON format with a category field. So, I\u2019ll just give the final answer as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I should keep things simple and avoid any extra notes or text."
