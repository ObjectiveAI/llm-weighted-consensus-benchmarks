Since the ticket mentions \u201cnew starter\u201d and \u201chire,\u201d it seems to fit best under \"HR Support.\" However, I must also consider potential IT tasks like provisioning access or email accounts. It's a bit tricky, but HR Support seems most relevant!**Classifying IT tickets**\n\nFor classifying the IT ticket, I think \"HR Support\" is the best category since it\u2019s about onboarding a new starter. However, if the focus is on IT access provisioning, \"Access\" might fit better. The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" among others. There\u2019s no explicit mention of access in the ticket, so I'll stick with \"HR Support\" for onboarding. My output will be a JSON object specifying this category!**Finalizing category output**\n\nThe right choice for the category is \"HR Support.\" I need to output just the JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I should avoid any extra commentary, as the instruction specifies to respond with the category only. While there\u2019s a chance it could relate to \"Administrative rights\" for a new user, there's no explicit mention of that. To be safe, I\u2019ll stick with \"HR Support\" and provide the valid JSON. Let's finalize it!"
