It seems largely about access control, so my best bets for categorization are either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" This makes sense since it\u2019s clearly about gaining access to this library system and possibly its management settings. I\u2019ll finalize the classification.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user is requesting access to a system, so the category should be \"Access.\" If they need admin privileges, it could also fit under \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Access\" seems safer for this ticket. I need to format the response as a JSON object, strictly following the structure provided. Therefore, I\u2019ll respond with exactly: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text or formatting to keep it valid JSON. Let's go ahead and finalize that!"
