Phrases like \"storage usually work weekends\" indicate that it likely belongs in the \"Storage\" category. The user appears to be asking about a storage outage from Friday PM and wants to confirm if storage can be reinstated. So, it makes sense to categorize it under \"Storage\" and prepare a JSON response for that category.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI need to produce a JSON object that properly reflects the required \"category\" format, which should include \"category\": string values from the enumerated categories. The instruction indicates that the final answer must be a JSON object with \"category\": \"Storage\". However, the schema provided seems more like a guideline for the structure of the response rather than something to include in my final answer. So, I'll ensure to output it correctly as {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Delivering JSON Response**\n\nI'm certain that I should respond simply with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. Since the instruction was to categorize the IT ticket and the content is clear and minimal, I need to avoid adding any extra text. It\u2019s important to stick to the task at hand and deliver precisely what\u2019s required. So, I\u2019ll make sure to provide it as a direct response without any unnecessary additions. Yes, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do!"
