The user mentions they've changed their password but can't log into a sheet, and although it accepts the password, it says it's expired, prompting a change. They can\u2019t change the domain password via their laptop, only through the web, so they\u2019re requesting help to check Active Directory and reset it if possible.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm dealing with an access issue where the user can't log into the domain due to an expired password that needs resetting. I need to categorize this ticket, and the options include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since it relates to authentication, \"Access\" is the best fit. I'll format the response as a JSON object, including \"category\": \"Access\". I need to make sure to keep to the exact allowed strings for proper categorization."
