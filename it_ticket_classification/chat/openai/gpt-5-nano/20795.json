The provided schema includes categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and more. Given that the user mentions \"wants to access planning\" and \"difficulties these days working without,\" it suggests this issue relates to access or permissions. Since \"access\" appears multiple times, it seems logical to categorize this ticket under \"Access\" due to the emphasis on accessing a planning tool.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering the phrase \"accept decline,\" which seems related to meeting invites, possibly for calendar invites. However, the categories don't include a direct option for \"Calendar.\" \"Access\" seems like a safe choice, and \"Administrative rights\" might be relevant if the user needed permission for the planning link, though they didn't mention rights explicitly. Given this, \"Access\" fits best. I'll respond with the JSON object specifying the category, formatted as requested. So, the output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
