The message talks about a new starter and onboarding documents, mentioning a starter form and joining details. This strongly suggests it's related to HR processes. Given the context, it seems appropriate to categorize the ticket as \"HR Support,\" as that aligns well with its focus on onboarding and new employee protocols. I\u2019m confident this is the right choice!**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI'm finalizing the response format for the IT ticket categorization. It looks like \"HR Support\" is the right category to use. According to the system, I need to structure my output as a JSON object, ensuring no extra commentary or text. So, I\u2019ll put together the JSON as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I want to make sure it\u2019s properly quoted and clean. Although I considered \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" the context strongly points to HR Support. Let's go with that!**Finalizing category selection**\n\nIt looks like we're focused on document processing for onboarding, which definitely aligns with \"HR Support.\" I'm ready to finalize that choice! This category fits perfectly, considering the context of the ticket regarding new employee documentation. Now, I just need to produce and confirm it. I\u2019m glad we reached this conclusion! Let\u2019s proceed with the response in the correct format."
