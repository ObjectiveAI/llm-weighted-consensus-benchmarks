The user's message seems messy, but it looks like they're discussing a \"starter form\" for a new contractor. This could fit under \"Access\" for new starter access, \"HR Support\" for onboarding, or potentially \"Administrative Rights\" if it's about granting access. Overall, it emphasizes completing the starter form to facilitate access.**Deciding Category for IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, which is likely related to onboarding forms. The repeated phrases indicate it pertains to a \"new starter contractor\" and \"starter form.\" The categories available include \"HR Support\" and \"Access.\" \"HR Support\" seems fitting for onboarding, while \"Access\" applies to account provisioning. Since I must output a JSON with the chosen category, I need to decide if it aligns more with provisioning accounts or support for the onboarding process.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"starter form contractor\" indicates that the user is likely referring to necessary forms for onboarding. There are several mentions of \"completion\" and \"help,\" suggesting they might be asking for assistance to complete the starter form, which is essential for granting access. Since the user requested a category for this IT ticket, I believe \"Access\" is the most appropriate choice for provisioning rights. I\u2019ll structure my response simply as the required JSON object."
