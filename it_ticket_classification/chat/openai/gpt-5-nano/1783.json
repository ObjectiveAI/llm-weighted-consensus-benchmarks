This seems to fit under access permissions, probably related to HR analytics. The best categories for this ticket would likely be \"Access,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Administrative rights,\" since it's about managing access.**Categorizing the ticket again**\n\nI\u2019m thinking this ticket might relate to an \"approval workflow\" within attrition management. However, since the category options are limited, \"Access\" seems to be the most suitable choice since it\u2019s primarily about access to the system. Although \"HR Support\" would fit too, it\u2019s not an available option. I need to structure the response correctly as a JSON object, so I\u2019ll output: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. That seems to cover it well!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
