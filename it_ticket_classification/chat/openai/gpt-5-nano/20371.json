The user mentioned various details, like providing a license and installation instructions. I see options from the categories listed: \"Purchase\" could work because it hints at license procurement, while \"Administrative rights\" might fit since installation typically requires those rights. \"Access\" is also a possibility because of the mention of providing a license. I'll go with \"Purchase\" for licensing costs.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe statement \"license request\" indicates procurement, while \"provide details how to install PC\" points to installation instructions. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Access\" is about credentials; \"Administrative rights\" is for privileges. Since the user is asking for license and installation details, I think \"Purchase\" fits best due to the focus on licenses. While \"Access\" could also be relevant, it seems more about procurement, so I will go with \"Purchase.\"**Formatting IT Ticket**\n\nI realize I need to provide a JSON object with the category set as \"Purchase.\" There's this earlier format we might need to consider, which specifies the structure. Since the instruction calls for a categorized IT ticket, the output needs to match that expected format: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit due to installation requiring admin privileges, I think the term \"license request\" is more about procurement. So, I'll stick with \"Purchase\" and deliver just the JSON format."
