The user mentions \"extenders needed,\" quotes, brand preferences, and safety buttons, which all lead me to believe this relates to hardware. Given the context, it seems most fitting to place it in the \"Hardware\" category, but it could also fit under \"Purchase\" since they're asking for a quote. Ultimately, I decide on \"Hardware\" due to the emphasis on extenders.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI'm figuring out the right category for this IT ticket. Since it's primarily about purchasing extenders and the user specifically asks for a quote, it seems most appropriate to categorize it as \"Purchase.\" However, I could see it fitting under \"Hardware\" as well since extenders are hardware items. Ultimately, I\u2019ll stick with \"Purchase\" for clarity and compliance. I\u2019ll format my final output as a JSON object with the appropriate category. Here\u2019s what it looks like:\n\n{\"category\": \"Purchase\"}{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
