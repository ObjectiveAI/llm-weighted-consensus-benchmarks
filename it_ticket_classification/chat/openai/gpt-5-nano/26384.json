The relevant categories from the system are: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the mention of \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"joining,\" it seems like the most appropriate categories would be \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights,\" particularly for onboarding and access provisioning.**Processing IT Ticket**\n\nIt seems the user has filled out a starter form and asked for help with it. Given the context of providing access for a new starter, the best category to choose would be \"Access,\" as it's focused on access provisioning. While \"HR Support\" could relate, the ticket is IT-specific, so \"Access\" fits best. I should also consider \"Administrative rights,\" but since that's about granting admin privileges and might not apply here, \"Access\" remains the most suitable choice. I'll provide this categorization as a JSON object.**Delivering JSON Response**\n\nThe prompt includes a category schema that requires me to respond with a JSON object, specifically with the category value. It needs to be an exact match, so I'll format it as {\"category\":\"Access\"} with a capital \"A.\" The user's request was to categorize the IT ticket, and they likely just want the category without any extra explanations. Since the instructions emphasize structure, I can confidently respond with just the JSON object. So, I will deliver that now!"
