The provided categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I need to extract the relevant information from the ticket text, but it seems quite garbled and difficult to understand. I\u2019ll choose the best-fitting category from the enumerations provided based on what I can decipher from the text.**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions terms like \"change module,\" \"reference field mandatory,\" and \"rolled back changes.\" It seems to be related to Change Management, but there\u2019s no explicit category for that in our list. I\u2019m considering whether \"Internal Project\" fits best, as it involves a project change. I suspect \"snow\" refers to ServiceNow, specifically its Change module. So, I think categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" makes sense since it focuses on change control and project processes. Alternative categories like \"Administrative rights\" aren't appropriate here.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI need to classify this ticket, which involves change control in ServiceNow, but there's no specific category for \"Change Management.\" \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit since it's about an IT project change. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too vague. I need to respond with a JSON object, specifically: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It's critical to follow the schema, which states the top-level JSON must include the type as \"object.\" I want to ensure I comply while also giving the user a clear response.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nIn previous tasks, I\u2019ve simply responded with JSON formatted like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. However, the schema indicates it needs to be structured as an object with properties. So, I should just return the category value, but to be safe, I want to make sure I\u2019m still following the required format. Still, I\u2019m clear that the correct JSON to use is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI\u2019ll deliver only that JSON without any extra explanation. It\u2019s straightforward!"
