They mentioned crashes related to devices, which seems to point toward hardware issues. Looking at the categories provided, \"Hardware\" fits best. So I'll prepare the output in JSON format with the appropriate category designated. The system requires that I respond in a specific format, indicating the category string among the predefined options. Let's go ahead and finalize that!**Determining the category**\n\nI need to figure out which category fits the ticket. The text seems garbled, mentioning \u201ccrashes once per day,\u201d \u201cdomain crashes,\u201d and \u201cdrivers fail for devices.\u201d It suggests a problem related to hardware or possibly software, but \u201cHardware\u201d is the closest available option since there\u2019s no \u201cSoftware\u201d category. I also considered \u201cAccess\u201d for potential domain login issues, but it doesn\u2019t seem strong enough. Overall, \u201cHardware\u201d feels like the best fit based on the context.**Classifying the ticket**\n\nI've determined that the category should be \"Hardware\" since the ticket mentions crashes, failing drivers, and devices. The response needs to be a JSON object, structured properly to fit the requirements. The format requires that the \"category\" field be a simple string, specifically \"Hardware.\" \n\nI\u2019ll keep it straightforward by only outputting the required JSON without any extra text or formatting. Alright, let's proceed with the response: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
