The content mentions flammable materials, cages, and surveillance cameras, which gives me safety vibes. It might fit as \"Hardware,\" since it discusses equipment and extension cords. The mention of Digital Realty hints at it being related to data centers, but there\u2019s no \"Security\" category available. I should consider \"Administrative rights\" as a possible fit, but it seems a bit off. It's tricky!**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI'm narrowing down the categories for this IT ticket. \"Access\" doesn\u2019t seem right since there's no mention of access control, and \"Internal Project\" or \"Storage\" don't fit either. \"Hardware\" feels appropriate due to the equipment and extension cords mentioned, and the flammable materials suggest a safety hazard. However, \"Safety\" isn\u2019t an option. \"Miscellaneous\" could work too, given the ticket's messy nature with various issues like flammable materials, cameras, and racks. It\u2019s a bit tricky!**Assigning category to the ticket**\n\nThe user's message emphasizes flammable materials, racks, cameras, and extension cords, which all lean towards \"Hardware.\" The term \"pols\" might refer to \"policies,\" hinting at monitored camera policies. I did consider categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" due to possible camera installation, but the categories are quite generic. I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit here. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object with just the category as requested. \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}**Delivering the category**\n\nI think it's time to deliver the response since the user asked for a category. They might only want that specific information, so I\u2019ll stick to just providing the JSON format without any extra commentary. It\u2019s important to keep it clear and concise. I\u2019ll go ahead and respond with just the requested category object!"
