If it's general access, I might consider using \"Access,\" but the term \"rights owner\" leans toward administration. So, I'll finalize my response as a JSON object: `{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}`.I see that the required format specifies responding with a category object as a string. So, I'll provide this: `{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}`. Although the user didn't ask for an explanation, I might think about including a brief justification. But the guidelines emphasize that I should only deliver the category object. Since the prompt clearly states to \"Please categorize this IT ticket,\" I'll focus on outputting just the JSON object as specified."
