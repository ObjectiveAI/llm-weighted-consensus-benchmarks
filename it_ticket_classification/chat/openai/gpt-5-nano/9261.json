Given the lack of a clear request for admin rights, I think \"Access\" is the most fitting since it revolves around retrieving reports. So, I'll go with \"Access\" for this ticket.**Outputting in JSON format**\n\nI need to output the category in JSON format, specifically as an object with a \"category\" key. The prompt guides me to respond with the correct structure without adding any extra text. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll just provide: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This keeps things clean and straightforward. I want to make sure it's exactly as expected, so I\u2019ll stick to just the category object for clarity."
