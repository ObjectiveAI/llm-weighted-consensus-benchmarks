The user message seems garbled but mentions \"submission errors,\" \"urgent,\" and \"select code for Monday.\" It could relate to submission errors, maybe falling under \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I should consider \"Internal Project\" if linked to a project. It looks like \"Access\" could also apply if it's about codes or permissions.**Requesting Clarification for Ticket Categorization**\n\nIt's a bit unclear what category fits best for the IT ticket the user provided. They asked to categorize a string that includes \"submission errors.\" I think the best option might be \"Miscellaneous\" since it doesn\u2019t clearly fit any specific category. There's also the \"Internal Project\" category, if it relates to a project, or \"Administrative rights\" for admin issues. I could propose \"Miscellaneous\" as a default, while also asking for clarification since it might help narrow it down.**Crafting the JSON Response**\n\nI want to create a clear answer for categorizing the ticket as {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Since there isn't a specific category for software issues and the ticket mentions submission errors, this seems like the best fit. While I could suggest tags like \"Urgent\" or \"Code,\" those aren't categories. The format requires a JSON object, so I'll stick with just the category. I'll output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} and maybe add a brief note like, \"If you have more details, please provide additional info.\""
