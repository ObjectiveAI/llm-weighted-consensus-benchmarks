It looks like they\u2019re asking for help in implementing changes and estimating tasks but the message is hard to follow. I'll need to clarify the key points before deciding on an appropriate category.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m trying to make sense of a user request about changes to statuses, task progress, and improvements in project management. It\u2019s a bit complex and seems focused on internal project management. Based on the categories available, \u201cInternal Project\u201d feels like the best fit since it relates to workflow improvements and estimation. I\u2019m considering \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but those don't quite capture the issue. So, \"Internal Project\" is definitely the way to go!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
