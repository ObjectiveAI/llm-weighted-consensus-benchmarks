The ticket mentions issues with sharing an Outlook calendar and receiving permission errors, which clearly points to an Access issue. Although it might relate to an \"Internal Project\" or involve \"Administrative rights,\" it primarily deals with access control. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the most fitting category since it focuses on permission problems. Let's ensure that we classify it accurately!**Classifying IT ticket category**\n\nGiven that the issue revolves around sharing calendars and permission errors, I should categorize it as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The mention of \"permission error\" strongly indicates it's an access rights issue. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" since it's about controlling access to resources. The JSON format for categorization will look like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nNow, I'll deliver the response as required!"
