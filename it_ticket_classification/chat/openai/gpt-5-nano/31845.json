The ticket content is a bit jumbled and focuses on problems with an \"activities calendar\" related to viewing and accessing it, along with an error issue. It seems to relate to Access or Administrative rights, concerning permissions. I\u2019ll need to be careful in making the right choice for categorization based on the ticket details.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out how to categorize this IT ticket based on the content. The options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others, but it doesn\u2019t explicitly mention \"Software.\" While \"Miscellaneous\" might fit, I\u2019m considering \"Access\" due to issues related to viewing and adding a shared calendar. The user\u2019s request isn\u2019t crystal clear, but since it discusses an application problem with errors, \"Miscellaneous\" seems the best choice. I\u2019ll format the output as required in JSON style. \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}**Choosing the category**\n\nI'm trying to determine the best category for this IT ticket. The closest options are \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access,\" especially since the user mentions errors related to viewing a shared calendar. Since they didn\u2019t indicate any login issues, it's more about permissions or access to calendar resources. Considering the ambiguity, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the safest choice to cover this generic application issue. I\u2019ll provide the category in a JSON format.\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
