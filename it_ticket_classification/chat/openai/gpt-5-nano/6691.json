The options are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context, it seems to relate to creating grades, which could fit under \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" if access permissions are required. However, there's no clear mention of needing access, so \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d might work too, but it\u2019s a bit uncertain.**Identifying ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to classify a task related to creating new \"grades,\" possibly for salary or performance levels in an internal system. The categories include \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Given that this task seems tied to an internal project, it feels like \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. However, if access authorization is needed, then \"Administrative rights\" might apply, but the user hasn't mentioned needing access\u2014just creating grades. So, \"Internal Project\" looks more suitable.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm looking to classify an IT ticket based on the user's request to create grades. If it's a standard form and requires administrative privileges, it would fit under \"Administrative rights.\" However, since creating those grades involves an internal workflow, I think \"Internal Project\" is actually the best match. There's also the option of \"Miscellaneous\" if I'm uncertain. Ultimately, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object that includes {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"} as per the requirements.**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to provide a response in the required JSON format, focusing on the \"category\" property. The schema specifies I should use a structure like {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[...]}}}. My answer will simply be {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} based on my earlier analysis. Since the instructions emphasize delivering just the JSON object, I won't add any extra text. I'll stay precise and deliver just that."
