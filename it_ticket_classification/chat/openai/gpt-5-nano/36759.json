This ticket is about travel to Denmark for the Okapi project, covering flights, accommodation, and expenses. It seems to relate to either Procurement/Purchase or possibly Administrative rights. \"Purchase\" feels right since it involves bookings and expense codes. \"Internal Project\" applies too. \"Access\" and \"HR Support\" aren't relevant here, so \u201cPurchase\u201d seems like the best fit.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nThe best category for the IT ticket seems to be \"Purchase.\" I need to format my response as a JSON object according to the schema provided, which requires a category field. So, my final response should be: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s in the correct format without any extra text, ensuring valid JSON. That way, it aligns perfectly with the requirements. Let's finalize this straightforward response!"
