The user mentioned changing a project manager, rights, and feedback, among other things. \n\nLooking at the provided categories, it seems like it would best fit under \"Administrative rights\" due to the mention of access and changes in roles. \n\nSo, I could create a JSON object with this category identified for clarity. I\u2019ll make sure to format it correctly.**Interpreting IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the user's request, which is a bit unclear. They want to change a project manager, but it seems there are some missing names in the message. The mention of \"Oracle\" suggests it relates to a specific project.\n\nThey also reference changes in rights and feedback, which points to possible categories like \"administrative rights\" or \"access.\" Overall, this request seems centered on managing project roles and permissions and might fit under \"Internal Project\" as well. I'll need to categorize it properly.**Choosing a Category for IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the possible categories for this IT ticket, which includes \"Internal Project\" for internal changes and \"Access\" for granting rights. The user's message notes \"granted rights,\" alongside phrases like \"please change myself\" which are a bit unclear.\n\nIt seems they're requesting to change a project manager and adjust access rights, tying into both categories. Since there's also an \"Administrative rights\" category that refers to elevating permissions, I\u2019ll take that into account. The phrase \"pm code\" might stand for project manager code, suggesting it\u2019s relevant too.**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nThe user's request appears to be about changing the project manager for an Oracle-related project, possibly on a Wednesday. The message is quite cluttered, mentioning \"granted rights\" and \"requested several times,\" which points to potential access rights issues.\n\nI need to categorize this ticket effectively. It seems I should choose between \"Access\" for rights granted or \"Administrative rights\" if it\u2019s specifically about administrative permissions. However, since the request is also about changing leadership, it doesn\u2019t solely focus on rights. So, I\u2019ll need to consider both aspects in my categorization.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI need to classify the IT ticket and it seems that typically, one category is used for classification. In this case, both \"Internal Project\" and \"Access\" could apply. However, since the content focuses on project management changes related to an internal Oracle project, \"Internal Project\" feels like the most fitting choice.\n\nThe ticket does mention granted rights, but it's not strong enough to lean towards \"Access.\" Therefore, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and provide the output in a JSON format as required. So here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
