It seems to relate to time management tools. I'll parse the content closely: it mentions the Oracle timesheet specifically and needs a template. I'm considering categories like \"HR Support,\" since timesheets are typically HR-related. It might also fit into \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" but \"HR Support\" feels like the right choice here.**Confirming ticket category**\n\nI realized that \"HR Support\" is indeed listed as one of the available categories in the user's prompt. Given that the IT ticket is about a weekly template for an Oracle timesheet, it definitely relates to HR functions. While \"Internal Project\" could also fit\u2014since it might pertain to internal tools\u2014I think \"HR Support\" is the more accurate categorization here. I'll format the response in JSON, providing the category as \"HR Support,\" since that aligns best with the request.**Formatting final answer**\n\nI need to provide the final answer as a JSON object, following the required format from the system. The output should be a simple response containing only the category. The correct format is: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there's no extra text or unnecessary whitespace, keeping it concise and to the point. I'll deliver it in a single line just as required. So, the response should be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Let\u2019s go ahead and present that!"
