While \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could fit, it\u2019s more about elevated privileges. The user mentions \u201cchange ownership lists\u201d and \u201cmodify members,\u201d which points to managing access rights. Given that \u201cexternal\u201d is also mentioned, \u201cAccess\u201d is definitely the right choice. So, I\u2019ll provide the JSON response as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.The system is asking for a valid JSON object that includes \"category\": \"Access,\" matching the given values. It's clear that the output needs to be strictly formatted as JSON. In previous cases, I\u2019ve provided this format as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to make sure there\u2019s no extra text, just the JSON itself. So, I'll prepare the final answer accordingly."
