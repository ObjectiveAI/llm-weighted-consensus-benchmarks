It seems to touch on onboarding, possibly indicating HR involvement. Given that it mentions \"new starter\" and \"starter forms,\" I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most fitting category. However, \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, considering it mentions access aspects. Let\u2019s go with HR Support for now!**Evaluating IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket. Since it involves a new starter, there\u2019s a chance it falls under \"HR Support\" due to the onboarding forms mentioned. However, if it revolves around access provisioning for the new starter, \"Access\" might be more appropriate. The repeated mention of \"starter form\" and \"head testing\" indicates a focus on onboarding processes or system access. I\u2019m weighing these options carefully to ensure I select the right category.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket that mentions \"starter form\" and \"new starter.\" This sounds like it's related to HR onboarding processes. While \"Access\" could fit if it were about access rights, there's no explicit mention of that\u2014just forms and testing. \n\n\"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" don't seem relevant, and the other categories like \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Hardware\" don't apply either. So, \"HR Support\" seems like the most fitting category for this ticket!**Formatting IT Ticket Response**\n\nIt seems clear that the IT ticket needs to be categorized, and \"HR Support\" is the most fitting choice for onboarding forms managed by IT. Now, I need to format my response as a JSON object, which must match the specified structure. The required format opts for a simple response without additional text. \n\nSo, I\u2019m ready to output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}, making sure I follow proper capitalization and syntax. Here goes!"
