The user has highlighted issues like \"change owners\" and \"ownership details wrong,\" indicating an urgent need to modify permissions. Since \"Administrative rights\" seems to fit well for requests about ownership and permissions, I'll categorize the ticket accordingly. I need to provide the required JSON format as specified, so I\u2019ll format my final output as: {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket based on the user\u2019s request. The instructions say to output only the category in JSON format, following the provided schema. While \"Access\" refers to general user permissions, \"Administrative rights\" is specifically about modifying ownership and permissions. Given the user's mention of changing owners and adding members, \"Administrative rights\" seems the most fitting. So, I'll just output: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. No extra text is needed!**Clarifying content type**\n\nI\u2019m noticing that the content is a bit messy, and I\u2019m trying to figure out if it's related to lists, like Shared Lists or distribution lists. It might even be about something called \"PowerLists.\" Regardless, the focus seems to be on categorizing this information, so I should stick to outputting it in JSON format. Let\u2019s ensure I have everything in place and present it clearly! Ready to get that JSON done."
