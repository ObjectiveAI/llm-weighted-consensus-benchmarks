They mentioned things like \"new project code\" and \"Oracle Fusion,\" along with an attachment. It seems to relate to creating a new project code, which might fall under categories like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It\u2019s a bit unclear, but I think it\u2019s focused on project coding. I\u2019ll need to map it accurately from the category list provided.**Classifying IT Ticket Category**\n\nI have a list of categories to consider: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Administrative Rights, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Miscellaneous. This ticket seems to fit best under \"Internal Project\" since it's discussing a new project code in Oracle Fusion and creating a job code form. However, if they need access to set up the project code, \"Administrative Rights\" could also be relevant. Since the user is asking to create a project code, I'll go ahead and categorize this as \"Internal Project.\"**Crafting JSON Response**\n\nI need to provide the answer in the required JSON format, which includes a \"category\" as a string. The instruction clearly says to use a category object. So, I\u2019ll structure my response like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.\n\nSince the format is strictly JSON, I won't add any extra notes or comments. I'll keep it simple and precise, ensuring it adheres to the instructions. Let's go ahead and deliver this response!"
