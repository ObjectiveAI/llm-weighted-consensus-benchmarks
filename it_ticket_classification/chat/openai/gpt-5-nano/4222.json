However, \"Administrative rights\" could also apply if it's about permissions. So, the main options to choose from are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\"**Classifying IT tickets**\n\nWhen classifying an IT ticket, I notice the user mentions tasks like access provisioning and onboarding, which involve proof of training and approvals. I see potential categories like \"Access,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The term \"start up\" could be referring to a \"startup\" program, and the user may want to upload proof of completed training while managing access requests. \n\nWhile \"HR Support\" fits due to the training aspect, I think \"Access\" is more appropriate since it's primarily about gaining access to that program. Otherwise, \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they\u2019re requesting admin privileges. One of these two categories needs to be chosen.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"starts up wants upload proof completed mandatory trainings\" suggests this is related to onboarding. It seems the user wants access to a startup program, along with uploading proof of completed mandatory training and the ability to accept or decline requests. \n\nTo keep it simple, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access\" since it pertains to access provisioning and onboarding tasks. I will respond in JSON format with the exact keys required. My output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nI\u2019ll ensure everything matches exactly as specified in the instructions."
