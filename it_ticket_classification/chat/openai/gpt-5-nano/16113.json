It might relate to sales leads, but that doesn't seem relevant. If they're configuring these numbers, I could categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" since there\u2019s no direct option. I should ask clarifying questions and maybe provide my best guess, offering \"Miscellaneous\" as a default and suggesting \"Access\" if they want to access extensions. Let's keep it clear and justified!**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket and it seems \"Phone/Extension Management\" isn\u2019t a valid subcategory, so \"Miscellaneous\" is my default choice. To refine the classification, I could propose some clarifying questions. The format calls for a JSON object, and the schema specifies valid fields, so my response should be structured like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}\n\nI'll stick with providing just one category since the schema expects a single string. A brief note might be helpful, but keeping it concise aligns with the instructions!**Delivering category response**\n\nI think it\u2019s best to keep it straightforward and just output the JSON without any extra commentary since the user didn't ask for an explanation. So, I\u2019ll simply provide:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}\n\nThis keeps it clean and meets their needs directly! Let's deliver it as is."
