They mentioned losing a work phone and are asking for the process to get it wiped. The options given are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since this is about a lost device and requesting a wipe, it feels like it fits under Hardware because of the focus on the phone. However, there's also a strong link to Access due to security concerns.**Categorizing lost device tickets**\n\nThis ticket is about a lost or stolen device, and the request to wipe it could involve security. Some organizations classify such issues under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but those may not fit perfectly. Since the main concern is the lost phone and wiping data\u2014linking to device management\u2014I think \"Hardware\" is the closest category. The user\u2019s mention of needing a process for the wipe suggests involvement from IT security, yet that isn\u2019t listed as an option. I'll go with \"Hardware\" and respond in the required JSON format!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
