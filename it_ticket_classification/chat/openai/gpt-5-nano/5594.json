The ticket content discusses various elements related to an employee offboarding process, mentioning things like leaver forms, leave dates, and mailbox access\u2014terms that suggest it involves permissions and access rights. It seems the most fitting category would be \"Access,\" given the references to AD rights and mailboxes, while \"Administrative rights\" could be a related subcategory.**Categorizing Ticket Content**\n\nI see that the ticket content mentions \"AD rights,\" \"approver,\" and \"leaver.\" The best fit for categorization is \"Access,\" since it's focused on access removal and offboarding. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it's about elevating or removing rights, the context strongly suggests it's about access. It also touches on aspects like \"inventory storage,\" but \"Access\" feels most appropriate. So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object specifying the category as \"Access.\" \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
