I\u2019m pondering my options.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve realized the best fit for this ticket is \"Internal Project,\" since it's about updates related to development test servers for a specific project. While \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant if patching requires admin privileges, the ticket doesn\u2019t actually mention that. It notes \"scheduled works affected during form attached.\"\n\nSo, I need to respond following the required JSON format. Since the user provided a schema, I\u2019ll output just the JSON with the category as \"Internal Project.\" Here\u2019s what that looks like.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
