If it\u2019s about physical hardware, then that\u2019s straightforward, but virtualization might fall under \"Storage\" or an \"Internal Project.\" If someone is asking to \"configure VMs to be assigned addresses,\" it could connect to \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" The mention of \"site\" might indicate a remote location, and ordering VMs by addresses seems to point towards technical support, possibly for a development project.**Categorizing user requests**\n\nI\u2019m looking at how to categorize help desk requests, and \"External Tuesday\" might imply an external user, but that category doesn\u2019t exist. If it's unclear, I could consider \"Miscellaneous,\" but perhaps \"Administrative rights\" would work if there are permission needs for managing VMs. The phrase \"telling range addresses\" suggests they\u2019re asking for information about IP ranges rather than access. I think \"Miscellaneous\" fits best, especially since \"Virtual machines\" could also relate to \"Internal Project.\"{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
