The categories to choose from include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the request is specifically about a mailbox size increase, I'll categorize it under \"Storage\" as it relates to storage quota. Now, I\u2019ll provide the response as a JSON object with the category field.**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nThe task is to categorize the IT ticket correctly and ensure that the output matches the required JSON format. The user specifically wants the response as a JSON object with the \"category\" property. Since the request relates to increasing mailbox size, it falls under \"Storage,\" which is one of the allowed categories. I'll keep the format simple and return strictly what is needed without additional content. Thus, the final output will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019ve concluded with the categorization for the IT ticket as {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. While I briefly considered classifying it as \"Access\" because increasing mailbox size involves granting more storage, I realized the request is primarily about storage quota. So, \"Storage\" is the most appropriate choice. I think I've picked the right category now, and I'm ready to produce the final output."
