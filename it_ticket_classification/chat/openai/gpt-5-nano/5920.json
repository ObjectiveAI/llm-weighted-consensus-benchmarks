The terms \u201cnew starter,\u201d \u201ccontractor,\u201d and \u201chelp completion\u201d suggest that it relates to onboarding. My likely category options include \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or possibly \"Administrative rights.\" Since it involves onboarding forms and contractor access provisioning, I think \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" would be the best fit for this ticket.**Categorizing IT ticket again**\n\nIt looks like the term \"new starter\" refers to onboarding procedures, while \"re starter form\" hints at a request regarding that form. I think the best category for this ticket is probably \"HR Support.\" The phrasing suggests it involves completing forms for a new starter, which falls under HR or Administrative onboarding. So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object indicating the category as \"HR Support,\" as that's aligned with the user's request.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket based on specific categories. I see the schema provided indicates I should output a JSON object containing the category. Given the context about onboarding, it makes sense to use \"HR Support.\" So, my response will just be this succinct JSON: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. I'll ensure that it's a valid format without any extra text, just delivering exactly what the user asked for!"
