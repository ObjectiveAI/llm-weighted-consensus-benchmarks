With the repeated use of \"leaver,\" I think the appropriate categories could be \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project,\" depending on our taxonomy.**Categorizing IT Tickets**\n\nI've got a category list to work with: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the ticket involves offboarding tasks like de-provisioning access, managing mailboxes, and handling mobile subscriptions, the most fitting category would be \"Access\" because it covers user access and deactivation. While \"HR Support\" fits given the leave context, \"Access\" encompasses all IT aspects like AD rights and tokens, so I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" I'll respond with a JSON object as instructed.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
