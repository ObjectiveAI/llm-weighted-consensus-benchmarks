The ticket text suggests it's about project setup and forms, so I\u2019m considering categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" The user is asking for help with the new project setup, attaching forms, and creating codes. I\u2019ll analyze the details and choose the best fitting category based on that information.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis looks like it\u2019s an internal project setup ticket. The phrase \"please help create two codes\" probably refers to project codes, and \"attach completed setup form\" hints at setup processes. The mention of linking forms and policies suggests alignment with procedures. \"Internal Project\" seems to fit well, but I wonder if \"Administrative rights\" might apply since they want those codes. Ultimately, I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project.\" So, I'll output the required JSON: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let's keep it simple!**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI see that I need to output a JSON object for the IT ticket categorization. The required format specifies that it should include a \"category\" property, and it should follow the schema provided. So, the output should be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. \n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that I need to stick to this format and not add any extra text. I\u2019ll just ensure the JSON object is clean and straightforward. Let's go with that!"
