It mentions \"change discipline,\" effective date, job title, and grade changed, making it seem more HR-related. However, since \"HR Support\" is available, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as HR Support, even though it's in the IT system.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe closest category for this ticket is HR Support, although I thought it might fit \"Administrative rights\" if it mentioned access, but it doesn\u2019t. The ticket discusses \"records updated,\" \"change discipline,\" and \"effective date,\" which all indicate it\u2019s HR-related. I need to output a JSON object with a category field formatted correctly. \n\nSo, I\u2019m looking to use the required schema, which means my final response should be just: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
