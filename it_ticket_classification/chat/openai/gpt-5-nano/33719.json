The user mentions a \"purchase request\" for a monitor, including allocation and installation details. It sounds like it fits best under the \"Purchase\" category, as it deals with procurement. Although it relates to hardware (the monitor), the \u201cPurchase\u201d category is specifically for requests like this, while \"Hardware\" typically addresses hardware issues. So, I think \"Purchase\" is the right choice here!**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe text clearly mentions a \"purchase request\" and the need to \"allocate a monitor.\" Since this revolves around procurement and approvals, I think \"Purchase\" is the most accurate category. Even though it involves installation and allocation\u2014which could hint at \"Hardware\"\u2014the focus here is on the procurement process. The mention of \"final owner id has been approved\" confirms it's about the purchase request, so categorizing it as \"Purchase\" makes the most sense!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
