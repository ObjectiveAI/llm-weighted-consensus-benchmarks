The text mentions \u201cleaver access card,\u201d \u201cintern leaver form,\u201d and various access-related terms. It seems to relate to removing access for an intern who is leaving, which points to categories like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or even \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll want to classify it in the best fitting category based on that understanding to help resolve the issue appropriately.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket relates to a \"leaver access card,\" most likely concerning internal IT access. Given the options, both \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" could work, but it sounds more about turning off access to an entrance card. I believe \"Access\" is the best choice since it deals with access control for an intern leaving. Though \"HR Support\" might apply for HR processes, this is principally an IT issue about removing access. So, I should classify it as \"Access\" and respond with a relevant JSON category object.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
