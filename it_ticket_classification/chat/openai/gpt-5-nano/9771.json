I can parse this as a request for access permissions. The category should likely be \"Access,\" since it\u2019s primarily about access rights. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also fit, depending on what the user means.**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nWhen a ticket relates to rights or permissions, it can be categorized as \"Administrative rights\" if admin privileges are requested. The phrase \"same rights has\" likely means they're seeking equal permissions as someone else, which focuses on access rights. \"Access\" could be the appropriate choice since it covers general access requests, but \"Administrative rights\" is also relevant. To adhere to the required format, I\u2019ll return it as JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra text needed!"
