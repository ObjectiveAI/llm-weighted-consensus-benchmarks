However, the text is quite messy, so I should proceed with caution and ensure I\u2019m selecting the most appropriate category.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm looking at the text from the IT ticket, which mentions phrases like \"change codes design prototype,\" \"project level,\" and \"assign.\" It seems that \"Administrative rights\" could pertain to access issues, while \"Internal Project\" fits the mention of project tasks. The phrase \u201ccodes design prototype\u201d leans towards development tasks, which isn\u2019t typical for IT categories. Given the context, I think I\u2019ll go with \u201cInternal Project\u201d since it relates to project management activities.**Categorizing access request**\n\nThe user mentions \"please assign\" with references to an engineer and senior accountant, which suggests that this ticket might relate to assigning someone or access issues. I have a list of categories to choose from: including Access and Administrative rights. The phrase \"changed level\" likely relates to access or permission levels. If it's specifically about granting admin privileges, then \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit. Given this context, I\u2019ll categorize it accordingly in JSON format.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
