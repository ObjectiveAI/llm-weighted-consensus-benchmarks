The user\u2019s request is about viewing expense reports older than a certain number of months, mentioning options for personalized searches. It seems to relate to data access, so the best fit might be under \"Access\" or potentially \"Miscellaneous.\" It definitely doesn\u2019t fall under hardware, HR, storage, or purchases.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket. The user is asking how to view expense reports older than a certain number of months and about personalizing the search. This could fit into \"Access\" since it involves permissions to view reports, or it might be in \"Miscellaneous\" for general IT help. However, since they\u2019re specifically looking for instructions, I lean towards \"Access,\" even though it\u2019s about visibility rather than permission changes. \"Administrative rights\" might not be relevant here.**Categorizing ticket as Access**\n\nThere's no need for \"Internal Project\" here, so the safest approach is to categorize this ticket as \"Access,\" since it relates to viewing expense reports and data access. I could provide a concise answer indicating it\u2019s a feature request for filtering or search options within the expense report system. The output should be a JSON object that follows the specified schema, so I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to ensure this is valid JSON."
