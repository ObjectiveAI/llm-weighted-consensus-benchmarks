The request focuses on HR-related paperwork, particularly the leaver form. The available categories include \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights,\" but since the primary focus is on HR administrative matters, I'll categorize this ticket as \"HR Support.\"**Formatting response in JSON**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object format, specifically using the \"category\" key. The appropriate category for this request is \"HR Support.\" I'll ensure the capitalization is correct, with \"HR\" capitalized and a space included. It\u2019s important not to add any extra commentary; I should keep the response brief and straightforward. So, the final output will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
