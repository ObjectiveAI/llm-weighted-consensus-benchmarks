The terms suggest it's regarding an SD card and associated receipts. Considering the options available, \"Purchase\" fits due to the mention of receipts and purchase orders, but \"Storage\" might also apply since the SD card is a storage type. I need to decide which category aligns best with the content of the ticket.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user provided some garbled text about a purchase order and an SD card. I'm considering whether to categorize it as \"Purchase\" or \"Storage.\" The mention of \"purchase order\" and \"receipts\" points towards a purchase, but the SD card suggests it might also fit into the \"Storage\" category. There's some confusion over the details, like installation logs and administrator mentions, but I think \"Purchase\" is the best fit due to the clear purchasing references.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nLooking at the content, it mentions receipts for an SD card purchase and the need to log installation by an administrator. While \"Storage\" could apply since it\u2019s an SD card, the focus seems more on the purchase and attached receipts. The terms \"po\" (purchase order) and \"receipts attached\" strongly suggest that \"Purchase\" is the more suitable category. I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Purchase\" and respond with the appropriate JSON format for the category object.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
