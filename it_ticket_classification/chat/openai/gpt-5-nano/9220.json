The allowed categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket mainly deals with outage communication and management, which might fit under \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, none of the categories seem perfect, so \"Miscellaneous\" could work as a catch-all.**Determining the appropriate category**\n\nI'm considering whether this ticket fits \"Administrative rights\" due to mentions of \"suspending affected polls\" and notifying users. However, it doesn't quite align with that category. It's definitely not hardware, HR, access, storage, purchase, or even an internal project. It could relate to \"Internal Project\" because of its focus on outages and communications, but it's not a technical project either. \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the safest option, so I'll categorize this ticket as \"Miscellaneous\" in the required JSON format.**Preparing the JSON output**\n\nI see that the system expects a JSON-like object based on the provided schema for categorizing the ticket. The required output format is simply: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Even though the category field is nested in the schema, I need to ensure that the final output matches exactly what\u2019s needed. It\u2019s clear I should keep it concise without needing to elaborate on the reasoning. So, I'll go ahead and return: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Let's get it done!"
