I interpret \u201cla merci\u201d as \u201cthanks\u201d in French. There are references to locations like VA and CA, possibly Virginia and California. The categories I can choose from are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It seems like the most fitting categories could be \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project.\"**Determining appropriate category**\n\nThe mention of an \"approval flow change\" indicates a system change related to authorization processes, so the \"Access\" category seems relevant. However, since it specifically refers to changing an approval workflow, categorizing it under \"Administrative rights\" appears more fitting, as this involves permissions for approving entries. The user is likely asking for a categorization of this IT ticket. I\u2019ll format the output in JSON with the most suitable category based on the context provided.**Selecting the right category**\n\nThe change in approval flow implies an internal process shift within the software, potentially classifying it as \"Internal Project.\" However, since it directly involves approving rights, \"Administrative rights\" seems more appropriate. The phrase \"action required approve entries\" suggests that there are entries to approve, like accounts or invoices, reinforcing the focus on approval processes. \"Access\" is likely too broad here, as it pertains more to user access, so I'll go with \"Administrative rights.\" I'll format the output correctly in JSON.\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
