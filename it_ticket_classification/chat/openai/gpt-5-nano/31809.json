Since this involves HR matters, \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category from my list. \n\nI need to format my response as a JSON-like object, meeting the schema requirement. I\u2019ll output it like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.

However, the overall context clearly falls within the HR domain. So, \"HR Support\" is definitely the best choice. \n\nNow, I need to make sure my response follows the required JSON format without any extra text.
