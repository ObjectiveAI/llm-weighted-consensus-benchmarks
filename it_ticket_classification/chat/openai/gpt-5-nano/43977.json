They mentioned \"unable to select contacts\" and \"snow issues,\" possibly referring to software like Snow Software. Additionally, they mentioned the \"line manager section.\" Given that there's urgency and an issue with selecting contacts, it sounds like it might be an access issue. I\u2019m thinking it fits best into the \"Access\" category.**Deciding on category**\n\nThe issue is related to selecting contacts, which makes me think it\u2019s about user access rights. I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing this as \"Access.\" Still, \"Administrative rights\" is also part of the discussion. Since the user seems to have problems accessing the line manager section, it likely involves permissions. So, while \"Access\" fits broadly, \"Administrative rights\" could be more precise. Ultimately, I think I\u2019ll choose \"Access\" and prepare to output JSON with the category field.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
