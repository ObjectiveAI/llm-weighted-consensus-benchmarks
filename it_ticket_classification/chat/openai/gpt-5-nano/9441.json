The allowed categories include \"Access\" and \"HR Support,\" which are both relevant here since recruitment relates to HR. While the mention of \"link libraries view dab ribbon\" adds some confusion, the main focus is still on accessing the recruitment reports. I think \"Access\" would be the appropriate category, but \"HR Support\" could also fit.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nThe ticket is about user access to recruitment reports, which falls under \"Access,\" especially since it's specific to HR reports. While the user mentions linking libraries and viewing a \"DAB ribbon,\" it's a bit murky. \"Link libraries\" might relate to SharePoint, but I'm not fully sure about the \"view dab ribbon\" part. The safest bet is to categorize it as \"Access\" since that aligns closely with the request rather than \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll respond with the category in a JSON object format.**Formatting the response**\n\nThe system specifies a response format for outputting a JSON object. It requires a \"type\" of \"object\" with a \"category\" property as a string. Since the evaluation likely expects just the category, I\u2019ll prepare the JSON object to match that schema. I\u2019ll finalize it as {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text or comments. It's important to stick to the instructions to ensure clarity and correctness in the response!"
