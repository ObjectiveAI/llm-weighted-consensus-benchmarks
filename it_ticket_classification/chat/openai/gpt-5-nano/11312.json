This ticket talks about a new starter contractor and mentions forms and details related to onboarding. It seems relevant to either \"HR Support,\" due to its onboarding nature, or \"Access,\" since it involves provisioning access for new users. I\u2019m leaning more towards \"HR Support\" given the focus on onboarding and the starter form, but access provisioning plays a role too.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe request is about completing a form related to the onboarding process for a new contractor. Among the categories, \"HR Support\" fits best because it relates to onboarding tasks. Although it could also fit under \"Access\" for new starter system access, the content doesn't specifically mention accounts. Given that it's mainly about the starter form, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll prepare the response in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
