The user mentioned something about \"new career for maxim,\" which could suggest a \"new hire\" or account for Maxim. They also talk about needing help with changing assignments and receiving errors. This might relate to permissions for Maxim to make changes. I\u2019ll have to determine which of the available categories\u2014like HR Support, Access, or Miscellaneous\u2014best fits this confusing request.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis ticket probably relates to Admin or Access rights, specifically mentioning \"Administrative rights,\" which is its own category. The user's wording, like \"change assign him allows make changes receive errors,\" suggests they need to assign permissions for someone to make changes and are experiencing errors. Given that this involves granting access, I think \"Access\" might be the best fit, but \"Administrative rights\" could also apply as it suggests elevated privileges. I'll choose the most appropriate category.**Deciding on ticket classification**\n\nIt seems like the user is referring to \"new career\" or possibly \"new career for Maxim,\" but the important part is \"assign him allows make changes,\" indicating they want to grant permissions. This definitely relates to access management. I think the best category here is \"Access,\" although if there's a specific bucket for admin rights, it could be \"Administrative rights.\" Since receiving errors is mentioned, the core focus is still on granting permissions. I'll format the final answer as a JSON object, responding succinctly as required."
