It frequently mentions \"network drive\" and \"reconnect,\" which aligns with categories like \"Storage\" or \"Access.\" While there might be aspects of \"Internal Project,\" it seems most appropriate to lean towards \"Storage\" or \"Access\" due to the focus on drive connections.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions issues with a network drive and requests help, which suggests it's likely about reconnecting or accessing storage resources. I think \"Storage\" seems like the best fit, as it focuses on the network drive itself, but \"Access\" could also apply if it relates to permissions.\n\nSince I need to respond in a JSON format, I'll create an object with the \"category\" key and set it to \"Storage.\" So, here\u2019s the output: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
