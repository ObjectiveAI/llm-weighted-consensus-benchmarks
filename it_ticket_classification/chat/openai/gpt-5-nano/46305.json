It's clearly a hardware issue, so I would categorize it as \"Hardware.\" I'll prepare to respond with a JSON-like format to output the category as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This seems straightforward!**Confirming the JSON Format**\n\nI need to follow a specific schema for the output, which requires a JSON object. So, I\u2019ll categorize the ticket by specifying \"category\": \"Hardware.\" The instructions say to provide only the category, which makes sense for clarity. I think it\u2019s best to keep it straightforward and respond without extra text.
