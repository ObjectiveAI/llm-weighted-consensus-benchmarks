I considered \"Administrative rights,\" but it might not fit. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too vague, while \"Internal Project\" seems quite relevant to ongoing internal initiatives. There's also \"Storage,\" given the mention of \"restore location\" and \"restore tests code,\" but it's more related to business continuity and disaster recovery testing. Ultimately, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best choice, so I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object stating that.**Finalizing the response format**\n\nI need to make sure my output is valid according to the required schema, which specifies a JSON object with a category field as a string. The user asked for a categorization based on specific options. While I could provide a brief justification, it seems they only want the category itself. Therefore, I\u2019ll stick to what\u2019s needed and simply output the category in the required format without any extra text. Here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
