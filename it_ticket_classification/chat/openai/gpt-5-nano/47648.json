It looks like they're having issues accessing something related to \"eel\" or perhaps \"eel.com.\" They seem to be requesting assistance to categorize this issue.\n\nGiven that the ticket mentions access issues, I think the most fitting category would be \"Access.\" However, it could also fall under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll prepare JSON with \"Access\" as the selected category.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing this IT ticket, and it seems the user is having intermittent access issues with the \"eel\" application. They mentioned that they configured it correctly, which suggests it's not a hardware issue. \n\nGiven the context, the most fitting category is definitely \"Access.\" I need to respond with a JSON object structured according to the requirements.
