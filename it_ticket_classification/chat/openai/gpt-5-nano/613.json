It seems to relate to tasks like determining unused servers and their owners, which links closely to hardware. Therefore, \"Hardware\" feels like the best choice. However, \"Internal Project\" might also fit if this process is part of a larger project. I want to ensure I pick the most appropriate category to reflect the ticket\u2019s content accurately.**Structuring IT ticket response**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to respond with a JSON object formatted correctly. The instructions specify that the category must be one of the following options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. Given the content revolves around servers and decommissioning, \"Hardware\" seems like the best fit. I'll structure my response as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to keep it straightforward and minimal.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
