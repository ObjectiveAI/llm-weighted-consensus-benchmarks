Since the request is about adding a user, it seems related to access management. \"Access\" feels like the best fit. \"Administrative rights\" might also work, but it seems more fitting to stick with the broader \"Access\" category for user access provisioning.**Providing JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nThe user wants to categorize a request that says \"add user to all list,\" indicating it involves provisioning. I think I should categorize it as \"Access.\" The system requires a specific JSON format for the response, with a category field. So I'll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. \n\nIt seems clear that the necessary response is just this JSON object, without extra text. I'll make sure the quotes are correct and keep it straightforward!"
