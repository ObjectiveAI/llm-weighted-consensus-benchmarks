The categories seem clear, and I think \"Internal Project\" fits perfectly for this ticket, which involves deactivating accounts. Since I need to format this as a JSON object, I'll go with a response like: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Minimal punctuation and heavy formatting are required, but if I wanted to, I could include a brief explanation. However, I\u2019ll stick to just the category for now.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe instruction clearly states that I need to categorize the IT ticket without providing an explanation. The \"category\" field is a requirement, and I need to follow the specified output format. This means I should produce a JSON object as my final response. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and stick to what's required, ensuring my output adheres to the format while fulfilling the task efficiently. Let's move forward with that approach!"
