The text is a bit garbled, but it refers to allowing access for all staff on Wednesday afternoon and mentions ensuring default configurations to prevent issues. This indicates the user is likely requesting changes related to access rights and configurations. I should classify this ticket under the \"Access\" category, as that aligns with the user's intent.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket clearly falls under the \"Access\" category since it requests enabling access for all staff on Wednesday afternoon, but it also touches on \"Administrative rights\" due to the nature of changing permissions. The user mentions \"administrative rights,\" which makes me wonder if that also applies. However, since the focus is more on broad access for everyone, categorizing it primarily as \"Access\" seems to be the most fitting choice. It's a bit tricky, but I think \"Access\" wins out.**Finalizing Ticket Classification**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the phrase, \u201cassume users cannot via due least cases order prevent issues via default configuration.\u201d It\u2019s a bit unclear, but I still determine that the best category is \"Access\" because it relates to granting permissions. I'll format this as a JSON object since the system requires that format. It seems they generally just want the category, so I\u2019ll respond simply with {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Seems straightforward enough, let's go ahead and do that."
