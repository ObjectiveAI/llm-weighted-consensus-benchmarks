                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the user's request regarding a \"passion map\" server and performance issues. It mentions a specific time, Thursday PM, and relates to an app that is running slowly. The categories I have to work with include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since this concerns server performance, I might classify it under Internal Project or Miscellaneous, but it could also relate to Hardware or Access.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking this ticket could fit into \"Internal Project\" since it concerns a passion map project. However, \"Miscellaneous\" might work too because there's no precise category provided. If it's a server issue, \"Hardware\" could be relevant, but it seems to be more about software performance, so that might not apply. I'll structure my output as a JSON object, so it meets the requirements and contains the right category for the user.**Analyzing IT Ticket Details**\n\nThe user's content suggests they need help with a \"passion map\" server, which implies potential infrastructure issues. The mention of an app moving slowly indicates performance concerns. It could fall under \"Internal Project\" as it relates specifically to the passion map project, but there\u2019s no \"Infrastructure\" or \"Software\" category available. \"Hardware\" might apply for server issues, yet it doesn't address performance directly. Given these details, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit, with \"Miscellaneous\" as a fallback option if needed.**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nI'm considering the best way to categorize the ticket without mislabeling it. The user specifically asked for a categorization, so I should provide a clear answer. Since the ticket relates to a server for a specific project, it seems appropriate to categorize it as \"Internal Project\" rather than something generic like Hardware or Access rights. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object, ensuring that I follow the exact schema required: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That should fulfill the user's request clearly!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
