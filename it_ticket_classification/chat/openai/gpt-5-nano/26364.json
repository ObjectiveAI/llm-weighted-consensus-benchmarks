I'll format my response as a JSON object that includes the \"category\" key set to \"Hardware.\" This way, I\u2019ll keep it structured and clear!**Interpreting IT Ticket**\n\nI need to interpret a ticket regarding a temporary laptop and backpack request. The user is borrowing hardware until Wednesday and seems to ask about the return. It definitely indicates a hardware category since it mentions a laptop and backpack. While I briefly considered \"Storage,\" I reaffirm that \"Hardware\" is the accurate categorization. I'll respond solely with the category object, formatted correctly without any extra text: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Keeping it simple!"
