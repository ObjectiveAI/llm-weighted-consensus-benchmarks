The ticket describes phone issues for service desk teams, mentioning that after picking up the call, the dial tone kicks out and users are unable to get through, experiencing dead lines or recorded messages. This clearly indicates a hardware issue with the phone system, and it requires urgent investigation.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the best category for this IT ticket. \"Voice/Phone system\" might fit, but the category options are limited. \"Hardware\" seems to be the most appropriate given it's a phone hardware issue. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" don't quite apply here, and \"Miscellaneous\" isn\u2019t ideal. Since the instruction is to categorize, I\u2019ll stick with \"Hardware\" and format my response in JSON as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll double-check punctuation and deliver it concisely."
