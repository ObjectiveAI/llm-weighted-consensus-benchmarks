They mention mandatory receipts and a receipt number, which hints at procurement processes. Based on the available categories like \"Purchase\" and \"Administrative rights\", it seems logical to categorize this ticket under \"Purchase\" since it primarily involves ordering and managing received items.**Determining category and format**\n\nI think the appropriate category here is \"Purchase\" because the ticket deals with purchase orders and receipts, rather than \"Administrative rights.\" Since it\u2019s focused on procurement processing, I\u2019m confident in this choice. \n\nNow, I need to respond following the required JSON format. The structure should be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nI'll make sure to only include this JSON object and not any extra text, as per the instructions. So, let's keep it simple and clear.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
