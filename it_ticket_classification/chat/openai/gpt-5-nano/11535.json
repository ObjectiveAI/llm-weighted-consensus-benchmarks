It looks like \"Internal Project\" suits it due to references like \"screen\" and \"custom fields,\" which indicate a customization task. \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Storage,\" and \"HR Support\" don't fit this context at all. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" The response should be a formatted JSON object with just the category: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll make sure that it conforms to the required format!**Formatting the Response**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on the required response format for the task. I see that I need to output a JSON object for the category. The content will simply be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, adhering to the specified schema. It's important to avoid any extra commentary or text, keeping it neat and precise. So, I\u2019ll stick to the final answer being only the JSON object with the category set as \"Internal Project.\" Here\u2019s that again for clarity: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
