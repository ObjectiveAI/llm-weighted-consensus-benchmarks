The phrases like \"new facing facing\" seem repetitive, and \"please add facing joiner\" could imply a request to add a new user. The mention of \"senior tester ext\" suggests it's related to an extension request. Based on this context, it seems the ticket is best categorized under \"Access,\" since it likely pertains to adding a new user or access point.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis ticket seems to relate to adding a new user, often referred to as a \"joiner.\" The phrase \"please add facing joiner\" raises some ambiguity, but it indicates a request for details on this new user. The mention of \"senior tester ext\" hints at an extension, which reinforces that it's about access. Overall, since the focus is on adding a user, I\u2019m inclined to categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" However, \"Internal Project\" could also be a possibility, though it seems less likely.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m determining whether the ticket falls under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" If it\u2019s about granting access to a new user, it\u2019s \"Access\"; however, if it involves adding admin rights, then it would be \"Administrative rights.\" Since the ticket doesn\u2019t explicitly mention admin privileges, my best guess is \"Access.\" The user requires a JSON format, so I\u2019ll output it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward without any extra commentary, just providing the required category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
