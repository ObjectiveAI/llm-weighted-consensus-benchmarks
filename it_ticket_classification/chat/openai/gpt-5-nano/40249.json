I\u2019m looking into terms like \"term relocation,\" \"manager,\" and \"extension hub,\" which might be relevant. I need to decide the best category for these issues. Since it involves the timecard system and HR processes, \"HR Support\" seems like a fitting choice. The ticket mentions timecards and submission, suggesting it might also have an administrative aspect.**Categorizing timecard issues**\n\nI'm parsing through a message about error term relocation related to timecards, specifically their deletion and resubmission. It's a bit messy, but it seems they're focusing on fixing timecard issues by deleting errors and then resubmitting. This content relates more to HR and payroll processing than to hardware or access. Since the user is asking to categorize this IT ticket, I need to create a JSON object with the appropriate category from the allowed values.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
