The user has submitted a ticket regarding Oracle issues that express a high level of urgency. The content, although messy, mostly talks about problems with card submissions and making sure the process works for different shifts. So, it seems this ticket would likely fall under \"HR Support.\" I'll confirm this classification based on the provided details.**Analyzing Ticket Category**\n\nI'm looking at a ticket related to submitting time cards and issues with the Oracle system. It seems like these issues revolve around timesheet submissions based on different shift patterns. I wonder if this fits under \"Access\" since it might involve access rights for submitting cards. However, since it's also about time tracking and HR processes, I think the ticket best fits \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll categorize it as such, since that\u2019s the most appropriate option.**Structuring Ticket Response**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this ticket. Since it focuses on issues related to card submission, I think \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate. Although \"Access\" could work if it was purely about access rights, the context leans more towards an HR process, specifically timesheets. \n\nNow, I need to respond in a structured JSON format. I\u2019ll provide the response as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This keeps it clean and straightforward, just as the instructions specify."
