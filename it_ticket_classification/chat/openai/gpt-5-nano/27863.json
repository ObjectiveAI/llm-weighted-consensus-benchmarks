The term \u201cdesign\u201d could hint at either hardware or purchase needs, but since the focus seems to be on replacing hardware, \u201cHardware\u201d feels like the most appropriate category. However, I\u2019m considering the possibility of \u201cPurchase\u201d too.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nIt\u2019s clear that \"replace monitor\" points to a hardware replacement rather than a purchase, even though \"Purchase\" could be relevant if they are buying new equipment. \"Internal Project\" doesn\u2019t really fit here, and \"Administrative rights\" is not applicable. I could use \"Miscellaneous\" if I'm feeling uncertain, but \u201cHardware\u201d remains the best option since it directly involves a monitor. I'll craft my response in the required format with the category data: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
