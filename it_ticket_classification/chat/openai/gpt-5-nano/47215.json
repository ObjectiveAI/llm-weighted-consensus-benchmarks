It likely relates most closely to \"Administrative rights.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think this ticket might best fit under \"Internal Project,\" as it discusses projects and dashboards, possibly related to a backlog of tasks. The categories include things like \"Hardware\" for issues, \"HR Support\" for HR matters, and \"Access\" for permissions. This ticket appears to involve admin actions, like closing dashboards and deleting pages, which could also point to \"Administrative rights.\" However, the user's phrases like \"request create again\" and \"please advise\" make me consider the context more carefully.**Categorizing IT ticket further**\n\nThe ticket includes phrases like wanting to understand why certain projects exist despite notifications. This suggests an ongoing process involving actions like \"closing sites\" and \"deleting dashboards,\" which points to \"Internal Project\" management tasks. The category would fit for tickets related to requests impacting internal projects. I\u2019m weighing whether to classify this as \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The actions discussed clearly relate to internal IT projects, making \"Internal Project\" seem like the best choice.**Choosing the right category**\n\nIt looks like there isn't a hardware or storage issue here. While the \"Access\" category could fit if it were about access rights, that\u2019s not explicitly stated. The ticket does involve actions like deleting dashboards and closing sites, which typically require admin privileges. However, it doesn\u2019t explicitly mention changes in permissions. I think the \"Internal Project\" category is the best fit since the ticket focuses on projects and dashboards. So, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Internal Project\" and present it in the required JSON format. \n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
