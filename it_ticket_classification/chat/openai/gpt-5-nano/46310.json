The content points towards \"leavers and tickets not received,\" which highlights a request about employees leaving. The mention of a \"leaver form\" indicates an HR/Access issue regarding off-boarding. It seems that tickets related to these leavers haven't been received, so I'll label this as HR Support or Access.**Categorizing IT Tickets**\n\nIt looks like this ticket is about off-boarding since it mentions \"tickets not received\" for leavers. This could imply support tickets related to those users. The mention of removing access hints at relevance to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, the most fitting category seems to be \"HR Support,\" or \"Access,\" given the focus on the leaver form and the management of leaver's access. So, I think I should classify this ticket as \"Access.\"**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019d go with \"Access\" as the best category for this ticket because it relates to removing access for departing employees. The line about still receiving IT tickets could imply ongoing support for them, but the main action revolves around off-boarding and the completed leaver form. I need to craft a JSON response specifying the category as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The instructions focus on this format, so I won\u2019t add an explanation. I'll keep it concise!**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nThe app probably needs a JSON snippet, but I can present it as plain text alongside the JSON. The instructions indicate showing a category object. So, I\u2019ll provide it in the format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That seems clear and straightforward. I'm all set to respond with that!"
