I think \"Access\" is the most suitable category, aligning with breach notifications more closely than others. I\u2019ll format my final response like a JSON output for clarity.**Formatting category response**\n\nThe user's instruction is clear: I need to provide a JSON response with a category. I'll respond with `{\"category\":\"Access\"}` as that's the best fit. Even though the instructions don't explicitly call for an explanation, I think adding a brief justification could be helpful for clarity. However, I must remember not to include extra text beyond the JSON format. So, let\u2019s keep it straightforward and deliver the required output correctly!"
