The user input mentions an issue about an origin.com poll string match check, which probably refers to system errors related to an outage. It seems they\u2019ve noted logs showing that the polls were down at the same time as issues with the load balancer. So, this ticket seems to fall under infrastructure-related concerns, particularly focusing on outages.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize an IT ticket. It could fit into \"Storage,\" \"Hardware,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but I\u2019m not seeing explicit hardware or storage issues. It pertains to infrastructure services like the load balancer and network status. Given the context, it seems best to categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project,\" focusing on an outage. The user mentions that the polls were down and requests investigation, which pinpoints it as an incident involving the load balancer.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking the best category for this IT ticket is \"Internal Project\" since it relates to an internal system. However, I notice the provided options\u2014like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Miscellaneous\"\u2014don\u2019t include \"Infrastructure\" or \"Networking,\" which would be more typical for these kinds of issues. If I\u2019m uncertain, I might lean toward \"Miscellaneous.\" Still, since the incident focuses on a load balancer and its hardware component, \"Hardware\" might actually fit better, despite load balancers often being virtual. The phrase \"poll string match\" does throw me off a bit.**Choosing the category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to decide which category fits best since \"Infrastructure/Network\" isn\u2019t an option. \"Internal Project\" could work for issues related to internal tools like \"origin.com polls,\" but that doesn\u2019t seem right. Other options don\u2019t apply either, like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Purchase.\" While \"Miscellaneous\" is safe, the load balancer outage could lean towards \"Hardware.\" However, since it also ties to software health checks, I could default to \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" for now.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
