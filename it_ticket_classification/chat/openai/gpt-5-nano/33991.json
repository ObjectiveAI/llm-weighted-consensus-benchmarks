The text is pretty messy but mentions aspects like a purchase requester, purchase coordinator, and logging onto a Puma tab. Looking at the available categories, the best fit appears to be \"Purchase\" due to the repeated focus on purchasing details. It seems urgent, and I need to make sure it's categorized correctly to keep things flowing smoothly!**Categorizing an IT purchase ticket**\n\nThis seems to be a Purchase ticket related to IT hardware like monitors and keyboards. The likely categories here are \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware\". Since it focuses heavily on the purchase request process and includes urgent actions and approvals, \"Purchase\" is the best fit. It also touches on hardware items, but choosing one category is key. I need to respond with a JSON object that clearly specifies the category in the required format. Let's get that done!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
