It might fit under \"Storage\" for the documents or \"Administrative rights\" for access issues. The user's request is focused on managing migration and asking for app assistance. I'll carefully consider the best category to match their needs.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI'm noticing this is a bit messy, but I need to categorize the IT ticket correctly. The ticket involves \"site collection migration,\" which leans toward \"Internal Project.\" However, \"Storage\" fits too, since it involves archiving and transferring documents and libraries. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" don't really apply here. Since the instruction is to categorize the ticket based on its content, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit to reflect this migration effort.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
