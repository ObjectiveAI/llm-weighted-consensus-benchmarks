They're mentioning something related to an \"access card\" and \"return from maternity leave.\"  \n\nLooking at the categories available, it seems like \"Access\" is a strong candidate, but there's also \"HR Support\" since it's about maternity leave. I\u2019m trying to decide which category fits best; it\u2019s likely a mix of both, considering the context.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s message mentions \"return maternity leave\" and suggests they want to enable an access card for their return. This would relate to IT access management. The best fit seems to be the \"Access\" category, as it directly pertains to access cards. Although \"HR Support\" could apply, the request is really about IT enabling that access. I should respond with a JSON object specifying the category as \"Access.\" So I'll format it like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Responding with category**\n\nI see that I can optionally include a brief note, but it seems the main requirement is just to provide the category itself. The required format is straightforward: I just need to output the \"category\" field. I'll make sure to format my response correctly. The available categories are: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. I'll go ahead and choose \"Access,\" and respond concisely with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
