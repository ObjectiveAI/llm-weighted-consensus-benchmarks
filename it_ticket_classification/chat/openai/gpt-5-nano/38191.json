It seems \"Storage\" is the best fit because it covers backup storage and data recovery points. Other options like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" don\u2019t really apply here. The task area indicates a focus on security or admin work, but clarity leads back to \"Storage.\" \n\nI\u2019ll output a JSON object with the category value, ensuring it matches exactly as \"Storage\" with a capital \"S.\"**Preparing the output format**\n\nI need to focus on the final format for the category output. The instruction indicates that we should present a JSON object containing the \"category\" property value. It seems I should provide just the category string, but since the schema requires JSON, I'll go with that approach. \n\nSo, the clear output will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. Now, let\u2019s get that delivered!"
