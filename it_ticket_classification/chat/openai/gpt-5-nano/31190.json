The user's note is quite messy but seems to focus on the installation of a new system, networking, and related tasks. It could fit under \"Hardware\" or \"Internal Project,\" but \"Administrative rights\" doesn't apply here. Since networking is mentioned, I'll focus on these core categories to classify it appropriately.**Determining the correct category**\n\nI'm deciding on the right category for this IT ticket. It could be \"Internal Project\" because it involves installing a new system, but that might apply to bigger projects. \"Hardware\" seems more fitting since the user mentions terms like \"new system,\" \"unit,\" and \"installation.\" There\u2019s a hint of networking too, but \"Access\" may not fit well here. If I have to, I could also consider \"Miscellaneous.\" Ultimately, I need to create a JSON object with the chosen category.**Parsing the user's note**\n\nLet\u2019s break down this jumbled message. It mentions a \"new system on the floor,\" indicating some hardware involvement. There\u2019s installation discussion, unit configuration, and guest network configuration too. It touches on logistics for the installation and refers to a \"VC unit,\" likely indicating a video conferencing hardware piece. The request for installation assistance and a \"face-to-face discussion\" suggests it\u2019s all about a project focused on hardware installation and network configuration related to this VC unit.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI'm trying to decide between \u201cHardware\u201d or \u201cInternal Project\u201d for this ticket. While there's mention of implementing a new system across floors, it doesn\u2019t seem like a project management item. I\u2019m cautious to avoid mis-categorization here. The categories provided don't list \"Networking\" separately, which might complicate things. Since this is primarily about devices and installation, I think \u201cHardware\u201d is the best fit. I'll output a JSON object with the chosen category string as specified.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
