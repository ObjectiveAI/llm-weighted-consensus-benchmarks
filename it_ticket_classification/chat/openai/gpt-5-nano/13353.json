I'll carefully match the input to the relevant category to ensure accurate classification! It\u2019s important to get this right to help streamline the support process and make it easier for everyone involved.**Analyzing messy text**\n\nI've got a long and messy piece of text that includes terms like \"password reset,\" \"expire days,\" \"attachments,\" \"unable to follow steps,\" and \"change.\" It feels jumbled and somewhat confusing. I need to distill this down to the main points and figure out what action I might need to recommend. The mention of expiration and attachments suggests there might be urgency or security concerns. My goal is to clarify the content for better understanding and response!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThere are several phrases in the text that point toward categorizing this ticket. It mentions \"password reset,\" which indicates access issues, so the \"Access\" category fits well. The text also contains terms like \"confidential,\" \"intended addressee,\" and \"privileged,\" hinting at potential security concerns. While a \"Security/Confidential\" category would be ideal, it doesn\u2019t exist in the current options. I could choose \"Access,\" but I\u2019ll keep in mind the possible implications of the other phrases!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket clearly mentions \"password reset\" and \"expire days,\" which suggests it\u2019s about resetting a password. The mention of \"change PC\" could imply administrative rights or access issues. Given that it revolves around password reset tasks, I think \"Access\" fits best. There are also notes about confidential attachments and data privacy, focusing on the main task: the password reset. So, I'll categorize the ticket as \"Access\" and respond in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
