The ticket mentions connectivity problems and server stability but lacks an explicit \"Network\" category. It might best fit under \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The ticket focuses on network instability, validation, and fixes, but I can't pinpoint an exact category like \"Infrastructure.\" I'll choose the category that aligns most closely with the core issue \u2013 stability and access.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nThe potential category for the ticket might be \"Infrastructure,\" but it's not listed. The options are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context of network access issues, \"Access\" seems to fit best, especially since it mentions mobile connectivity. While \"Hardware\" could apply to servers, the focus is on network stability. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and respond in the required JSON format.  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nThe prompt clearly specifies that I'm supposed to output a JSON object with a specific category. Given the category needs to be \"Access,\" I\u2019ll make sure the casing is correct, using capital \"A\" as specified in the enum. It's straightforward, and I just need to confirm that my output aligns perfectly with the requirements. So, here it goes.  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
