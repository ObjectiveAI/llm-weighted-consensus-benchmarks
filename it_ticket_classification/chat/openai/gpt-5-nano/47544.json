Since the user is asking for an engineer to visit and resolve the hardware issue, I believe it fits under the \"Hardware\" category. I\u2019ll likely format my response in a JSON-style structure for clarity.**Determining JSON output**\n\nI need to make sure I format my final answer correctly as a JSON object. The key instruction is to provide the category for an IT ticket. Based on the user's request regarding a system console issue in a conference room, it fits firmly under \"Hardware.\" So, my final output should be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll also double-check that I'm not adding any extraneous text, just sticking to the requirements for a clear response."
