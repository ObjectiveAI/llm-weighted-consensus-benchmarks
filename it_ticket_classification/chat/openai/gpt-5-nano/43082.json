The key phrases here include \"change mobile number,\" \"active directory,\" and \"amend correct number.\" This seems to involve updating contact details. The possible categories could be \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or perhaps \"HR Support\" depending on the context, but I\u2019m leaning toward \"Access\" since it specifically relates to updating information in the directory.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m determining the category for the IT ticket, which is probably \u201cAccess.\u201d The mention of Active Directory suggests it relates to access control, and the request to \"change mobile number\" leans toward this category rather than \"Administrative rights.\" Although admin rights might technically apply, it's more about the contact details than permissions. Since the instructions require a JSON format, I\u2019ll output the category clearly as this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That seems to match the content perfectly!**Delivering category**\n\nThe user wants to change a mobile number in Active Directory, so the \u201cAccess\u201d category fits well. It makes sense since it's about managing access to user information. Now, I'll make sure to deliver this clearly. It seems straightforward: I just need to confirm that the category aligns with what they need. Alright, let\u2019s go ahead and provide that as required. This is a clear case for the \u201cAccess\u201d category."
