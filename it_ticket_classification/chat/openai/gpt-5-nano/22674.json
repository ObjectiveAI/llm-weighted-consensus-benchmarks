Given the context, it seems to fit best under \"Access\" since it's likely requesting access permissions or rights related to PC management. Although the text is unclear, that's my best guess for which category to select.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s request, \"please make her owner codes,\" likely means granting administrative rights related to PC codes. The mention of \"owner\" suggests it pertains to access permissions. Given the context of the text, it seems appropriate to categorize it as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" as the focus is on changing project ownership or permissions linked to \"PC PAS codes.\" I'm leaning toward \"Access\" since it reflects the nature of the request clearly.{\"category\":\"administrative rights\"}"
