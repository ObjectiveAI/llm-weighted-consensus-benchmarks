The ticket describes issues like connection failures and a certificate replacement, which feels confusing. Based on the content, it could fit into \"Access\" since it deals with connectivity problems and logs. \"Administrative rights\" doesn't seem quite right, and categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Purchase\" don't apply either. So, \"Access\" seems best!**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI\u2019m choosing to categorize this IT ticket as \"Access\" because it focuses on connecting to a system and mentions certificate issues. \"Administrative rights\" wouldn\u2019t fit here unless it was about VPN logins, which it doesn\u2019t seem to be. The reference to a \"certificate replaced\" suggests SSL/TLS issues, possibly in a remote access context. I'll format the output as a JSON object strictly as required: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra notes, just the category in the right format!"
