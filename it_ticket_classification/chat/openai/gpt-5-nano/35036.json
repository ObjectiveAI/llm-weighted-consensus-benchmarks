I think categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" might be the safest choice.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about the request for categorizing the IT ticket. It mentions database corruption, which could relate to \"Storage\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" But without a clear mention of hardware storage and since it seems data-focused, I might lean towards \"Miscellaneous.\" I think this is the safest option because the ticket isn\u2019t clearly fitting into the other categories. Finally, I\u2019ll output the category in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
