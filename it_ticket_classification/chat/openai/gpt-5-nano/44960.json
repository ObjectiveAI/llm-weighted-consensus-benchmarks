The message mentions issues with accessing documents stored in a library and receiving an error. It seems that \"Access\" fits best since it's primarily about getting into the documents, but it could potentially also relate to \"Storage\" since those documents are stored in a library. However, I'll go with \"Access\" for accuracy. I'm considering outputting this in JSON format for clarity.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI need to format my response as a JSON object for the category of the IT ticket. Based on the user's request and the content, I\u2019m setting the \"category\" field to \"Access.\" The format I\u2019ll follow is a strict JSON schema, so my response will look like this: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I realize the instruction says to keep it simple and provide just the JSON output without extra text. Let\u2019s finalize that!**Confirming incident content**\n\nI need to double-check the content of the user's message. It discusses an incident involving difficulties accessing documentation and encountering an error when trying to open certain documents. This clearly points to a classification of \"Access,\" as it revolves around the issue of accessing those documents. So, it's important to categorize it accurately to reflect the user's needs. Alright, \"Access\" it is!"
