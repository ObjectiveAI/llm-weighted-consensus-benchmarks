Could this relate to an \"Internal Project\" or maybe fall under \"Miscellaneous\"? If it\u2019s about needing access, there's a chance it could go under \"Access.\" Given the uncertainty, I might need to suggest a couple of categories here.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe instruction says to categorize the IT ticket in a specific format. The provided categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The user's input about \"add into map\" is quite ambiguous and could refer to many things. It might fit under \"Miscellaneous\" for unclear cases, or possibly \"Access\" if they need account access related to mapping. I think the safest choice is to go with \"Miscellaneous\" in the JSON format as instructed.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I should respond with a JSON object containing just the category. So, I\u2019m thinking of structuring it exactly like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. There shouldn't be any extra text or details in the response \u2014 simply the valid JSON format with the \"category\" key and the value as \"Miscellaneous.\" I've got it straightened out now, so I\u2019m ready to provide the concise output as instructed!"
