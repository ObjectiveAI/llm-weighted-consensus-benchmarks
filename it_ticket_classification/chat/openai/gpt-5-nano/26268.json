I'm leaning towards categorizing this as \"Access\" or possibly \"Administrative rights,\" depending on the context of the request.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's mention of \"access request\" and \"write view ribbon\" suggests they might want permission related to the Office Ribbon feature. I\u2019m considering whether this falls under \"Access\" since it\u2019s indeed an access request. However, there's also the \"Administrative rights\" category for privileged access. The term \"write view ribbon\" could imply needing both write and view capabilities. Based on this analysis, it seems wise to categorize it as \"Access\" for clarity and accuracy before outputting the JSON format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
