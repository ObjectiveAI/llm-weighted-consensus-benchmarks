Based on the content, it seems like there could be a request for modification or deletion, possibly involving \"Administrative rights.\" The mention of \"lead\" makes it tricky but could hint at some internal project. I\u2019d suggest choosing either \"Administrative rights,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Internal Project\" for categorization.**Evaluating IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the user's request, which includes terms like \"december pm\" and \"thursday,\" possibly indicating a schedule. The phrase \"hi please delete\" suggests they want something deleted. I\u2019m considering whether it best fits \"Administrative rights,\" but that usually pertains to gaining or modifying privileges. \"Access\" could work for deletion of access rights, though the ticket isn't clearly asking for that. Given its garbled nature, I think \"Miscellaneous\" might be the safest choice, but the repeated mention of \"modification\" could link to \"Storage\" or \"Internal Project\" as well. I'll stick with \"Miscellaneous\" for now.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
