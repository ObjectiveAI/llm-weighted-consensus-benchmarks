Although it mentions \"recently purchased mounts,\" the main focus here is on the installation. So, keeping it simple, I can return the JSON as {\"category\": \"Hardware\"} while ensuring it matches the specified format. The goal here is to categorize it correctly as \"Hardware.\"**Formatting the response**\n\nI see the user needs the typical \"category\" value, and it makes sense to provide a JSON object. The earlier prompt mentioned a specific response format, which includes a \"category\" field. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and output it as {\"category\": \"Hardware\"} without the extra \"type\" wrapper. This aligns with the expected structure based on the schema they provided, ensuring clarity and compliance with their request. I think I\u2019m ready to respond!"
