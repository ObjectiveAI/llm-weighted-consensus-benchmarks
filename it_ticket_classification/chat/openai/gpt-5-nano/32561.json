The user's ticket includes a block of text that seems a bit chaotic, mentioning social pictures, issues entering folders, and storage locations. It could potentially fall under \"Internal Project,\" \"Storage,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Overall, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Internal Project\" since it relates to organizing and selecting social photos.**Categorizing Photo Asset Ticket**\n\nThis ticket appears to be about organizing photo assets for a kickoff event. The tasks involve selecting pictures, organizing them into folders, and addressing access or permission issues related to a storage location. It could fit within several categories: Access, Storage, or Internal Project. If it's particularly about gaining access to a shared folder, then \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights\" would fit. However, I think the best choice is \"Access\" since it focuses on the permission aspect.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nIn IT ticket systems, the \"Storage\" category usually deals with file storage and upload issues, while \"Access\" covers permissions for folders. The mention of \"issues entering folder\" clearly points to an access problem. Although there are tasks about \"kick off selection,\" those are more about content management, not strictly IT-related. Since the ticket involves setting up and organizing the folder, I feel \"Access\" is the best choice. I'll output it as a JSON object in the required format.**Outputting JSON for IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe instructions clearly state to categorize the IT ticket using a JSON object. I understand that the expected output should just be the category value in the schema format. For this ticket, I\u2019ll choose \"Access\" as the category. Therefore, the correct response will simply be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI'll make sure to keep it concise and straightforward, without any extra commentary since JSON is plain text."
