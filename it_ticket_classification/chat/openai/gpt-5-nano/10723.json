It seems like \"Storage\" fits best, but it\u2019s a bit unclear.**Categorizing IT Request**\n\nIn the IT context, the phrase \"additional space\" likely refers to \"storage space\" on a server or disk. The mention of \"more events\" might point to calendar events. The note about \"annual leave notice until specialist\" suggests the user will be unavailable until a specialist can assist. Given the urgency with \"additional importance high,\" it seems clear this is an IT request for extra storage space, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Storage.\" I'll respond with:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}**Outputting Category Format**\n\nIt looks like the user wants me to output only the category in a specific format, which is a JSON object. According to the instructions, it should just be a category string. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward with:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}  \n\nThis way, it\u2019s clear and not overly verbose, focusing directly on what\u2019s needed! I'll deliver this minimal response now."
