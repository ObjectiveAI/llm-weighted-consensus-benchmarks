It talks about \"access to reports,\" \"enable reports section,\" and \"extract details.\" This suggests they need help with report access, likely fitting into either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Both categories seem relevant. Typically, \"Administrative rights\" involves elevated privileges, while \"Access\" is more about general access requests. It's crucial to choose correctly based on the request.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nBased on the user's request to \"enable reports section,\" it seems like they're looking to enable a feature, which indicates an \"Access\" ticket. They also mention \"extract details reports,\" suggesting this is still about accessing data. So, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Access.\" I need to respond with the correct JSON format, ensuring I use proper capitalization for \"Access.\" The final output will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nI\u2019ll make sure it follows the system's instructions precisely."
