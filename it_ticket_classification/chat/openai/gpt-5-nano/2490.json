The ticket discusses probation period reminders, joining date, and review periods, which seem to fall under HR matters. However, \"HR Support\" isn't an available category. The closest options I see are \"Administrative rights,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or maybe \"Internal Project.\" Since it's primarily HR-related, perhaps \"Administrative rights\" works best as it relates to access to relevant forms, even though it\u2019s not a perfect fit.**Formulating JSON Output**\n\nI'm working on outputting the IT ticket's category in JSON format. The user wants me to categorize it as \"HR Support,\" which is actually in the list of allowed categories. I just double-checked, and \"HR Support\" is there, along with others like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\nThe final output needs to be a clean JSON object: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI'll make sure it's formatted correctly, without extra spaces or text."
