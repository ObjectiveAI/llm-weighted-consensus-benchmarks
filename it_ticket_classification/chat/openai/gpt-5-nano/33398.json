Terms like \"leaver,\" \"period code,\" and \"public holiday leave\" suggest it relates to HR matters, possibly for offboarding. Since there's also mention of a \"software developer,\" I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing this under \"HR Support.\" It fits well with the context of leave and user offboarding, so I\u2019ll aim to return a JSON object with that category.**Preparing the JSON output**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the required output format, which specifies a JSON schema with a \"category\" field. I need to ensure that my response includes just that aspect, so I will output:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI\u2019ll check that it's in lowercase, reflecting the schema where \"HR Support\" is correctly formatted with space and capitalization. I'll make sure there's no extra text, sticking strictly to the request. So my clean response will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nTime to deliver that!"
