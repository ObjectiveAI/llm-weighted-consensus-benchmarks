It mentions a \"rack fan cooling unit,\" which suggests it's related to hardware. The phrase \"log two tickets installed\" implies that tickets were created for installation, further supporting the \"Hardware\" category. There's also a mention of a purchase request, so \"Purchase\" could be relevant too. I'll focus on these two strong categories for the ticket.**Categorizing Installation Tickets**\n\nIt looks like the user is requesting to log two tickets, possibly for the installation of rack fan cooling units. I need to choose between categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since there\u2019s a mention of installation, the \"Hardware\" category seems most fitting. Despite indications of a purchase, the context is primarily about logging installation. I'll respond with a JSON-like object, specifically: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any extra text.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
