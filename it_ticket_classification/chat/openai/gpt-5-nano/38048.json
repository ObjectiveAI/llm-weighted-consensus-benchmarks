It's unclear, but it sounds like an alert regarding a door issue. Considering it's related to a door, which is physical, I think \"Hardware\" might be the best category. I'll go with that since it fits the context of a physical item needing attention.**Evaluating IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether \"Hardware\" fits best for this IT ticket since it involves a door being left open. However, it also relates to an event notification system, which suggests software. \"Access\" could apply if it's about door access control, but that's unlikely here. Looking at the context, it\u2019s safer to categorize this as \"Hardware\" since it\u2019s a physical door sensor event. The specifics about \"event notification data\" lead me to believe \"Hardware\" is still the best choice.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
