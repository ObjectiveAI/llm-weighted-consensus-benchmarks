The content includes a request to modify a rule that prevents the logging of requests with certain words. Looking at the category options, \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could fit, but it doesn\u2019t seem to belong to hardware, storage, access, purchase, or HR categories. So, I think \"Internal Project\" might be the best choice here.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nWhen classifying the IT ticket, I see that it's about changing a logging rule to allow certain words. \"Administrative rights\" is generally for granting permissions, but that's not what this ticket is asking for. This seems more like a configuration or policy change, which could fit either \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" If it's tied to a specific project, I think \"Internal Project\" might be the best choice. Otherwise, \"Miscellaneous\" could work as a catch-all for general IT requests.**Categorizing User Request**\n\nThe user is asking to change a rule that blocks logging requests containing the words \"summary\" or \"description.\" This is definitely a policy or rule change. While \"Administrative rights\" doesn't apply here, \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best since it's about modifying an internal system configuration. I could consider \"Miscellaneous\" for non-classifiable requests, but in this case, \"Internal Project\" is more precise. I'll deliver my response in the required JSON format. \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
