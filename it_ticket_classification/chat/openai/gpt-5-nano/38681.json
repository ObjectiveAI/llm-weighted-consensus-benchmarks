Considering the content, it fits best under the \"Storage\" category since it focuses on disk space. While \"Administrative rights\" could be a consideration, it seems the main issue is about storage. I'll respond with a JSON object that includes \"Storage\" as the category.**Finalizing JSON Output**\n\nI need to create the response as a JSON object that specifically states the category. So, I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. Since the instructions clearly ask for a category object, I want to make sure that's exactly what I provide. I also considered including more analysis, but it seems unnecessary since the instruction is straightforward. I'll stick to the requirement and just provide the specified output. Let's go ahead and answer!"
