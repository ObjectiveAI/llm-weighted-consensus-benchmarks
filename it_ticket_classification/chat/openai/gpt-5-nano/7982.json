The correct format is simply: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, as the user specifically requested that. I\u2019m ready to send this out!**Deciding category explanation**\n\nI'm considering whether I need to include an explanation for the category. The instructions indicate that providing just the category is sufficient; an explanation isn't required. While \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option if I were unsure, the phrase \"network switched room rack\" strongly suggests it's related to hardware. \n\nSo I\u2019ll focus on delivering the right category without any extra text. I'll provide just the JSON object with the category. Here goes!"
