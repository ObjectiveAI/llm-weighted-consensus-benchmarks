It mentions \"map upload,\" \"attached floor map,\" and \"infrastructure,\" which could fit into categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Storage,\" or even \"Access,\" depending on the intent. The message feels unclear, almost like a noisy auto-translation. I'll analyze those keywords carefully to determine the best category for the ticket. It's a bit tricky!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis ticket likely fits into \"Internal Project\" or \"Storage\" since it involves uploading maps, but \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if permissions are needed. Given the context, \"Internal Project\" seems most appropriate because it clearly pertains to mapping and floor plans. However, if it\u2019s about uploading to shared storage, \"Storage\" might work too. The user's message is quite jumbled, so if unsure, \"Miscellaneous\" is also an option. It\u2019s a bit of a puzzle!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nSince the user's request to categorize the IT ticket is a bit ambiguous, I need to make my best guess. The category structure calls for a JSON object, specifically with a \"category\" field. I think \"Internal Project\" fits best given the context of uploading floor maps. However, there's a chance it could be \"Access\" due to potential upload rights. While \"Administrative rights\" is an option, it may not apply here. My final response will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Parsing IT ticket request**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the user's message about uploading a map, which has various components. The phrase \"map upload\" clearly indicates an action, and \"unto eel wednesday\" might refer to a subsystem, with \"Wednesday\" mentioned twice. There\u2019s an attachment noted as well. They also request to upload maps for other locations. Although the last part of the message is less meaningful, it seems like a request related to an internal project. Based on this, \"Internal Project\" appears to be the best category to assign.**Delivering category response**\n\nSince the instructions specify that we can only provide one category, I'll go with \"Internal Project.\" The response needs to be in JSON format, containing just the category object. I won\u2019t include any extra text, just the required snippet. It should look like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nOkay, that\u2019s clear! I'll make sure to deliver this precisely as needed."
