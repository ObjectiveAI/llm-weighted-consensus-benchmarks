This could fit under \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project\" categories due to the network routing changes being requested. It's definitely not about hardware, HR, storage, or purchases.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket seems to fit under \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Requests listed in the ticket include \"add route to site,\" which is a network admin task that may need admin rights. The content itself\u2014repeating \"site\" and mentioning \"pf\"\u2014could reference pfSense or possibly something else. Time notation like \"friday pm\" could indicate when the task should happen. Since this is a direct request for changes, \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" seems most appropriate.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI see that the request to \"add route\" likely involves administrative changes and could fall under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project.\" Since I need to output JSON with the appropriate category, I\u2019ll pick the best fit. The ticket seems ambiguous; \"Internal Project\" often relates to long-term efforts, while \"Administrative rights\" typically involves requests for elevated privileges. However, the instruction here is solely to add a route, so I lean toward \"Internal Project\" for network administration.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering categorizing the ticket as \"Miscellaneous\" since it doesn\u2019t clearly fit into hardware, HR, or access. Although \"Access\" might be relevant if the route implies network access, it\u2019s not a request for personal access; it's about a network route. Given the ambiguity of the request, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the safest default choice for uncertain tickets. I\u2019ll format the JSON object to reflect this category. So the final output will be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
