It's a bit chaotic, mentioning things like devices received and the need for an extension cord. I think the best category fits in is \"Hardware\" since an extension cord is hardware equipment. Although \"Purchase\" could apply if it's more about acquiring items, \"Hardware\" seems most suitable. I'll respond with the appropriate JSON format, like: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Sounds good!**Providing Justification for Categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering if I should include a brief justification since the user asked me to categorize an IT ticket. While they provided the text, the expected output seems to just require the category. I think keeping it concise is key, so I\u2019ll simply produce: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I want to ensure I don't add any extra text or information that isn\u2019t necessary. Keeping it straightforward should meet the user\u2019s needs!"
