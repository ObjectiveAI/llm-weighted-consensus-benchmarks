The user talks about a new starter returning to work after an unpaid leave, mentioning an attached form and an administration officer. This could fit several categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\nI think the best category here looks like \"HR Support\" considering it's about returning to work after leave. So, I\u2019ll prepare the JSON output accordingly.  \n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions a \"new starter\" returning from unpaid leave and involves an \"administration officer,\" which suggests it's related to HR onboarding or offboarding. The terms like \"fill attached form\" and \"return to work\" indicate HR tasks. Although \"Administrative rights\" might seem relevant for granting system access, the user doesn't specify needing access credentials. Given the context, I believe \"HR Support\" is the best fit. So, I\u2019ll prepare the JSON output as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Finalizing output**\n\nI want to keep my response concise and straightforward. The required output is simply a JSON object indicating the category, which will be {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll make sure that the formatting meets the system's requirements, as it expects this specific structure. So I\u2019ll deliver it promptly as requested!"
