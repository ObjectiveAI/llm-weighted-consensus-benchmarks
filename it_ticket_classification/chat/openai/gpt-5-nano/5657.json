It might refer to a new starter and something about \"Thank Tuesday,\" which could be an event or practice. I think this falls under HR Support since it relates to onboarding and possibly scheduling for a new hire. I'll output this as a JSON with the HR Support category.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI think this ticket might involve \"Administrative rights\" if it's about access, but it doesn't explicitly mention that. The phrase \"new starter\" typically relates to HR onboarding. The categories list includes \"HR Support,\" which seems fitting here. The \"hello please fill date\" part hints at scheduling, but there's no clear IT task beyond onboarding. Therefore, HR Support is likely the best choice. I'll format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} according to the schema provided."
