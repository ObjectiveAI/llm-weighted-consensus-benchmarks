The user asked me to categorize the ticket, which mentions \"old library,\" \"archive too big,\" \"site permissions,\" and \"backup available.\" Even though it touches on multiple categories, I need to pick the most appropriate one. Given that the phrases \"archive too big\" and \"backup available\" strongly suggest issues related to storage, I'm leaning toward categorizing it as \"Storage.\"**Classifying an IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants to categorize an IT ticket that mentions recovering an old library and has several relevant aspects. It talks about an \"archive too big,\" \"site permissions,\" and \"backup availability.\" While it could fit in \"Internal Project\" or \"Access,\" I'm leaning towards \"Storage\" as the best single category. The phrases indicating issues like \"archive too big\" and \"backup\" clearly point toward storage concerns. So, I'll categorize it under \"Storage\" since it encompasses those key issues.**Finalizing category choice**\n\nI'm settling on \"Storage\" for this IT ticket categorization. While \"Internal Project\" could fit because it's about recovering an old library, that's more focused on ongoing tasks. The emphasis here is on \"recovering an old library,\" which relates to storage issues. Since the user asked for a specific category, I\u2019ll provide that in a plain JSON format without any extra commentary. So, my response will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}."
