The categories include options like \"Internal Project,\" \"Hardware,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It seems pretty clear that the request is centered around the installation of meeting rooms, which leans towards \"Internal Project\" or \"Hardware.\" I should assess if there's a request for administrative rights, but it feels more focused on the installation itself. Let's choose the best fit!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe request is centered around \"install meeting rooms,\" and it mentions multiple locations, which suggests the user wants separate tickets for each installation. Since the focus is on installing equipment for meeting rooms, the best category seems to be \"Hardware.\" While \"Internal Project\" could be relevant if it's for an internal initiative, it doesn't strongly apply here. \"Purchase,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" and \"Storage\" don't fit either. So, I\u2019ll categorize it straightforwardly as \"Hardware\" and prepare the response in the right format.**Formatting category response**\n\nI'm noticing that the format for the category object requires specific structuring according to the system's guidelines, which state it should be in JSON format. The instruction is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket appropriately. Considering the previous discussions, it\u2019s evident that the best category is \"Hardware.\" I'll respond simply with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, ensuring there\u2019s no extra text or code blocks added. I want to keep it straightforward and compliant with the requirements!"
