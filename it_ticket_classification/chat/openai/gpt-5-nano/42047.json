It could also relate to access if they're facing permissions issues, especially with the mention of \"validation unavailable\" and \"printing screen.\" Let's figure this out!**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned issues about submitting timecards, specifically saying \"cannot submit timecard\" and referencing last week. This clearly indicates a timekeeping issue, which doesn't relate to hardware or storage. The best category here appears to be \"HR Support\" since it involves payroll and human resources processes. While \"Administrative rights\" could involve permission adjustments, it's not relevant here. So, I\u2019ll create a JSON object with the category as \"HR Support\" following the specified format.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
