                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the user's description. They mentioned a \"calendar app,\" extracting documents, and available events, which suggests it could belong to categories like \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access.\" However, I'm unsure since there's no clear indication of hardware or storage issues involved. The mention of \"report based category name\" adds some ambiguity. Overall, I'll have to decide carefully which category best fits this ticket.**Identifying ticket categories**\n\nThis ticket might relate to an internal calendar app feature. It mentions extracting document calendars and selecting content, which could suggest it's an \"Internal Project\" if it's about feature development. However, the categories are quite limited. \"Administrative rights\" is for admin privileges, but there's no explicit permission issue. It might fit as \"Access\" since it deals with the calendar app, but that\u2019s unclear. Given the ambiguity, \"Miscellaneous\" feels like a reasonable catch-all category for this ticket.**Choosing the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering classifying this ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it relates to the calendar app and mentions generating reports by category name. The user seems to want to extract calendar data, which might imply \"Administrative rights,\" but it doesn't seem about permissions. Many ambiguous requests end up categorized as \"Miscellaneous.\" I think that\u2019s fitting here. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous\" and justify it by noting that the ticket revolves around calendar features without clear issues related to hardware or access rights.**Formatting the output**\n\nI need to output the result in JSON format, specifically with a category field. The schema provided specifies it as an object type with the \"category\" property set to one of the predefined options. Since I've determined the category to be \"Miscellaneous,\" I should create the JSON object accordingly. I'll ensure I only include the necessary JSON output and avoid any extra text. So, my final answer will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
