They're asking about adding someone to a shared mailbox on a specific date, which seems to fit under \"Access,\" as it's related to mailbox permissions. I should output this as a JSON object with the correct schema, ensuring it matches the required format. So, my response will simply include \"Access\" as the category within the JSON object.**Categorizing IT ticket request**\n\nI need to determine the right category for the user's request to \"add to com shared mailbox\" and \"add member.\" This is about access rights, which leads me to consider \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the nature of the request, it seems fitting to categorize it as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll prepare my response as a JSON object with \"Access\" as the value. Any extra details about dates or holidays can be considered unnecessary for this task. So, I\u2019ll format it like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Finalizing the decision**\n\nThe request is clearly centered on adding a member to a shared mailbox. This process specifically relates to granting access rights. So, I\u2019m ready to finalize my categorization as \"Access.\" It seems straightforward, but I want to be sure that I\u2019m being precise in my classification. I\u2019ll prepare the JSON object accordingly and ensure everything is neat and clear. Let's get this done!"
