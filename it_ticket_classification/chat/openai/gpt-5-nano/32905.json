The \"ext mob\" part could mean extending something to mobile or even a mobile extension? Additionally, it might connect to administrative rights, but I\u2019m still unsure. I\u2019ll need to think more about how to categorize this.**Clarifying IT Ticket Categories**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about what \"ext mob\" could mean \u2014 maybe \"extension mobile\"? Or it might mean \"extremely mobile?\" We need to categorize this IT ticket effectively! The categories available are Access, Administrative rights, Miscellaneous, Internal Project, and a few others which don\u2019t seem relevant. If it\u2019s about adding something in July, it could relate to an Internal Project. However, I\u2019m uncertain if it implies mobile access. It might be best to ask the user for clarification on their request!**Requesting Clarification on Ticket Category**\n\nI think it\u2019s best to request clarification since the user's request is a bit ambiguous. We could categorize it as \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The phrase \"add into Thursday July\" seems related to calendar scheduling, while \"ext mob\" might mean \"extension mobile,\" potentially referring to external phone access. However, there\u2019s no clear mention of access or permissions. Given the uncertainty, I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing this ticket as \"Miscellaneous.\"**Preparing the IT Ticket Output**\n\nI think I need to clarify the user's exact request about adding something for Thursday in July, particularly what and who it's for. Since I have to output this as JSON, I\u2019ll use the format provided: `{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}`. The spec indicates that the response should only include the category, but I\u2019m wondering if I should add a brief note justifying this choice. Still, since the instructions specify to present the category alone, I\u2019ll stick with just that.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
