Given that, I\u2019ll classify it as an \"Access\" ticket, since it's primarily about that access card. We could also consider \"Administrative rights,\" but it seems more likely that it's just for general access.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"new starter access card\" suggests this is about a physical access card for a new employee. I should consider if it may fall under \"Hardware,\" but it seems more aligned with an access request. The term really indicates a need for access, and the mention of an \"administration officer\" might imply they approve it. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" Now, I\u2019ll prepare a response in JSON format, specifying that the category is \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
