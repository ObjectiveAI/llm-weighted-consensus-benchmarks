It sounds like the issue is related to performance problems with their laptop, particularly when using Node for installations. Since the list of categories doesn't include \"Software,\" I'm considering \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Hardware.\" However, given the context, it seems best to classify it as \"Miscellaneous,\" since it isn't strictly hardware-related.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket based on the provided options. \"Miscellaneous\" could work for general IT issues, while \"Internal Project\" might apply if it's a project ticket. Other categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Purchase\" don\u2019t fit. Given the mention of CPU usage, I think the best option is \"Miscellaneous,\" reflecting a software performance issue. Now, I'll format my response as a JSON object with the \"category\" field.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
