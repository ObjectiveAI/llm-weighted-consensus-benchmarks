It might be \"HR Support\" since it relates to HR processes like candidate selection, but \"Access\" also seems appropriate if there's an issue with tool access. The ticket mentions being \"unable to view candidate selection\" and the tool being \"blocked for more than minutes,\" so it might lean towards an access problem. However, the user is asking for guidance to obtain a report, suggesting it could be more about HR support.**Categorizing recruitment issues**\n\nI\u2019m debating the right category for this recruitment tool issue. While \"HR Support\" could apply since it involves an HR system, \"Access\" also seems relevant because the user can't view the candidate selection process and is blocked from doing so. Their request for \"how to obtain a report\" feels more like a feature inquiry. Still, since it's fundamentally about access to a module, \"Access\" is the better fit, but \"HR Support\" could also be valid if the system leans heavily towards recruitment processes.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm tasked with categorizing this IT ticket, and since the user is seeking IT help, it's clear it\u2019s not about hardware. I think \"Access\" is the right choice here because it indicates an access issue. The system instruction specifies I need to output this in a JSON-like format with a category field. So, I\u2019ll prepare my answer as {\"category\": \"Access\"} based on the required schema. I\u2019ll make sure to stick strictly to that format for clarity!**Preparing the JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with just the JSON object, so I\u2019ll format it correctly. The output has to be concise and clear. It\u2019ll be simply {\"category\":\"Access\"} to reflect the category choice appropriately. I\u2019ll make sure there are no extra comments or text\u2014just a clean JSON structure. Alright, I\u2019m ready to finalize it!"
