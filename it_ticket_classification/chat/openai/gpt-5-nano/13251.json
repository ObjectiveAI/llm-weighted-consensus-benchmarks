It seems they might need administrative rights to change or update the contract. I'm categorizing this and ruling out options like HR, hardware, or storage. It looks like the \"Access\" category could fit if they need the ability to edit the submitted contract, or \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they need permissions to make changes.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI see that the user is asking me to categorize this IT ticket, and \"Administrative rights\" seems like a reasonable option for permissions to undo or change a submission. I need to provide a JSON object that fits the allowed categories. It looks like the response should be along the lines of `{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}`. The urgency in their request adds weight to this, as they\u2019ve mentioned they've accidentally submitted fully approved documents and want to act on it quickly.**Deciding on category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing that the phrase \"old broad street\" seems to reference a location but isn't relevant to the category choice. The user\u2019s request is likely about modifying a contract submission, which may need \"Administrative rights\" to undo or change it. While \"Access\" could apply for retrieving the contract, the categories are distinct. I think \"Administrative rights\" fits best as it typically allows reverting a submission in a workflow. So, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object to respond with this category.**Preparing final response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that categorizes this IT ticket. Based on the schema, the category is \"Administrative rights.\" Since the instruction is clear and straightforward, I\u2019ll just output the JSON object without any extra commentary. The response format seems flexible, but following the schema ensures clarity. So here\u2019s what I\u2019ll deliver: `{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}`. Let's finalize that!"
