While I briefly consider other categories like Hardware or Administrative rights, none fit as well as Purchase does. Since the ticket's main focus is on purchases and receipts, it\u2019s clear that \"Purchase\" is indeed the correct category.**Creating JSON response**\n\nI need to respond using a JSON-like object as per the instructions. The format requires a category property set to \"Purchase.\" It\u2019s essential to ensure that the JSON is valid, so I'll structure my response to simply include this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.\n\nWhile I think about whether to add a justification, the instructions specify that only the object content is needed. So I\u2019ll make sure to keep it minimal and just deliver that straightforward JSON response."
