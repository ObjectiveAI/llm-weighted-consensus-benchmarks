It seems to mention not being sent for approval and suggests a workflow issue. This could fit under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\". However, given the context of approval, \"Purchase\" might also apply, linking to a purchase order not being approved. The reference to \"Thursday December\" seems like a date, while the rest is a bit unclear. Let\u2019s choose the best category!**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering whether this IT ticket fits under \"Internal Project\" for something needing approval or \"Administrative rights\" for permissions issues. However, the phrase \"not sent for approval\" seems more connected to approval workflows, possibly linking to \"Purchase\". I feel \"Purchase\" is the right choice since approvals are common in procurement. If it's still unclear due to the garbled message, I could also suggest \"Miscellaneous\". Now, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object for the chosen category.**Formatting the Category Response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object to categorize the IT ticket, likely as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. The format requires this to be specified correctly, ensuring capitalization is consistent with the enum values. While \"Purchase\" seems best, I also wonder if \"Administrative rights\" could fit since it relates to approval processes and access rights. The message appears to be someone complaining about an approval workflow issue. It all leads me back to confidently categorizing it as \"Purchase\".**Deciding on the Category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to go with \"Purchase\" as the category for this IT ticket. It seems clear and straightforward, so there's no need for extra explanations unless the user asks. Since the request is just to categorize it, I'll respond with the JSON object containing that specific category. I\u2019m ready to deliver just the necessary information in the required format. Let\u2019s keep it simple and efficient!"
