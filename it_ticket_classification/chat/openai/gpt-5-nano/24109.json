The ticket is a bit messy, mentioning reports, parameters, graphs, and various technical aspects like disks and CPU. The task is to pick a category from Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights.\n\nIt seems like it could fit under \"Storage\" or \"Hardware,\" but since it focuses on reporting, it might be more appropriate as \"Internal Project\" due to its emphasis on generating reports.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nI have the available categories to consider: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the ticket focuses on creating reports and involves data extraction for an internal project, \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best. Although \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback, it's a bit vague. \n\nNow, according to the instructions, I need to respond with a JSON object containing the category. I\u2019ll format it as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. No additional text is needed\u2014just that JSON output.**Confirming the category selection**\n\nI'm confirming the best category for this ticket. It mentions \"reports,\" \"monitored parameters,\" \"December,\" and various technical terms like \"graphs\" and \"CPU.\" Since it\u2019s focused on monitoring and reporting, it doesn't touch on access or hardware actions. Therefore, \"Internal Project\" definitely fits best.\n\nI'll format the output as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} and ensure there\u2019s no extra whitespace. Time to finalize this response!"
