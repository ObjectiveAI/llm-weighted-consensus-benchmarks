The request is a bit unclear, but it seems they want to update their status with a new line manager, possibly changing their reporting structure. I\u2019m going to consider it a change request, likely relating to HR support since it involves a new manager and their working situation. So, I'll assign it under that category.**Interpreting IT ticket categories**\n\nIt seems the user is asking to change their manager in the system, likely requesting to update their status to a working project manager. This could fall under several categories like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"HR Support.\" If it's about modifying their reporting structure, it should probably be categorized under \"HR Support,\" as it relates to personnel changes. The ticket clearly implies an organizational change, so I\u2019m leaning toward that classification.**Clarifying ticket changes**\n\nThe user seems to be asking to change themselves to a \"working PM,\" which I interpret as \"project manager.\" The phrase \"new line manager\" suggests they\u2019re looking to update their reporting structure. It\u2019s a bit ambiguous, though, because \u201cworking PM\u201d might also imply a more permanent role. Given the context of a new manager and the update request, I think the best category here would be \"HR Support\" since it deals with personnel changes and reporting lines.**Finalizing category classification**\n\nIt seems I've concluded that this request is primarily about a management change, so I'll classify it as \"HR Support.\" Other categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" don\u2019t fit as well here. The prompt specifically asks for a JSON object with the category, so I'll format my answer accordingly. The response will be minimal, focusing solely on the JSON output. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll provide: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
