Here we go!**Categorizing leave issue**\n\nI need to classify a ticket about annual leave days not showing correctly in a system. The ticket mentions issues related to leave requests, and it could be an HR system problem. I'm considering whether it fits better under \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" However, since it specifically deals with leave days, \"HR Support\" seems like the most appropriate choice. It definitely relates to HR policies, so I'll go with that!**Preparing the JSON output**\n\nI need to respond to a request to categorize an IT ticket appropriately, focusing on HR support. The allowed category is clearly stated, and \"HR Support\" is the best match. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object, ensuring it fits the schema precisely without any extra text. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll output it like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Just double-checking that I have the correct quotes and formatting before delivering it. It's all about being precise!"
