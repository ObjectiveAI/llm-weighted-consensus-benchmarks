They mentioned things like \"access required,\" \"editing files,\" and \"daily job,\" which makes it seem focused on access rights. Since two categories fit\u2014\u201cAccess\u201d and \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d\u2014I think it leans more toward \"Access,\" as it sounds like they\u2019re requesting general access to files. But I wonder if \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant since it implies specific permissions.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nLooking at the content of the request, the user mentions needing access to edit files for their daily job and references administration. The phrase \"Administrative rights\" suggests elevated privileges. I think the best category is \"Access,\" as it fits the general nature of their request. However, since it could imply they need admin rights, I might note that in the ticket's details. For now, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and output it in the required format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
