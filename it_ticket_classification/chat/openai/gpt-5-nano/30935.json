The user mentions \"new project\" and seeks to establish board administrators. This context suggests it could fall under \"Internal Project,\" but there's also a chance it relates to \"Administrative rights\" due to the mention of board administrators. Given the project's focus, it makes sense to categorize it as an \"Internal Project.\"**Evaluating Ticket Categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket based on the mention of \"board administrators,\" which might suggest the need for access or administrative rights. The request to \"create corresponding board\" and \"board name\" indicates it's project-related, so \"Internal Project\" seems appropriate. However, since \"board administrators\" hints at permission changes, \"Administrative rights\" could also fit. Ultimately, I believe categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" makes the most sense since it's focused on setting up a new project board.**Categorizing IT Requests**\n\nIn IT ticket triage, creating a new project board typically falls under \"Internal Project,\" while granting admin rights would be categorized as \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" The mention of \"board administrators\" suggests they may want to set up users for that board. Given that the request primarily revolves around creating a board, \"Internal Project\" is likely the safest and most appropriate category. So, I'll go ahead and categorize it as an \"Internal Project.\"**Formatting IT Ticket Response**\n\nI need to respond to the request for categorizing the IT ticket in JSON format. The user asked, \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" so I should provide a JSON object with the category property. I\u2019ll set the category value to \"Internal Project,\" as that fits the context. According to the instructions, it\u2019s important to maintain the exact schema, but I\u2019ll focus on providing just the required object without unnecessary wrappers. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
