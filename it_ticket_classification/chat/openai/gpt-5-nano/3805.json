I find the mention of \"points map\" intriguing; it probably relates to the locations of these access points, which I need to understand better. It seems I should check the plans and links provided for clarity on where these installation points are located. There's a lot to unpack!**Analyzing access points map**\n\nIt seems like there are several references to an \"access points map\" in this text. I see mentions of plans and links, along with requests for help and clarification regarding the installation of access points. There are several thanks and communication about who's responsible for providing this information. I should pay attention to the details regarding layout and positioning since it looks like guidance on how to install and share these maps is part of the request. This definitely requires careful reading!**Categorizing project details**\n\nI think this is about an \"Internal Project\" since the focus is on infrastructure maps, planning, and uploading. It might also touch on \"Access\" in terms of network access points, but the main theme involves sharing and storing project-related information. There's a lot of conversation about existing plans and sharing links, so that leans towards project management rather than hardware support. Although \"Storage\" comes up, it doesn't quite fit. It feels like \"Internal Project\" is the best category here!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
