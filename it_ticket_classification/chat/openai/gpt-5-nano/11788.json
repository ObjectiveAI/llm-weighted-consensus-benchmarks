Given they might be asking to share or gain access to the app, it seems appropriate to classify this under \"Access.\" I should also consider \"Administrative rights\" if it\u2019s about permissions.{\"category\":\"Access\"}I'm considering whether \"Administrative rights\" might be more appropriate. The user\u2019s message suggests they might be asking for access to Fusion\u2019s expense app, which could imply needing permission. The word \"share\" could mean granting access or sharing the app, and \"let\" clearly indicates they're asking for permission. However, to be safe, I think \"Access\" is the best classification. I\u2019ll go with that for the final answer."
