The user\u2019s rough text mentions an \"oracle problem\" related to a software or database issue, specifically about entering code multiple times and encountering problems with saved entries. Given this context, it makes sense to categorize it under a software-related ticket. I'll ensure that the mapping accurately reflects the user's concerns.**Categorizing Software Issue**\n\nIt looks like the ticket involves a software issue with an Oracle database where entries aren't saved properly, and there are problems with duplicate codes and hours incrementing. I'm considering the best category for this based on the options available. \"Miscellaneous\" might be the most fitting since it covers a broad range. While \"Internal Project\" could be relevant for development issues, it seems off for this case. Ultimately, I'll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" and format the response in JSON with the appropriate schema.**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nThe user wants a JSON object to categorize the IT ticket, following the instruction to provide the category. The schema requires a clear format, which means I should present it like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I need to be sure to use \"Miscellaneous\" exactly as specified. The instruction mentions categorizing but doesn\u2019t call for additional notes or commentary, so I\u2019ll just deliver the JSON object without any extras. I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
