From what I'm reading, it seems related to returning hardware after maternity leave, along with hardware allocation details like monitors and peripherals. The user mentions a \"starter form\" that was submitted and attached terms for the requested hardware, but the message isn't entirely clear. I need to pull the relevant context to determine the best category from options like \"Hardware\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket seems to focus on hardware return and allocation. The categories available include \"Hardware\" and \"Administrative rights,\" among others. Since it discusses returning equipment after maternity leave, \"Hardware\" fits best. I considered \"HR Support\" due to maternity leave, but the core issue is about hardware and devices. Categories like \"Access,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Internal Project\" don\u2019t apply here. I\u2019ll definitely categorize it as \"Hardware\" and respond in a JSON format per the requirements.**Formatting Response as JSON**\n\nThe system requires a specific response format: a JSON object with a category field. It must include a category from the given list. For this ticket, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.\n\nI see that the instructions indicate I should provide only this content. They mention the response may need parsing by code, so I\u2019ll stick strictly to the format without any extra commentary. Let\u2019s get that done!"
