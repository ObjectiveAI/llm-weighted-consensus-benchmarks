I'm not clear on specifics, but it could relate to software or calendar issues. The available categories are Access, Administrative rights, and Miscellaneous. Since the issue involves meetings, Access might fit if it\u2019s about calendar access, while Miscellaneous could apply if it's not specific. Ultimately, it seems like a general IT help request about meetings.**Choosing an IT category**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to find the best fit. The issue likely relates to \"Meetings,\" potentially involving calendar software like Microsoft Outlook. Since there's no \"Software\" category, \"Access\" makes sense if it's about calendar access. The phrase \"sent Wednesday\" might suggest they're trying to schedule meetings on that day, but it\u2019s not very clear. I think going with \"Miscellaneous\" is safest, as it's a catch-all for unclear issues. I'll format the response in a JSON-like structure for the category.**Finalizing the category output**\n\nI need to format the output according to the provided structure, which requires a JSON-like object with a single category string. Based on the content regarding \"trouble with meetings on sent Wednesday,\" I'm going to select \"Miscellaneous\" since it's the safest choice. Even though there's a chance it could relate to \"Access\" or \"Internal Project,\" I'll stick with \"Miscellaneous\" to avoid uncertainty. So, the final response will be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
