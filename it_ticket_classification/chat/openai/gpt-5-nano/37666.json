The options are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I need to evaluate the ticket details and decide which category fits best to ensure it's handled properly. Let's make sure to assign the right category so the team can process it efficiently!**Analyzing user text**\n\nThe user provided a long block of text that mixes various messages regarding issues with accessing a token crypto signer for document signing through a Chrome extension. It mentions the need for installation procedures and troubles with logging in. I need to break down this information and identify key points like issues, requirements, and troubleshooting steps. It seems essential to clarify what assistance they require and how I can help them move forward effectively!**Categorizing access issues**\n\nThe issue here involves access problems with the token signer, so I think the appropriate category is \"Access.\" Although there's mention of a laptop and installed software, the main focus is on the inability to access due to tokens and installation concerns. I'll go ahead and respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The instructions are clear that no extra text is needed, so I'll keep it straightforward with just the category object."
