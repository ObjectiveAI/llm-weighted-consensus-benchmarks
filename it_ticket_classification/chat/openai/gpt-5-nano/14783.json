The categories I have to choose from are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It seems like this ticket is primarily about purchasing a replacement mouse and logging an installation, which makes it fit under \"Purchase.\"**Deciding ticket categories**\n\nThis IT ticket is likely about hardware since it mentions devices like a wireless mouse and involves requests for replenishment and installation. I need to determine the primary category from options like \"Purchase\" and \"Hardware.\" The ticket includes phrases related to ordering a wireless mouse and logging an installation, possibly for a monitor. I\u2019ll interpret it as a purchase request since that seems to be the main focus, along with installation tasks.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket as either \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" The instructions are clear: I should output a JSON-like object based on the schema provided. Given the ticket mentions \"create replenishment,\" \"order number,\" \"log installation,\" \"monitor,\" and \"mouse,\" the primary action suggests a request to order a wireless mouse, fitting under \"Purchase.\" While it could be \"Hardware,\" the explicit language around replenishment strongly indicates \"Purchase.\" So, I\u2019ll format my response correctly as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
