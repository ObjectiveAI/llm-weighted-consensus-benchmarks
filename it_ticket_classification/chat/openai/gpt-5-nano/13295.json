It mentions \"storage folder,\" \"enough rights,\" and wanting to save files. I see options like \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The repeated mention of \"enough rights\" suggests it's about permissions for a storage folder. The \"Administrative rights\" category could imply needing specific admin privileges, but \"Access\" feels like a more generic fit. I need to figure out which category fits best!**Examining IT Ticket Content**\n\nThe user\u2019s message can be summarized as a request for permission changes regarding a storage folder. They seem to need administrative rights to save files, as indicated by phrases like \"how save files folder storage change\" and \"enough rights.\" I\u2019m considering categorizing it as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \"Access\" seems to relate to login and file shares, while \"Administrative rights\" pertains to privileges. Since it leans toward rights for a storage folder, I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the best fit!{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
