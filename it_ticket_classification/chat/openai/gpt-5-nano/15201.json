The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. It\u2019s important to determine which category best fits the ticket, so I\u2019ll carefully evaluate the phrases and match them to the appropriate category. Let\u2019s see which one aligns best!I\u2019m looking at a ticket that mentions a list of people needing access to a secure area and requests for starter cards. It sounds like this ticket is all about access control, including securing the area and verifying access rights. I\u2019m noticing elements related to both Access and possibly Administrative Rights. I want to categorize this properly, so I\u2019ll focus on these key aspects to find the right fit for the ticket.The ticket is requesting access to secure areas and starter cards, clearly placing it in the Access category. It also mentions several storage areas, which reinforces that classification. Given the requirements, I think I should respond with a simple JSON object that states the category. I\u2019ll format it like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Keeping it straightforward is important here, so I\u2019ll just provide the category without any unnecessary details. Let's deliver that!"
