The relevant categories include Access, Miscellaneous, and Internal Project. Since the issue seems related to app connectivity, it might best fit under Access or Miscellaneous. The categories feel a bit generic, but I need to select the most appropriate one for the user's request.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user's issue regarding \"error connecting server when trying to upload app\" indicates a server connectivity problem during the app upload. The comment about changes over the past week is unclear, leading me to consider categories like Internal Project, Miscellaneous, or Access. \n\nSince it involves server connectivity and it's likely an internal app issue, I might lean towards Internal Project. However, if things are too uncertain, labeling it as Miscellaneous could also be appropriate.
