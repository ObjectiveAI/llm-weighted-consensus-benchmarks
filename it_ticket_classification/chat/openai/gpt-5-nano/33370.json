I think I'll respond with a categorization result based on that. It might help to ask for clarification if necessary, too. I\u2019ll provide the category as a JSON object, so it'll look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. However, I wonder if \"Administrative rights\" might be a more precise term.**Providing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe user wants to add member mailing addresses, which indicates adding them to a mailing list rather than granting admin rights. So, categorizing this under \"Access\" seems appropriate. I recognize that it\u2019s tied to a communications project too, but the main action is adding those member addresses. Therefore, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object category: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I think it might be best to keep it minimal without extra text."
