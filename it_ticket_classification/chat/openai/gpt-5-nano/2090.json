It seems they\u2019re asking to grant access to certain colleagues on Microsoft Teams. The ticket could fit under the \u201cAccess\u201d category or maybe \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d because it focuses on allowing colleagues to have access. Since it centers around granting permissions, I think \"Access\" is the best fit, given the context of the request.{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Verifying ticket category**\n\nI want to double-check the ticket that reads, \"teams teams hello please allow teams colleagues listed thank best.\" It seems to suggest granting access to certain colleagues on Teams. Given the repeated mention of \"allow\" and \"colleagues listed,\" it clearly points to needing access for those individuals. So, I think the appropriate category here is \"Access,\" rather than \"Administrative rights,\" since the focus is on granting access to Teams."
