The available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. However, the ticket content is quite garbled. It seems to involve a \"call to action\" and mentions project-related tasks, possibly implying it's related to an internal project. Although it's confusing, I'll lean towards categorizing it as an Internal Project due to the context.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm noticing that the ticket mostly revolves around adding users, possibly to a project or granting access. Key phrases include \"add users,\" \"procedure,\" \"annual leave,\" and \"wireless code.\" The categorization options are Access, Administrative rights, and Internal Project. Given the context, it appears that the most fitting category is Access because the user is requesting to manage access rights. Administrative rights could also fit, but Access is broader and covers user access quite well.**Formatting response as JSON**\n\nI need to format the response as a JSON-like object according to the prompt provided. The required structure is clear: a \"category\" that must be one of the listed options. Based on my analysis, I can categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" So, the final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ve made sure to keep it in plain JSON format without any extra text. Let's finalize this as just the JSON object."
