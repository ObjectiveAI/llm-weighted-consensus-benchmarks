So, I\u2019ll output it as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's essential to follow the exact format!**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI'm looking at the \"Valid channels\" and the structure specifies a category object with properties. For this task, it seems that my output should simply be a JSON object representing the category of \"Access.\" Since the user needs a straightforward answer, I\u2019ll keep it concise without adding any extra text.
