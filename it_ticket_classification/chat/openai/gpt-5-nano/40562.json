Users can\u2019t change their passwords themselves and need assistance. There's a mention of an ambiguous AD creation, which I'm unsure about\u2014could it relate to \u201cWeWork\u201d? My best guess is this ticket is mainly about access issues related to password management and potentially resetting passwords. I\u2019d categorize it under \"Access\" since it centers on credentials and logging in.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe line in the ticket suggests it relates to creating documentation for incoming mail next month, but it seems to primarily involve access issues. I need to output a JSON object according to the schema provided, specifically focusing on the \"category\" field. Since \"Access\" seems like the most fitting category, I\u2019ll respond with just that category in the required format. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text. Here\u2019s what I will produce:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
