It's a bit unclear because the message includes various terms like \"cleanup,\" \"sign off,\" and \"replace lead.\" The categories available are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It might fit under \"Administrative rights\" if they need permissions to delete, or \"Internal Project.\" Overall, it feels most suitable for \"Miscellaneous\" given the vagueness.**Determining the Best Category**\n\nI'm trying to find the best fit for an IT ticket that involves deleting dashboards, cleanup, and project-related tasks. It could fall under \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are needed, or \"Internal Project\" if this pertains to project management tasks. Given the repeated mention of deleting dashboards and the nature of the tasks specified, \"Internal Project\" seems the most suitable category. Although \"Miscellaneous\" is a safer choice when details are vague, I think I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" for clarity.**Parsing the Ticket Text**\n\nI need to analyze the user's message: it contains phrases about deleting dashboards, cleaning up boards, and other maintenance tasks. This aligns well with \"Internal Project\" as it relates to managing tasks within a project. The user specifically asked for a categorized output in JSON format.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll follow the requested format and provide: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra text since the user expects a straightforward response according to the specified schema."
