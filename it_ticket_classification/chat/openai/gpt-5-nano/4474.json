The provided options are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The user string mentions aspects like \"service recovery test\" and \"restore,\" which makes me lean towards the category that fits technical functions overall. I\u2019ll have to output a JSON object with the appropriate category from the list. Let's finalize this!**Examining ticket category**\n\nI need to look at the ticket content to determine the right category. It includes phrases like \"annual service recovery test\" and \"restore,\" which suggests it could be related to an Internal Project, or possibly Miscellaneous or Access. However, since it discusses templates, tests, and documentation but not hardware or specific purchasing needs, I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as the best fit for this. It's about a test plan and related documentation\u2014definitely worth categorizing correctly!**Determining the category**\n\nI'm reviewing the ticket content, which mentions \"restore tests code,\" \"work instruction,\" and \"documentation,\" potentially hinting at a project focused on service recovery. The inclusion of templates, location, and report forms strongly points to it being an Internal Project. I need to respond precisely with a JSON object that includes the identified category. The expected output format appears to be straightforward: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. Let's go with that \u2014 it's clear and fits the requirements!"
