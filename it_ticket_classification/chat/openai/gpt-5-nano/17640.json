The phrasing \"hi cleaning she working replacement\" could suggest it's regarding staff working on cleaning, possibly needing a replacement card. \n\nGiven the context, this ticket most likely fits under the \"Access\" category since it involves an access card. I'll map it there!**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m realizing that \"same card name\" likely means the replacement card should match the previous one. So, the ticket is definitely about activating or replacing an access control card. I\u2019m settling on categorizing this ticket under \"Access\" since it clearly deals with card permissions.\n\nFollowing the instructions, I'll present the categorical response in the JSON format specified. It\u2019ll be really straightforward: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI'll keep it concise and follow through!"
