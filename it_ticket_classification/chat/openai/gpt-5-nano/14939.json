There are requests for changes and accessories like a tempered glass cover. This makes me think it\u2019s related to purchasing or order processing for an employee's mobile device. So, it seems to fit under the Purchase, Hardware, or Access categories, but I need to decide on the best one.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nThis IT ticket is about provisioning a mobile subscription and device installation, which makes me think about categorization. I feel like \"Purchase\" is the best fit since it involves ordering a device and its accessories. While \"Hardware\" could apply too, the message seems more related to provisioning a subscription rather than physical hardware installation. The mention of an \"order number\" definitely suggests it's a purchase. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase\" and respond with the required JSON format.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
