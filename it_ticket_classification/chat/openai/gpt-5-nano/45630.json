Given the content suggests an access problem, I think the most fitting category is \"Access.\" I should respond with a JSON object formatted accordingly.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe task is to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to provide the output in JSON format. The ticket mentions an issue with connecting outside and getting an error message. I think the key point to take is about access, so I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" Given the required structure, my response will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nIt's important that I focus solely on providing the JSON object, but I could consider adding clarifying questions if needed.
