I\u2019m weighing options like \"Purchase,\" since it relates to licenses, or maybe \"Miscellaneous.\" However, \"Administrative rights\" doesn't fit here. Overall, I think \"Purchase\" is the best category.**Formatting response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON-like object according to the instructions. There's a \"category\" type that requires specifying one of the fields like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Purchase.\" Since the request is about licensing and obtaining the latest version, it seems to fit the \"Purchase\" category. I\u2019ll make sure to keep my response clean and only include what's necessary. So, my final response will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Ready to deliver!"
