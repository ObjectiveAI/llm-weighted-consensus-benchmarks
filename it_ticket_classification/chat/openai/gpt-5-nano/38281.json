The category \"Administrative rights\" seems more about permissions, but this is more related to data cleanup tasks, so I'd go with \"Internal Project.\" I need to respond with the JSON object that includes the category field. The required format is clear: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I must be precise and provide exactly this JSON string to meet the user's expectations.**Finalizing JSON Response**\n\nI need to format the response as a JSON object. The required structure is clear: it should have a type of \"object\" and include the \"category\" property. My final answer will be {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. While I could add a brief note, the instructions specify just to provide the category. So, I\u2019ll stick to the required format with no extra commentary. Let\u2019s deliver that JSON response as requested!"
