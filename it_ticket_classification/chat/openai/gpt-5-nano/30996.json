The user mentioned needing access and visibility for primary ledgers, which strongly suggests the \"Access\" category. However, there's also \"Administrative rights,\" which might be relevant since it deals with user privileges. Ultimately, I'm leaning towards \u201cAccess\u201d since the request focuses on visibility and permissions related to the secondary ledgers. It\u2019s important to choose the category that fits best!**Categorizing IT Ticket with JSON**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket. It definitely relates to access since the request is about accessing secondary ledgers and their visibility with primary ledgers. The task asks for a JSON object with a specified category. Although \"Administrative rights\" might seem applicable since it involves permissions, I think \"Access\" is the safest choice, focused specifically on access rather than hardware or HR-related issues. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
