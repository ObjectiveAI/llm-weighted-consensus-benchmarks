It's important to select the correct category so that the ticket is routed to the right team for resolution. Based on the details provided in the ticket, I should analyze which category fits best. Let's make sure to get it right for smoother processing!**Identifying storage-related issues**\n\nThe ticket discusses a warning regarding the use of spares and reconstruction of disks. It's indicating that if a disk fails, reconstruction cannot automatically start unless certain configurations are in place. The situation emphasizes the need to configure dedicated or spare disks of the same type and performance level to ensure smooth operation. It seems crucial to address these details to prevent data loss and to manage spares effectively. Let's ensure this gets categorized correctly!**Categorizing as Storage**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket as \"Storage.\" To do this correctly, I will provide a JSON object that follows the required format. The category must match one of the enumerated values, and \"Storage\" is included, so that's perfect. I want to ensure proper formatting, so I'll create a JSON object with the category field. I\u2019ll respond with just the object itself, ensuring clarity and precision:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
