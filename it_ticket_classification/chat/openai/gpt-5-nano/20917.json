The details mention \u201cnew desk phones\u201d which suggests it\u2019s mainly about hardware. However, there\u2019s also a mention of \u201cauthentication\u201d which could indicate it falls under access. It seems like the primary focus is on setting up the new desk phones, so I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as \u201cHardware,\u201d though I might consider \u201cAccess\u201d because of the reference to radius authentication.**Formatting IT ticket category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to provide a JSON-like output with a category value. Based on the provided options, the ticket references \"new desk phones,\" which clearly points to the \"Hardware\" category. There\u2019s also a mention of \"radius authentication,\" suggesting it could relate to \"Access.\" However, given that the focus is on hardware, I think it\u2019s safest to classify the ticket under \"Hardware.\" So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
