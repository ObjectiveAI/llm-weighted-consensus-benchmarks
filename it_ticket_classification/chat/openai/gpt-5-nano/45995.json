This definitely sounds like an \"Access\" issue because the user had permissions before but can\u2019t access now. I\u2019m also wondering if it could fall under \"Administrative rights,\" but Access seems like the most fitting category.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user requests to \"restore accesses\" and mentions having had full access. However, I'm not sure if they specifically need admin rights. The category options include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the issue relates to accessing specific sections, it's primarily an \"Access\" problem. They also mention needing permissions for migrating folders, which could hint at administrative rights, but the direct request focuses on access to hubs. So, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Access.\" \n\nI'll format it as a JSON object with a \"category\" property.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
