It looks like they're reporting a problem where something isn't working, possibly related to connectivity. They mention that it keeps trying to connect but fails and requests a password every few minutes. The user acknowledges that they've raised an incident and thanks us for our efforts. Clearly, I need to prioritize this ticket for further assistance.**Categorizing ticket**\n\nI need to categorize the ticket, which seems related to access or authentication because the user reports password prompts and connection failures. The category could either be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Access\" fits best given the issue with login prompts. I think I should respond with a JSON object as specified, formatted correctly to contain the category field. So, I\u2019ll prepare the response like this: {\"category\": \"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
