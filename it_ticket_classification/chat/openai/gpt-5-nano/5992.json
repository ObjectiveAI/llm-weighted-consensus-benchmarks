I think this aligns with either \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" If they're asking for monitors to be purchased, it leans toward \"Purchase.\" However, since it\u2019s a request related to monitors needed for use, I\u2019ll lean towards categorizing it as a \"Hardware\" request.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to choose between \"Purchase\" and \"Hardware\" for the IT ticket categorization. Given that the request is for \u201cmonitors for interns\u201d and involves provisioning, it implies a need for hardware. Even though it doesn\u2019t explicitly state \"buy,\" the context suggests procurement. Because of explicit mentions of \"monitors\" and \"two monitors,\" I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing this as a \"Purchase\" request. I should prepare a JSON object for the response too.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
