They mention creating separate tickets for each installation and assigning orders, which suggests this pertains to hardware. Given the categories available, \"Hardware\" seems to be the best fit. The focus is on installations, cables, and asset allocation, all of which point towards hardware-related tasks. So, I'll categorize this ticket under \"Hardware.\"**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering the possibility of categorizing this ticket as \"Internal Project,\" but the user\u2019s focus on installations and asset allocation strongly suggests \"Hardware\" is more fitting. They mention specific tasks like creating separate tickets and allocating assets, which aligns with hardware deployment. Therefore, I conclude that \"Hardware\" is the right category. The output will follow the JSON-like format, stating: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. This matches the schema for the ticket categorization task.**Finalizing output format**\n\nI need to provide the output as a JSON-like object, specifically in the expected format. Based on the user's request to categorize the IT ticket, I'll structure it as {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. Even though there\u2019s a slight possibility of categorizing it as \"Internal Project,\" the focus on installations and assets makes \"Hardware\" the clearer choice. So, I\u2019ll stick to that and ensure to keep my response concise without extra commentary."
