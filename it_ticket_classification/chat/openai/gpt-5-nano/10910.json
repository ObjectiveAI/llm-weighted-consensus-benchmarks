They mention \"staff location mapping to cost matrix,\" which seems related to an internal project. When considering the provided categories, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best fit because it relates to mapping staff locations and cost. It could potentially overlap with \"HR Support\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but given the context, I'll go with \"Internal Project\" for clarity.**Selecting the right category**\n\nThe categories I have to work with are limited, but I see that the phrase \"staff location mapping to cost matrix\" suggests a cost allocation or budgeting task. This feels more like it fits under \"Internal Project,\" especially since it aligns with an assignment to an engineer. The mention of \"Wednesday PM\" is just a scheduling detail. Although it could touch on \"Administrative rights,\" it doesn\u2019t really fit. So, I'm set on \"Internal Project\" \u2014 I'll respond with the proper JSON formatting.**Formatting the output**\n\nI see the instruction says \"Bullet lists acceptable,\" but it looks like the required output is structured as a JSON object. Since we need to categorize the ticket, I'm sticking with the format and will produce: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.\n\nThere's a thought about adding a brief note since they asked for categorization, but I feel it\u2019s best to keep it simple and focus on the JSON category field. So, I\u2019ll just go ahead and answer with that!"
