The ticket mentions \"leaver mailbox\" and requests forwarding upon the leave date. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Access,\" which might encompass mailbox access rights, and \"Administrative rights,\" which relates to permissions for forwarding. However, \"Access\" seems the most fitting since it addresses mailbox forwarding rules. The focus is clearly on enabling forwarding rather than deactivating the mailbox or exporting data.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m checking the category options for an IT ticket about arranging mailbox forwarding. The categories don\u2019t explicitly mention \"Email\" or \"Azure/Exchange,\" which is tricky. The closest fits are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the user is asking to set up mailbox forwarding, it falls under access management, making \"Access\" the most appropriate choice. I need to respond with a JSON object that categorizes it as \"Access.\" However, I\u2019ll also consider if they'd prefer \"Administrative rights\" for enabling forwarding rights. So, I'd go with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nThe request \"arrange mailbox forwarded upon her leave date\" indicates setting up automatic forwarding, not requesting rights. I\u2019m confident that \"Access\" is the right category for this. Since the instructions specify to provide only the JSON object, I need to stick to that format. Given the schema, the response should simply be {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll keep it minimal as instructed and deliver just the essential information without any extra commentary."
