The user provided a text that seems a bit garbled but is mostly about changing owners and modifying group members for their technical assessors. It seems like this is related to access rights or administrative rights, so that's likely the category I'll choose for this ticket.**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nThe category for this IT ticket would be \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" Since the ticket involves modifying group ownership and members, it aligns best with \"Administrative rights.\" I need to respond with a JSON object containing the category field. The correct format is a JSON object with the chosen category value. So, I\u2019ll output simply: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} without any additional text.
