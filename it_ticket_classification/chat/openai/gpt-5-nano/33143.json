Other options like \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" don't fit as well. So, I'll go with \"Access.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user message appears jumbled, but it seems to primarily be about \"access to servers\" and an \"updated configuration plan.\" I believe they want me to classify this ticket and the best category would be \"Access,\" given that the focus is on server access rather than administrative rights. While \"Administrative rights\" sounds relevant, it's more about permissions. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" and format my response as a JSON-like object: {\"category\": \"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
