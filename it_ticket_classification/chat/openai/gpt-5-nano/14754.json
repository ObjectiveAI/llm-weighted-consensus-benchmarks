The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The user described it as a ticket for setting up the Milky Way sound system, which likely falls into Hardware or Miscellaneous. Since this involves a physical sound system setup, Hardware seems to fit best. It's also a service request for setup, making Miscellaneous a possible option too, but Hardware is more accurate here.**Finalizing the category**\n\nI'm concluding that the best category for this IT ticket is \"Hardware\" since it concerns the physical setup of a sound system. I just need to output the JSON with the category property as \"Hardware.\" The format required is straightforward, so it should look like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text included and keep it clean. Let's proceed!"
