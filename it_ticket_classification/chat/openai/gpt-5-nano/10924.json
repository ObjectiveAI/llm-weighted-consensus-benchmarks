They've mentioned something about needing access to a floor, specifically on a Wednesday, which relates to employee movement and badge problems. Given the categories available, I think this ticket fits best under \"Access.\" It's about being able to enter a specific work area, so that makes sense for mapping it to one category.**Determining Access Category**\n\nThe text is about access to a floor, with mentions of badge issues, high importance, and a specific day, Wednesday. It suggests that employees were relocated and now have trouble entering the area\u2014likely due to badge malfunctions since July 1st. So, this seems to indicate a need for access control. Given the context, I'd categorize this ticket as \"Access\" because it directly involves access rights related to badge problems. \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, but \"Access\" feels more appropriate.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
