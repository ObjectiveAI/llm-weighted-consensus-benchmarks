I'm considering the categories we have: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" Given the context, it seems to relate mostly to costs and servers, leaning towards \"Purchase.\" While \"Internal Project\" could be relevant if it's about testing, I'm deciding on \"Purchase\" as the best fit for this ticket.**Parsing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing the string provided, which includes phrases like \"servers price,\" \"cost,\" and \"application lead.\" It seems like the user is asking for pricing related to servers, possibly for cost estimation for clients. To classify this correctly, I'll categorize it as \"Purchase\" since it relates to acquiring hardware. I\u2019ll output the JSON object as specified in the instructions without any extra commentary.
