Looking at the categories available, \"Purchase\" seems to make the most sense because it focuses on the new purchase order and associated receipts. While \"Hardware\" could also work, \"Purchase\" is my top choice. So I\u2019ll format my output as a JSON object with the chosen category.**Determining category format**\n\nI need to decide on the right category for the IT ticket. \"Hardware\" is an option since it involves physical items, but \"Purchase\" seems more fitting, as it directly relates to new acquisitions and procurement. I should provide the output in the JSON format specified. It should look like this: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`, following the proper schema that confirms the allowed values. Since the instructions specify that we should respond with a type object, I\u2019ll make sure to format it correctly.**Formatting the category output**\n\nI need to ensure I'm formatting the output correctly for the category of the IT ticket. Based on the schema, I should provide a simple JSON object with the field \"category.\" Given that \"Purchase\" is an acceptable value, I\u2019ll go with that. The output will be straightforward, looking like this: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. It's important to keep it minimal and clear, so I'll deliver just that!"
