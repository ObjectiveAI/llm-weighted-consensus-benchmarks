The text mentions issues like \"not receiving approval notifications\" and involves a manager and approval process. It looks like it's related to administrative processes in sheets. Among the categories available, it seems the best fit would be \"Administrative rights\" since it appears to deal with receiving notifications tied to an approval workflow. I need to ensure I pick the most relevant category!**Determining the right category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out the best category for this IT ticket. It looks like a notification issue related to an approval workflow and involves a manager. \"Access\" seems relevant, particularly around permissions, while \"Administrative rights\" might apply if it's about setting manager rights. However, it feels more like a simple notification/approval workflow problem. The user is asking for the best category, so it's important to choose wisely between these options!**Choosing the category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that \"Access\" is the best category for this ticket, since it's about not receiving approval and manager notifications, which relates to access control and approval flows. The ticket clearly involves user account notifications, so \"Access\" really fits. I need to respond according to the given JSON format, so I\u2019ll create a JSON object with the category set to \"Access.\" The final answer will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll stick to the instructions without adding extra content!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
