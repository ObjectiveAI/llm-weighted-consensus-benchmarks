The grammar is a bit rough, but it seems like the issue is related to tasks not being visible under specific project codes.\n\nGiven the categories available, I think the most suitable option might be \"Internal Project,\" as it directly relates to project codes and tasks. I'll go with that!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the IT ticket which mentions that tasks under project codes aren't appearing\u2014sounds like an access issue. The user also references browser screenshots, which might indicate a browser-related problem or user interface issue. \n\nI\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as \"Access,\" since it seems related to permissions for specific project codes. However, if the focus is more on internal tasks rather than permissions, \"Internal Project\" could also fit. If it remains unclear, \"Miscellaneous\" may work as a fallback.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to pick a category for this IT ticket about missing tasks under some project codes. The user mentions browser screenshots, so they might be illustrating an issue. Based on the description, the best category options are \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it sounds like a problem with viewing tasks due to permissions, \"Access\" seems like the most fitting choice. I\u2019ll respond with the appropriate JSON format, indicating that the category is \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
