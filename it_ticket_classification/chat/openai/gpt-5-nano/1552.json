The options I have for categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the user's request is clearly about changing a job title, it leans towards HR Support but may also fit under Administrative rights considering IT ticketing. I need to decide which category suits best.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user isn't asking for access or hardware, so it seems they're requesting a job title change within Oracle, likely referring to the HR module. This request fits into the \"HR Support\" category since it's about modifying employee data. While typical tickets may also involve \"Administrative rights\" for changing permissions, that doesn't apply here. It looks like the user wants to change from \"Consultant\" to \"Lead Consultant,\" so, I'll respond with the JSON category: \"HR Support.\"**Crafting JSON response**\n\nThe prompt clearly asks to categorize the IT ticket, so I\u2019ll respond with a single JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It's important to make sure the enumeration matches exactly as \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll double-check to confirm that everything aligns properly. Once I'm sure, I'll return this as my final output. It's a straightforward task, but I want to ensure it\u2019s done accurately!"
