It's important to make this decision clearly!**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI'm analyzing the request, which mentions a \"new purchase,\" purchase orders, and the need to log installation and consider mandatory receipts. It seems to focus mainly on procurement, and \"Purchase\" appears to be the best category since it directly relates to the order and receipts. Although installation is mentioned, there's a specific category for \"Hardware.\" Since I must categorize the ticket, I will structure the output as a JSON object with the category set to \"Purchase.\"{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
