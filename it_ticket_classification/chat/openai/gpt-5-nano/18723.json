Since it\u2019s related to reconciliation, I\u2019m thinking it fits under \"IT Support\" rather than \"Infrastructure,\" which lacks a clear category here. Given the context, I\u2019m leaning toward classifying it as \"Internal Project\" or \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d but \"Internal Project\" seems like a better fit.**Determining ticket categorization**\n\nThe instruction I have says to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" so I\u2019ll need to provide a JSON-like output. I\u2019m considering two possible categories: \"Internal Project\" since it involves reversing a batch and reconciliation, and \"Miscellaneous,\" which could fit it as a general IT task. However, \"Internal Project\" seems more appropriate since it relates to specific internal processes in the Oracle system. I\u2019ll format the final answer as a JSON object without extra text. Here it is:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI need to make sure that I output only the JSON object, without any extra text. I\u2019ve confirmed the allowed categories, which are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I want to ensure that the category matches exactly, so I'll use \"Internal Project\" with the correct spacing. Alright, I'll produce the final output neatly as a JSON object. Here it is:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
