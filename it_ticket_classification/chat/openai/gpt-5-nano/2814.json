The categories available are: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket is messy but mentions an \"oracle process request\" and a desire for a report on team project spending over the last year. It feels like a request related to data or analytics. \"Internal Project\" could fit best since it relates to project management and reporting, but nothing else really matches.**Determining the report category**\n\nThe user's request is about running a report in Oracle, which may imply needing \"Access\" to that system. They didn't explicitly ask for access rights, so I wonder if it could be categorized under \"Miscellaneous\" as a general IT task. However, considering the mention of \"time spent by team on projects\" over the last year, it feels more appropriate to categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project.\" I should output the relevant JSON object.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
