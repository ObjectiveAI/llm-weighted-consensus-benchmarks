Terms like \"phones,\" \"provider,\" and \"connection\" suggest that it's likely a hardware or network issue. I'll consider if it fits under access as well, depending on further details.**Selecting the right category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the IT ticket categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since none directly mention Networking or Telecommunications, I think \"Hardware\" is the closest fit due to the phone issues. \"Access\" could apply if users can't connect, but the focus seems to be on connectivity problems. It looks like the best choice is \"Hardware,\" although \"Miscellaneous\" might work if it seems too vague. I need to note the update issues with the phones as well.**Submitting the category**\n\nI think this could be a software update issue on the devices, but it's still hardware-related. I'll select \"Hardware\" as the category. Now to format that as a JSON object according to the user's instructions. The expected format is:\n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}\n\nSo my final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"} \n\nI\u2019ll make sure it matches the capitalization exactly."
