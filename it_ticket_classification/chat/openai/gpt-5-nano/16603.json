The text suggests it's a maintenance notification with details about scheduled work, interruptions, and modernization. It mentions aspects like location, duration, and apologies for the inconvenience. Given the context, it likely fits under \"Internal Project\" since it revolves around maintenance and planned work, although \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could also apply. I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" as the most relevant category.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI'm reviewing the options for categorizing a maintenance notification ticket. It might fit under \"Administrative rights,\" but that seems a bit off since it\u2019s mainly about a maintenance project. \"Internal Project\" feels like a solid choice, especially since it relates to modernization. \"Miscellaneous\" could work if it doesn't fit any other category, but I think \"Internal Project\" is the best match here because it's directly related to the maintenance project mentioned.**Finalizing category response**\n\nThe \"Internal Project\" category really fits with IT projects like modernization and planned work. I need to format my response as a JSON object, so I\u2019ll structure it like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It's essential to stick to this specific format without adding extra text. I'll check that \"Internal Project\" is an exact match in the enum. It is, so I\u2019m ready to provide just the necessary JSON object without any fuss."
