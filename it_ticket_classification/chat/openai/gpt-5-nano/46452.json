The categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. This seems to relate to server issues, potentially falling under \"Hardware\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It's important to classify this correctly based on their focus on server work and ongoing configurations. Let's decide on the most fitting category.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket doesn\u2019t mention access credentials, but it revolves around booting and server processes. I'm thinking it seems more related to server hardware, specifically the boot/restart behavior. It could fit under \"Hardware,\" but also might qualify as \"Internal Project\" if it's linked to a specific task. The best fit seems to be \"Hardware,\" given the nature of their request, so I'll go with that. I\u2019ll prepare a JSON format response with the selected category.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
