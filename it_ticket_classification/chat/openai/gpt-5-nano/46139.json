I'll focus on identifying key phrases to help determine the right category. It can be a challenge to sort it out accurately, but I\u2019ll do my best!**Interpreting the ticket issue**\n\nIt seems there's an issue with a machine where their application is deployed. The app, which runs REST, has some cache problems that are preventing changes. They mentioned that they\u2019re using the same database and the app is expected to work, but they need someone to investigate the fix or properly externalize the machine. This is a high-priority ticket related to an internal project, but I'm wondering if it could also fit into \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll sort this out!**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve identified that the ticket likely falls under the \"Internal Project\" category since it involves software deployment and server issues. While there\u2019s a chance it could be categorized as \"Hardware\" if it\u2019s a machine issue, the focus is more on the deployment of the REST server and externalizing the machine. It's clearly not related to HR, Access, Storage, or other categories. So I'll go with \"Internal Project.\" I can respond with a JSON object like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nThat feels like a solid approach!**Generating the JSON response**\n\nThe instructions are clear that I should respond with just the category in the specified format, focusing solely on the JSON object. I need to ensure that I'm using the correct capitalization, specifically using \"Internal Project\" as defined in the enum. So, my output will be strictly formatted as follows to meet the requirements:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nThat should align perfectly with what's expected!"
