The request might fit with \"Hardware\" since it involves equipment and accessories. However, it could also be \"Purchase\" due to \"log queue\" referencing a potential procurement action. The mention of a \"senior engineer\" and installing the stand might imply it's part of an \"Internal Project.\" But given its hardware nature, I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"Hardware.\"**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering if \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous\" fits, but I think they don't really apply here. Perhaps \"Purchase\" could work, but the ticket isn\u2019t asking to buy, just to install an adjustable monitor stand. Therefore, \"Hardware\" seems to be the best fit. I'll categorize it as \"Hardware\" and provide a brief note that it's a request for installation. \n\nFollowing the schema, I\u2019ll output the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Keeping it succinct with no extra text."
