The ticket mentions \"queue owner\" and \"snow assignment,\" which might relate to ServiceNow. It looks like it could fit into several categories, particularly \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or even \"Internal Project.\" Given the focus on permissions and assignments, I think \"Access\" might be the most appropriate category to choose.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nThe user seems to be asking for the creation of assignment groups and queue owners in Snow, likely referring to ServiceNow. This relates to access and administrative rights due to the nature of the tasks. The ticket specifically mentions a \"security request,\" highlighting its focus on permissions. I think \u201cAccess\u201d fits better because it encompasses managing user access rights. Since we need to present this in a JSON format, using the \"Access\" category makes the most sense!**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe ticket clearly mentions \"security request\" and \"assignment groups,\" which likely pertain to access. The term \"queue owner\" is about ownership too, but doesn't specifically indicate admin rights. Since \u201cassignment groups\u201d can help assign tasks and are probably linked to ServiceNow tasks, they aren't about granting admin rights. So, I think \"Access\" is the appropriate category, covering everything from access control to queue assignments. My final JSON response will be {\"category\": \"Access\"}, and I\u2019ll ensure it follows the required format!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
