The ticket discusses processes related to server room rack key management, access control, and secured storage. It clearly focuses on procedures and logs for who enters the server room, so the \u201cAccess\u201d category seems most appropriate. \u201cStorage\u201d could also fit, but access control is the main concern here.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
