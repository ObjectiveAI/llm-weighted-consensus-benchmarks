They mentioned \"time card rejected\" and \"submitted again,\" which hints at an issue with timekeeping or attendance. \n\nConsidering the categories available, it\u2019s likely this relates to either \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" Since these tickets typically concern attendance systems, I think \"HR Support\" is the most suitable category for this situation.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe content focuses on \"time card rejected\" with high importance, which suggests it\u2019s related to a time and attendance issue rather than hardware or access. The phrase \"every card rejected\" indicates it's about submitting to a payroll system. The user's message contains some disorganization, but it seems they're requesting to categorize this for an IT ticket. \n\nI\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object, indicating the best category based on the context, likely choosing \"HR Support.\"{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
