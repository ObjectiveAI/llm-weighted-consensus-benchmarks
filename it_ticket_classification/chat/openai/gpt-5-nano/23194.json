The ticket mentions a \"job offer approvals issue,\" which suggests it\u2019s related to HR processes. The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. Given that it focuses on approvals for job offers and requisitions, \"HR Support\" seems like the most fitting category. I\u2019ll create a JSON object with the key \"category\" set to \"HR Support.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm tasked with categorizing an IT ticket that involves a \"job offer approvals issue.\" The ticket repeatedly mentions requisition approvals and approvers, which suggests it's related to HR processes. There seems to be no mention of IT systems, but the content hints at needing HR support or possibly access. Since it primarily revolves around hiring requisitions, I'll classify it as \"HR Support\" because that aligns best with what's presented in the ticket.**Providing JSON response**\n\nI need to determine the best way to respond\u2014should I just include the JSON object or a category line? The instructions specify to categorize the IT ticket, and the expected output is clearly a JSON formatted object. The schema outlines that it needs a \"category\" field. Since I've categorized it as \"HR Support,\" I\u2019ll craft the output as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I won\u2019t include any additional explanations\u2014just the JSON."
