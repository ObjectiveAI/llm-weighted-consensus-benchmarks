They mentioned they're having trouble with uploading expenses via a mobile app, facing a \"connection failed\" error, and previously lost expense items when trying to reinstall the app. It looks like this situation fits under the category of \"Access,\" since the issue seems to revolve around uploading documents and potentially accessing stored images. I\u2019ll present this in a JSON-like format with the category included.**Categorizing IT Support Ticket**\n\nThe user is seeking help with a mobile app issue related to expense uploads and lost data, which is definitely an IT support matter. I see the possible categories as \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Access.\" However, I think the best fit would be \"Storage,\" since they\u2019re focusing on recovering images stored on their phone. It's definitely not a hardware issue, and the \"connection failed\" error hints at a software-related problem, reinforcing my choice.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
