The details provided, such as \"increase maximum storage limit,\" \"archiving,\" and mentions of folders clearly indicate this is related to storage. It doesn't fit into categories like hardware, access, purchase, HR, or others. So, I'm concluding this request belongs in the \"Storage\" category. I\u2019ll prepare a response accordingly!**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI need to provide a category object for the IT ticket with \"category\" indicating the storage category. The format requires a JSON response, so I\u2019ll respond with the category value only: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. However, I should also consider including the schema structure since it was provided, even though it\u2019s not required for the output. The safest approach could be to give both the schema details and the straightforward category string, so I\u2019m set either way!**Formulating Category Response**\n\nI need to provide the category in the specified JSON format. Based on the schema, my response will look like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. This format is straightforward and meets the requirements since it\u2019s structured as expected. I won\u2019t add any extra text, just delivering the JSON object cleanly as requested. Let\u2019s go ahead with that!"
