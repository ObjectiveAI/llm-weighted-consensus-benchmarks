The keywords strongly suggest it's related to access permissions. Given the repeated references to \"accesses\" and specifics about extracting reports for analysis, it seems most appropriate to categorize this ticket under Access. Although it might also fit into Internal Project or Miscellaneous, Access seems the most fitting based on the context.**Formatting the IT ticket categorization**\n\nI see that the user message contains \"pas accesses\" and requests for running an extract cube report, which signals a technical context. The Access category fits here. I need to output the category in the JSON format specified in the schema instructions. The correct format is a JSON object with the \"category\" field indicating \"Access.\" It seems some previous tasks required just the category itself, so this new structure is a bit confusing, but I'll stick with what\u2019s required.**Determining the JSON output format**\n\nI notice the schema specifies a more formal structure for the output, and the simplest valid response would be `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. However, the schema indicates that I should present it with types and properties. While the instruction requests categorization and lists enum options, it seems many previous tasks allowed just the category string. Still, I\u2019ll stick to the safest choice and provide the structured JSON format that includes a \"category\" field. It seems correct to maintain the capitalization, so I'll give: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`."
