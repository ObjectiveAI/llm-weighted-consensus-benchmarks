The message mentions \"annual leave\" and \"second input books,\" which makes it a bit tricky. However, the key phrase \"admin access on library\" points to it being about access rights. So, this ticket would best fit under either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I think \"Access\" is the most suitable category.**Determining Category for Ticket**\n\nThe more accurate category for the user's request is \"Administrative rights,\" as they want admin access. The phrase \"admin access on library\" confirms that. While \"Access\" is a broader term, \"Administrative rights\" is more specific here. I need to provide a JSON object in the right format for this. The output should include just the category, which will look like this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I'm sticking with that conclusion since the main focus is on admin access.**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that \"Administrative rights\" is indeed the more precise category for this request. It clearly reflects what the user is asking for regarding admin access. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and finalize that as the category. Let\u2019s make sure to present this clearly: \"Administrative rights\" is the chosen category, and that should wrap things up nicely!"
