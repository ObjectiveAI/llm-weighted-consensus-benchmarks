The user mentions dates that could be referring to the 7th and 8th of March, but it\u2019s a bit unclear, maybe due to how it was phrased. After considering the categories available, it\u2019s clear this is hardware-related, given the mention of a projector and screen. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware\" and format it as a JSON-like object.**Formatting IT Ticket Response**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the provided instruction. The expected output format is a JSON object with a category field. Since I determined that the category is \"Hardware,\" I\u2019ll format it correctly as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. There shouldn\u2019t be any extra text included; the focus is solely on delivering that JSON response clearly and accurately. Alright, let's deliver it!"
