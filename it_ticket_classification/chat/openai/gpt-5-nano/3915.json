There are several categories to consider: Hardware, Purchase, and Internal Project. If it's about requesting equipment, I believe the best fit is Hardware. However, since it mentions the Locomote project team, it could also fall under Internal Project. But \"assign queue\" suggests a workflow component. Overall, I'd categorize it as {\"category\": \"Hardware\"} since it's primarily about requesting monitors.**Choosing monitor category**\n\nI'm considering the category classification, and \"Internal Project\" is meant for internal tasks. However, traditional IT helpdesk classifications lean towards \"Hardware\" versus \"Internal Project.\" Since the text is focused on allocating existing monitors, \"Hardware\" feels like the safest bet. \n\nSo, I'd output a JSON-like object like this: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. There\u2019s some ambiguity about whether to include the type wrapper, but it seems their main interest is in the category string itself.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
