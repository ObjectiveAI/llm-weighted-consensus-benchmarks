The ticket mentions issues with product activation, server connections, and attempts to resolve these through product key management. Given the details and context, it seems to best fit under the category of \"Access,\" as it involves problems with accessing the software. I'll log this categorization and ensure it's tracked for follow-up. Let's get this sorted!**Choosing the IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize the ticket based on activation failures and product key issues. It seems to touch on server access related to licensing, leading me to consider \"Access\" as the most fitting category since it aligns with issues accessing the activation server. While \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d might also sound relevant, it's more about server access for activation. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Access\" and format it as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. Let's make sure that\u2019s clear!{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
