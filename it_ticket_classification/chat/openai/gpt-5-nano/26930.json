The ticket includes various elements like access rights, mailboxes, and AD rights. It falls into de-provisioning and access removal categories. Since the details provided emphasize access issues, I would categorize this ticket under \"Access.\" I'll output a JSON object with that category property set appropriately.**Categorizing IT Tickets**\n\nIt looks like the right category for this ticket is \"Access\" because it deals with a leaver access card and access rights termination. I considered \"Administrative rights,\" but since it focuses on deactivating access for someone leaving, \"Access\" is the best fit. While \"HR Support\" could also apply because it involves leavers, the emphasis here is on IT and access removal. Therefore, I\u2019ll output a JSON object with the category set to \"Access\": {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\": \"Access\"}"
