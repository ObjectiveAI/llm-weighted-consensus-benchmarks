The ticket mentions issues like being unable to log on and needing access, which indicates it belongs in the \"Access\" category. However, it could also fall under \"Administrative rights\" if elevated privileges are requested. Yet, the message is quite garbled, making it tricky. Still, the main theme is the access problem, so \"Access\" seems to be the best fit.**Categorizing IT ticket with JSON**\n\nThe user\u2019s message mentions \"created for graduate program,\" which probably indicates account creation or access related to that program. It could also align with \"Internal Project,\" especially concerning head testing in Belgrade. However, the main focus here is clearly an access issue, so I'll categorize it as \"Access.\"\n\nNow, I need to format my response to match the required JSON schema. I\u2019ll just provide the necessary JSON without any extra wording: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
