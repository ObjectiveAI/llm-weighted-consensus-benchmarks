The ticket is requesting a monitor for Wednesday, so it likely falls under the Hardware category. However, it could also be linked to Purchase since that category exists separately. It seems they're asking for a monitor to be provided, suggesting a request for hardware rather than a new purchase. I'll categorize it as Hardware, given the context of their request.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe safest category is Hardware for this ticket request. To be thorough, I could ask for specs, quantity, model, and delivery date, but since they just asked for categorization, I\u2019ll focus on that. I need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category as \"Hardware.\" The required format is clear, so I\u2019ll go ahead and output:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
