It seems like they're asking for a monitor, which could fit under the \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase\" categories. Since they mentioned needing a center and second monitor, it feels like a hardware request. If there's a procurement process, it might also be labeled as \"Purchase\". Overall, it\u2019s definitely a hardware request.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the provided categories. \"Hardware\" seems appropriate since the request involves a monitor. However, if they need procurement, \"Purchase\" could also fit. The phrase \"monitor needed\" indicates they're asking for a monitor, and \"second monitor\" suggests a dual setup. With limited context, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" for now. Ultimately, I will format my output as a JSON object declaring the category as \"Hardware\".**Formatting IT Ticket response**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about whether to include a brief justification for the category. The instructions didn't specifically ask for it, but it could be helpful to add a short note. However, the required format is a JSON object with just the category field. Since the system message says to keep it to that format, I\u2019ll go ahead and respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without adding any extra text. This way, I\u2019m complying with the requirements."
