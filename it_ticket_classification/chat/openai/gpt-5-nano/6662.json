The available categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nGiven that this relates to polls, it seems to fit as an \"Internal Project\" since polls are part of a project or system, but \"Miscellaneous\" could also work. I\u2019m leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as the best choice!**Selecting category for IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket, and I've been considering my options. \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d feels too generic, so I\u2019m leaning toward \u201cInternal Project\u201d because the ticket mentions polls, which fit within an internal project. \n\nAlthough I briefly considered \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d since they might need permissions to amend entries, the focus here seems to be on content management rather than access or hardware. I\u2019ll structure my final answer as a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Finalizing output for IT ticket**\n\nThe user's request is clear: categorize the IT ticket, and I should respond with a JSON object. I\u2019m going with \u201cInternal Project\u201d because that seems to fit best. Since the instruction says to provide this in a straightforward way, I'll keep my response simple. \n\nI can just output the following JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It seems best to deliver exactly what was asked without additional confirmation, so let\u2019s go with that!"
