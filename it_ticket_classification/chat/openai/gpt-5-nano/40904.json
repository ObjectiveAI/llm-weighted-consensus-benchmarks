It starts with \"Categorize this IT Ticket:\", followed by a detailed description. I\u2019ll look through the categories available: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" My job is to determine which category fits best based on the ticket's content. Let's analyze the details to make the right classification!**Analyzing project quote request**\n\nAlright, the message seems to be a request for project quotes, specifically for licenses and hardware like chassis and towers. It mentions \u201cFirepower,\u201d which suggests they\u2019re looking for subscriptions related to that technology. The user is asking for total costs and quantities for various locations, along with some details about licenses that may already be purchased. I need to identify what information they need for this quote to help them effectively!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe user is looking for a \"final cost ETA,\" a \"shopping list,\" and quotes, which suggests this is a procurement task. The category \"Purchase\" seems most appropriate here, though I also consider \"Internal Project,\" since it relates to a project. However, \"Purchase\" is more on point due to the focus on quotes, licensing, and estimates. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object indicating the category selection. It\u2019s clear I should go with: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
