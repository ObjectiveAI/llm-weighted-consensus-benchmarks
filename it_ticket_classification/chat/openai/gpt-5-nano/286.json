The content mentions items like starter forms and an employment contract, which leans towards HR-related support. The category options include \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights,\" but since it's more focused on onboarding, \"HR Support\" seems most fitting. It doesn't strictly mention hardware or access, so I think \"HR Support\" is the best choice here.**Choosing HR Support Category**\n\nI\u2019m going to classify this IT Ticket as \u201cHR Support\u201d since it discusses onboarding for new employees. The user specifically asked to categorize it, so I\u2019ll respond in the required JSON format. The structure needs to match exactly, with \u201ccategory\u201d set to \u201cHR Support.\" I'll make sure to output only the JSON object, without any extra comments. I\u2019m confident that \u201cHR Support\u201d is the appropriate category based on the details provided. Here\u2019s how it looks:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}**Outputting Category JSON**\n\nI need to focus on delivering just the category value in the correct JSON format. The instructions mention that the output might be parsed by code or displayed in an app, so it\u2019s best to stick with a simple JSON object containing only the category field. According to the schema, it should look like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nThis format aligns perfectly with the specifications, and I won't add any extra text to keep it clean."
