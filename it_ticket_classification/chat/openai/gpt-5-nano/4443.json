The options available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It seems to focus on policy configuration for screen timeouts and lock screen speed. \"Access\" might be fitting due to security concerns, but \"Administrative rights\" could also apply if changes require admin privileges. \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could work too.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nThe text indicates that a policy related to screen locking is being enforced, and the user wants to categorize it rather than find a resolution. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project.\" The mention of a quicker lock screen points to a security-related policy. Since there's no \"Security\" category, \"Access\" fits best as it relates to lock screens and timeout, while \"Administrative rights\" might not apply if they\u2019re just adjusting options rather than requesting permission.**Finalizing Category Output**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the ticket as \"Access\" since it's about authentication and session timeout. I need to present this as a JSON-like object, as specified. The required format is quite clear: it should include the key \"category\" with the value \"Access.\" Following the instructions closely, I\u2019ll respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to avoid extra text and deliver it concisely."
