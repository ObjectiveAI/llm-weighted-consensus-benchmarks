The user seems to be having trouble accessing collateral files related to pre-sales work. They mention being able to access the main site but not certain resources, facing issues with both remote access and direct wired connections, and encountering a server address problem. Since it's primarily about access, I'd categorize it under \"Access.\"**Categorizing the IT issue**\n\nI\u2019m looking to categorize this IT ticket, and it seems like an \u201cAccess\u201d issue rather than \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d since it\u2019s focused on accessing resources. The user referenced their trouble with infrastructure, remote access, and the server address. Since the main concern is accessing collateral files, I'll conclude that it belongs in the \"Access\" category. I need to respond with a JSON object indicating this, like so: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra commentary is necessary!**Finalizing the category output**\n\nI\u2019m set to output the category as \"Access.\" I need to confirm the JSON structure is correct, following the schema provided. It looks like I should form an object with a \"category\" property that matches one of the allowed strings. So my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s crucial to avoid any extra commentary, just delivering the clean JSON format as instructed. Alright, let's deliver this!"
