It mentions setting up devices and meeting rooms, receiving signals, and testing. Given the context of \"setup devices\" and \"hardware,\" it looks like the best fit is the \"Hardware\" category. While \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could also work, \"Hardware\" seems most appropriate since it's specifically about configuring devices for meetings. Let's go with that!**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object for the IT ticket categorization. The instruction specifies a schema that includes a \"category\" string, and I'm going to set that to \"Hardware.\" So, I\u2019ll create a simple JSON object as follows: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I want to make sure there's no extra text in my response. The focus is solely on providing this JSON format as the answer. Let's go with that!"
