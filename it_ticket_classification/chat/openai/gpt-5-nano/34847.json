Although \"HR Support\" could fit since the badge is often tied to HR, it\u2019s more about access control. The instruction says to output this as a JSON-like object, specifically in this format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This matches the requirements, so my final answer will just be that JSON without any extra text.**Confirming task request**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket based on the text provided. I just need to focus on identifying the correct category without suggesting any actions or additional comments. It\u2019s straightforward, so I'll make sure to respond with the relevant category based on the user's input. I feel ready to deliver exactly what they need without overcomplicating things. Let's get right to it!"
