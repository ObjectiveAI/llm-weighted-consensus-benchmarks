It mentions concepts like \"cluster,\" \"distributed computation,\" and \"storage,\" along with other technical terms. The allowed categories are \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Given the terms used, \"Storage\" seems most relevant due to the mention of storage and distributed computation. However, it could also fit as \"Internal Project\" if it relates to setting up a cluster. I'll go with \"Storage.\"**Classifying the request**\n\nThe phrase \"cluster needed for client\" suggests a request for setting up a compute cluster for distributed computation, which involves storage and Spark. I\u2019m considering categorizing it under \"Hardware\" because clusters imply hardware, or \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s a project to establish the cluster. Given the urgency for \"configuration asap,\" I believe \"Internal Project\" fits best since it\u2019s about setting up a cluster. However, \"Storage\" could also apply due to mentions of distributed computation over storage. Ultimately, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Internal Project.\"**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nThe phrase \"cluster needed for client\" indicates a service request for setting up a cluster. I\u2019m inclined to choose \"Internal Project\" since it reflects a setup or infrastructure project. The available categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since this request is about infrastructure and configuration rather than purchasing, \"Internal Project\" seems the most fitting. I'll finalize my response in the required JSON format as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
