The user message discusses a \"starter form,\" which relates to HR onboarding. It seems like a request for help filling out this form. Therefore, I think it makes the most sense to classify this under \"HR Support,\" as it's about onboarding for a new starter and directly related to that category.**Categorizing IT ticket requests**\n\nIt looks like the user is discussing a \"starter form\" related to onboarding a new starter. They\u2019re asking for help with this form, which suggests it fits better under \"HR Support\" rather than categories like \"Administrative rights.\" The typical IT ticket categories include Access, Administrative rights, HR Support, and Miscellaneous. Since this is focused on onboarding paperwork, I\u2019ll categorize the ticket as \"HR Support\" and return a JSON object with that classification.**Generating JSON response**\n\nI need to create a JSON-like object with a \"category\" field based on the guidelines provided. The appropriate response should be just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I want to make sure there\u2019s no extra text or information\u2014just the JSON format. While I considered categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" the content revolves around onboarding and filling out starter forms, which makes \"HR Support\" the most fitting choice."
