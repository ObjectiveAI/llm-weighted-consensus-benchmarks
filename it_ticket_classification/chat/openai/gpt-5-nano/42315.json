It mentions access issues related to library visits, workshops, and a year celebration, along with requests to modify documents. The available categories include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\". Given the content, it looks like it falls under \"Access\" since it primarily relates to access requests. However, I might also consider \"Administrative rights\" if it pertains to site ownership rights. It\u2019s a bit unclear, but \"Access\" feels like the right fit!**Selecting Access Category**\n\nThe ticket mentions that the \"site owner should be able to access and modify documents,\" which suggests administrative rights. However, there\u2019s also a clear \"Access\" category, and the main issue seems to be about getting access to resources. Given that, I think \"Access\" is the best fit. I need to respond with a JSON format that specifies this category. So, I\u2019m going to finalize it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra explanation needed!"
