The user's issue seems to revolve around not being able to complete a customer satisfaction survey, which is likely tied to an application error. It's not a hardware or storage issue, and the limited category options include \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Internal Project.\" Considering that the problem does not fit neatly into other categories, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the best fit.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI'm considering if the issue might relate to \"Access,\" especially since the user mentioned \"once logged.\" This could indicate that they're having trouble logging into the survey system. However, without a specific \"Software\" category, it appears that \"Miscellaneous\" is still the best fit for categorizing this ticket. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object in the format expected, which will be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. This should meet the requirements for coding and categorization.**Deciding on justification for categorization**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about whether to include a short justification, but the instruction specifies that I only need to categorize the ticket. It\u2019s clear that presenting just the JSON is allowed. The only property I\u2019m required to provide is the \"category.\" So, I\u2019ll stick with the instruction and proceed with just the JSON response without any extra justification. This will keep things simple and in line with what\u2019s expected."
