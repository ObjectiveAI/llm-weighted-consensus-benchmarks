Given the options\u2014Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights\u2014I\u2019m leaning toward \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d since the text doesn't clearly fit into any specific category. I'll finalize the categorization based on my best judgment!**Categorizing Ticket Resolution**\n\nThe text I have centers on changes in task resolution statuses, mentioning various issues like tasks being done or unresolved. It doesn\u2019t really fit neatly into categories like Hardware, HR Support, or Storage. While \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" might seem relevant, I think \"Miscellaneous\" would be the best fit due to its generic nature. I need to select a category that best captures the overall context of the message. So, I'll go with \"Miscellaneous.\""
