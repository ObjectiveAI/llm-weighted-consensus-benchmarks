It seems to be regarding a new starter, so it likely falls under HR Support or Access categories. However, since it's an IT ticket, categorizing it as Access for provisioning is more appropriate. I'll output this as a JSON response with \"category\": \"Access\". This feels like the right decision considering the content.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket regarding a new starter, and the user mentions completing a \"starter form\" for November PM, which hints at needing help with onboarding. I see options for categorization: \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" However, since this is an IT-oriented request, \"Access\" seems to fit best, considering it's about granting access to systems. The ticket implies they want accounts set up, including email and IT onboarding. So, I'll select \"Access\" as the final category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
