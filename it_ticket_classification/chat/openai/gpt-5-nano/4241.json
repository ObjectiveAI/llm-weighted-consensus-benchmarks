The categories available include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since it involves potential submission issues, Access might be the most relevant category, but I'm still not entirely sure.**Determining Access Issue**\n\nI believe this ticket is likely related to Access because the user can't submit something, which hints at a possible login or system access problem. Their message mentions \u201cpatron day\u201d and \u201cOracle,\u201d which suggests it might involve an occupancy scheduling system or an Oracle database. If they can't submit due to access issues, that aligns with the Access category. \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant here if they need specific permissions to submit their request.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that the phrase \"shows submitted future days\" might indicate a bug, perhaps pointing to an issue within the Oracle system. Since the user can't submit entries due to something, I believe we should classify this as \"Access,\" since it doesn\u2019t fit other categories like Hardware, Storage, or HR Support. If the issue involves needing permissions, \"Administrative rights\" might also apply. The user\u2019s request for categorization means I should format my response as a JSON object, setting the category to \"Access.\"**Delivering JSON for Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering if \"Miscellaneous\" might fit due to unclear descriptions, but since it's definitely about submitting access issues, \"Access\" seems to be the right choice. \"Administrative rights\" could apply if permissions are involved, but the user didn't mention that specifically. I'll go ahead and output a JSON object with just the category being \"Access.\" The correct format appears to be simply: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, following the given schema. I think I\u2019ll stick to just providing that without any extra notes since the instructions focus on the categorization request."
