It sounds like something related to onboarding, possibly involving international transfer details. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Access\" for login rights or \"Administrative rights\" if the form pertains to that. However, it might be best classified under \"HR Support,\" as it's about new hire forms.**Clarifying IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m realizing that \"HR Support\" is indeed one of the allowed categories, along with \"Administrative rights.\" The user's request about a \"new starter\" and an \"international transfer\" hints at onboarding, and \"pm starter form\" could relate to a Project Manager. The phrase \"she has added ad\" makes me wonder if \"ad\" refers to Active Directory. It sounds like they need assistance with access provisioning or user accounts, making \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights\" valid categories for this ticket.**Choosing the category for the IT ticket**\n\nI'm thinking the form likely involves user access and Active Directory, leading me to consider the category as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The mention of a \"Frankfurt international transfer\" suggests a user might be moving between domains. However, since this seems more related to onboarding, \"HR Support\" could apply, but it feels more IT-focused due to terms like \"fill part enclosed form.\" So, the best fit is \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format the output as requested: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
