The user mentioned an unfamiliar screen when trying to submit, which is something to consider.**Finalizing the IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering if this issue could be categorized as \"Administrative rights,\" but that doesn't quite fit. \"Internal Project\" might work if the timecard is internal, yet it's really about the timecard submission screen.
