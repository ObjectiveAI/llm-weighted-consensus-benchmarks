The \"ext\" might refer to an extension, but since it's about onboarding, HR Support looks like the right choice. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON category object.**Categorizing IT Ticket for Onboarding**\n\nI'm looking at an IT ticket for onboarding a new employee. The ticket mentions \"starter form,\" which suggests it\u2019s HR-related, so \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit. However, it could also involve \"Access\" since accounts need to be set up during onboarding. The term \"starter form ext\" raises questions about whether they want an extension of the form. Still, given the context and the focus on a new starter, \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category.**Providing Category in JSON Format**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize, so I need to respond with a JSON object, specifically using the category \"HR Support.\" While considering how best to present this, I realize I should output the category as part of a schema format. \n\nThe required format is structured like this: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[...]}}}. \n\nHowever, since the instruction emphasizes simply providing the category, I will focus on delivering the necessary JSON object while ensuring I include only that information.**Clarifying JSON Output Requirements**\n\nThe instruction specifies to output a JSON object in a particular schema format: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\"...}}. This means I need to provide the full object, not just the category value. The schema indicates that \"type\" is \"object\" and \"properties\" includes a \"category\" as a string with an enumerated list.\n\nEven though it\u2019s common to output a minimal object with just the category, the user's request requires this full schema. Therefore, I will provide a JSON structured like this, ensuring it meets the required format.**Deciding on JSON Format**\n\nIt seems the \"type\" should be part of the schema, not the data itself. In some cases, I believe the user only wants the category value, even though the instruction mentions \"category format.\" \n\nThe prompt indicates I need to categorize the IT ticket, and I think outputting the category in a simple format like {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} is both valid and concise. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll just give that straightforward response without any extra text."
