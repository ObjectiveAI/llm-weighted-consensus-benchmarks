I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Storage,\" since the issue is specifically about partition space. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and format the final output as JSON with the selected category.**Delivering the JSON response**\n\nI want to finalize my categorization of the IT ticket as \"Storage.\" It's important to keep my response clear and concise, so I\u2019m ensuring not to include any extraneous text. I\u2019ll present the final answer as a JSON object that specifically states the category. Okay, let\u2019s deliver that now! The format will be straightforward and to the point, focusing solely on the necessary information."
