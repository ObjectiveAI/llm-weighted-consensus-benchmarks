The user mentions wanting to ensure there\u2019s proper cable configuration and requests to raise an issue regarding access. Based on the content, this clearly fits into the \"Access\" category due to the focus on connectivity and server access. I'll make sure to classify it accordingly!**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm identifying the best category for this IT ticket. It seems the most fitting choice is \"Access\" since it's about server access and related rights. There's also mention of needing a cable configured, which could suggest \"Hardware,\" but the main theme is access to servers. It doesn't fit into HR, storage, purchase, or internal project categories. While \"Administrative rights\" was mentioned, the request is more about general access. Therefore, I\u2019ll choose \"Access\" and format it in JSON.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
