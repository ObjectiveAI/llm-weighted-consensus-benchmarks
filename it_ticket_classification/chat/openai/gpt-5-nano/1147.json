It involves access removal relating to an employee leaving, that \"leaver\" terminology is important. I think \"Access\" is the best fit since it deals with rights and mailbox changes. \"Administrative rights\" could be a subset too, but the ticket specifically mentions \"Access.\" The tasks include disabling the AD account, mailbox access, and more related to inventory.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI'm looking at IT ticket categorization and think \"Access\" fits best for user access requests. \"Administrative rights\" would be more for granting privileged access, but I want to be precise. The prompt asks for categorization and expects a JSON format. So, I should respond with `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I'll ensure to follow the given schema and confirm that \"Access\" is indeed within the required categories. I wonder if \"HR Support\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could fit better, given it's about the leaver process.**Selecting category for IT ticket**\n\nConsidering this IT ticket is about access termination for a leaver, \"Access\" really does seem like the best choice. I want to provide a clear and accurate response, so I\u2019ll format it as a JSON object with the category set to \"Access.\" Let\u2019s make sure I craft it correctly: `{\"category\": \"Access\"}`. I\u2019ll stick to that format, ensuring everything is neatly presented and follows the guidelines!"
