The phrase \"set as approver\" stands out as it relates to access or permissions. This could fall under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I should parse the ticket carefully to choose the appropriate category, ensuring that the decision accurately reflects the user's intent. Okay, let's go with \"Access\" as it seems to fit best!**Determining the right category**\n\nI see that the ticket mentions \"set as approver for Tuesday July PM,\" which suggests someone wants to grant approval rights for a specific date. This seems to connect to \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access.\" The request implies elevated permissions, so I\u2019m weighing which category fits best. While \"Access\" is more generic, the context of granting someone approver status aligns more closely with \"Administrative rights.\" I think I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" since that fits the privileged nature of the request."
