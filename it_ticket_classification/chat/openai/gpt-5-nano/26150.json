It might fall under \"Internal Project\" due to references to moving package production and website content. However, \"Miscellaneous\" could also fit given the mixed nature of the phrases.**Categorizing as Internal Project**\n\nIt seems like the ticket doesn't clearly fit into \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"HR Support.\" The phrase \"logging requests\" suggests it might relate to logging events, but there are other phrases like \"Careers events code\" and \"rules heading\" that point towards something web-related or about a \"code event\" deployment. Given the context, it makes sense to categorize this as \"Internal Project\" since it relates specifically to coding and production. Now, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object, following the required schema without extra comments.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
