They mention upgrading RAM, which clearly falls under \"Hardware.\" There are also references to laptops and potentially related processes like testing or organization of upgrades, hinting at \"Purchase\" as a secondary category. While there are some unclear parts in the request, the main focus is on upgrading hardware, so I\u2019ll prioritize the \"Hardware\" category for this ticket.**Finalizing category response**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this request primarily as \"Hardware\" since it involves an upgrade for RAM and laptops. While there is mention of an additional order that could suggest \"Purchase,\" the main focus is on the hardware upgrades, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ll prioritize. The response must be structured as a JSON object with the category specified. I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra text and respond just with the necessary JSON format.
