The content of the ticket seems to focus on updating Oracle HR/Payroll information, specifically about Romanian employees whose work relationships ended earlier than displayed. This most closely relates to \"HR Support\" since it's about employee data updates. However, I\u2019m also considering whether it might fall under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\"**Deciding on category classification**\n\nIt looks like the ticket is about updating details related to leavers in the Oracle system, so I\u2019m thinking it should be classified as \"HR Support.\" I briefly considered \"Internal Project,\" but it's clearly about data management. \"Miscellaneous\" doesn't fit either. So, I'll output a JSON object with the category field, as specified in the prompt. The required format is clear, and I\u2019ll keep it simple without extra text. Here it goes: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
