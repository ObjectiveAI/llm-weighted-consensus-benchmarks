The instructions indicate that I should output a JSON-like object containing a field for \"category\" with the corresponding string from the enum. The user has asked, \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" followed by a long message that I need to analyze to find the best-fitting category. Let's get started on this!**Analyzing an IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket content is a bit jumbled, mentioning things like \"reset password,\" \"expire days,\" and \"importance high.\" It has phrases related to confidentiality and errors, suggesting it may involve sensitive information. However, it most clearly ties to a password reset, which usually falls under access or credentials. Given the context, I believe the appropriate category for this IT ticket is \"Access,\" as it's primarily about login privileges and not hardware or administrative rights.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI'm confirming that \"Access\" is indeed a fitting category based on the user's primary request for a password reset. There's also a mention of \"change pc,\" which might suggest hardware concerns, but the main focus is on resetting the password. The user's text indicates high importance, and includes typical steps for changing a password on Windows, further supporting the \"Access\" categorization. So, I'll prepare a JSON object with the category set to \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
