It\u2019s a bit messy, but it contains phrases like \"installation requested,\" \"log installation,\" and mentions of a router and an engineer. Given these details, it could fit into several categories, such as \"Hardware,\" since it mentions installation of hardware, or possibly \"Internal Project\" if it's related to project work. However, I think \"Hardware\" might be the most appropriate choice since the router is involved.**Formatting IT ticket category**\n\nLet\u2019s clarify this: The user's request includes phrases like \"installation requested\" and involves a \"router\" and \"engineer,\" which points to \"Hardware\" as the likely category. I need to respond with a JSON-like object in the correct format. The specification expects a category object, so I\u2019ll prepare my output as: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. In this case, I think a minimal explanation of the category isn't necessary since they likely just want the category itself.**Delivering category response**\n\nThe instructions indicate that I need to select one of the provided categories and respond with the JSON format. Since \"Hardware\" is the appropriate choice, I\u2019ll output exactly: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. I need to ensure that I observe case sensitivity since \"Hardware\" should have a capital \"H.\" There\u2019s no need for any extra text or explanation; I just need to deliver the data as specified. Let's get this done!"
