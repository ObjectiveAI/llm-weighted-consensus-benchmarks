The ticket mentions \"toil day issue,\" likely referring to \"Time Off In Lieu.\" They mention an error with \"annual leave change,\" asking how to proceed further, which suggests it may be HR-related. However, since I'm tasked with categorizing it as an IT ticket, I need to focus on how this falls within those categories rather than getting lost in the HR aspects.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI'm looking at the categories available: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket pertains to \"toil day issues\" and \"annual leave,\" suggesting it's about HR. Although they asked how to proceed, which might complicate things, I think \"HR Support\" fits best since it focuses on leave. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as HR Support and respond with a JSON-like object that includes this category.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
