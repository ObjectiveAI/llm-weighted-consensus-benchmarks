The request suggests a hardware issue, potentially needing a storage upgrade or RAM increase. \"Compliance officer\" is mentioned as a sign-off. Considering the phrasing, it seems safest to categorize this under Hardware since it's about performance capabilities. However, if the request clearly pertains to increasing storage specifically, I might also consider Storage. The ambiguity around \"capacity increase\" means I should select the best fit.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nIf the user is asking to increase their computer's capacity, it likely pertains to storage capacity, since \"computer slow\" suggests there might be a performance issue to resolve with RAM or CPU additions. While the specific request points to storage, the mention of performance might complicate the categorization. Since there's a specific Storage category, I would initially choose that, but given the overall context, I might also mention Hardware. I need to provide a JSON output reflecting this decision.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI believe Storage is the most accurate choice for the IT ticket regarding increasing computer capacity, specifically disk capacity. So, I'm going with Storage. Now, I'll make sure to follow the prompt and provide just the JSON object without any extra commentary, as that\u2019s what the UI expects. The required format is a simple object with the category. The final output will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"} \n\nGot it!"
