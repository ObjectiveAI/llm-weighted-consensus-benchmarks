I'll go ahead and format my response as JSON, as specified by the system.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nI need to output the category as a JSON object, and the chosen category is \"Access.\" The system specifies a certain format, emphasizing that special formatting might not be supported. So, I should simply return: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nThere's a mention of \"maternity leave,\" but it doesn\u2019t really change the category. I can see how keeping it concise is essential. So, I'll stick with the clearly required format while also being mindful of the instructions."
