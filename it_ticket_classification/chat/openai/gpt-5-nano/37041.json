The user mentions struggling with adding a team member and includes terms like \"unable to add,\" \"forecast code,\" and \"assistance,\" along with their upcoming leave. This suggests the issue likely pertains to access control or permissions. I\u2019m leaning toward classifying it as \"Access\" since it involves granting access for team involvement. It could also fit under \"Administrative rights,\" but I think \"Access\" might be the best fit here.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, and it seems to involve access management since it\u2019s about adding team members. \"Access\" feels like the right choice because it relates to user permissions. However, \"Administrative rights\" is even more specific to permission levels. The user\u2019s message is a bit messy, but I think sticking with \"Access\" is appropriate. Now, I should provide the category in JSON format, like this: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I'll make sure it follows the expected output structure!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
