They mentioned issues with short cables making it hard to distribute and something about cables near a TV. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Hardware\" since it relates to cables, but it could also fit \"Purchase\" because they\u2019re requesting longer cables. I\u2019ll decide on the best category based on the core request about hardware.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m processing a request for longer network cables for meeting rooms, which clearly falls under the hardware category. While I initially thought of categorizing it as \"Purchase\" because they\u2019re asking for longer cables, it's ultimately more about the hardware itself. However, since the schema provides both categories, it could really fit into either \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll output it as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} since the primary focus is on the hardware request.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe request for longer network cables indicates it's about hardware. Some systems differentiate between \"Hardware,\" which is for requests related to equipment, and \"Purchase,\" which pertains to procurement. The ticket doesn't mention any costs or purchasing directly, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll produce a simple JSON object with the category: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I want to keep the response concise since the user only asked for categorization!"
