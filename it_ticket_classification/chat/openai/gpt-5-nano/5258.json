However, \"Access\" could also apply since it involves granting access to that folder.**Deciding on Category for IT Ticket**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize the IT ticket regarding the user's request to add a shared folder called \"contracts.\" While \"Access\" involves granting permissions, the request is primarily about creating storage. In IT ticketing systems, adding a shared folder aligns more with \"Storage\" or \"New folder in shared drive,\" emphasizing storage management. So, I believe \"Storage\" is the most appropriate category. I\u2019ll respond using the required JSON format as specified.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond to the user with a JSON object, specifically including a \"category\" field. The options I have are: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the user\u2019s request to add a shared folder, the most fitting category is \"Storage.\" \n\nSo, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I think I should stick to the instruction and provide just the category without asking any further questions. Let\u2019s do it!"
