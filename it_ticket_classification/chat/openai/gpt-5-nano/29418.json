While \"Access\" could also fit if it relates to system access, the message isn\u2019t clear about that. Therefore, I believe \"HR Support\" is the best category, so I\u2019ll output:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to make sure I respond with a JSON object, specifically formatted with a \"category\" property. The valid categories include options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. According to the schema provided, I must stick to this format:  \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}  \n\nIt's essential that there are no extra spaces or text, and the string matches the enumerated category exactly. So, my final output will be:  \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
