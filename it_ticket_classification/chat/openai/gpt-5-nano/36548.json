They mention an \"equipment problem\" that makes it hard to use equipment in SAN rooms, specifically with video conferencing and screen sharing. It could relate to hardware or connectivity issues, but I\u2019m pondering if this falls under \"Access\" since it's about screen-sharing capabilities. It\u2019s a bit tricky, but I\u2019ll go with that for now.**Determining the right category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for an IT ticket regarding an equipment problem. Screen sharing is a software feature, but since there\u2019s mention of problems with equipment in SAN rooms, I lean towards \"Hardware.\" \"Miscellaneous\" could apply if it\u2019s unclear, but \"Internal Project\" doesn\u2019t fit. \"Access\" would relate more to permissions, and this isn\u2019t strictly about that. I need to generate a JSON-like object to confirm the chosen category, which will be \"Hardware.\"{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
