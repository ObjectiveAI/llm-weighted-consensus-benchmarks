The available categories include hardware, access, and administrative rights among others. Since the user mentions the need to upgrade operating systems and highlights urgency, I think it might fit best under either the hardware or administrative rights category. I need to consider which one aligns most closely with the ticket content.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm reviewing a ticket about Windows servers, focusing on upgrades, OS versions, and scanning for infections. There are a few potential categories: \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" and possibly \"Hardware.\" It seems like the issue is related to software processes and infrastructure rather than strictly hardware. Given the message references changes and requires input, it might best fit the \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative Rights\" category since it's about managing access for upgrades and logging changes.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nThe list of categories is limited, but I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since it involves upgrading OS versions across virtual machines and addressing change management. I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and make a note that it's a high-priority security upgrade. I\u2019ll create a JSON object with just the category field. The format will be simple: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I need to ensure I don't add any extra text, just the clean JSON output.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
