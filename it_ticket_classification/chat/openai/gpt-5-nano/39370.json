The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the user mentioned issues with Outlook, which relates to software concerns, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll format my response as a JSON object. Okay, I've decided on the category and it'll go out as follows: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI need to determine the right category for this IT ticket. Considering the options, \"Miscellaneous\" could work as a catch-all since there isn't a dedicated \"Software\" category. It could also be \"Access\" if the issues relate to Outlook access. The user\u2019s text talks about \"Outlook problems,\" so leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" seems safe without any specific email category. I\u2019ll return the JSON format with: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. That should fit!"
