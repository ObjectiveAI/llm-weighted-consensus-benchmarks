The content mentions onboarding and administrative roles, which makes me think it could be related to HR Support or Access rights. The mention of \"administration officer\" reinforces the idea of onboarding. Since \"new starter\" clearly indicates a focus on onboarding, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this as \"HR Support.\" Let's settle on that category!**Evaluating Access and Administrative Rights**\n\nI'm analyzing the request, which seems to be related to onboarding a new starter in Bucharest. The phrases about filling out information and mentioning an \"administration officer\" suggest it could be connected to \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" There\u2019s a hint that the new starter might take the lead in testing, which is intriguing but not entirely clear. I think it's best to categorize this as \"HR Support\" since it directly relates to the onboarding process.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing this IT ticket, which focuses on dates and onboarding details like \"please fill date\" and mentions of a \"new starter.\" While it seems to fit the \"HR Support\" category due to its onboarding nature, this is primarily an IT-related request. \"Access\" makes sense for user provisioning, especially for setting up accounts for a new employee. Given the context, I think I'll categorize this ticket under \"Access.\" Let's finalize that choice!{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
