Given all this, I\u2019m concluding it best fits under the \"Hardware\" category. I'll respond with the JSON: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}.**Delivering IT ticket category**\n\nI need to follow the instruction to \"Categorize this IT Ticket\" and provide just the category in the required format. The final output must be a JSON object that reflects this.\n\nSince the best fit is \"Hardware,\" I\u2019ll create the response as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. The prompt specifies that my answer should stick to that structure, so I\u2019m confirming this is what I\u2019ll deliver. Let's go ahead with that!"
