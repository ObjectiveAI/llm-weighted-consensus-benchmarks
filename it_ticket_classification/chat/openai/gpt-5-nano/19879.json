I need to categorize the ticket efficiently, considering it's related to a purchase of a monitor. The phrases \"new purchase\" and \"purchase po\" strongly indicate the \"Purchase\" category, even though it\u2019s also hardware. \n\nTo adhere to the format provided, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like structure, specifying the category as \"Purchase\": {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. Let\u2019s do this!**Formatting the response correctly**\n\nI\u2019m working with the JSON schema and need to respond according to the user\u2019s request to categorize this IT ticket. The schema specifies that I should provide a JSON object with a category field, so I\u2019ll format it as {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. \n\nThe directives clarify valid response channels and emphasize sticking to the required schema. There shouldn't be extra commentary, just the straightforward category label with proper capitalization, so I\u2019ll finalize my response as {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. Let's keep it concise and clear!"
