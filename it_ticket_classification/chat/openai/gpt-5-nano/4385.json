It doesn't seem to be related to administrative rights since it's just about resetting the password. So, I'm deciding on the category \"Access.\" I'll format this as a JSON object.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI need to confirm that the assistant outputs the JSON format correctly, specifically with the category included. So, I will provide just the essential part, ensuring there\u2019s no extra commentary or unnecessary details. It should simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThis keeps it straightforward and meets the requirement perfectly. I'll make sure to deliver it as requested!"
