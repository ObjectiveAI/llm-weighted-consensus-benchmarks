Keywords like \"new purchase\" and \"Catalyst switch\" suggest it fits under Hardware, but it may also relate to Purchase due to the context of a new purchase order.**Deciding on the category**\n\nI\u2019m reconsidering the categorization based on repeated phrases like \"purchase order,\" \"new purchase,\" and \"po.\" The options include \"Purchase\" and \"Hardware.\" Since the text refers to a switch, which is a hardware item, it complicates things. However, \"new purchase\" and \"purchase order\" suggest a procurement context. Typically, \u201cPurchase\u201d is for procurement requests while \u201cHardware\u201d covers physical devices. Given these clues, it seems most appropriate to categorize this IT ticket as \"Purchase.\"**Formatting the output**\n\nThe input text isn\u2019t asking for access, HR support, or anything like that, so I can confidently categorize it as a purchase. I\u2019ll format the JSON output correctly since it should include enum values in string format. That means I\u2019ll show it as: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}.\n\nI\u2019ll stick with this option because \u201cPO\u201d suggests procurement, steering us toward \u201cPurchase.\u201d Let\u2019s keep it straightforward and respond only with the JSON object while ensuring proper formatting: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
