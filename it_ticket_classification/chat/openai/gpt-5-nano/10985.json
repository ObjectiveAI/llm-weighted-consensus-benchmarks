The ticket text is unclear, but \"add towers\" appears twice. It might refer to adding computer towers or supplier towers. Since it's ambiguous, I think the best fit for this request would mainly be a hardware-related action, but it could also fall under Purchase if it's about supplier addition.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe phrase \"add towers\" likely refers to hardware, such as PC towers. I see two possible categories: \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase,\" depending on whether the request is about adding physical towers or a supplier. The ticket mentions \"supplier towers,\" which could indicate adding a vendor named \"Towers\" to the procurement system. However, considering the overall context, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Hardware\" because it's mainly about adding those towers, rather than procurement.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
