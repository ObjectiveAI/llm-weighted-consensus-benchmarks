I suspect this is an access issue, or it might relate to storage since it's about missing documents. It could fit into \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous,\" but it seems most aligned with \"Access.\" I\u2019ll go with that for clarity.**Categorizing IT Tickets**\n\nIn categorizing this IT ticket, \"Access\" is the best fit since the user is having trouble seeing documents. The issue seems related to their ability to access these documents, especially with phrases like \"not showing documents sent.\" \"Storage\" might also apply, but \"Access\" is clearer. While \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if access is blocked, it\u2019s not explicitly mentioned. It might be helpful to ask clarifying questions, but first, I'll just categorize it as \"Access\" and format it as a JSON object.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
