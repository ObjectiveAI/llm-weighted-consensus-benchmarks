The main points appear to revolve around timecard issues, such as difficulties submitting a timecard for December, concerns about absences, and annual leave being imported incorrectly. There are also mentions of holidays and checking the annual leave balance. The text is a bit confusing, but I'll focus on the key topics related to timecard problems!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe content I'm working with includes phrases like \"lead sent Friday December\" and mentions of timecard issues, annual leave, and balance. It seems to relate to HR matters, particularly involving the timecard system. So, I think \"HR Support\" is the right category since it addresses issues like timecards and leave requests.\n\nI need to format the output as a JSON object with the category property, so it will look like:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"} \n\nThis aligns with the instruction to categorize the IT ticket!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
