It seems to mention \"leavers,\" which probably refers to employees leaving due to termination effective Thursday PM. They use terms like \"hi forms,\" likely meaning HR forms, and they're requesting categorization into one of several categories. Since it discusses terminated users, I think \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" really fits this context best since it relates to managing employee access.**Choosing category for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the message about \"two leavers\" and termination on \"Thursday PM,\" which makes it a bit confusing. I think the most suitable category for this could be \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\" Since it seems to be about deactivating accounts for terminated employees, going with \"Access\" seems right. The response will need to be in a JSON format specifying the category. I\u2019ll respond with `{\"category\":\"Access\"}` to fit the required structure.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
