While it could also fall under \"Purchase\" if they're requesting to buy a cable, \"Hardware\" seems to be the better designation since it directly pertains to the equipment involved. However, it\u2019s important to consider the context. Overall, the most fitting category would likely be \"Hardware.\"**Finalizing category output**\n\nI've concluded that the request for a cable likely falls into the \"Hardware\" category since it involves a physical connection to a monitor. The user's mention of \"connect PC monitor port\" supports this hardware classification. Therefore, I need to respond with a JSON object indicating this category. The final output should simply be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra text included, just the required format. It's all set to deliver!"
