It seems to be about allocating hardware for a new starter who\u2019s beginning in July. The most fitting category for this request appears to be \"Hardware,\" since it involves provisioning hardware. However, it could also relate to \"Access\" if login credentials are needed. The allowed categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and a few others. I'll go with \"Hardware.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe text mentions a \"new starter\" and hardware allocation, indicating that it's related to onboarding. It specifies a start date in July and suggests that more details might be necessary. The user has asked me to categorize this IT ticket, which means I need to respond with a JSON-like structure. Based on the content, the most suitable category is \"Hardware.\" So, I'll output the required JSON format: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}.**Outputting category**\n\nThe required format for the category is a JSON object. To ensure everything meets the standards, I'll output it in proper JSON syntax, without any extra text. I\u2019ll use the key \"category\" with the value \"Hardware\" since that fits best with the IT ticket. So, my final response will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This way, I can confirm it's structured correctly!"
