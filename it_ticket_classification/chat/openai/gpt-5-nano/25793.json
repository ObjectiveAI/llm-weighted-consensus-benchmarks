They're asking for assistance with issues related to meeting rooms, urgent requests, and a request to split tickets for each room. The options I have for categorization include types like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and more. Given the context about meeting rooms, it seems most appropriate to categorize this as \"Miscellaneous.\"**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I'm analyzing the details. It seems to be about configuring meeting room devices, which might fall under \"Hardware.\" There's a mention of splitting tickets, suggesting procedural work, which could relate to \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, without a clear request for access, the best fit appears to be \"Hardware.\" I'll prepare to respond with a JSON object reflecting this category.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
