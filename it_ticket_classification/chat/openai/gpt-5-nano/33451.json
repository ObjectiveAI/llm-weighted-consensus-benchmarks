The ticket mentions \"pipeline project codes,\" \"opportunities won,\" and seems to touch on project management and CRM pipeline issues. It looks like it's primarily about project management statuses, which would likely fit best under \"Internal Project.\" So, I\u2019ll categorize it that way, focusing on the context of project-related topics.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve analyzed the categories: it\u2019s not Hardware, HR Support, Access, Storage, Purchase, or Administrative rights. The ticket mentions pipeline projects and testing, which makes it more appropriate for \"Internal Project.\" It doesn't align with Access or hardware issues. I should format my response as a JSON object, so I'll present it simply with the required category key. My final output will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. No extra text needed!"
