Given the mention of \"blade enclosures decommissioned,\" \"Hardware\" seems like the right choice, but it might also fall under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" if it\u2019s task-specific for operations.**Selecting the right category**\n\nThe phrase \"service now task to be amended for ops\" indicates it's an operations task, and while \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility, it seems more likely this is about editing an existing task rather than changing permissions. Given that \"blade enclosures decommissioned\" suggests hardware involvement, I feel \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category. I\u2019ll format my final answer as a JSON object with the appropriate category property. Here it is: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}**Finalizing category selection**\n\nThe user has requested that I categorize the ticket, and I'll provide the response in JSON format. I want to double-check the details to ensure accuracy. The mention of \"blade enclosures decommissioned\" definitely relates to hardware, confirming that \"Hardware\" is the correct category. It feels good to have clarity on that! I\u2019m ready to present my final answer in the required format."
