It mentions \"new starter tower,\" which likely refers to a hardware request, alongside terms like \"internship ended\" and \"please provide fathers initial.\" The main actionable items include the mention of a new starter tower and aspects related to HR support regarding the internship. Given these details, I lean toward categorizing this ticket under Hardware or HR Support.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing a confusing IT ticket that could relate to providing a PC tower for a new starter or maybe access rights. The phrase \"new starter tower\" hints strongly at hardware provisioning, which would place it under the Hardware category. There's also mention of \"AD\" that might mean Active Directory, suggesting possible Access as well. So, I need to balance the hardware aspect with potential access for Active Directory as I categorize this ticket.**Finalizing the IT ticket category**\n\nI'm sifting through possible categories for this IT ticket and note that it's a bit unclear. Administrative rights and HR support popped into my mind, but they don\u2019t seem relevant. I think this request is primarily about hardware, specifically a new starter's tower computer. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as Hardware and respond with the proper format as a JSON object, ensuring no extra commentary. The output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
