It mentions an Oracle question about changes after migration, including issues with cards showing entered hours. This suggests it could relate to \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\"\n\nGiven the focus on migration and potential timekeeping issues, \"Internal Project\" seems like the most fitting choice since it connects directly to the internal processes. If unsure, \"Miscellaneous\" is always a safe bet.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's message seems to revolve around Oracle, likely concerning Oracle databases or systems, along with migration issues. I think the best fit for categorization is \"Internal Project,\" as it pertains to post-migration problems. If there are any further actions or approvals needed, it could also lean toward \"Administrative rights.\" The mention of \"cards showing entered with different hours\" hints at time tracking. Ultimately, I\u2019ll format my final answer as a JSON object that captures the selected category from the given options.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
