I\u2019ll focus on identifying key terms in the text to decide which category to use for the JSON output. Let's see what I can work with!**Analyzing the client's message**\n\nThe user's message includes phrases like \"client sent me with attached file\" and references to various technical topics, such as configuration, templates, and database interactions. It seems to talk about interface calls and confirmation settings, including enabling or disabling confirmations and regex validation. There\u2019s a lot of detail here, but it appears somewhat jumbled. I think I need to extract key components relating to the client's concerns to categorize this ticket effectively. Let's focus on that!**Determining the project category**\n\nThis message appears to be a technical document discussing code, templates, and databases. I think the best category for this ticket is \"Internal Project,\" especially since it mentions an \"application architect.\" Other categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" don't quite fit here, and it's definitely not about hardware or storage. So, I'll format my response as a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It's important to present it correctly without any extra text!"
