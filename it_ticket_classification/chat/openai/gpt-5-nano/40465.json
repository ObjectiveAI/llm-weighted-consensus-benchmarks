The user\u2019s message mentions missing time deletion, weekly submissions, processes, and manager notifications. Given the content, I need to select one category among \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the focus on processes and submissions, I might lean toward \"HR Support\" as the most relevant category here.**Classifying Timesheet Ticket**\n\nI see that this IT ticket is about timesheet compliance, which seems to revolve around issues with deleting inputs and submitting weekly timesheets for approval. It mentions manager notifications, so I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this as \"HR Support.\" The categories I'm considering are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. I need to respond using a specific JSON format that clearly identifies the category. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
