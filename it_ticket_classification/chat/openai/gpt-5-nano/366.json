It mentions things like changing the sending hour for MS call closure surveys, increasing the response rate, monitoring results, and client reminders following the initial survey. \n\nGiven the context, it seems the most fitting category would be \"Miscellaneous\" because it covers various topics that don\u2019t neatly fit into the other categories. Let's make sure we classify it correctly!**Categorizing ticket details**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a ticket that involves changing the hours for Microsoft call closure surveys, improving response rates, and managing reminders after the initial invite. It doesn't relate to hardware, storage, or purchase, so I\u2019m thinking it might fit into \u201cInternal Project\u201d or possibly \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d \n\nSince there\u2019s no mention of access permissions, \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems to be the best fit as it appears to be more about managing survey processes. I\u2019ll categorize it accordingly!**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object for the IT ticket, specifically including a category field set to \"Internal Project.\" The instruction emphasizes that I should output just the JSON without any extra text. \n\nI've confirmed that the structure is valid: the top level is an object, and \"category\" holds an allowed string value. So, here\u2019s the response I\u2019ll provide:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nNo extraneous information, just the required format!"
