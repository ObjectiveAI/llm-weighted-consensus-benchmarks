The repeated mention of \"license\" suggests it might be about software licensing, renewal, or access rights. It could fit into \"Access\" if referring to access licenses, \"Purchase\" if requesting a license, or \"Administrative rights\" if it's about admin privileges. However, the mention of \"architecture presentation drawing\" complicates things. It seems like the ticket is likely about a software license for daily work related to architecture.**Determining Category for IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the phrase \"various architecture presentation drawing,\" which suggests it's about software for architectural drawings, maybe an AutoCAD license. I think the \"Purchase\" category fits best for license procurement, while \"Access\" relates to login credentials. The \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it involves admin privileges. Since the ticket focuses on licenses, it seems most appropriate to categorize it as \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like object indicating the category.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
