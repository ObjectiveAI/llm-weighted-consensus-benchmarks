It mentions things like \"get approved automatically\" and \"teams sheets.\" There's also a request for help with an issue and some mention of updates to profiles. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Administrative Rights\" or \"Access,\" given the context around automation and approvals. It\u2019s tricky, but I'll aim for the most relevant category.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI notice phrases like \"get approved automatically\" and \"sheets get automatically approved,\" which might refer to an approvals workflow in Google Sheets or Microsoft Sheets. The user seems to need IT help regarding automatic approvals, possibly linked to access rights for Teams or Sheets. \n\nI\u2019m looking at categories like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" since the ticket mentions both access and issues. Really, the most fitting category could be \"Access,\" but \"Administrative rights\" might apply if it's about elevated permissions.**Finalizing category output**\n\nIt doesn't seem like this ticket is related to hardware or storage. While it could fit under \"Internal Project,\" the best option is likely \"Access,\" since it\u2019s about approvals and access to Teams or Sheets, along with profile updates. I need to respond using the required JSON format, which is {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The instructions say to provide just the JSON object, so I\u2019ll do that without any extra notes. Let\u2019s deliver it now!"
