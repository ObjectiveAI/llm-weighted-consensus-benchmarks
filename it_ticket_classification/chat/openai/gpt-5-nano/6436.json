The content mentions tasks related to \"allocating\" and \"getting two monitors.\" I see possible categories such as \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" or \"Internal Project.\" It leans towards \"Hardware\" since it\u2019s about allocating monitors. However, it could also fit under \"Purchase\" due to the request for additional monitors. Ultimately, it feels like the best category is \"Hardware,\" considering the context of equipment allocation.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nFor classifying this IT ticket, \"Hardware\" suits the need since it's about equipment like monitors. \"Purchase\" would fit if there were a request to buy, but the focus here is on allocation and deployment. So, I think \"Hardware\" is the right category. The format requires a JSON output for the category, so I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It\u2019s straightforward, keeping it clear and concise without any extra text."
