The user\u2019s message indicates they\u2019re having trouble with timecard rejection, which seems to be an issue with the HR or timekeeping system. I think it fits best under \"HR Support,\" but it could also go under \"Administrative rights\" if it involves permission issues.**Categorizing the timecard issue**\n\nThe user is seeking help with rejecting a timecard that includes sick leave, suggesting that there may be a system rule preventing the rejection. This situation doesn't fall under hardware, storage, purchase, or specific access issues, although permission problems might relate to \"Access.\" Given that it involves HR processes, I believe \"HR Support\" is the best fitting category.
