I think it fits best under \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d since it involves privileged rights and account management.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe content I have seems quite chaotic, but it mentions urban access, admin accounts, and process details for leavers. It's primarily focused on revoking access, removing memberships, and disabling accounts. This all indicates it's related to access provisioning and deprovisioning. I believe the best category for this ticket should be \"Access,\" given the emphasis on user access and management. But I also wonder if it could fit under \"Administrative rights\" due to the mention of specific rights.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
