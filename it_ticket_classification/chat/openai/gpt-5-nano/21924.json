This makes it seem most appropriate for HR Support, as it's about job title changes and related processes. However, I wonder if it could also fall under Administrative rights since it involves permissions. \u201cInternal Project\u201d might be relevant too, depending on how it relates to project mapping. Ultimately, HR seems like the best fit.**Selecting HR Support category**\n\nIt looks like this ticket should fall under the \"HR Support\" category since it involves job titles, mapping, and grades. The available categories include Hardware, Access, Miscellaneous, and others, but HR Support makes the most sense here. I'll need to respond with a JSON-like object that has a \"category\" key. \n\nSo, the response will simply be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It's important to keep it clean and straightforward without any extra text."
