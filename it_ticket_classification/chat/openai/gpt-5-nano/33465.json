Based on the categories in the schema, it seems the best fit would be \"Hardware\" since that covers physical issues like network cables. \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback if I can't determine a clear category. Let's classify it!**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned \"network cable\" and \"newly assigned,\" which likely refers to physically installing or wiring a network cable for a new user. There\u2019s no mention of access credentials, so I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Hardware.\" The reference to \"Tuesday July PM\" might indicate scheduling, but the main focus is on the network cable issue. I need to format my response as a JSON object that specifies the category. So I\u2019ll respond with: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
