They seem to refer to a Statement of Work (SOW) and ask for help urgently. Their grammar is a bit unclear, so it\u2019s hard to pinpoint their exact issue. It looks like the problems might relate to access or permissions. There's a possibility that \"administrative rights\" could be relevant if restrictions are causing the upload failures. However, the error indicates it\u2019s not about limits on storage or indexing.**Creating category JSON object**\n\nI need to output a JSON-like structure for categorizing the user's request. Since it's about access related to uploading, I've chosen \"Access\" as the appropriate category. The response format should simply be a JSON object with a \"category\" property.\n\nFollowing the guidelines, I\u2019ll ensure there's no extra content or unnecessary text. So, the final output will just be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I think this keeps it clean and straightforward for the user!"
