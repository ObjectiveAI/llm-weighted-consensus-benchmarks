It appears to describe an issue when trying to raise purchase requests in Fusion, specifically related to a stationary branded backpack. The user is seeking advice on how to resolve this problem. It mentions the importance of the issue being high and indicates an ongoing improvement exercise in Fusion categories. I think I\u2019ll flag this as a request for support regarding purchase requests.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing phrases from the user's message, like \"issue when raising category stationary branded backpack\" and \"raising new purchase requests.\" It seems clear this ticket pertains to purchase requests, which would fit well under the \"Purchase\" category. I\u2019ll consider other categories, but none seem as relevant. I'll definitely categorize it as \"Purchase.\" I'll respond with a JSON object indicating this category. It\u2019s important to follow the prompt correctly and deliver the expected output!**Creating JSON Output**\n\nI need to format my response as a JSON-like object with a \"category\" field, specifically indicating \"Purchase\". According to the required format, the final output should look like this: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. There\u2019s no need to add any extra details; I just have to ensure the JSON is correctly formatted. Alright, let's go ahead and return: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I think that sums it up nicely!"
