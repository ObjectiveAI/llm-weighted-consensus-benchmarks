The provided snippet suggests it's related to hardware, so \"Hardware\" seems like the right choice. However, it could also fit under \"Purchase.\" I'll go with \"Hardware\" since that's more commonly used for requests like this. My output will be a JSON object indicating the category, formatted correctly as required.**Deciding on IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the request: \u201cnew monitor needed Wednesday pm\u2026\u201d This seems like an end-user request, suggesting a new monitor rather than a fix, so it could imply a procurement need. While \"Purchase\" fits for ordering, \"Hardware\" is more appropriate for device-related issues. Since the user is asking for a new monitor, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll ensure to format the output as a JSON object with \"category\" specified correctly.**Generating JSON output**\n\nSometimes, I realize the user just wants to supply the value for \"category.\" The schema indicates that the output should be a JSON object. To keep it simple and aligned with the requirements, I'll produce the output as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I need to focus on providing exactly what they need without adding any extra commentary. Let's proceed with that format, ensuring clarity and correctness!"
