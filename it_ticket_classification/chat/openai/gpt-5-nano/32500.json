The predefined categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and so on. Since the ticket discusses certificates, it's likely related to SSL/TLS management. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no category for \"Networking\" or \"Software.\" The best fits seem to be \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or possibly \"Internal Project.\" It might also relate to procurement, but I think \"Miscellaneous\" fits better overall.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for the IT ticket. Options like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Storage\" don\u2019t fit well. \"Internal Project\" could cover certificate rotation in a staging environment, while \"Miscellaneous\" is more generic. The user asked for categorization, and the text mentions \"stage certificate\" and \"wildcard certificate,\" suggesting it might relate to SSL certificates. I think \"Internal Project\" is the best choice since it pertains to tasks related to a project. If I'm uncertain, I can always default to \"Miscellaneous\" for safety.**Selecting the category**\n\nI'm deciding on the best category for the ticket. \"Internal Project\" seems appropriate because it involves a staging environment and certificates for a project. I also considered \"Purchase\" if the user is requesting to buy a wildcard certificate, but the text isn't clear about that; it seems more like a request for help. \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they're seeking admin privileges, but it's ambiguous. So, I\u2019ll stick with \"Internal Project\" and output it in JSON format as required. Here's the output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
