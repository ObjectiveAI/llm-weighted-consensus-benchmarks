The ticket seems a bit jumbled, but it\u2019s clear that it relates to onboarding. Since it mentions \"new starter\", I think it might be related to the Access category, especially since it refers to someone who likely needs system access. The phrase could relate to a Romanian greeting, but I'm not entirely sure. So, Access seems like a sensible choice!**Deciding on ticket categories**\n\nI think we should categorize the ticket as \"Access\" since it\u2019s about a \"new starter\" needing access rights. However, there's also \"Administrative rights,\" which is a subcategory of Access, and that could be relevant if the ticket is about admin access. It's a tough call! The phrase \"new starter\" in Bucharest confirms it\u2019s likely about account provisioning. I notice some Romanian language in there, which adds to the complexity but makes me think it\u2019s focused on access for this new starter.**Structuring the response**\n\nIt looks like the ticket is likely about setting up access for a new starter, involving the \"administration officer.\" While it initially seemed to fit \"Administrative rights,\" I think \"Access\" is a more general and appropriate category for this situation. The user needs the JSON format for categorization, and I've got that covered!\n\nI\u2019ll format it correctly, following the expected schema, and just keep it concise as follows:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
