The user\u2019s ticket requests changes for specific values, which doesn\u2019t seem to involve hardware, HR, access, or purchasing. It might be related to an internal project or could be classified as Miscellaneous if it doesn\u2019t fit elsewhere. There\u2019s a possibility it could involve Administrative rights if permissions are needed.**Selecting the best category**\n\nI need to determine the right category for a ticket that involves changing some values, like adding \"saxons\" and renaming \"celts,\" \"vikings,\" and \"samurai.\" This seems related to modifying an application or dataset. I\u2019m leaning toward \"Internal Project\" since it involves a development change, but it could also fit under \"Miscellaneous\" if it doesn't quite match. There's a mention of \"analyst,\" suggesting this might be a help desk request for implementing changes. Access doesn't seem applicable here.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe user wants to test the changes mentioned, so I need to categorize the request as either \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit since it\u2019s more precise. I'll respond with the required JSON format, ensuring it has the property \"category\" with the value \"Internal Project.\" It\u2019s crucial to stick to the allowed values exactly, so my output will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nNo extra text is needed!"
