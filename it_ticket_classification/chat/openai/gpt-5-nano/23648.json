This request looks more like an HR onboarding issue than IT. The category \u201cHR Support\u201d isn\u2019t available in the list. \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d wouldn't apply either. I\u2019m thinking \u201cAccess\u201d could be relevant since this involves filling out a starter form for IT onboarding.**Identifying ticket category**\n\nI'm trying to figure out how to categorize this IT ticket. It seems like the user is asking for assistance with a starter form, which likely relates to onboarding a new employee. While \u201cAccess\u201d could fit if they need system access, the phrasing suggests they need help filling out the form. \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d doesn't seem to apply here. I\u2019m leaning toward \u201cAccess\u201d since this involves granting access as part of the onboarding process.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019ve determined that the best category for this ticket is \u201cAccess\u201d since it\u2019s regarding user access provisioning. Other categories like \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d don't apply here. Here\u2019s the breakdown of typical categories: Hardware for devices, Access for provisioning, and a few others, but HR Support isn\u2019t listed. Since the instruction is to categorize this IT ticket, I\u2019m going to respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
