I need to categorize this into one of the specified categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. \n\nI\u2019m thinking HR Support might fit since it discusses leave details and personal mailbox. However, there are also aspects that could fit under Administrative rights. I\u2019ll analyze it closely now!**Analyzing leaver form content**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a messy array of content that revolves around a leaver form for things like leave dates, access, and mailbox rights. It seems to relate to the IT offboarding process and involves removing access and rights as an employee leaves. Since it highlights access rights, AD rights, and mailbox details, I think the \"Access\" category fits the best. While \"HR Support\" could apply to aspects of the leaver form, the focus leans more toward IT tasks.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
