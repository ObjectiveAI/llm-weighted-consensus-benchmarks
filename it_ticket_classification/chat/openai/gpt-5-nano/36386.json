I\u2019ll determine the most fitting category, like \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" based on the details provided in the ticket.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nThe details in the ticket mention issues related to workflow and triggers, which indicates it's about an internal project. Given the available options, the most appropriate category is \"Internal Project.\" So I need to ensure my response is in the correct JSON format that includes a \"category\" property. I\u2019ll keep it concise: the output should be a JSON object formatted as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let's stick to that without any extra commentary."
