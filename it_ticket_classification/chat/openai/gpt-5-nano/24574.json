The instruction outlines possible categories such as \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and more. The ticket involves monitor installation and mentions aspects like purchase order and commercial code, which indicates a focus on hardware procurement. Since it strongly revolves around purchasing monitors, I\u2019ll classify it under the \"Purchase\" category, while acknowledging the installation aspect as well.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI need to output a JSON object with a category field based on the provided schema. The category should be one of the enumerated types like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. In this case, I'll format it as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.\n\nI\u2019ll ensure the final output is just the JSON content without extra commentary. While I considered whether \"Hardware\" might fit due to the installation aspect, the main focus is on purchasing monitors, which justifies my choice of \"Purchase.\" So, that\u2019s the final output!"
