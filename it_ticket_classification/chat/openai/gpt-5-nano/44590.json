The available categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. The ticket mentions issues with server access, specifically asking for access addresses and port numbers.\n\nGiven that it directly pertains to accessing a server, \"Access\" seems like the right category. While there could be some connection to \"Administrative rights,\" the main focus is clearly about gaining access. So, I\u2019m confident in choosing \"Access\" for this ticket.**Formatting response as JSON**\n\nI see that we need to respond with just a JSON object for this IT ticket categorization task. The prompt indicates a specific format, which includes a category schema. \n\nTo reflect the user\u2019s request accurately, I\u2019ll simply output a JSON object with \"category\": \"Access,\" which is clearly the correct category based on the ticket content. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text included, just the JSON as specified. So, it\u2019ll look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
