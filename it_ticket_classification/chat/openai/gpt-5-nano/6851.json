The message mentions \"new purchase\" and discusses an \"Apple SE\" or \"Apple Plus,\" which suggests it's related to purchasing a new device. \n\nI should choose from categories like Hardware, Purchase, or Miscellaneous. Given the content, it looks most fitting to classify it under Purchase, especially since the user is referring to order details and receipts. That seems like the best fit!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI see that the ticket discusses a \"new purchase\" and mentions things like \"purchase order\" and \"log allocation,\" which hints it's related to hardware procurement. The categories are Purchase and Hardware. I need to decide which fits better. Given the focus on procurement and receipts, it seems more accurate to classify it under Purchase. \n\nI'll finalize it by crafting a JSON object with \"Purchase\" as the category. That aligns well with the intent of the ticket!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
