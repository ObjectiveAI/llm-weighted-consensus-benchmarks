The user mentions problems getting correct results when searching for computers, while other users have no issues. They\u2019ve tried different browsers and cleared their cache. The phrase \"hi can call be booked\" suggests they might be asking about arranging a call. It looks like this ticket relates to an asset management search issue, so I think it fits best under \"Miscellaneous.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis ticket is related to search results, indicating a software issue rather than hardware failure. The options are limited since there aren't categories for \"Software\" or \"IT Support.\" It could be categorized as \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but since the user mentions issues with search functionality in an asset management portal, I think \"Miscellaneous\" fits best. I would classify it as a general IT support ticket about a bug in the search results. So, the final category will be \"Miscellaneous.\"**Formatting ticket category**\n\nThe user instructed me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to respond with a JSON object that includes a \"category\" field. According to the allowed categories, \"Miscellaneous\" fits best for this issue. While I could provide some rationale, the user didn't specifically request an explanation. Therefore, I\u2019ll keep it concise and just provide the category in the correct format.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
