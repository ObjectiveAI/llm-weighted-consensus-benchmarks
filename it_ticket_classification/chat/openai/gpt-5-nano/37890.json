They mention analyst positions that have expired but are still posted. The request is to remove these postings without closing them. This sounds related to HR Support since it deals with recruitment. I'll select HR Support as the most fitting category for this ticket to help address their concern effectively.**Structuring the Response**\n\nThe user's message refers to an HR recruiting system issue. It seems that categorizing this under \"HR Support\" is fitting. Based on the provided categories, I need to respond using the correct JSON format, which specifies a category field with possible values. I\u2019ll create an object with the category value of \"HR Support\" exactly as stated without any extra text or commentary. So, I\u2019ll respond with:  \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
