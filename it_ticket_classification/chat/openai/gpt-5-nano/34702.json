It seems like a software/database problem, indicating it likely falls under IT support. Our available categories are limited: since there\u2019s no specific \u201cSoftware\u201d category, \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d appears to be the best fit for this general IT issue. Other categories like \u201cAccess,\u201d \u201cHardware,\u201d and \u201cStorage\" don't quite match. So, I'll go with \"Miscellaneous.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket, and I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" since it covers a general IT issue. There\u2019s a mention of \"oracle error\" and a \"sheet,\" which might imply an Excel-related problem. Although \"Administrative rights\" seems like a possibility, for safety, \"Miscellaneous\" seems best here. I need to respond in the required JSON format. So here\u2019s what I\u2019ll output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
