We have several categories available: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The content includes topics like configuring for employees, absence leave, submitting cards, and difficulties with attendance management. It seems to relate most closely to \"HR Support,\" since the ticket addresses issues with submissions and workflows in absence management. It might also fit into \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are needed.**Outputting HR Support Category**\n\nThe main theme is about configuring employees, managing leave or absence requests, and dealing with browser preferences like unblocking Safari. I\u2019m deciding that \"HR Support\" is the best category for this IT ticket. I need to respond with a JSON object in the required format since the prompt specifies, \"Categorize this IT Ticket.\" \n\nThus, I\u2019ll format it correctly: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It's important to stick to just the category without adding anything extra."
