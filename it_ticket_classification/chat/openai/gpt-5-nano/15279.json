It mentions creating code and setting up according to a template, which hints at some sort of development task. This seems to fit best under \"Internal Project.\" However, there's also a mention of \"oracle,\" which could suggest a need for access to an Oracle database, but overall, I think \"Internal Project\" captures the essence of what's being requested here.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIt seems like the ticket falls under \"Internal Project,\" as \"Development\" isn't an option. While \"Access\" could be considered because of the mention of \"Oracle,\" the request is primarily about creating and setting up code based on a template. There's also a vague possibility of \"Administrative rights,\" but that doesn\u2019t seem as relevant here. I'll respond with a JSON object, ensuring it's formatted correctly. So the output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
