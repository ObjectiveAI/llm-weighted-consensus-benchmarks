The message has repetitive phrases about a low satisfaction score and process changes, likely indicating it relates to complaint handling and feedback procedures. I should create a JSON-like object with categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. From what I see, this ticket may fit into \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but it doesn't seem to align with hardware or access issues.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis ticket is focused on process and feedback handling, so \"Administrative rights\" doesn't fit. \"Internal Project\" seems appropriate if it's about an internal procedure, while \"Miscellaneous\" is too broad. The content highlights the need for a process change within IT support operations, so I'll likely go with \"Internal Project.\" I need to respond with a JSON object, setting the category field to \"Internal Project,\" as it aligns with the details shared about feedback handling and process improvement.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
