I\u2019m thinking \"Internal Project\" fits best, but I wonder if \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it involves stopping any processes. If I'm unsure, \"Miscellaneous\" could also work. I'll lean towards \"Internal Project.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe text includes terms like \"announcement,\" \"teams,\" \"upgraded workstation,\" and \"backup,\" which all point to IT operations. It seems clear that \"Internal Project\" is the best fit for this IT ticket. I'll respond with a JSON object, ensuring it follows the required format. They specified to categorize the ticket, so I'll output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI need to make sure the format is correct without any extra commentary. Let's stick to that!"
