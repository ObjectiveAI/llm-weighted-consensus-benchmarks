The phrases like \u201cnew purchase\u201d and \u201cmandatory receipts section\u201d suggest that it fits best under the \"Purchase\" category. Other options like \"Administrative rights\" and \"Miscellaneous\" don\u2019t seem appropriate here. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Purchase\" as the final choice and respond with a JSON object in the specified format.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize this IT ticket and provide the response in a JSON format. The allowed category includes \"Purchase,\" so that's what I'll use.\n\nI\u2019ll respond with `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}` as the final output. It\u2019s important I ensure it\u2019s exactly \"Purchase\" with the capital P since the schema specifies that carefully. Even though I could give a short rationale, it looks like the instruction requests that I just include the category itself. So, I'll stick to that!**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket based on the instruction, and it's clear I shouldn\u2019t add any extra text\u2014just the JSON response. I'll go with `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}` since that seems most fitting based on the mention of \"new purchase.\" \n\nI've considered other categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Hardware,\" but none fit. It looks like the mention of image input capabilities isn\u2019t relevant here, so I\u2019ll focus solely on providing the category."
