The ticket mentions an account being locked and needing access assistance. The categories available include \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Hardware.\" However, since this is primarily an access issue, \"Access\" is the most fitting category. I should respond with a JSON formatted response to clearly state the categorization without extra text. I'll make sure to get that right!\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket as instructed. The output needs to be in a JSON format, specifically a string with the category. I see that \"Administrative rights\" has a space in it and must match exactly as shown in the enum. However, since the issue primarily revolves around access, I'll use \"Access\" precisely as required. I'll make sure to respond clearly without any extra commentary this time!\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
