The provided information mentions starting dates, automation, and updates needing links. I should output a JSON-like object indicating the appropriate category from a predefined list. Considering the content, this seems to fit under HR Support or possibly Internal Project. I\u2019ll have to decide which best captures the essence of the ticket.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe request appears to involve onboarding interns for a \"graduates program\" and \"automation school,\" with possible additional participants. It doesn\u2019t clearly fit hardware, storage, or purchase categories. I\u2019m considering \"Internal Project\" for IT programs or \"HR Support\" for onboarding and training aspects. The ticket mentions preparing interns and requiring links, making \"HR Support\" the closest match. So, I believe it's best to classify this IT ticket under the HR Support category.**Finalizing the JSON output**\n\nIt looks like \"HR Support\" is indeed an allowed category. Other potential options could be \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" but the request hints more at onboarding. Since the ticket's focus is on interns and the graduates program, I need to respond with a JSON object. The format requires me to ensure it's valid for parsing:  \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}  \n\nI\u2019ll print just this JSON object without extra commentary to keep it clean."
