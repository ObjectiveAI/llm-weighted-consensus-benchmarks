Therefore, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and provide a JSON object with just the category field in the response.**Producing JSON output**\n\nI need to create a JSON object that categorizes this IT ticket. The schema specifies it should have a top-level object with a \"category\" field. Given that I\u2019ve decided on \"Internal Project,\" my output will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll ensure it\u2019s properly formatted and that the app only expects the JSON without any extra explanation. It's straightforward, so let's finalize this!"
