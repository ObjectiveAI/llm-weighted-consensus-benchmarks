They want to select from the categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket discusses issues with purchase orders in the Oracle system, specifically related to processing POs and supplier invoices. This clearly aligns with the \"Purchase\" category, which seems to fit best. I don't think \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" apply here.**Outputting JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket and provided related text. I should respond with a JSON object that specifies the category as \"Purchase.\" Based on the required format, I'll create an output that matches the given schema. \n\nI\u2019ll ensure it looks like this: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. Including explanations is tempting, but the instructions clearly state to output only the categorized JSON. So, I\u2019ll stick strictly to that!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
