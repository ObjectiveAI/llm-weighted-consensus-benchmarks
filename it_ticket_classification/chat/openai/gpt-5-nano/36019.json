They repeatedly mention \"cannot connect,\" which points to an access-related problem rather than hardware or storage. The best fit seems to be the \"Access\" category. I\u2019m thinking of responding with a JSON format for the categorized ticket, as specified in the instructions. So, I'll go ahead and prepare the JSON for this.**Formatting IT Ticket Response**\n\nI need to ensure my output matches the required format for the IT ticket. It seems I should provide a JSON object with a \"category\" property. The instruction suggests keeping it simple, so I\u2019ll just respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. While it might be tempting to include a brief explanation, sticking strictly to the JSON format seems safest based on the guidelines. So, that will be my final output. Let's go with that!"
