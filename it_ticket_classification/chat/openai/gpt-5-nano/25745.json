The user\u2019s message is a bit messy, but it seems focused on tracking leaves, absences, and holiday requests. It mentions needing assistance with calendar integration, which suggests HR Support as the best fit. While Administrative rights could apply if they're asking for calendar access, I think HR Support is the most relevant category since it's mainly about absence tracking.**Categorizing HR Support request**\n\nThe user is asking about a process for tracking leaves and adding a calendar for absences. They mention needing to track who is absent and that changes should revert when someone returns. It seems like they want to implement something for managing absences, which aligns best with the \"HR Support\" category. I'll need to respond with an exact JSON format. So, I\u2019ll confirm the category as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It matches the allowed values perfectly!**Providing JSON category**\n\nAlright, it\u2019s clear that I need to provide the exact JSON format for the IT ticket categorization without any extra text. Since the user has requested this be categorized, I\u2019ll go ahead and respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This follows the instructions perfectly, so I think I\u2019ve got it right! Let's move on to the next step."
