The phrasing seems unclear, but it looks like the user wants to add interns to a distribution list for Friday. That means it\u2019s likely related to access since they're asking about message recipients. The wording like \u201cshe receiving messages addressed\u201d suggests they might want an intern to stop receiving messages. Overall, access seems to be the best fit for this category.**Interpreting IT ticket**\n\nI'm looking at the user's IT ticket, which seems to be about adding interns to the all-staff distribution list. They want to grant access rights, categorizing this as \"Access\" since it's related to users receiving messages. It could also fit under Administrative rights if adding users to groups, but \"Access\" seems most appropriate. I should respond with a JSON object reflecting the category, formatted correctly to convey the necessary information. Let\u2019s do that!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
