The string mentions issues like \"unable to submit,\" error messages, and tasks. \n\nLooking through the categories, it could relate to \"Administrative rights\" if it's about permissions or \"Access\" if there are login issues. It might also fit under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" if it deals with project management. \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"HR Support\" don\u2019t seem to apply specifically here.**Analyzing IT Ticket Issues**\n\nIt seems \"Administrative rights\" might relate to being unable to submit tasks, but the text is quite messy. The mention of options to add tasks suggests a software bug, likely in a task management system. There's no explicit category for \"Software\" or \"IT Support,\" so I\u2019m leaning towards \"Internal Project\" because it mentions tasks and coordinators. \"Miscellaneous\" could work for more general issues, and \"Access\" could apply if it\u2019s about permissions. It's tricky to determine the best fit!**Parsing User Issue**\n\nLet\u2019s break down the user\u2019s message: they\u2019re saying they can't submit something and keep encountering errors. They mention options to add tasks for certain days and a \"select coordinator\" field, which might mean the UI isn't working properly. There could also be questions around \"Administrative rights\" related to these tasks. I believe this user issue relates to an internal project management tool, so the most fitting category would be \"Internal Project.\" I should format my response in JSON with the category field!**Formatting the Output**\n\nThe instructions are clear: I need to create a JSON object with a category value from the specified options. The schema indicates I should use one of the predefined categories. So, I\u2019ll output the following JSON: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.\n\nIt's also worth noting that while I could consider adding additional notes, the instructions specifically say to focus on the category alone. Therefore, I\u2019ll stick to this final form and proceed."
