It's important to choose the right category based on the ticket's content. I'll take a look at the details to make sure I'm selecting the most appropriate option to ensure the issue gets addressed efficiently. Let\u2019s get this categorized correctly!**Investigating survey triggers**\n\nThe ticket describes an investigation into surveys generated for an account through generic triggers in October. It references access to a survey instances table, possibly in ServiceNow. The request includes analyzing why surveys were generated and suggests adjusting triggers, like decreasing requirements for desktop and Active Directory, and modifying or replacing specific triggers related to telephony. There\u2019s also mention of ensuring that changes maintain normal operation and confirm coverage rates for upcoming tests. Let\u2019s dive into that!**Categorizing ticket details**\n\nThe ticket is about triggers, access, surveys, and potentially relates to ServiceNow data and automation. I could categorize it as \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The mention of adjustments like adding or removing triggers and activating Active Directory suggests it's more about system configuration than hardware. \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d seems focused on permissions, while \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d covers broader aspects. Overall, I think \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d might be the simplest choice here. Let's finalize that category!**Clarifying ticket category**\n\nThere\u2019s a specific category, \"Access,\" that fits if the ticket relates to accessing the survey instances table in ServiceNow. The request to \"please access survey instances table\" indicates they want to investigate why surveys were generated through generic triggers. So, \"Access\" seems appropriate. However, \"Administrative rights\" involves permissions, as they also request changes to triggers, which are more about administrative actions. I need to weigh these options carefully for the best categorization!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
