It seems quite messy, but there are clear references to an old PC, configured monitors, an LED strip controller board, and a request for minimum requirements. Given these details, it looks like it should fall under the \"Hardware\" category. I\u2019ll wrap up my response with a JSON-like object indicating the category. Here we go: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Categorizing IT Request**\n\nI'm analyzing this content and it seems to be a hardware-related request focused on an old PC, minimum requirements for that machine, linked monitors, and an LED strip controller board. It's definitely about hardware, and while it could relate to an \"Internal Project,\" I think it's safest to classify it as \"Hardware\" since it highlights various hardware components. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} and keep it straightforward. Here we go!"
