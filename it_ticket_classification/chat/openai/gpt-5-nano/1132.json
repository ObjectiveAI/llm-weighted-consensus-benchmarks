Given the focus on network-related tasks, the best fit seems to be \"Internal Project\" for planned works, although \"Miscellaneous\" could work for more general IT tasks. The ticket mainly relates to hardware and network maintenance.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm looking at the IT ticket and realizing the categories don\u2019t specifically include terms like \"Network,\" \"Maintenance,\" or \"IT Operations.\" \"Internal Project\" seems fitting for scheduled work, and \"Hardware\" could apply since it involves wireless controllers. However, since this is about an upgrade and maintenance rather than a purchase, the most logical classifications might be \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Given the format I need to output, it looks like I'll go with {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} but \"Miscellaneous\" could also work.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket content clearly refers to planned works and downtime, relating to IT operations. I\u2019m deciding to categorize it as \"Internal Project\" since it's about a maintenance project that includes downtime. So, my concise response will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI need to be careful to present just the JSON without any extra text, as the instructions specify following the schema strictly. Let\u2019s stick to this format and deliver!"
