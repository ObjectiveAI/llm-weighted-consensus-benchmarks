I\u2019m considering categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Purchase,\" or \"Internal Project.\" The ticket mentions \"approval of internal codes,\" expense report submissions, and card approvals, indicating it's largely about workflow for expenses and approvals.**Analyzing ticket categories**\n\nI'm considering whether this ticket should fall under \"Purchase\" for procurement or \"Administrative rights\" for permissions to approve codes. It mentions \"expense reports\" and \"charged code,\" which relate to finance and purchasing workflows. \"Purchase\" fits procurement better, but \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they want to assign approvals or permissions for submitting expenses. They mention \"please assign\" and \"card approvals,\" which may indicate they're asking about user access rights to approve codes in an IT system.**Interpreting user requests**\n\nThe phrase \"please assign\" might indicate a request to assign a code to someone. The mention of \"currently sitting him\" likely refers to something currently assigned to him. They are discussing \"pm re codes\" and approvals related to expense codes and card approvals. It's a bit messy, but it seems to fit best under \"Purchase\" since it's about expense codes. \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if they're asking for rights to approve expenses, but that's less clear. So, I'll categorize it primarily as \"Purchase.\"**Formatting category output**\n\nI need to provide a multi-label output for the category of the IT ticket. It appears to relate to expense codes and approvals for purchasing, so I'll categorize it as \"Purchase.\" The required format is a JSON object, which should look like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I must ensure it aligns with the schema, without adding any extra words. The classification policy indicates that I should simply return this classification in JSON format, so that's what I'll prepare."
