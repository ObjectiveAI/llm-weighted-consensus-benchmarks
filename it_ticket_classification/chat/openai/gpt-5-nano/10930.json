The content is a bit messy but seems to mention \"external access,\" which could suggest it's about access rights. There are also phrases like \"forms view ribbon\" and \"upcoming leave.\" Given this, it seems most appropriate to classify it under \"Access,\" although \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant if admin rights are being requested. Let's categorize it carefully!**Clarifying IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket seems to be requesting external access on Tuesday evening, possibly to a program. It mentions \"upcoming leave\" which might suggest someone has left. Simplifying things, the best category appears to be \"Access,\" as it relates to external access. \"Administrative rights\" might also fit if it's about elevated permissions. The mention of \"forms view ribbon\" could relate to software features, but \"external access\" is clearer, so I'll categorize it as \"Access\" and respond accordingly!**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI see that the required output format is a JSON-like object with a \"category\" field. The prompt clearly indicates that we need to specify one of the enumerated values. Since the best fit here is \"Access,\" I will format it like this: {\"category\": \"Access\"}.\n\nWhile brief justification could be nice, the format specifies that only the category object is needed. So, I\u2019ll keep it simple and deliver: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra text will be provided!"
