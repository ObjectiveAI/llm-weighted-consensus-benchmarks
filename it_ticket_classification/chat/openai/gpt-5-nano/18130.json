The user's ticket mentions a headset request, so it seems to fit best in the \"Hardware\" category since a headset is a hardware device. However, it could also be considered under \"Purchase\" if they're requesting to buy a headset. Since \"Hardware\" is the more specific category for this context, I'll categorize it as such.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nWithout additional details, I think the request is best categorized as \"Hardware,\" since it's about a headset, which is a hardware device. \"Infrastructure\" appears in the message but seems more like a filler word. The instructions call for a JSON object with the category value. So, I\u2019ll keep it concise and provide the output in the specified format: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. I'll make sure the syntax is correct without adding any extra explanation unless requested."
