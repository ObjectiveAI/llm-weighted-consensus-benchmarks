The user's request to elevate the head of discipline's access rights is likely related to an internal app needing admin rights. I need to decide whether to classify it under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It appears to involve modifying privileges, so I think categorizing it as \"Administrative rights\" is the best choice.**Outputting category JSON**\n\nThe ticket involves granting \"head discipline rights\" and elevating a user to the head discipline level, which requires admin privileges. It references errors, record numbers, templates, and location, so I need to categorize it accurately. I'll prepare the output in the specified JSON format with the \"category\" key. The appropriate category is \"Administrative rights,\" so I\u2019ll produce: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. This approach aligns with the guidelines, and I'll ensure there\u2019s no extra text."
