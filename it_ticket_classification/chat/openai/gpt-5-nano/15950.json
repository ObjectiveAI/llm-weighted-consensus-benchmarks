However, since \"Access\" is more general and could include various access issues, I might lean towards categorizing it under \"Access\" due to the ambiguity in the request's grammar.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe user's request mentions \"remote access\" and \"please give rights,\" indicating they need access on Wednesday PM for what could be a Microsoft Dynamics user. Since it involves granting permissions, I should categorize this as \"Access\" or more specifically \"Administrative rights.\" Given that it pertains to granting rights and permissions, it seems more fitting to select \"Administrative rights.\" Finally, I need to format my response as a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
