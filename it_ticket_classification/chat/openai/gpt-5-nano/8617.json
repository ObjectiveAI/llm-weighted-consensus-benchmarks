The allowed categories are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. \n\nIt seems like they're requesting a physical cooler, which could fit under Hardware. It also might fall under Purchase since they want to procure coolers. However, the typical classification for such requests is Hardware. I\u2019ll categorize this ticket under Hardware.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user submitted the ticket: \"cooler for team cooler dear please assign coolers thank kind regards country.\" It seems like they're asking to assign physical coolers, which could indicate a hardware request that involves purchasing. There's a \"Purchase\" category for buying hardware, but it sounds more like asset management or provisioning. Given the ambiguity, \"Hardware\" feels like the safest category to assign. So, I\u2019ll prepare to output this in JSON format as instructed.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
