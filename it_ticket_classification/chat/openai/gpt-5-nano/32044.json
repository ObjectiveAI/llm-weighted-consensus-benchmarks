It seems they\u2019re asking for access to Friday PM technical interviewers and a link to materials for Thursday PM interviewers, including technical evaluator documents. They also mention concerns about overloading colleagues. This seems like a task that could fit into a few categories like Access or HR Support. My goal is to assign the most appropriate category for this request.**Categorizing IT ticket content**\n\nI\u2019m examining the user's content regarding access to interviewers and links to documents. The term \"AD view ribbon\" likely refers to \"Active Directory view ribbon.\" Since the focus is on access and resources for technical interviewers, I think the best categories are \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" both tied to permissions. However, considering the mention of \"technical interviewers,\" it also leans toward HR-related issues. So \u201cHR Support\u201d seems like a fitting choice given the context.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI think the user wants me to categorize an IT ticket related to access to \"technical interviewers.\" The best choice seems to be \"Access,\" especially since they mention it explicitly at the start. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply, \"Access\" fits better. I\u2019ll respond using the specified JSON format for the category. So, I\u2019ll output {\"category\": \"Access\"}. It looks like I\u2019ll keep it concise to match the instructions.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
