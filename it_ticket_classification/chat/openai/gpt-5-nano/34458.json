I\u2019ll go ahead and format the response in JSON: {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}, keeping it concise as instructed.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nThe required output is a JSON object with the key \"category.\" I\u2019ll make sure to format it correctly and use the exact enumeration, which is \"Miscellaneous\" with a capital M. The instruction is clear: I just need to categorize the IT ticket without any extra explanation. So, I\u2019ll simply respond with the object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Alright, let\u2019s deliver it!"
