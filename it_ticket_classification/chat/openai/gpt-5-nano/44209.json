It seems they\u2019ve recently changed setups, connecting a desktop monitor to a laptop. After evaluating the available categories, this issue clearly relates to hardware. It can\u2019t be about Storage or an Internal Project, so the best fit is definitely Hardware, likely involving either the monitor or the video cable.**Outputting IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to create a JSON object following the specified schema. The appropriate category is clearly \"Hardware,\" based on the description of the second monitor turning black and loss of video signal. I should ensure I format the output correctly according to the instructions. So, I'll present the result as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} with no extra commentary. This keeps it clean and straightforward for the user."
