It appears they\u2019re asking for a category from a list. The ticket mentions annual leave and timecard processes, like amendments and approvals. Given that it relates to HR processes, it seems the best fit would be \"HR Support\" since it specifically deals with timecards and leave. Overall, I\u2019m leaning towards classifying it under that category.**Returning JSON for Ticket**\n\nThe user has requested that I categorize this IT ticket, and the best fit seems to be \"HR Support,\" based on mentions of annual leave, timecards, and amendments. I need to return a JSON object with the category specified. The required output format is pretty clear: it should just be the category without any extra text.
