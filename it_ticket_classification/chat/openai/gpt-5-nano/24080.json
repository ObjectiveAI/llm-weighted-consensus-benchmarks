It mentions \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"updated,\" which makes me think it relates to onboarding a new employee. Terms like \"head testing\" and \"ext\" could suggest that it's part of the project management process or an extension of some kind. Given this context, I think \"HR Support\" fits best since it's about the onboarding process.**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nI see that the category list includes \"Access,\" which might relate to access rights. However, the phrase \"new starter\" strongly suggests it's about the HR onboarding process, possibly referring to an onboarding form. Given this, I believe the best fit is \"HR Support.\" \n\nI need to format this as a JSON object with the required category field. My final output will look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text.**Confirming IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm reviewing if any category other than \"HR Support\" could fit. \"Internal Project\" crosses my mind, especially with the mention of \"starter form updated.\" But since \"new starter\" clearly indicates onboarding, I still think HR Support stands out as the best choice. \n\nThere's a chance it could relate to \"Administrative rights\" if the form is about access requests, but the text doesn't specify that. To play it safe, I'll go with HR Support and respond with the JSON format."
