I think \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category since the message revolves around filling out a maternity leave form. While \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" could also apply if it dealt with accessing a maternity leave system, HR Support fits best for this situation.**Formatting JSON category**\n\nThe category I need to use is \"HR Support,\" which fits perfectly for the IT ticket. I have to format my response as a JSON object. So, it should look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I need to ensure I'm following the correct structure, as specified. There shouldn't be any additional text or confusion about this category. It\u2019s clear this aligns with the given categories, and there's no need to consider \"Miscellaneous\" here.**Selecting category for IT ticket**\n\nThe subject of the ticket is a \"maternity leaver form,\" which relates to HR processes. Although it's not strictly IT, since it concerns a form, I need to categorize it. I have to consider the available options: while \"Admin\" could fit, the correct term is \"Administrative rights.\" Since the other categories don\u2019t apply, like hardware or access, \"HR Support\" is the best choice. So, I\u2019ll finalize with just the JSON: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
