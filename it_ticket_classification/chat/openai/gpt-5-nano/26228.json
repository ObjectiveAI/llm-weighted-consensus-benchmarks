This means the primary focus is on IT infrastructure, specifically virtualization and workstation setup, so I think \u201cInternal Project\u201d is the best fit.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking I could categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it involves planning and creating virtual machines and sites. It could also fit under \"Hardware\" for the servers, but that seems less relevant. The mention of updates and bandwidth suggests a project coordination request. Since it\u2019s primarily about VM creation, the most fitting category is \"Internal Project.\" So, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Providing JSON output**\n\nThe prompt is clear: I need to categorize this IT ticket and output it as a JSON object. The required format specifies a \"category\" field. Based on my reasoning, the best category here is \"Internal Project.\" So, I\u2019ll respond concisely with exactly what\u2019s needed, ensuring no extra text. The final output will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I think I've got this right!"
