It seems that the user is referring to increasing space on a drive, suggesting \u201cStorage\u201d fits best. The mention of \"perform update\" aligns with updating a driver, but \"Storage\" is more precise for this situation.**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on the user\u2019s provided text, which has some typos, like \"driver order perform update.\" It likely should be \"increased space on drive.\" I'm considering if it fits \"Storage,\" \"Hardware,\" or \"Purchase.\" \n\nSince the text suggests a drive space issue, \"Storage\" is the most appropriate category. I\u2019ll format my response using the required JSON schema: \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}\n\nIt might also be useful to briefly explain my reasoning.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
