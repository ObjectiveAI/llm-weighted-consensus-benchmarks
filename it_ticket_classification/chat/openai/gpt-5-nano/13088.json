It seems they're asking about access to an expense report, mentioning \"expense report history,\" \"viewing report,\" and \"had submitted.\" This suggests they might need help accessing a report, so it could fit under \"Access.\" While there are hints of \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights,\" there's no indication of hardware, storage, purchase, or HR-related issues here. It's likely an access-related query.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nIt seems this ticket could fall under \"Administrative rights\" if the user needs permission to access the expense report history. However, given the phrases \"help viewing report\" and \"how,\" it points more toward \"Access,\" which relates to permissions. Since they're asking for assistance with viewing their report, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Access.\" To respond, I need to provide a JSON object with the category specified. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll give:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
