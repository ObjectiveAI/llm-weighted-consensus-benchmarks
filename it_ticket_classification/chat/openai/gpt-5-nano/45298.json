The relevant categories are \"Storage\" for mailbox quotas and storage issues, and possibly \"Access\" for mailbox permissions. However, since the main issue stems from the mailbox being full, it fits best in the \"Storage\" category. I think I\u2019ll label it as \"Storage\" and note it refers to email delivery failure due to mailbox full.**Outputting the IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe prompt asks me to categorize an IT ticket and expects a JSON object. The provided format includes the category field with specific options. I need to ensure my output matches the required JSON schema. So, I should format my answer as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} because it's the appropriate choice from the enumerated options. I'll keep it simple and valid according to the instructions, ensuring it aligns with the expected structure.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
