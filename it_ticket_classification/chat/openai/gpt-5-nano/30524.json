The request is about creating a shared folder urgently, which seems to fall under categories like \"Storage\" or potentially \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" due to the need for permissions. It\u2019s clear that access and storage are key aspects here. Since the focus is on creating a resource, \"Storage\" is likely the best fit. However, \"Access\" could also apply. I'll finalize the appropriate category.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe text indicates a request to create a shared folder for multiple users, which leans towards granting access rights. I think the best category here would be \"Storage,\" since it's all about the shared folder as a resource. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply due to the mention of permissions, I\u2019m sticking with \"Storage\" for simplicity. As for the format, I\u2019ll output the category as a JSON object directly, aligning with the user's request. Here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
