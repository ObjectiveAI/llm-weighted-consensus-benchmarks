The ticket content seems quite messy and confusing, possibly due to transcription errors. It mentions interns and a bulk starter form related to a school, but it\u2019s unclear if it fits into a specific category. I\u2019ll have to carefully analyze the context to ensure proper classification.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe content of the ticket indicates it relates to HR processes for interns, focusing on job titles, a bulk starter form, and testing internship details. Based on this, HR Support seems like the most appropriate category. Categories like Administrative rights or Access don\u2019t fit, as the ticket is tied to onboarding forms. I\u2019ll format the response in the required JSON structure, providing only the essential information, like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
