The categories to choose from are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the context involving lead generation lists and forms, it seems to fit best under \"Internal Project\" since it deals with creating a lead generation list and mentions an attached starter form along with references to other lead generation folks.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m weighing the appropriate category for an IT ticket. The user's message mentions tasks related to a lead generation list and a starter form, which makes it seem suitable for the \"Internal Project\" category. However, I also briefly considered \"Miscellaneous\" if things were unclear. But ultimately, it feels right to define it as \"Internal Project\" since it\u2019s centered on creating a lead generation process. I\u2019ll format the final output accordingly: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
