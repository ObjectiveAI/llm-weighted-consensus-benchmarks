It mentions issues with an Oracle report where task details aren't loading when the project code is absent. So, the ticket seems to fall under a software issue rather than anything hardware-related. From the categories provided\u2014like Hardware, HR Support, and Miscellaneous\u2014it sounds most fitting to categorize it under Miscellaneous since it doesn't directly align with the others.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI'm sorting through how to categorize an IT ticket. Based on the details, it could be \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or even \"Access.\" It doesn\u2019t fit hardware, storage, or purchase categories. Since the issue involves an Oracle report in a project system, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON format for the category, like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I think I\u2019ll keep it simple and avoid extra notes since the user only asked for the category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
