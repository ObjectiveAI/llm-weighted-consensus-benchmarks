I'll lean towards Access or Administrative rights for this one.**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nI realize the category options are focused on IT, not HR. \"Access\" seems like the best fit since the ticket is about accessing Oracle Reports. \"Administrative rights\" might work if they need special permissions to access those reports. The term \"log\" likely refers to \"log in,\" but could also mean \"log a report.\" Given these considerations, I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate category. I'll prepare the JSON response with the category set to \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
