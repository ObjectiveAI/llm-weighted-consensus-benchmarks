Phrases like \"new purchase po\" and \"allocate device\" keep coming up, suggesting it fits into the \"Purchase\" category. It\u2019s about ordering new hardware and assigning devices to users. So, I think \"Purchase\" is the most appropriate choice. Now, I need to format that in a JSON-like structure based on the user's instruction.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nThe prompt is asking for a JSON object, specifically with a category field set to one of the preset options. I\u2019m thinking about whether \"Hardware\" could be more appropriate since the content refers to assigning devices. However, the emphasis on purchase orders suggests that \"Purchase\" aligns better with the procurement process. Since \"PO\" terms are present, I feel confident that \"Purchase\" is the right choice. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
