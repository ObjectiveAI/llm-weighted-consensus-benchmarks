The terms \"expense report,\" \"expense auditor,\" and \"help\" may suggest it's related to finances. However, I can't find a specific \"Finance\" category to use. Looking at the allowed categories, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the best fit since the request is vague and doesn't align neatly with any one category like \"Administrative rights\" or \"HR Support.\"**Categorizing an Expense Report**\n\nThe user's message about needing help with an expense report sounds like they\u2019re trying to route it to the right team. I wonder if it\u2019s \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but they don't mention needing access rights. They just talk about an \"expense report\" and \"auditor.\" Since the mention of \"agile\" seems irrelevant, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best choice for categorization. I need to respond with the correct JSON structure, so I'll ensure it looks like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
