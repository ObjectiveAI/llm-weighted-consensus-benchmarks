The mention of \"phone problem,\" \"ringing,\" and \"change phone ring\" indicates that it's likely a hardware issue. I could consider other categories like \"Administrative rights,\" but that wouldn't fit. Therefore, it seems best to map this ticket to the \"Hardware\" category. \n\nI'll format the response in JSON with the identified category as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m examining the user\u2019s message about a phone problem, which is a bit jumbled but mostly focuses on changing the phone ring tone. I\u2019m considering whether it could be \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d for changing settings, but it seems to lean more towards a hardware issue since it specifically pertains to the phone. I think it's best to categorize this as \u201cHardware.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll stick to just outputting the category without added notes."
