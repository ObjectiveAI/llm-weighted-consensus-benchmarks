The user's message is pretty jumbled, mentioning approval for Friday in July and some issues about a mobile site while requesting a link for an app in the App Store for expense reports. It seems like they are looking for help with accessing something for expense reporting. I need to distill this down into an appropriate category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user mentions \"approval Friday July PM,\" which seems to indicate they want approval for something scheduled that afternoon. They also say \"cannot site mobile rest work fine,\" which is unclear. I think I need to categorize it based on that content. It could relate to \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" They talk about linking to an App Store app, suggesting it's about an expense reporting app. Overall, the ticket is quite ambiguous, and I need to clarify.**Decoding user request**\n\nI\u2019m trying to make sense of the user\u2019s message: \"approval Friday July PM\" seems like a request for approval for something in July. The part \"cannot site mobile rest work fine\" might indicate an issue with the mobile app not functioning, while the rest works fine. They also mention wanting a link to an app in the App Store regarding expense reports. I need to place this ticket into a category like \"Access\" or possibly \"Internal Project,\" since it doesn't relate to hardware issues.**Categorizing the request**\n\nIt looks like the user is dealing with an issue regarding a mobile app not working on site, and they're asking for a link to the App Store. I can classify this under \"Access\" since it seems they're unable to access something on the mobile app, while the rest works fine. Alternatively, it could fit into \"Miscellaneous\" if the request doesn't align neatly with other categories. However, \"Access\" feels like the most suitable classification, given the context of their request.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
