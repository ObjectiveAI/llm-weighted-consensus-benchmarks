Since the user asks for categorization, I should choose \"Purchase\" as the category. \n\nI will output a JSON formatted response with the \"category\" field set to \"Purchase.\" According to the required format, I'll keep it simple and structured, ensuring clarity by providing just what\u2019s needed. Here\u2019s the output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
