It mentions phrases like \"export request,\" \"export date,\" and \"migration.\" I need to categorize this appropriately using one of the specified categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the focus on exports and migration, it seems to fit best under \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll format this as a JSON object for output.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI think this ticket is about exporting data and migration. The mention of \"digital solution architect\" might indicate a role here. It could fall under \"Internal Project,\" especially since it's related to data export tasks. \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" don't quite fit, and \"Storage\" doesn't make sense either. \"Purchase\" is also irrelevant. So I'm deciding on \"Internal Project\" as the best category. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI realize that the output needs to be in JSON format, specifically with the \"category\" property. It looks like I need to provide the exact string \"Internal Project,\" using the same capitalization as specified in the enum. If they were looking for a list, that\u2019s not the case here; I should stick to this specific format. I\u2019ll ensure it\u2019s clear and correct. Time to return the information as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
