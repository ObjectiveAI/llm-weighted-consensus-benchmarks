They also mention \"add station,\" suggesting they want to add a user or workstation. The most fitting category for this ticket seems to be \"Access,\" or maybe \"Administrative rights\" if it involves admin-level access.**Determining the IT ticket category**\n\nThe user is looking to add \"station,\" which might mean adding a computer or device to their account, making it related to access. The potential categories are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the user's request, which seems more about general access rather than admin-level rights, \"Access\" appears to be the best fit. I need to format the response correctly as a JSON object, so I'll return it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. However, I must ensure it follows the specified structure.**Finalizing the JSON response**\n\nIn previous tasks, I'd typically output a string for the category. However, it seems the \"category\" field is crucial for downstream parsing. So, I\u2019ll create a simple JSON object stating that the category is \"Access.\" I\u2019ll ensure this value is one of the valid options. While I considered that \"add station\" might imply hardware, the request emphasizes gaining access, confirming that \"Access\" is indeed the right choice. I\u2019ll keep the response concise by returning just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
