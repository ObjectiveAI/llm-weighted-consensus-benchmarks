It seems like the best choice might be \"Administrative rights,\" as it relates to modifying deletion rules, which require admin access. I could also consider \"Internal Project,\" especially if it's a change request for the ITSM workflow. However, since it feels more like a configuration change rather than a project, I\u2019ll stick with \"Administrative rights\" and provide a brief justification.**Formulating JSON response**\n\nThe \"Response Formats\" indicates that I need to create a JSON object for the category. The correct format is simply:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}  \n\nIt's important to remember that the wrapper expects just the object without any additional information. Though I considered adding a brief justification, the user didn't explicitly ask for it. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and provide just the JSON object with the category, ensuring no extra text is included."
