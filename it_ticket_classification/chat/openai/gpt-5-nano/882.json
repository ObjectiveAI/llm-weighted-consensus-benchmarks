It looks like a request related to onboarding a new employee in Belgrade, possibly involving authorization to hire or account provisioning. The categories available include \"HR Support\" and \"Access.\" Given the references to \"new starter,\" \"attached hire,\" and \"administrator,\" it seems most appropriate to classify this ticket under \"HR Support\" since it pertains to HR processes. However, it could also align with \"Access\" regarding account provisioning.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nThe available categories only include \"HR Support,\" which is good for this situation. The content suggests it's related to a new employee starting in Belgrade in February, and mentions an attached hire document. The user is categorizing this, so I shouldn't think too much about the \"administrator\" mention as they could just be signing off. It seems the best choice for this ticket is \"HR Support\" since it's focused on onboarding, especially regarding access and account provisioning.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nAmong the given categories, \"HR Support\" seems to be the most fitting because this ticket is about a new starter and the hire documentation. However, if the focus is on setting up user accounts, \"Access\" could also work. The mention of \"new starter\" definitely suggests onboarding where access is necessary, but there's no explicit reference to accounts. I lean toward \"HR Support,\" especially since the user specifically asked for categorization. So, I'll output a result indicating this choice.**Outputting category in JSON format**\n\nI need to respond in a JSON format specifying the category for this IT ticket. The tool requires an exact string, and I\u2019ve decided that \"HR Support\" is the best choice since it's about a new starter and hire documentation. While \"Access\" might also fit if provisioning is intended, the clarity of HR involvement leads me to choose \"HR Support.\" So, I'll output it like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
