The user message is a bit jumbled and unclear, but it seems to mention a new purchase order for a mobile device, likely a Google Pixel phone. I see keywords like \"log allocation,\" \"retrieve old device,\" and \"mandatory receipts.\" It's a lot to unpack, but I\u2019ll focus on those key points to guide my categorization.**Analyzing IT Ticket Request**\n\nThe request seems to involve logging allocation and retrieving an old device after receiving a new item. It mentions mandatory receipts and a video link, suggesting it's related to hardware procurement and asset management. I think categorizing it under \"Purchase\" fits best since it\u2019s about a new purchase order and allocation. While \"Hardware\" might apply, it's more about procurement than an issue with hardware itself. Overall, it closely aligns with \"Purchase\" as an asset management task.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m tasked with categorizing the IT ticket, and it looks like \u201cPurchase\u201d is the right choice since it mentions a new purchase and a PO. I need to deliver the output in JSON format, specifically as an object with a \"category\" property of type string. So, I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s correctly formatted as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nI also need to double-check that I stick to the required casing for the enum. Alright, I\u2019m ready to respond!"
