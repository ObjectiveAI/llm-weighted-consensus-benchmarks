The ticket discusses Oracle Fusion, focusing on creating reports, adding members, managing tasks, and user management. Based on the content, it looks like it fits under \"Internal Project\" due to its focus on using an enterprise application. \"Miscellaneous\" could also work, but I think \"Internal Project\" is the clearer choice.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize the IT ticket. \"Internal Project\" might fit since it relates to an internal system, but \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant due to the mention of adding members, implying access issues. The ticket doesn't specifically mention permissions, though. It mentions Oracle Fusion, often used for HR tasks, which might lead to \"HR Support.\" Still, \"Internal Project\" seems like a safe choice. If I'm unsure, \"Miscellaneous\" might work too, but \"Access\" is worth considering because of the focus on task visibility.**Finalizing category for IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like \"Access\" is mainly for login issues, while \"Administrative rights\" relates to admin privileges needed for actions like creating reports or adding members. However, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since the ticket concerns Oracle Fusion in an internal project context, focusing on tasks and reports. It does not pertain to hardware or storage. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and format the response as a JSON object. So it\u2019ll be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
