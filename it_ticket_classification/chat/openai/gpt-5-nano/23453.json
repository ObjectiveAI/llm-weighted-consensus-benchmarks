The user's message focuses on site migration, mentioning the old site, new library link, shared forms, and a migration deadline. It appears to relate to an internal IT ticket about the site migration project, so it might fit under \"Internal Project\" or perhaps \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights.\"**Categorizing IT ticket content**\n\nI\u2019m working with categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Based on the content, it could fit into \u201cAccess\u201d if it\u2019s about permissions for the migrated site, or \u201cAdministrative Rights\u201d if it\u2019s a request for managing the site. It could also be classified under \u201cInternal Project\u201d if the focus is on the migration project. The user's message is really a prompt to organize and triage this information, leading to a JSON output with the appropriate category.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize this IT ticket. The required output format is a JSON object with a specific \"category\" property. From the ticket content, it seems related to site migration, which likely fits under \"Internal Project.\" However, there's also mention of \"Access\" to various elements like the library and shared forms, potentially indicating access issues. Since no explicit requests for admin rights are made, that category doesn\u2019t apply. Therefore, I'll conclude the category as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} and ensure to respond in the requested JSON format.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
