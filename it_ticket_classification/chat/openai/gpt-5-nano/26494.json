The phrase \u201cinfrastructure\u201d at the end definitely points in that direction, suggesting it doesn't fit under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project.\" So, it seems like the right category would be \"Hardware,\" given that it involves the decommissioning of a physical piece of equipment. I'll output this in JSON format.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user keeps mentioning \"communication floor cage decommission,\" and I'm trying to make sense of it. It seems to relate to hardware or infrastructure in IT operations. While \"Storage\" could be a candidate since it sounds like a storage cage, it's actually more about network infrastructure. The absence of an \"Infrastructure\" category means \"Hardware\" fits best since it involves the decommissioning of a physical asset. So, I think I'll categorize this as \"Hardware\" and focus on that for the output.**Providing the output**\n\nThe required output format specifies a JSON object with a single \"category\" key. Based on my reasoning, it seems the best fit is \"Hardware,\" so I\u2019ll go with that. The instructions mention the output might be parsed by code, so I need to stick to just the JSON format and avoid any extra information. I\u2019ll respond simply with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I considered \"Administrative rights\" due to the mention of an attach form, but that doesn't fit here. Final decision made!"
