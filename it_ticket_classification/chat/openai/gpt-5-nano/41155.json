The content isn\u2019t very clear, but I can identify some key phrases like \"shared with you not working,\" \"check her server,\" and \"client side issue.\" Overall, it seems to relate to issues with access, remote work, and server checks. I'll decide based on that context!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm thinking this IT ticket likely fits into the \"Access\" category since it discusses access issues related to shared items and remote access. The phrase \"shared with you not working\" strongly suggests a problem with accessing resources. There are also references to server checks and client updates, reinforcing the access issue. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and make sure to output the required JSON format without any extra text: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
