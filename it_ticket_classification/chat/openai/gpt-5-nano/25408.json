It could really fall into \"Hardware\" since they refer to a power adapter. But there's also a chance it falls under \"Purchase\" if they're asking to procure something. The context isn't super clear, but I'll explore these options to categorize it correctly.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm evaluating this IT ticket and eliminating categories like HR Support, Access, Storage, Internal Project, Administrative rights, and Purchase as relevant options. It seems to center around the \"plug adaptor,\" which fits within the Hardware category. The user message isn't super clear, with several repetitions and references to relocation and timing, but I think Hardware is the best fit. I need to prepare a JSON object to categorize it properly, specifically stating the category as Hardware.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
