However, \"Hardware\" might also be relevant due to memory pressure on the server. I'll respond with the appropriate category in the expected JSON format.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket content highlights issues like resource overload, memory pressure, and various backup-related problems. While \"Hardware\" could fit due to server constraints, \"Storage\" seems more appropriate given the frequent mentions of backups, logs, and available disk space. I need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category according to the allowed enumerations. So, the final response will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I'll make sure the formatting is correct with no extra commentary."
