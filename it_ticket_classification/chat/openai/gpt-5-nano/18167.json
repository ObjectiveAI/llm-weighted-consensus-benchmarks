Looking at the provided categories, it seems like this ticket really fits into the \"Access\" category, since it involves access permissions and requests. I\u2019ll make sure to output it in the requested JSON format as {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Parsing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at this ticket, which mentions access to ServiceNow for colleagues in Belgrade. It feels a bit jumbled, but the main point is about granting access. That leads me to think it fits best in the \"Access\" category, as it involves permissions. There are also mentions of \"joiners\" and \"infrastructure,\" but those seem secondary. So, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access,\" since that's the core request here.**Clarifying access categories**\n\nI realize we need to be specific with categories like \"Administrative rights\" for admin-level access, but in this case, the ticket primarily discusses access to ServiceNow for Belgrade colleagues. There isn't an explicit request for admin rights, so \"Access\" feels more fitting. Now, I must ensure the JSON structure is correct. The required format specifies that I should return a JSON object with the \"category\" property, so I\u2019ll output {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text."
