The message is unclear; it's trying to mention \"oracle app\" and possibly \"controller\". However, without an explicit request for access, categorizing it remains tricky.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" for vague requests, but there are also options like \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" If the ticket concerns an internal Oracle app, it could fit under \"Internal Project.\" The user mentions \"controller,\" which could relate to a specific role in Oracle applications. Since they mention \"Friday December pm,\" it might refer to scheduling. However, I need to assign a category now, so I think \"Access\" is best since it likely pertains to accessing the Oracle application.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
