The request for \"copy accesses\" seems to indicate they want copying rights, possibly related to something in Macedonia\u2014either a location or a specific user. I'll need to classify this under the \"Access\" category since it deals with permissions and user accounts.**Determining service category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out the best service category for this request. It looks like \"Access\" is the most fitting choice, although \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it relates to admin access for Oracle users. The user is requesting rights related to an Oracle user account for Tuesday PM and mentions \"copy accesses,\" which seems to indicate access permissions. Without additional context, I\u2019ll categorize it mainly under \"Access,\" so I'll prepare to respond with a JSON object reflecting that choice.**Formatting response correctly**\n\nI need to format my response according to the provided schema for categorizing the IT ticket. The schema indicates that I should output a JSON object specifically for the \"category\" field, not just a plain string. The response should look something like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. \n\nI just need to ensure that there\u2019s nothing extra included in the response. So, I'll get ready to finalize my response with just that JSON structure: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
