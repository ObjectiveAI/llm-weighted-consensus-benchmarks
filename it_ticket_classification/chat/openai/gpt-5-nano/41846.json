The categories I have to choose from include \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and others. It seems this issue is more about software rather than hardware or permissions, so \"Miscellaneous\" could fit but it's not perfectly clear. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access,\" but I'm wondering if it\u2019s truly the right call since it feels a bit ambiguous.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe category \"Miscellaneous\" seems to fit best for this IT ticket since it's about Excel crashing when opening specific files, indicating a software issue. While \"Access\" could have been considered if it involved file permissions, the user's description suggests the files might be corrupted rather than access-related. So, I'm settling on \"Miscellaneous\" as the appropriate category. Now, I need to prepare the JSON object with just that category. Here\u2019s the output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
