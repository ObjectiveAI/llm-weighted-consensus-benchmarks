The taxonomy includes categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and more. However, the user\u2019s message is quite garbled, repeating phrases about remote assistance and queue rights. It seems to relate to Access or Administrative rights, or possibly Internal Project or Miscellaneous. The repeated request for passing queue rights indicates they're probably looking for help with access issues or administrative privileges. I need to pinpoint this accurately.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket among eight categories, including Hardware, HR Support, and others. The ticket is focused on remote assistance and likely involves needing administrative rights to access or pass a queue. The repeated phrases suggest that \"Administrative rights\" is the most fitting category. Alternatively, \"Access\" could work too, but since the content explicitly mentions \"admin rights,\" I should categorize it as \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nI\u2019ll output the required JSON object to reflect this choice.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
