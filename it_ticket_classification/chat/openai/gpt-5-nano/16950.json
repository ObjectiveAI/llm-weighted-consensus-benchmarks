The message shows they're asking for a starter form to be filled in, which ties to onboarding. \n\nGiven the context, it seems related to HR support or possibly access rights. Looking at the options available, \"HR Support\" stands out as the most appropriate category for this task since it specifically pertains to onboarding.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m weighing the different categories for the IT ticket, considering options like \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access\" based on the user's request. Key phrases like \"starter form\" and \"she join later\" hint toward an onboarding process which typically falls under HR topics. Since the focus is on filling out an onboarding form, \"HR Support\" feels like the most fitting category. Other options like \"Access\" could apply for system entry, but I think \"HR Support\" is the safest choice here.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to craft a JSON-like object for the IT ticket categorization as per the given format. The prompt specifies that I should respond with a category. I\u2019ll structure it as required, focusing on just the category without adding any extra text. \n\nSo, based on my conclusion that \"HR Support\" is the best fit, I\u2019m going to create the final output as: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. It's important to match the exact string to avoid any errors. Let's get that delivered!"
