It seems like they're asking for access, possibly to something called \"Wednesday,\" which could refer to a project or a calendar. They also mention adding an agile survey. Given their request for access, I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate category. However, \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" could also fit, though I believe \"Access\" is the best choice here.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe ticket content is ambiguous, but I think \"Access\" is the best category since it directly mentions access. While \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" are possibilities, they aren't as clear. It seems they might also be requesting admin rights to add an agile survey, but that\u2019s not explicit. The instructions require a JSON response with just the category, so I\u2019ll format it as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's straightforward, with no extra text needed!**Responding with category**\n\nI need to ensure the \"category\" field is a string that matches one of the specified values. In this case, I\u2019ve decided on \"Access\". Now, I'm ready to format the response correctly. I\u2019ll keep it simple and clear, just providing the necessary JSON response. It feels good to make sure that everything is in order, and I'm excited to send back the information! Here we go!"
