It mentions \"request monitor,\" \"change work tower,\" and \"developer work.\" Since it appears to be a request for hardware, I think it fits into the \"Hardware\" category.  \n\nGiven the context, I could also consider it a \"Purchase\" if it focuses on acquiring a monitor. So, my best guess is to follow the format: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}` or `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`, depending on what seems most appropriate.**Categorizing IT Ticket Details**\n\nThe ticket text indicates a request for a monitor with some confusing phrases like \"MD Friday December.\" It seems they want to change or upgrade their workstation too. My goal is to categorize this ticket properly. The relevant categories are \"Hardware\" for physical items like monitors or \"Purchase\" for requests related to acquiring hardware. Since the primary focus is the request for the monitor, I'd likely categorize it as \"Hardware,\" but I could also consider \"Purchase\" if that's how they define it.**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nIn ticket categorization, a request for hardware could fall under \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" The ticket text clearly indicates a \"request for monitor,\" pointing towards a hardware request. I think the best choice here is to categorize it as \"Hardware.\" I need to keep my response clear and concise, following the expected format. So, I\u2019ll provide the answer as a JSON object: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`, without any extra text."
