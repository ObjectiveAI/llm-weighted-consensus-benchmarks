The options are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The sentence is a bit garbled, possibly referring to \"adding a new range.\" It could relate to markdown, medical, or master data. It hints at credit cards, but the rest is unclear. I need to clarify this before deciding on a category.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI'm trying to categorize the IT ticket, and I\u2019m considering the available categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket mentions \"range,\" \"cards,\" and \"imported,\" but it's quite vague. It could relate to a project in progress or something about a database. If I'm unsure, I might default to \"Miscellaneous.\" However, I wonder if it could link to an Internal Project, especially with the mention of \"md.\" It's tricky!**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm exploring another possibility for categorizing this IT ticket. It could refer to adding a new range to \"MD,\" which might mean \"Master Data.\" The mentions of \"cards\" could relate to card readers or hardware, but everything feels ambiguous. Since the standard categories include Access, Hardware, Software, and others, but this ticket doesn\u2019t seem to fit HR or access, I think \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" would work best. Given the data import context, I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" and craft the answer in the required JSON format.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the output format for this task, which involves creating a JSON object with a category property. The format requires that the category must be one of the predefined options. Since we\u2019ve determined \"Internal Project\" is the best fit for the ticket, I should output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.\n\nWhile I considered including a rationale, the user didn\u2019t specifically ask for one, and the instructions emphasize providing just the JSON object. So, I\u2019ll stick to the required output without any extra text."
