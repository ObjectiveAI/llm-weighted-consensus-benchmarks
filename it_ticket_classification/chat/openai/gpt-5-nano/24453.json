This suggests it\u2019s an access request, likely related to their role as \"discipline lead.\" Since they asked for access, it fits the \"Access\" category perfectly among the options available.**Determining access category**\n\nI'm considering if the user needs access or possibly admin rights. The phrase \"new pas\" might refer to \"Power Apps,\" but it strongly indicates access control. The default category is \"Access,\" yet they could need \"Administrative rights\" as a subcategory. The role of \"discipline lead\" might relate to their request. It\u2019s unclear if they specifically want admin rights or just general access, so I'll categorize the ticket as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like object for clarity.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
