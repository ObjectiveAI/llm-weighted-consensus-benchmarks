It clearly relates to access and login credentials, so I think classifying it under \"Access\" is the best choice since it primarily concerns password reset.**Finalizing Category for IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering that this ticket could fit under \"Administrative rights\" since it might be requesting rights. However, since it's primarily about a password reset and access, I\u2019ll go with \"Access.\" The categories we have are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nTo comply with the required output format, I need to provide a JSON object with the selected category. So, I\u2019ll respond simply with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That should meet the expectations!**Determining Access Category**\n\nThe text in the ticket highlights key phrases like \"password reset,\" \"expire today,\" and \"change PC,\" which clearly suggest it\u2019s related to access issues. Given these details, classifying it under \"Access\" makes the most sense. \n\nNow, I\u2019ll respond in the required format by providing a JSON object with the selected category. This way, I can neatly convey the necessary information. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That should fit the expectations perfectly!"
