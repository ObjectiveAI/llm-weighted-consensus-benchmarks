Phrases like \"update records,\" \"titles,\" and \"importance high\" suggest it's related to HR or administrative tasks. The categories I have are \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative Rights,\" but it looks more HR-related because it doesn't mention access credentials. The mention of \"PM\" likely refers to a project manager, so this ticket seems to be for an HR data update.**Finalizing JSON Output**\n\nI need to categorize the ticket, and \"HR Support\" seems like the right choice due to the focus on updating records, titles, and positions. \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t apply here, and \"Internal Project\" isn\u2019t relevant. While \"Miscellaneous\" could work in unclear cases, I feel confident that \"HR Support\" fits best. I\u2019ll format the final output as a JSON object following the required schema, with no extra commentary: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
