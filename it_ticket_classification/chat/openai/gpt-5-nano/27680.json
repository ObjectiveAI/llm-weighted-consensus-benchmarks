I have a list of categories, including Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. Since the ticket is mostly about the approvals workflow and managing vacation requests, it seems most fitting to categorize it under HR Support. Even though there are elements of process, the focus is more on HR-related tasks.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm looking at the IT ticket that mentions \"vacation requests,\" which definitely falls into the HR domain. It seems the clear category for this might be \"HR Support,\" especially since the ticket discusses approvals and approvers. The user wants a straightforward classification, so I\u2019ll finalize it by creating a JSON-like structure. I\u2019ll format it as `{\"category\": \"HR Support\"}` to keep it simple since that's what they requested. There won't be any extra explanations since the focus is just on categorization.**Formatting category response**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to respond with a category object. The output format states that it should match a specific schema. So, I\u2019ll return it like this: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`. I\u2019ll ensure that I use proper JSON quoting, which means no extra spaces are needed between the key and value. Once that's ready, I can deliver it to the user as specified! Let's get this done efficiently."
