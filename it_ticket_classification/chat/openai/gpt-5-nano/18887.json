The ticket text mentions terms related to HR onboarding, like \"new starter\" and \"starter form,\" suggesting it fits into \"HR Support.\" However, it could also relate to \"Access\" since starter forms sometimes involve access rights. Ultimately, \"HR Support\" seems to be the best fit, especially since the user's intent is to categorize it for internal purposes.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether this IT ticket fits into categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" However, those don't seem to apply since there's no explicit request for rights. The mention of \"new starter\" leans towards HR onboarding, making \"HR Support\" a plausible category. While the ticket could relate to \"Access,\" since starter forms can set up accounts, it doesn't mention that. Since it clearly involves filling out a form for onboarding, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support.\"**Outputting JSON Category**\n\nI need to provide the category as a JSON object with the format required by the system. The correct output should be `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}` since the schema indicates that \"category\" is a property with a string value that must match the given enumerated types.\n\nI can confirm that my response needs to be in this structured format, even if sometimes users want a more natural language response. So, I'll make sure I stick to this requirement and respond with exactly `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`.**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether I should offer a rationale for the category selection. However, the instruction is clear: I only need to categorize and not provide explanations unless specifically requested. So, I\u2019ll stick with providing just the category according to the required specifications. \n\nLet's make sure to finalize this and just deliver the category without any additional commentary or rationale since that\u2019s what\u2019s indicated here."
