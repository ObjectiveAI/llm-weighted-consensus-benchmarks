The categories available are \"Access\", \"Administrative rights\", or \"Internal Project\". The phrase \"change approver\" suggests it relates to approval workflows rather than file access. So, I'm leaning towards \"Access\" for permissions changes or \"Administrative rights\" for elevating permissions. It makes sense to classify it under one of these categories given the content of the request.**Determining the IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the right category for this IT ticket. It could relate to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\", but \"Internal Project\" is also an option for project-specific tasks. \"Access\" typically means permissions for approvals, while \"Administrative rights\" refers to higher-level permissions. The user\u2019s request to change an approver indicates it\u2019s about workflow, not admin rights. Given this focus on changing the approver, I\u2019d categorize it as \"Access\", unless it specifically ties to a project, then \"Internal Project\" could be relevant too.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m contemplating whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The user\u2019s request to \"change approver for project pm\" includes a \"holiday approver,\" which indicates a temporary access control for approvals. Since it\u2019s primarily about who can approve tasks, I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object, like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Including a brief explanation might help clarify the decision too!**Finalizing the category output**\n\nThe user requested to categorize the IT ticket, and I need to ensure I only provide the category object. Following the instructions, I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object, like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nI might consider adding a brief rationale for clarity since the instruction mentions that the output may need parsing by code, but I'll keep it minimal to comply with the requirements. Let's go forward with that!"
