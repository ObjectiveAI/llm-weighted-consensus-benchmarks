I should categorize this ticket from the provided options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" etc. It seems most relevant to HR Support since it deals with an employee leaving and access control. I will format the output in a JSON-like format with the selected category.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket mentions automated visibility control and requests actions from an administration officer, which could lean towards \"Administrative rights,\" especially regarding access removal for a leaver. However, repeated requests to \"delete\" suggest they want to remove a leaver form, indicating it relates to an HR process. Given the context, categorizing this as \"HR Support\" seems most fitting. I\u2019ll produce a JSON-like object with the category: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
