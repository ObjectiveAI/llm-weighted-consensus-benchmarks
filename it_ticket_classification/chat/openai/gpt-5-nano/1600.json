The focus seems to be on video broadcasting for Agile Days and various room bookings, including opening and closing ceremonies. I'll consider categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. It feels like this ticket is primarily about IT support for video broadcasting and room arrangements related to the event. So, I'll probably place it under Administrative rights.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating the right category for this IT ticket. It could be \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Hardware,\" or others from the provided list. There are mentions of \"video broadcasting,\" \"test broadcasting,\" and various room bookings, indicating it's about event logistics requiring IT support for Agile Days. While it seems suited for \"Internal Project,\" I wonder if \"Administrative rights\" applies for granting permissions. Then again, if it's about equipment setup, \"Hardware\" might fit too. It\u2019s a bit unclear!**Categorizing Event Broadcasting**\n\nI\u2019m deciding how to categorize this ticket focused on event broadcasting. It looks like \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since it involves Agile Days and mentions \"test broadcasting\" and responsibilities. I consider \"Access\" for system permissions, but it seems more about project management. Room bookings indicate IT coordination rather than hardware. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project.\" I'll need to format the response as a JSON object, resulting in:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
