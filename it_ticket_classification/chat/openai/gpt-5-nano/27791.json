The user seems to be requesting a physical cooler, which could be a computer cooling device. The mention of a \"senior tester engineer\" may indicate the sender's role, but I'm focusing on the request itself. \n\nGiven the context, I believe the best category is \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object with the category specified.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
