I wonder if there are any specific guidelines for categorizing or if it's more about the content of the ticket itself. Let's stay focused and make sure each ticket goes where it needs to!**Interpreting form change request**\n\nThe user shared a long message about a form change focusing on displaying the alias alongside the project name. It seems they're mentioning several aspects, like making descriptions self-explanatory, ensuring visibility for opportunities, and discussing pipeline codes. This looks like it pertains to software development or IT changes in an admin context. I need to grasp the key points to understand the request fully and help with the necessary adjustments!**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user provided details that could fit into the \"Internal Project\" category. I also considered \"Administrative Rights\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" but those don\u2019t really align. The ticket is specifically about form changes to display an alias alongside the project name and pipeline codes. Since it's a request for software development, \"Internal Project\" seems most appropriate. I need to respond with a JSON object indicating this category: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"} to neatly categorize the ticket.**Producing JSON response**\n\nI'm ready to provide the category in a valid JSON format. It needs to be straightforward, containing just the key \"category\" with the value \"Internal Project.\" There's no need for extra commentary in this response. So, I\u2019ll format it precisely as required. My response will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nThat's it! Simple and clean!"
