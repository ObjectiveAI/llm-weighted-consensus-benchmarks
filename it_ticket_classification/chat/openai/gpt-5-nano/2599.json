Given the context, it seems related to onboarding. My options are HR Support, Administrative rights, or Access. Since it's about a new hire and a form, HR Support feels like the best choice, even though \"administration officer\" suggests administrative tasks. However, I think HR Support fits best for onboarding processes.**Deciding on category for IT ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"new starter\" implies onboarding, and the request to fill out a form points towards HR or IT documentation. Since the user is an \"administration officer,\" it might suggest administrative rights, but there's nothing specific about access or login issues. I think the safest category is \"HR Support,\" since it clearly relates to onboarding. As the system requires a JSON output, I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019m checking if I need to explain this, but the prompt only asks for the category.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
