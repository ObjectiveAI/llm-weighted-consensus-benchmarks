It seems to relate mostly to storage concerns, specifically regarding tape backups. While it could also relate to hardware, categorizing it under \"Storage\" is more precise since it's focused on backups and recovery points.**Formatting IT ticket output**\n\nI need to output the categorized IT ticket in a specific JSON-like format. The system asked: \"Categorize this IT Ticket:\" and provided a list of categories. The required format includes a \"category\" field containing an object with a specific string value from an enum array. \n\nSo, my response should be structured like this: {\"category\":{\"category\":\"Storage\"}} if that's the chosen category. I want to ensure I'm presenting this correctly according to the format outlined in the prompt!**Finalizing the IT ticket response**\n\nThe schema indicates the expected format is an object with properties, specifically for the category. I need to provide the value directly without extra explanations. \n\nSo, my final answer will be straightforward and look like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I want to make sure it\u2019s clear and precise, avoiding any unnecessary text since the user just needs the category identified. I'll stick to giving that response directly!"
