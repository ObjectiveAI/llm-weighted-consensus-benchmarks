The string mentions issues with \"spark\" and \"device install,\" which suggests it's related to a video conferencing device, likely Cisco Spark or Webex. \n\nI have a list of categories to choose from like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous\". Given the context of Spark not working and installation, it seems like the appropriate category would be \"Access\". \n\nI'll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Access\"}.**Categorizing IT issue**\n\nThe user describes the issue with \"spark not working,\" \"device install,\" and mentions \"meeting room\" and call capabilities. This points towards a hardware issue related to video conferencing. I think the simplest category is \"Hardware,\" as it directly relates to a device not functioning and needing installation.\n\nI need to format my response strictly as a JSON object that reflects this category. I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. No additional text needed!"
