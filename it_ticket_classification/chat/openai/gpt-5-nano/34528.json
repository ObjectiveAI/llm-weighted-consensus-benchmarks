It mentions maternity leave, direct reports, and submission processes. My categories to consider are: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the reference to maternity leave and HR processes, it seems like this ticket fits best under \"HR Support.\" I need to ensure I'm clear and precise in choosing the right category for effective handling.**Outputting JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nI need to create a JSON object that includes a category field for the IT ticket. The content seems to relate to HR processes, specifically about maternity leave and weekly submissions, leading me to think \"HR Support\" is the right category. I'm sure that this aligns with the allowed categories. I\u2019ll format my response as instructed, ensuring it matches the requirements for a JSON object. So, I\u2019ll respond with:  \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
