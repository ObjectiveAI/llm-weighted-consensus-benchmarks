This way, the ticket can be directed to the appropriate team for resolution. I'm just making sure I get this right so that everything flows smoothly in the process!**Decoding a jumbled IT ticket**\n\nI have this jumbled IT ticket that the user provided, and it contains a whole bunch of phrases like \u201ccareer added to the reports\u201d and \u201cplease help by reports.\u201d It\u2019s really messy and hard to follow, making it difficult for me to figure out the core of the issue. My goal here is to extract the important details and clarify what the user needs so I can assist them effectively without getting lost in the confusion!**Analyzing report details**\n\nThe ticket mentions various terms like \"reports,\" \"details,\" \"prod details,\" and \"storage,\" which suggests it could be about generating or adjusting reports, possibly involving adding columns or sorting storage reports. Since it doesn't touch on hardware, HR, or access, I\u2019m thinking it might fit into \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" However, given the focus on storage and report details, the \"Storage\" category seems the most appropriate, unless it's more about adjusting internal processes.**Preparing JSON for categorization**\n\nThe mention of \"provide exact storage report order\" really points to the \u201cStorage\u201d category, so I need to categorize it as such. I\u2019ll craft the final output in JSON format, ensuring it includes the category as \"Storage.\" The schema requires a specific structure, so my output must match: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}. \n\nThus, I'll deliver:  \n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}**Delivering the category**\n\nThe content I need to provide is just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text. The system is categorizing this IT ticket, but there\u2019s a chance they might prefer \"Miscellaneous\" if there's uncertainty. However, since \"Storage\" is clearly relevant, I\u2019ll go with that. So, I'll answer with the single object and keep it simple and clear. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}."
