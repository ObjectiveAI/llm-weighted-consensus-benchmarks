The user is asking about issues with a leave sheet and terms like \"annual leave\" and \"restricted absence\" suggest it's related to HR or absence management. Given the available categories, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as this seems to fit the user\u2019s request better than other generic options.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm looking at how to categorize this IT ticket. It includes mentions of removing a leave entry and an Oracle error, so it doesn't relate to hardware or storage. The \"HR Support\" category seems most fitting, as the user is asking about leave management. However, \"Access\" could apply if they're facing permission issues. Since it's primarily about removing a leave sheet, I'll go with \"HR Support.\" Now, I need to format the response as a JSON object!{\"category\": \"HR Support\"}"
