I\u2019ll ensure the JSON format is correct, which means I\u2019ll output the top-level object with the property \"category\" assigned to \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\nI\u2019ve checked if \"Storage\" applies, but it seems more about renaming folders and repair tools than a storage issue. I\u2019ll respond with just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Ensuring correct JSON format**\n\nI need to confirm that the \"category\" property value is a string and matches one of the allowed categories. Thankfully, \"Miscellaneous\" is on the list, so that works for my response. I'll stick to providing just the JSON object without any extra commentary. Keeping it straightforward is the goal! I\u2019ll respond accordingly with the correct format to satisfy the user\u2019s request while ensuring compliance with the specifications."
