Since this ticket revolves around hardware purchases, it seems the most fitting category would be \"Purchase\" or possibly \"Hardware.\" I'll proceed with that categorization!**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT Ticket. It leans towards \"Purchase\" since it discusses purchase requisitions and hardware items like a keyboard and monitor. Both \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase\" are relevant, but since the ticket is focused on purchasing, \"Purchase\" seems more appropriate. I\u2019ll craft a concise JSON object with \"category\": \"Purchase\". I must ensure it follows the required format, specifying the category with the correct properties noted in the response instructions.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
