The ticket has a long, messy description focused on creating a new Excel connection for invoicing. It talks about linking code, errors while importing files, and other technical details. This seems tied to IT infrastructure or data integration. It could potentially fit into \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous\" based on its content.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at several categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. This ticket is about creating an Excel connection for invoicing, linking code, and dealing with import errors. Since it mostly revolves around a specific internal project for the Excel connection, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit. Still, \"Miscellaneous\" could work as it\u2019s a mix of elements. I\u2019m also considering \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but those aren\u2019t explicit in the message.**Outputting the category in JSON**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on the details from the ticket, mentioning \"connected location details\" and \"view per models.\" This leads me to categorize it as \"Internal Project\" since it\u2019s all about developing an Excel invoicing connection and related tasks. I need to follow the required JSON format for this output. The structure should simply indicate the category, so I\u2019ll provide it as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I'll keep it concise and straightforward, just delivering what\u2019s needed."
