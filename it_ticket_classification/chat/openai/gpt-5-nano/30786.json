This suggests it could fit under \"Access\" for access rights or potentially \"Administrative rights.\" The mention of the administration officer indicates that they may be involved in granting necessary access. So, Access feels like the best fit.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user needs help with onboarding as a new starter in Bogota, which occurs on Wednesday. While \"HR Support\" would typically handle this, it's not one of the listed categories. \"Access\" seems fitting since it's about the new starter needing access rights, and \"Administrative rights\" may be too specific. The mention of \"complete form joining\" indicates they might be seeking access related to their onboarding. I'll lean towards categorizing it as \"Access\" and create a JSON-like output as requested.{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
