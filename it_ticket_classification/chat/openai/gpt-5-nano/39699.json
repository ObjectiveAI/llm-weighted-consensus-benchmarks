It mentions issues with a cable connection, along with network interference affecting communication. Given the details, it seems to fall under \"Hardware\" since it relates to a physical connection. However, it might also connect to \"Internal Project\" if it's about a test consultant. I should pick the category that best reflects these issues.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering categorizing this IT ticket. The user mentioned a \"test consultant\" and issues with calling, which could suggest \"Miscellaneous.\" However, since it primarily discusses a cable connection and laptop issues, \"Hardware\" seems like the best fit. The categories available are limited, and though \"Access\" could apply, it seems more like a hardware issue regarding the wired connection. I\u2019ll confirm my response in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
