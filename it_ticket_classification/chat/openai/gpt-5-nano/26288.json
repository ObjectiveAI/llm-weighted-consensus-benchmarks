Since \"mini drive\" suggests storage hardware, it makes sense to choose the \"Hardware\" category. It also hints at RAID systems with the mention of \"head,\" but I'm not entirely sure about that. I'll respond with the required JSON object indicating the category as \"Hardware.\" So, my output will be {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe instruction clearly states to categorize the IT ticket, and I have several options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. The mention of \"mini drive\" suggests a connection to hardware storage. I think \"Storage\" fits better since it's directly tied to a drive, even though \"Hardware\" could also be applicable. Considering the text refers to \"drive\" and \"head,\" it seems best to categorize this as \"Storage.\" I'll respond with the JSON: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Confirming JSON Output**\n\nI need to ensure the response contains an object with the \"category\" string that's approved, and \u201cStorage\u201d is indeed on that list. My goal is to keep the answer concise and focused, avoiding any unnecessary commentary. Since the user specifically asked to categorize the IT ticket, it's best to respond simply with the required JSON object. So I\u2019ll go ahead and output: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. This aligns perfectly with the instructions!"
