The request is a bit jumbled, mentioning extensions, investigations, and changes. From the provided categories, \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best for this feature request related to a system change. However, \"Miscellaneous\" could also work, but I'll lean towards \"Internal Project\" since it aligns most closely with the nature of the request.**Choosing a category for the ticket**\n\nI need to pick a category for the ticket about modifying the character limit for client approval comments. Since it\u2019s related to system modifications, \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems like the best fit. The request is clearly not about hardware, storage, access, or HR. After confirming the category, I\u2019ll prepare the output in the required JSON format. It should look like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI\u2019ll keep my response concise and straightforward, without extra explanations.**Formatting the JSON correctly**\n\nI need to ensure that the JSON output is formatted correctly and without any extra text. Given the options, \u201cInternal Project\u201d is the most appropriate category for this ticket, even though \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d could also fit. But let's stick with \u201cInternal Project\u201d since it aligns better with the nature of the request. So, I\u2019ll output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nGot it! Keeping it simple and to the point."
