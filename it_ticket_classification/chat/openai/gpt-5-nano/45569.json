The user mentioned an issue with \u201cleaver tickets\u201d not being generated, which likely ties to HR processes involving an employee leaving. Since it concerns access provisioning or deprovisioning for leavers, the \"Access\" category seems appropriate. However, it could also potentially fit into \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" depending on the exact context. Alright, I'll go with \"Access\" for now!**Creating final JSON object**\n\nI see that the content is about tickets not being generated for leavers, which points to an IT service management issue related to access deprovisioning. The correct category looks like it's \"Access,\" though I briefly considered \"HR Support\" due to the mention of \"leaver tickets.\" However, since this situation primarily affects IT processes, I\u2019ll stick with \"Access.\" \n\nNow, I'll prepare the final JSON-like object with the category set to \"Access\" without extra explanation.
