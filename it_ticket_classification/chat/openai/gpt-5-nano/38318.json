Analyzing the provided text, it seems to relate to an issue with the new starter template and creating a starter using a check request for a license.**Classifying the license request ticket**\n\nI think this ticket is about a license request generated multiple times relating to a \"new starter template.\" The mention of onboarding a new employee suggests a possible connection to HR. Although \"template issue,\" \"starter,\" \"license,\" and \"ticket generated multiple times\" all seem relevant. Among the categories, \"Access\" could fit as it references the license, while \"Administrative rights\" might also apply if it involves user access provisioning. However, \"Purchase\" could work too, given the request item for the license. It's a bit tricky!**Defining the best category for the ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned that the \"ticket generated multiple times\" and it was \"tested multiple times.\" This makes me think about categories, especially \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" If it's about granting permissions for a new starter, that leans toward access rights. \"Access\" might be the best fit since it deals with new starter provisioning and software licenses. The template issue seems relevant here as well. Ultimately, I feel \"Access\" aligns well with onboarding and license management.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I\u2019m thinking the best category is \"Access.\" I need to format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This fits since it relates to a \"new starter template\" and access for software licenses. Even though \"HR Support\" could seem applicable because of onboarding, the ticket is more about IT issues, so \"Access\" is more accurate. Minimal explanation seems best here!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
