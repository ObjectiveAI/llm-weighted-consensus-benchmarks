The ticket references various aspects like \"editing rights,\" \"creating named owner,\" and adding members, which is a bit jumbled but looks like it\u2019s about access and permissions. It suggests granting rights to new members, so it seems to fit best under either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" Since \"Administrative rights\" is also listed, I think that\u2019s the appropriate category for this ticket.**Creating category object**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"new members\" and \"editing rights,\" which clearly fits into \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ve decided to categorize it as such. Now, I need to format my final response as a JSON-like object, since that's what the prompt specifies. Following the required schema, I will output the JSON with \"category\": \"Administrative rights.\" I'll keep it straightforward and minimize any extra text to match the instructions. Here\u2019s the final output:  \n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
