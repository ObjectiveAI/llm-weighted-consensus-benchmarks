However, while \"HR Support\" fits, I realize it's more focused on IT categories. Access rights might come to mind, but it doesn't seem to fit that either. It's a bit tricky!**Determining the category**\n\nI\u2019ve concluded that the ticket should be categorized as \"HR Support\" since it\u2019s about a career change. However, there's a chance it's related to an internal request within the IT department, which could suggest \"Internal Project\" too. The content is a bit all over the place, but ultimately, it seems the best fit is \"HR Support.\" I'll output the JSON object just as instructed, following the required format and ensuring it\u2019s valid. So, here goes: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
