The user's message is a bit jumbled but suggests it relates to project management and code approval, especially with phrases like \u201cbackup approver while holiday.\u201d It looks like it could be about granting access or making temporary changes to the approval flow. I'll focus on categorizing it under Access or Administrative rights based on context.**Choosing the best category**\n\nI need to classify this IT ticket and am considering categories like Access, Administrative rights, or Internal Project. The request involves setting up a backup approver while the project manager is away, which directly relates to permissions for code approvals. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Administrative rights\" since it focuses on granting access for code approval, but \"Access\" could also fit since it pertains to system permissions. Ultimately, I\u2019ll choose the category that best captures the intent: either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\"**Deciding on the category**\n\nThe request seems to involve setting up a backup approver during the project manager's holiday, which relates to granting or modifying approval rights. This definitely falls under \"Administrative rights\" since it concerns who can approve code changes. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON format as required, stating: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. While I could add a brief justification, the main task is to provide the correct category in JSON format according to the schema provided. So, that\u2019s my plan!{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
