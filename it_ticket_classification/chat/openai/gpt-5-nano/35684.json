The potential categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the issue isn't related to hardware, access, or anything else specific, \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d seems the best fit as it's an IT problem that doesn't clearly belong to another category. So, I\u2019ll choose \"Miscellaneous.\"**Formatting Category Response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON payload that contains the category field. The prompt dictates that I should use the specified format for the category JSON. The allowed categories are outlined, and since I determined \"Miscellaneous\" fits best, my response will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}\n\nI want to keep it simple, so I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s minimal extra text. My final answer will consist solely of this JSON output. So, I'll go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
