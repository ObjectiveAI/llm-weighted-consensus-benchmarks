While \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" don\u2019t quite fit, \"Purchase\" seems appropriate. Since it revolves around expense reports, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like object noting the category as \"Purchase.\" So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Confirming JSON Output**\n\nIn previous tasks for categorizing IT tickets, the expected output is a JSON object that indicates the category. The options given are: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since I determined \"Purchase\" is valid, I'll stick with that. The instructions also make it clear that I should provide just the JSON object without any extra text. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
