Given the options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others, I'm trying to find the best fit. The mention of a \"capacity report\" suggests it relates to monitoring. It seems to connect most to \"Storage,\" since capacity typically pertains to storage issues. I\u2019ll lean toward that category, considering the context of the ticket.**Understanding the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the IT ticket that mentions a capacity report for Windows servers. Given the category options, I\u2019m considering if it fits under \"Storage\" since capacity typically relates to disk space. However, it could also relate to CPU/RAM usage. The ticket's phrasing about \"raising\" might imply a process improvement, which makes me think about \"Internal Project\" as a potential category for ongoing work. I\u2019ll lean towards \"Storage\" but keep \"Internal Project\" in mind as well.**Categorizing the capacity report**\n\nI'm reviewing the categories available for this IT ticket about a capacity report on Windows servers. The \"Hardware\" category seems generic and may not fit since the report isn\u2019t about hardware failures. Typically, \"Storage\" is used for capacity reports, and since the focus is on reporting capacity, this may be the better choice. However, there\u2019s also mention of CPU and memory alongside storage. In summary, I\u2019ll decide between \"Storage\" and \"Hardware\" based on this context.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m determining the safest category for this IT ticket, focusing on \"capacity report.\" While \"Storage\" is often used for storage capacity, I realize that for Windows servers, a capacity report might also include CPU and RAM aspects. However, since \"Storage\" is more specific, it seems like the best fit. I'll go ahead and return the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} without any extra commentary, since the user just needs the categorization."
