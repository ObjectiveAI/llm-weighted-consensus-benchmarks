The user provided a string indicating issues with adding an address, stating there\u2019s an error related to an existing linked feature. I see that the categories available include \"Access,\" which seems to fit this case best since the ticket is about access issues. I'll output a JSON object like {\"category\":\"Access\"} to accurately classify the ticket.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think this issue relates to adding an address, possibly an email from Live.com. The user is experiencing an error about an \"existing linked feature disabled,\" suggesting account access problems. I see two possible categories: \"Access,\" which fits well since it's about user permissions, and \"Administrative rights\" if enabling a feature is necessary. Other categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" don't seem relevant. Overall, \u201cAccess\u201d feels like the best option for this situation.**Finalizing category assignment**\n\nThe phrase \"address existing linked feature disabled\" hints at a feature toggle, but it doesn\u2019t connect directly to admin rights. The user's issue seems to involve adding a Live.com email address to their account, which points to an \"Access\" category since it's about user authentication and identity management. So, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" I'll output that in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"} to keep it concise for the user."
