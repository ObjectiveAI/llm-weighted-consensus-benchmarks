However, \"Access\" could also apply since it might involve access provisioning for a new employee. But since the mention of \"starter form\" suggests some administration might be required, I might also consider \"Administrative rights.\" It's clearly not about hardware or storage.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI need to determine the best category for this ticket about filling out a starter form for a new employee, which is HR-related but involves IT systems. I see two potential categories: \"Access\" for provisioning systems or \"HR Support\" for HR queries. Since the request mentions a \"new starter\" and \"starter form,\" it hints at onboarding, but access to systems is essential. Given the context, \"Access\" seems like the most fitting category.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering that \"Administrative rights\" could fit, but the user didn't specifically mention that. So, I think \"Access\" is the right call here. The task is to respond with a JSON-like category object since the prompt asks for categorization. I should keep my response concise and focus on delivering only the necessary information. So, I'll craft the answer as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That's clear and straightforward!"
