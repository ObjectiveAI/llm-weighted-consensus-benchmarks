Since this involves ownership changes, it could fit under \"Administrative rights\" as well. Both categories apply, but I\u2019ll lean towards \"Access\" for this ticket.**Categorizing IT Ticket in JSON**\n\nThis system includes a specific category for \"Administrative rights,\" which fits requests to change admin privileges. Since changing ownership of an AD user relates to security and ownership, I think \"Administrative rights\" is the best category. If that's not an option, \"Access\" would work too. However, based on the provided instruction schema, I should output a JSON object. Therefore, I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. No extra details, just the category."
