The issues mentioned, like filling out the report and functionality of buttons, suggest it's related to software. It seems like it could fall under \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Internal Project.\" There's no mention of hardware problems, so I\u2019ll steer clear of that category. I'll need to select the most fitting option from the list.**Classifying UI issues**\n\nI'm attempting to categorize a ticket related to UI issues with a report form involving the save and close buttons. It might fit under \"Software,\" but looking at the available categories, \"Internal Project\" seems suitable due to its connection to the Agile Manager. \"Miscellaneous\" is too broad, while \"Access\" could apply if it\u2019s related to the input link. Given the context, I\u2019ll lean toward \"Internal Project,\" focusing on the internal reporting feature in the Agile Manager.**Categorizing report issues**\n\nThe user mentioned something about the \"input link open save button,\" which is a bit tricky to interpret. It seems like the save button works, but there might be issues with the open and close buttons. This suggests a problem with the UI of the report form. Since there's no specific \"Software\" category, I'll choose between \"Miscellaneous\" and \"Internal Project.\" Given that it relates to the Agile Manager, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" based on the signature. I'll format this in a JSON object.**Structuring JSON response**\n\nThe user\u2019s message points to issues with the report form in what seems to be an internal Agile Manager tool. Therefore, \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category. The instruction requires us to output in a specific JSON format, which I\u2019ll need to follow closely. It should look like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI should avoid adding any extra text. Just focusing on the structure with the correct capitalization is key here!"
