The mention of \u201cgranted\u201d implies they might be requesting access rights. The user's issue seems to revolve around not being able to retrieve the screen in their environment. Given this context, I believe \"Access\" would be the best category, but \"Administrative rights\" could also apply if it\u2019s about granting access.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm deciding between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The user's ticket about a \"possible granted custom report\" suggests they might be asking for permission to access that report. The mention of \"currently under shared folders\" shows where it's located, while \"unable to retrieve screen\" indicates there's an issue generating the report. I think \"Access\" is the best primary category, and perhaps I should consider labeling \"Administrative rights\" as a secondary category. I need the final output to be JSON format, focusing solely on the category without any additional text."
