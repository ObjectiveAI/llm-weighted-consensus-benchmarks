I\u2019m considering the categories like \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d \u201cHR Support,\u201d \u201cInternal Project,\u201d or \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d Given the focus on employee-related tasks, I'd lean toward either \u201cHR Support\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d Let's aim for clarity as we sort this out!**Refining category selection**\n\nThe categories available are somewhat limited. \"HR Support\" seems to fit best, given the focus on employee details, birthdays, and newcomers. However, the ticket highlights issues like finding details and updating lists, which brings in access or provisioning, but that doesn\u2019t exactly describe it. It looks like they're seeking help with upcoming birthdays and newcomer information. Since the emphasis is on employee-related tasks, categorizing this ticket as \"HR Support\" seems like the right choice!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
