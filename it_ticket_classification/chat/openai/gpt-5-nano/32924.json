Given the context of the request for a setup form from a senior engineer, I'll likely categorize this as \"Storage.\" Still, it's slightly ambiguous!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"cpu storage\" suggests a connection to both hardware and storage. However, since there's a specific \"Storage\" category, it makes sense to categorize it there, especially as the request is clearly about storage needs. The content indicates a new request with a setup form. So, I'm thinking the best JSON format response would be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I want to ensure that I'm using the exact category string from the allowed values. This keeps it clear and straightforward!**Providing Category in JSON**\n\nThe user has asked for a category assignment, and I need to ensure the response is in the right JSON format. The instruction clearly specifies that I should provide a category object with a key of \"category.\" Based on previous reasoning, I'll respond with {\"category\":\"Storage\"} as the concise answer. If there's any ambiguity remaining, I could consider adding a note, but for now, responding with this straightforward JSON is the way to go!"
