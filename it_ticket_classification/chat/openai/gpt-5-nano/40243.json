However, the message is somewhat garbled, making it challenging to determine the precise category. I\u2019ll need to focus on the key aspects mentioned to choose the most appropriate category for the ticket and clarify any confusion.**Identifying IT ticket categories**\n\nThe ticket mentions an \"oracle issue\" with project tasks editing, including problems with visibility and tasks not showing up properly. This suggests a software or application issue related to project management. I think it could fit into categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or perhaps \"Access.\" The focus is mainly on Oracle software and project editing, so it doesn\u2019t align with hardware or HR concerns. It might even be a bug in the internal project management tool, possibly related to Oracle Fusion.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe ticket refers to visibility issues with project tasks, mentioning things like project editing. The user is asking me to investigate where the problem lies, indicating it's likely an application or software issue. Given the context, I think categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" makes sense since it's related to project management tasks. The categories available are somewhat limited, but this one seems fitting. Finally, I'll respond in a JSON-like format to reflect the required category.**Preparing the JSON response**\n\nThe user's prompt asks me to categorize the IT ticket, so I need to create a JSON object with the appropriate category value. Based on our discussions, I\u2019m determining that it should be {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I need to make sure the formatting is precise because there's a specific JSON schema that I must follow. While I could consider \"Miscellaneous\" as an option, \"Internal Project\" seems more accurate for this context. So, I'll finalize and respond with {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
