The user talks about missing time reports, someone leaving for maternity, and updating records. It looks like it refers to HR processes, particularly around time reporting and managing personnel records. Since \"HR Support\" is one of the provided categories and seems to fit best based on the context, I\u2019ll categorize it as such and create a JSON output.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m dealing with an IT ticket that centers on direct reports missing time, maternity leave, and needing to update a person\u2019s record. It definitely relates to HR, especially with mentions of submitting specific dates and tracking total days. So, I\u2019ll select \"HR Support\" as the category. The user instructed me to respond with a JSON format, so I\u2019ll output it as follows without any extra text: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Let's keep it straightforward!"
