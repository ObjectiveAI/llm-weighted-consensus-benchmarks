It seems like a request for hardware, so categorizing it under \"Hardware\" makes sense since it directly mentions hardware components. I could also consider \"Internal Project\" if it's part of a larger setup project.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s request talks about needing a router by Tuesday, mentions specific locations and ports, and asks for an estimate. This clearly indicates a hardware request, so I think the best category is \"Hardware.\" While \"Miscellaneous\" could apply for more general inquiries, sticking with \"Hardware\" fits best. The output needs to be in JSON format, specifically as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text and deliver it exactly as specified."
