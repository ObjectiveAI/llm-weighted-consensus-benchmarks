The description suggests both a replacement request and hardware problems, particularly with the mouse's cursor drifting unexpectedly. Considering all of this, it seems that the most fitting category is \"Hardware.\" \n\nNow, I should format the output as valid JSON, making sure it matches the required schema. That looks straightforward!**Determining IT ticket output format**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket and produce the correct JSON format. The instruction points to presenting just the category, like {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. However, the schema specifies that it should be an object with properties.\n\nSo, it's a bit tricky; I want to ensure I'm adhering to the top-level schema, which includes \"type\" and \"properties.\" But the instruction looks like it\u2019s asking for just the category value. I may need to clarify the output to follow the schema correctly.**Clarifying IT ticket category**\n\nThis is a little confusing. The data model suggests that I should produce the object {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to match the request. While there\u2019s some nuance here \u2014 they might consider \"Purchase\" since a replacement could imply buying a new laptop or mouse \u2014 it seems the main issue is a hardware malfunction.\n\nSince they\u2019re asking for a replacement for a device that\u2019s not working properly, \"Hardware\" remains the best classification. So, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
