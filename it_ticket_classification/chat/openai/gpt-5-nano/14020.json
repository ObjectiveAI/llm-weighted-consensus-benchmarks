It looks like they're requesting to delete something related to \"AM Academy\" on Wednesday PM. I have to decide which category fits best from options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and so forth. Parsing through the content, it seems this ticket might fall under \"Administrative rights\" due to the deletion request. Let's make sure to classify it accurately!**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe user's message points to a request related to \"delete am academy\" and \u201cmigrate content.\u201d It seems like they're concerned with moving content from the academy mailing list to something new, possibly a marketplace. While they're not asking for problem-solving, I need to categorize this ticket appropriately. Given that it revolves around an internal project involving the academy, I believe this fits under \"Internal Project.\" I'll make sure to classify it correctly!**Deciding the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering which category fits best for this IT ticket. It could be \"Storage\" since it mentions migrating content, but that typically relates to data storage issues. The relevant options are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. This request seems more like a project tied to an internal \"academy,\" leading me to categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" \n\nI\u2019ll format that as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I think that\u2019s the right response!"
