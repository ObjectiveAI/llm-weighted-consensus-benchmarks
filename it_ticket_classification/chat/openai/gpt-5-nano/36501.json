The user mentions an issue with entering annual leave into a sheet, which seems to have resulted in a status card error. They can't remove the entry and need help. This seems to revolve around HR-related issues, so I should consider \"HR Support\" as the most fitting category since it's related to leave tracking. Alternatively, \"Administrative rights\" could apply, but HR Support fits best here.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the options for categorizing this IT ticket. While \"Administrative rights\" might fit if it\u2019s about access control, the user\u2019s issue with not being able to remove an entry suggests it\u2019s more about the HR system. They mentioned \"annual leave,\" which definitely leans towards HR. So, I think categorizing it as \"HR Support\" makes the most sense. Now, I should format this final output in a JSON-like structure with the category clearly specified.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
