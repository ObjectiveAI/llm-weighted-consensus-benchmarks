The ticket describes an issue where the user encounters an error while trying to assign a \u201cstory,\u201d likely in a project management tool like Jira. The user notes that this error has been happening for at least a week and asks for screenshots. This clearly indicates a software bug related to user assignment and viewing details.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket. It seems to involve an inability to assign a story because of an error when clicking on the assignee. This might relate to \"Administrative rights\" if it\u2019s a permissions issue. However, it looks like the UI has an error loading the user list, which suggests it's a front-end bug, not hardware-related. The ticket could fit as \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" Since the user is a front-end developer, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" since it pertains to the internal project management tool.**Finalizing category response**\n\nI think this IT ticket is best categorized as \"Internal Project,\" though it could be an access or permissions issue. Since the user specifically asked me to categorize the ticket, I should return a concise JSON response. The required format is clear, with the category field needing to be filled in. So I\u2019ll respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI won\u2019t include additional explanations, as the system expects just this JSON object. Let's keep it minimal and straightforward!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
