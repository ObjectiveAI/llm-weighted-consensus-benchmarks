The text I'm parsing seems to be a bit jumbled, but it\u2019s about a new starter and creating credentials for access. It\u2019s really about onboarding, which touches on Access for accounts. While it might hint at HR support, since it's specifically about user credentials, I think \"Access\" is the best category.**Formatting response in JSON**\n\nI need to respond in the required JSON format, following the instruction to categorize this IT ticket. The category is specified as \"Access,\" so I\u2019ll produce a concise JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. \n\nIt\u2019s important to keep it simple and only provide the category object. I\u2019ve double-checked that \u201cAccess\u201d is indeed the best choice since it\u2019s about new starter credentials. Administrative rights don\u2019t apply here as there\u2019s no mention of admin privileges needed. So, \u201cAccess\u201d it is!"
