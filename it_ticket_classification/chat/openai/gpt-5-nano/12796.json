I'm considering \"Internal Project\" because it focuses on project code management. \"Administrative rights\" might apply if there's an element of permission involved, but it doesn\u2019t seem to fit perfectly. \"Access\" would be more about login issues.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories and ruling out \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Hardware,\" and \"HR Support.\" It looks like \"Internal Project\" fits best because the ticket talks about a new project code and reviewing attached code forms. I need to respond with a JSON format that specifies this category. The correct output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI want to make sure it matches the required capitalization and is just the JSON object, no extra text, to avoid any miscategorization.**Clarifying ticket details**\n\nThe content is a bit messy, mentioning a \"new project code\" and \"revised code forms.\" I\u2019m considering if it could be \"Administrative rights\" concerning access or password codes, but it largely talks about project-related codes. Since it references project code forms and possibly a project manager with \"pm,\" \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best. I just need to keep my response clear and concise, providing only the necessary JSON format without any extras."
