The available categories are things like Hardware, HR Support, and more. Given the content about change management, it seems to align closely with either \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, the existing categories don't cover \"Change Management\" explicitly, so I'll choose the best fit from what's available.**Evaluating the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket is about changes to shared infrastructure and involves client communication, downtime, and the change request process. The category options include things like Hardware and Internal Project. Since this content focuses on internal process changes and client-facing information rather than administrative rights, \"Internal Project\" seems most applicable. I considered \"Administrative rights\" too, but the focus is more on processes and communication rather than granting access, so I\u2019ll go with Internal Project.**Categorizing the IT project**\n\nThe text clearly indicates an internal project related to IT infrastructure changes, mentioning terms like \"shared infra,\" \"change planning,\" \"CR,\" and \"CAB\" tasks. So, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" I need to format the output correctly as a JSON object, with the \"category\" property assigned the value \"Internal Project.\" I'll ensure there\u2019s no extra commentary and that the JSON is properly structured. Let\u2019s get that response ready!"
