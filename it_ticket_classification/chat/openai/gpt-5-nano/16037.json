The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The user's message is messy, but it largely revolves around purchase orders, requisitions, and installations. The most fitting category here seems to be \"Purchase\" due to the repeated mentions of purchase orders and requisition processes. I'll go ahead and prepare the JSON output with \"Purchase\" as the category.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that categorizes the ticket as \"Purchase.\" The required format is straightforward, just a JSON object with {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. It looks like the system expects this structure, so I\u2019ll stick to it. I don\u2019t want to add any extra commentary; it\u2019s better to keep it simple. So the final output will be just that: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. If \"Purchasing\" were mentioned, it would still fit under \"Purchase.\" All set!"
