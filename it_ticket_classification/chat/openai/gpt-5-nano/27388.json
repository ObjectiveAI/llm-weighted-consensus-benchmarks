                    "reasoning": "**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the user's text about \"urgent expenses\", \"android password\", and \"oracle\". It mentions high importance and the need to submit something quickly via an app before leaving for the weekend. It sounds like they're requesting an app for submitting expenses on an Android phone. Given the context, I should consider \"Access\" due to the password mention, but \"Administrative rights\" might fit too since it involves an app installation.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket based on the user\u2019s request about creating an app on their Android phone. The phrase \"please create app his android phone asap\" suggests it may involve app development, which could fall under \"Internal Project.\" However, since it's focused on urgency and submission, it might also relate to a \"Purchase\" if they're requesting app creation. Ultimately, I need to choose the category that fits best for an app related to submitting expenses.**Analyzing ticket category**\n\nThe user wants to create an app on their Android phone to quickly submit expenses, labeling this as urgent since they\u2019re traveling Friday. This sounds like it could fit under the \"Internal Project\" category, as it's about developing a new app. I might also consider \"Administrative rights\" if they need permissions for the installation. While there are mentions of a password, it\u2019s less clear if that\u2019s the main focus. I\u2019ll focus on categorizing it based on the app development nature.**Finalizing ticket classification**\n\nI believe \"Internal Project\" is the best fit for categorizing this IT ticket, especially since the user is asking for app creation on their Android phone urgently. While there are mentions of \"oracle\" and other details, the primary task seems focused on developing the app. I need to respond in a specific format, providing a JSON-like object with the appropriate \"category\" property: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This adheres to the required structure for categorization.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
