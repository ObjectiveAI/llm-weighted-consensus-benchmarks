The ticket describes connection issues tied to assigned addresses and after troubleshooting efforts, it suggests a problem likely related to network access. So, I think the most fitting category is \"Access,\" since it specifically involves network connectivity regarding an assigned address. This aligns with the prompt's structure and category options perfectly!**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering whether the category should be \"Hardware\" since the problem could involve the NIC or cable. However, since the user tried different cables and switches and found that they work for colleagues, it suggests the hardware is functional. The actual issue seems to be related to the IP address or assignment. So, I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate category because it involves access to network resources. I\u2019ll format the output correctly as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Formatting IT ticket category**\n\nThe prompt specifies that I need to categorize the IT ticket and only return the category itself. To be safe, I\u2019ll output just the category as a JSON object, which should look like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The schema suggests a nested format, but since the user's request is for a straightforward category, I think it's best to stick with just \"Access.\" I don't need to add justification here since the task focuses on categorization. So, I\u2019ll go with that!"
