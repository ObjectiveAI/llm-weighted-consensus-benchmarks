The categories I have to choose from are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nThe mentions of \u201cdefault view\u201d and possibly the \u201csn added\u201d (which could relate to a serial number) make me consider Access or Administrative rights since these often pertain to permissions. I'll classify this ticket accordingly.**Parsing Keywords for IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m parsing keywords from the ticket, noting that \u201cservice now\u201d refers to an ITSM platform. Phrases like \u201cview,\u201d \u201cdefault view,\u201d and \u201cshared members\u201d catch my attention. \u201cSN\u201d could mean a serial number or something related to user permissions. I wonder if this is about \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d for modifying default views and managing access. \n\nThe overlap between \u201cAccess\u201d and \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d suggests that \"Access\" might be the right category for user permissions, while \"Administrative rights\" deals with higher privileges.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m examining the available categories for this IT ticket: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the user mentions adding shared members and customizing the default view, it points towards access management and perhaps even administrative rights.\n\nNow, I\u2019m wondering which category fits best: Administrative rights or Access? Administrative rights are a subset of Access, but given the customization aspect, it could possibly fall under Miscellaneous too. It's a bit of a toss-up!**Analyzing the IT Ticket Discussion**\n\nI\u2019m examining the string related to ServiceNow, which includes terms like \u201cview,\u201d \u201cdefault view,\u201d and \u201cshared members.\u201d It seems like the user is looking to add a \u201csenior engineer\u201d to a specific view, which hints at managing access. \n\n\u201cSN\u201d might refer to ServiceNow, suggesting that the ticket is about access or permissions. Since adjusting shared views typically requires admin rights, I think I should categorize it as \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Access\" could also work. It's a bit tricky!**Classifying the IT Ticket**\n\nI'm deciding between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" for this ticket. Since it focuses on adding shared members and modifying the default view\u2014tasks tied to permissions\u2014I think it fits best under \"Administrative rights.\"\n\nNow, I need to ensure I deliver the response in the correct JSON format without any extra text. The output will look like this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. Let's keep it straightforward and deliver just that!"
