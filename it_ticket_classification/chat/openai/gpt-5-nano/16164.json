It could fall under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it also references a board, it might relate to an \"Internal Project.\" Overall, the best fit seems to be \"Access\" based on the explicit request for changing rights.**Determining category for ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"change name board\" suggests that the ticket is about changing a board's name, but the primary issue seems to be access rights. I think \"Administrative rights\" fits better than just \"Access,\" since changing rights on a board involves permissions and possibly administrative actions. This ticket appears to request modifications related to board rights and name. Therefore, I believe \"Administrative rights\" is the most accurate category. Now, I should prepare a JSON response with that category.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI'm making sure to output a JSON object based on the instruction for the category format. It looks like I'll be providing it as plain text. The valid response should be: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. Although I could add a short justification, the user just asked for the category, so it may not be necessary. I'll stick to the required format and simply respond with the category. Here we go with that output!"
