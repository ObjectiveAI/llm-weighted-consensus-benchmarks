I have a block of text from the ticket that provides details. I\u2019ll carefully analyze the text to find clues about which category fits best. By doing this thoroughly, I can ensure the ticket is routed to the right team for resolution. It\u2019s all about getting it right!**Interpreting project code request**\n\nThe text I have is pretty garbled, but it seems to involve creating new project codes and managing existing ones. There's mention of noncommercial codes and tracking client codes better. It looks like some codes were created in a rush and there's frustration about the process, especially with forms that need to be filled out correctly. I need to clarify the details about the codes and the forms to ensure everything is properly addressed.**Categorizing project codes request**\n\nThe text mentions \"two forms\" and \"completed creation form.\" It seems focused on the creation and processing of project codes. I'm trying to figure out if it falls under Administrative Rights or Internal Projects. Since it seems more about workflow improvement in creating project codes, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best fit because it relates to tracking billing. While Administrative Rights could apply if it were about user permissions, the content doesn\u2019t specifically mention needing those permissions. So, I lean toward Internal Project!**Categorizing as Internal Project**\n\nIt looks like creating project codes is an administrative task that might relate to permissions, but there's no explicit request for those rights. So, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best category here. I need to respond in the correct JSON format, so it should be straightforward. Since the user just asked for the category, I should keep it concise and avoid any extra text. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let's get that ready!"
