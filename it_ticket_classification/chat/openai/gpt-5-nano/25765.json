They've mentioned things like \"code requests,\" \"forms,\" and \"PM role,\" which seems a bit confusing, but it hints at needing \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or possibly \"Internal Project.\" The mention of names and setup forms suggests they want specific access or rights. Given all these details, I\u2019ll lean toward \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" as the most likely categories here.**Assigning IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe message is indicating a need for a new project code and mentions high importance regarding code request forms and PM role assignments. This suggests it relates to project management within IT. Categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access\" seem relevant. \"Access\" would be fitting for permissions inquiries, while \"Administrative rights\" applies to admin modifications. Since it's unclear, I\u2019ll categorize the ticket based on this information and provide the most appropriate category in a JSON-like format.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
