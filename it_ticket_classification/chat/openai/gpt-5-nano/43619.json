The ticket content suggests a user wants to block domains related to phishing and fraud. Ideally, a \"Security\" category would fit perfectly, but it's not available. The closest options seem to be \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since \"Access\" relates to access restrictions, it might be the better choice, but \"Miscellaneous\" could also fit.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket references terms like \"block list,\" \"domain added,\" \"fraud,\" and \"phishing,\" hinting at a security incident response. Given the context, I think the best categories are \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access.\" If it's specifically about blocking a domain to prevent access, \"Access\" could work, but it's a bit tricky with the mention of \"anti-block list.\" Since the situation isn't covered by standard IT categories, I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous\" for the category. I'll present that as a JSON object.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
