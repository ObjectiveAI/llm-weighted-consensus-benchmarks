I want to ensure that I'm considering the specifics so that it gets routed correctly. This will help in addressing the issue effectively, ensuring the user gets the support they need!**Interpreting the ticket text**\n\nThe ticket text is quite jumbled, mentioning things like reviewing submission data sheets, modifying views, and issues with columns in Excel. It seems focused on spreadsheet organization, migration of columns, and making changes easier. Given the content, it could fit into categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Access\" since it involves improving the user experience with Excel-connected documents. I want to make sure I categorize this correctly to help resolve the issue efficiently!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering if this ticket falls under \"Administrative Rights\" since it requests the deletion of columns or changes, but it doesn't seem to fit perfectly. Alternatively, it could be \"Internal Project\" if it's regarding a feature request for an SOW review submission sheet. The categories are limited to eight options, which is a bit restricting. It appears to focus on modifying views and columns in Excel, suggesting \"Internal Project\" might be the best choice. Still, I wonder if \"Miscellaneous\" could work as well. I need to make a confident decision!**Categorizing ticket as JSON**\n\nI don't think \"Access\" fits here since there's no mention of a login or permissions needed. \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best choice since it's about an internal project sheet template. Now, I just need to format my response correctly as a JSON object. The prompt specifies that I should provide a \"category\" field. So, I\u2019ll format it as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I'll make sure to keep it as plain text JSON without any extra commentary. Here we go!"
