The categories available include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019m going to structure the output as a JSON object, focusing on which category fits best.\n\nSince there's a mention of installation, \"Miscellaneous\" seems appropriate. I'll prepare the response as a JSON object with \"Miscellaneous\" as the selected category.**Determining category**\n\nI need to decide on the best category for this IT ticket request. The options include \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Access,\" but since this is about installing software and doesn\u2019t explicitly mention any admin rights, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the right fit. I'll present my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. This aligns with the user\u2019s request while following the specified format and avoids confusion. No extra explanations are necessary\u2014just the category!**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to keep formatting light, but since the response essentially needs to be in JSON, I\u2019ll go with that. The category for this IT ticket is definitely \"Miscellaneous,\" so my response will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}\n\nI think that covers all the bases without any unnecessary details. It\u2019s concise and meets the user's request perfectly!"
