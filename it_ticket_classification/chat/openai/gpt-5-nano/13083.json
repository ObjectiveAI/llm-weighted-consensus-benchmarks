There\u2019s uncertainty here, though. Should I categorize it as \"Hardware,\" since this includes possible display problems? Or is it more of a workplace issue? Let\u2019s keep parsing! Maybe it\u2019s about correcting some issues related to displays on Tuesday PM.**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt looks like the message might be talking about \"two employees displays,\" which makes me think it involves correcting display issues with monitors. It probably shouldn't be \"admin rights\" or \"access.\" Based on the repeated mention of \"displays\" and \"correcting,\" this seems more like a hardware problem. \n\nSo, categorizing it as \"Hardware\" makes sense. I should respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That way, it\u2019s clear and straightforward, just as the instructions say!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
