The ticket mentions \"access to Wednesday pm\" and requests to adapt views and resources. The categories to choose from include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context, I think \"Access\" fits best for this ticket since it focuses on resource access. I\u2019ll output the category in a JSON format.**Categorizing Access Request**\n\nThe ticket seems to relate to access on Wednesday PM, and the phrase \"ad cd view ad resources\" might refer to Active Directory, so I\u2019m thinking that \"ad cd\" means AD. The user likely wants access to certain resources and possibly to adapt the view. I\u2019m considering either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" as the category. However, since it\u2019s primarily about gaining access, \"Access\" feels like the most appropriate choice overall.**Categorizing Access Request**\n\nThe ticket reads: \"access to Wednesday pm hello please adapt ad cd view ad resources within kind regards engineer.\" It looks like \"ad\" likely stands for \"Active Directory.\" The user seems to want access provisioning to view certain resources, so I think \"Access\" is the best category here. I'll format the response as a JSON object according to the schema provided. The final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
