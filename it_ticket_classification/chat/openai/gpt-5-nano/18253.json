However, none of the categories explicitly mention password reset, so \"Access\" is the closest fit. I considered \"HR Support,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" but they're not relevant. I need to format the answer like a JSON object, so I'll go with: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nIt\u2019s clear and concise, matching the required format."
