They emphasize \"weekly final pm,\" \"submission needs done weekly,\" and \"please include two.\" It might fit under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" So, I need to consider how to best categorize it based on these clues.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm trying to figure out if this could be a request for inclusion in a distribution list or calendar, considering terms like \"weekly final pm\" and \"inclusion request.\" I need to choose the best category: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nWhile \u201cHR Support\u201d is usually about employee issues, this is an IT ticket. It likely relates to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" especially since it mentions weekly submissions. I need to decide based on how it connects to these terms.**Determining Category Output**\n\nI need to produce a JSON-like category object based on the system's defined format. It specifies that the category should be one of: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nThe text mentions \"inclusion request,\" \"include two,\" and \"weekly submissions.\" It seems like it could relate to including recipients in a report. \"Administrative rights\" could fit if they're asking for admin access for someone. Alternatively, \"Access\" might work too, as it covers granting access for submissions. If I'm uncertain, \"Miscellaneous\" could be a safe fallback, but I should aim for the best fit.**Choosing JSON Category Format**\n\nI think the phrase \"inclusion request\" likely suggests they want to be included in weekly project management updates or reports and possibly include two people. Terms like \u201cofficer weekly\u201d seem to reinforce that idea, indicating they might want access to project management software for those individuals. The mention of \"submission needs done weekly each Friday\" hints at needing to automate submissions, so assigning an \u201cAccess\u201d category feels appropriate. \n\nTherefore, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
