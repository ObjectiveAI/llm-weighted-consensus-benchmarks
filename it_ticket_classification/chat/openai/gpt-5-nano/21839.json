It feels like it could fit under \"HR Support,\" especially since it's about making changes to an HR system. I\u2019m leaning toward that category or possibly \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" But \"HR Support\" seems like the most appropriate choice.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm deciding on the category for this IT ticket, considering \"HR Support\" or \"Internal Project.\" It mentions Oracle, which generally relates to HR systems, but it could also be an implementation task if I'm thinking \"Internal Project.\" However, since it\u2019s really about a leave type in the HR system, \"HR Support\" seems more appropriate. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}, keeping it straightforward without extra explanations."
