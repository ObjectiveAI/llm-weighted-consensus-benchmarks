Given the user's request, \"Administrative rights\" seems the most fitting option.**Deciding on the category**\n\nThis task involves data restoration, but there's no specific \"Data Recovery\" category. The best fit could be \"Administrative rights\" since reverting changes often requires admin privileges. Alternatively, \"Miscellaneous\" might work if it doesn\u2019t fit well elsewhere. \"Access\" could apply to situations involving personal information, but the user specifically wants to roll back changes, which doesn\u2019t directly relate to access requests. Given this clarification, I think I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" and output it as JSON.**Formatting the JSON output**\n\nThe system requires a category for the ticket, and I need to format it correctly as a JSON object. Based on what I've gathered, I'll set it up as follows: it should simply state the category without extra explanation. So, I'll create the JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. It\u2019s crucial to ensure it follows the exact format with proper quotes. Now let\u2019s finalize this response!"
