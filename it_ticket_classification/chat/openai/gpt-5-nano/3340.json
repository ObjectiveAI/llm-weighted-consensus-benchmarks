Considering the context, it seems likely to fall under \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or possibly \"Access.\" I need to choose wisely!**Deciding on Category**\n\nI think this ticket could fall under \"Internal Project\" since it involves a tool for internal use. It might also be \"Administrative rights\" if the user needs those rights to install or configure Confluence. They mention \"installed,\" but the grammar is unclear. This seems to hint at a request for help with Confluence for planning strategic initiatives. I\u2019d lean towards \"Internal Project,\" as it fits better, but \"Access\" might apply if they require access to a Confluence page. It's tricky!**Formatting Category Response**\n\nI'm planning to respond with a category field formatted as a JSON object. The instructions mention a schema that defines the format, but it\u2019s important to create a properly structured response. The category must be one of these options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll output just the category without additional commentary. So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That feels right!"
