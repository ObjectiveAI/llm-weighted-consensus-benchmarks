The mention of \"approver vacation requests\" suggests configuring the system for someone to approve those requests. The specific date references hint at possibly scheduling an approver too. I might categorize this request both as \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access,\" or lean towards designating the approver for vacation requests.**Determining ticket category**\n\nWhen handling IT tickets for tasks like \"set up approver for vacation requests,\" I need to choose between \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access.\" If I'm changing who can approve requests, that's about granting or modifying user permissions, clearly \"Administrative rights.\" However, if it's enabling a feature or granting access to the vacation request system, then it'd be \"Access.\" But since this looks like assigning an approver\u2014basically modifying user roles\u2014I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"Administrative rights.\" So that\u2019s my choice!**Formatting JSON output**\n\nThe expected output should be a JSON object indicating the category, specifically in the format: {\"category\": \"<category name>\"}. Given the instructions, I need to prepare this as {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}. While part of me wants to add an explanation, the user only asked for categorization. The focus here is strictly on that JSON object without any extra text. So I\u2019ll just stick to providing the necessary JSON format: {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}."
