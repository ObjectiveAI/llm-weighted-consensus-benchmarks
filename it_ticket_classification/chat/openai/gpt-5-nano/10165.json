The ticket mentions \"new purchase,\" \"purchase order,\" \"log allocation,\" and \"mandatory receipts.\" It seems to be primarily about a hardware purchase, likely \"over-ear headphones,\" and also involves receipts and allocation of items. The overall content points toward classifying it under the Purchase category.**Determining ticket category**\n\nFor this IT ticket, the relevant category could either be \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware,\" given the mention of \"over-ear headphones.\" However, since it's primarily focused on procurement, \"Purchase\" seems like the best fit. The ticket references a purchase order, log allocation, and required receipts. It sounds like asset allocation is also involved, which further supports the \"Purchase\" categorization. So, I'll categorize it as \"Purchase\" and provide the response in the specified format.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
