The user shared a messy text regarding a leaver process that includes terms like \"access removal,\" \"AD rights,\" and \"mailbox.\" The central theme revolves around revoking access and decommissioning for an employee. Therefore, the best fit is the \"Access\" category, though there's a case for \"Administrative Rights\" too as it involves admin rights removal.**Validating JSON Format**\n\nI believe \"Access\" is the most fitting category for this ticket due to its focus on deprovisioning access. The user prompted me to categorize the IT ticket, so I need to return a proper JSON object. The required format specifies a schema that includes \u201ccategory\u201d as a string. Therefore, my response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra text or formatting issues and confirm that this is valid based on the ticket's content mentioning \"leaver\" and \"AD rights.\"**Finalizing Category Decision**\n\nI\u2019m considering \"Administrative rights\" as another possibility because it relates to specific rights. However, the ticket focuses on the leaver process, which includes removing access, mailbox, and roaming profile. Since \"Access\" is a more general and fitting category here, it makes the most sense. The schema does permit \"Administrative rights,\" but that's not the primary focus of the ticket. So, I\u2019ve confirmed that \"Access\" is indeed the correct category to return."
