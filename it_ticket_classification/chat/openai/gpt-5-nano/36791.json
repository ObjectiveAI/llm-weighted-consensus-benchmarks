The ticket specifically mentions problems connecting to test environments, indicating it's a high-priority access issue. \n\nGiven the provided categories, it looks like \"Access\" is the most fitting one for this situation. So, I'll output a JSON-like object with the category \"Access\" noted. This will match the instruction's format nicely!**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket addresses access issues to test environments, primarily focusing on access control and proxies. Considering the context, the most suitable category appears to be \"Access,\" rather than \"Administrative rights,\" since it\u2019s more about general access. \n\nI\u2019ll structure the response as a JSON object, specifically: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s essential to keep it clean and straightforward, avoiding unnecessary commentary. I think this works perfectly!"
