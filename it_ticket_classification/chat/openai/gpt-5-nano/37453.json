The user asked for categorization of an IT ticket, suggesting that I should just return the category itself rather than the full JSON structure. However, following the system instruction requires presenting the data according to the schema provided. I'll confirm this to make it clear.**Formatting the output**\n\nIn previous tasks, I needed to return just the simple output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. However, the given JSON schema requires a different structure. The tool's valid channels include \"category\" formatted that way. I think the best approach is to provide the required output clearly and simply. So, I\u2019ll just give the JSON format without extra explanation: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That feels straightforward enough!"
