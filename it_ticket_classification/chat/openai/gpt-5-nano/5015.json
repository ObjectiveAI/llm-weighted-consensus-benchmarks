They've mentioned wanting a link to the referral policy and how to accept or decline requests. This suggests it could fit under either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, it seems to align best with \"Access\" since it focuses on gaining access to the policy. It might also touch on \"HR Support\" given the context of the referral policy.**Evaluating IT ticket categories**\n\nI'm sorting through category options for an IT ticket regarding accessing a policy document. There's a mention of \"HR Support\" in the allowed categories, but this request is more about access management. The user is asking for permissions to view the policy and mentions accepting or declining requests. This sounds like it could fit under \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or even \"HR Support.\" Ultimately, the best fit seems to be \"Access\" since it focuses on gaining access to the policy document.**Determining the IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this IT ticket under \"Access\" since it involves generic access requests. The phrase \"accept decline requests\" strongly indicates it's about managing those requests. While there's mention of \"HR Support\" due to the employee referral policy, the user isn\u2019t asking for HR details but rather for access to that policy. So, my conclusion is to categorize it as \"Access.\" I'll format it properly in JSON as requested:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
