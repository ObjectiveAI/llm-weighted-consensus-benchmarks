The ticket discusses visitor card discrepancies, which ties closely to access management. So, I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate category since it involves access badges and user access control. While it might fit \"Hardware\" due to the physical nature of the cards, the primary focus here is access management. Therefore, I'll respond with the category in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
