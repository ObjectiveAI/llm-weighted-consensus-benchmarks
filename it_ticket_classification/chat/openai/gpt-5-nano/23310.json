They mention adding cameras several times, which makes me think this is related to \"Hardware.\" However, I must ensure it aligns with the specifics of the categories provided: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the focus on cameras, it's likely that \"Hardware\" is the best fit, but I want to double-check.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket's content clearly focuses on adding cameras to various PM tickets, splitting them, and assigning them to different queues. It involves updating hardware like cameras and related devices. So, it seems that \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate category. Although I initially considered \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" they don't fit here as closely. I must ensure I respond with the category in the required JSON format, though I\u2019m a bit confused about the instructions.**Responding with JSON Output**\n\nI need to provide the JSON category object based on the schema that specifies the category options. It appears that \"Hardware\" is the right category, so I\u2019ll format my response as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.\n\nThe user simply wants this categorized without any extra text or explanation. It\u2019s important to stick to that simple output format, ensuring that I don\u2019t confuse the instructions or add unnecessary details. Therefore, I'll confidently respond with just: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
