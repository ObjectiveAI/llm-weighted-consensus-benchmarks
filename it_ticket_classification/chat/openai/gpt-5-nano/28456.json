To summarize, I lean towards \"Internal Project\" as the best fit due to the context.**Categorizing an IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket, which includes terms like \"new project git\" and \"setup forms.\" The mention of \"git\" suggests it relates to a Git repository, indicating a new project setup. It makes sense to categorize it as an \"Internal Project\" since it\u2019s about starting something new. However, if the ticket seeks access or administrative rights to Git, then \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" could be considered. So, I\u2019ll likely respond with {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} for clarity.**Finalizing the IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket appears to be focused on starting a new internal project with Git, so categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" feels right. However, I considered \"Administrative rights\" since there's a mention of needing access to create the project, but there's no clear request for those rights. The instruction says to provide a JSON object with the category value, so I\u2019ll structure my response as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Ready to deliver that!"
