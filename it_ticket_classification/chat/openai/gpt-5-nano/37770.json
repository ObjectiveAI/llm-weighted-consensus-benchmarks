The user says to \"Categorize this IT Ticket\" followed by a long text. My goal is to pick the correct category from the list: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I'll carefully read through the ticket to determine which category it fits into best.**Interpreting IT Ticket Details**\n\nThe ticket points to an issue in the underwriter portal where saving a newly created opportunity causes duplicates because of an \"unsaved changes\" message. The user needs to delete unnecessary opportunities while keeping the test opportunity intact, as indicated by the opportunity ID with a forecast overview. This seems to be related to software application issues or data cleanup. The best categories to consider are \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll evaluate which fits best.**Categorizing Software Bug**\n\nIt looks like there's a bug in the software related to the underwriter portal. This issue doesn\u2019t pertain to hardware, access, or other categories like HR or purchase; it more logically fits under \"Internal Project\" since it\u2019s about internal software code. If it doesn't fit neatly, \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback. Since I need to output a JSON structure for the category, it should follow the schema provided: \"category\" as a string type. Let\u2019s get that formatted correctly!**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nThe correct output for the user\u2019s request should be straightforward: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Among the given categories, \"Internal Project\" fits best since it\u2019s about a bug in the underwriter portal. While I considered \"Miscellaneous\" because it deals with test data cleanup and duplication, \"Internal Project\" is still more appropriate here. There\u2019s no need for extra commentary, so I'll keep it simple and stick to just the JSON format. Let\u2019s execute that!"
