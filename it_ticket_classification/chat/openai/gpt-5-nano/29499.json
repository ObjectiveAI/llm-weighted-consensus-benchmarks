The options could be \"Storage\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the user mentioned requesting partitions and implied tasks related to them, \"Storage\" seems to fit best. I should output just the JSON object for clarity, probably like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I want to ensure I follow the instruction to respond in the proper format without extra text.**Finalizing the output**\n\nI\u2019m considering the requirements for the output. The UI likely only needs the category string, but the schema says to return an object with the category. I think the correct output should be {\"category\":\"Storage\"} because the enum specifies \"Storage\" with the right capitalization. I want to make sure I'm crafting this final response accurately to meet the specifications laid out without making any mistakes!"
