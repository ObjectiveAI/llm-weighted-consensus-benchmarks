This seems high priority. The categories available include \"Access\" and \"HR Support.\" Since it\u2019s about job postings, I\u2019ll likely go with \"HR Support\" for this issue as it connects to the human resources system. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"HR Support.\"**Outputting category in JSON format**\n\nI need to provide a JSON-like category object as specified. The format requires me to create an object with a category string from the available options. So, since I've determined this ticket should be categorized as \"HR Support,\" I'll structure it accordingly. \n\nThe final output will be: \n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI need to ensure this complies with the instruction to categorize the IT ticket while keeping it strictly to the required format."
