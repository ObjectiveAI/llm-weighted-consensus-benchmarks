They're clearly requesting a hardware accessory, which leads me to think this falls under \"Hardware.\" However, since they mentioned providing an adapter, it could also be a \"Purchase\" request if they need to buy it. I\u2019m debating which category would be more suitable: the typical classification is \"Hardware\" for requests like this, while \"Purchase\" is for procurement needs. I need to decide which is the best fit.**Determining Category for IT Ticket**\n\nIn IT ticket systems, requests for hardware procurement typically fall under \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" Since the user is asking for an adapter plug outlet, it aligns more with \"Purchase.\" The message is a bit shorthand, but it clearly requests a plug adapter, which strengthens the \"Purchase\" categorization. Now, I need to deliver a concise JSON object, simply stating the category as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} without any extra explanation. Keeping it minimal is key!**Delivering Final Category**\n\nThe instructions say to respond in the final channel with the category, so I just need to produce the exact output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It\u2019s a straightforward task, and I want to make sure I get it right without any extra fuss. Just sticking to what\u2019s required! Here we go, focusing on delivering it precisely as requested. That keeps things neat and clear, which is always a good approach. Alright, let\u2019s do that!"
