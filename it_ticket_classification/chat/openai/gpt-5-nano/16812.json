I think \"HR Support\" fits best since it relates to forms and onboarding processes. However, since it's in an IT context and mentions access setups, \"Access\" could also apply. The ticket doesn't explicitly request access, focusing more on completing the starter form. I'll go with \"HR Support,\" as it seems most accurate based on the wording.**Classifying IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm categorizing an IT ticket for onboarding, which typically uses \"HR Support\" as the category. Given the provided options, I'll select \"HR Support.\" The output needs to be in a JSON format, so I'll ensure it looks like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. The instructions specify just to output the category, so I'll provide only that JSON object without additional information. It feels clear and concise, so I think I've got it right!"
