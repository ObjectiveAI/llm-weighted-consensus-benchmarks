The potential categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and a few others. This situation seems related to a software issue, specifically with a certificate trust problem. Since \"Access\" is more about account access and neither \"Storage\" nor \"Administrative rights\" seem right, I think \"Miscellaneous\" could be the best fit here. The user is a software tester, which adds context.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the error message regarding the proxy server certificate. It appears to be a certificate trust issue, which isn\u2019t fitting neatly into the categories provided. \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the best choice here, since it refers to a software issue rather than hardware. There's also the possibility of categorizing it under \"Access,\" but the specifics about cert trust lead me to prefer \"Miscellaneous.\" I should format my response as a JSON object to match the given schema.**Finalizing IT Ticket Response**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the ticket as \"Miscellaneous\" because the issue relates to a proxy server certificate, which doesn\u2019t fit perfectly into the other categories. While \"Access\" might be a consideration due to potential access issues with Outlook, it feels a bit too generic for this specific problem. Since the instruction emphasizes a JSON format, I will respond with just the JSON object for clarity and parse-safety. Here\u2019s the response: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
