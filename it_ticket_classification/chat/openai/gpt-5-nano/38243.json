The text is a bit jumbled, but it points out the cable isn\u2019t working during meetings while trying to share screens with clients. They\u2019ve tried two different cables and want to change the laptop due to similar problems in other meetings. It sounds like there\u2019s a hardware issue with the conference room cable that IT needs to check out.**Choosing category for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m working on categorizing an IT ticket regarding a non-working cable in a conference room. This clearly falls under the \"Hardware\" category, as it\u2019s an issue with the meeting room equipment. Other categories like \"Purchasing\" or \"Access\" don\u2019t fit here. I just need to respond with the JSON object for the category. I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. If necessary, I could also suggest a brief explanation about the hardware issue.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket based on the provided text. The expected output is just the category, so I need to deliver it in a valid JSON format. I'll go with {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It\u2019s important to make sure it's a proper JSON string with the right quotes. Now, I just need to respond with that!"
