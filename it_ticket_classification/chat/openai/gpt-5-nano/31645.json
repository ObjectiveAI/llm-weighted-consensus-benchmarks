The user mentions, \u201cnew starter ad him Thursday PM,\u201d likely meaning to add a new starter. This seems related to creating a user account or access and filling out a starter form. Possible categories include \"Access\" for user provisioning, \"Administrative rights\" if they need admin access, or \"HR Support\" since it relates to HR tasks. The context suggests \"Access\" is most fitting.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m interpreting the text about a new starter, possibly meaning that the user wants to add someone to Active Directory (AD) on Thursday afternoon. They may want to fill out a starter form and return both items. Since this is about user provisioning, the correct category appears to be \"Access,\" which aligns with the task of adding a user. I think I should classify this ticket as \"Access\" and consider suggesting next steps or asking for clarification if needed.**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket and expects the output in a specific JSON format. This means I need to create a valid JSON object, containing only the category value. Following the schema, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This is straightforward since \"Access\" fits best based on the context provided. I just need to ensure that the format is correct and meet the requirements. I'll proceed with this response."
