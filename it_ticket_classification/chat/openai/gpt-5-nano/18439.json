I want to make sure I understand the user's needs clearly so I select the most fitting category for their ticket.**Interpreting the ticket request**\n\nThe ticket appears to be a request to assign extension numbers for Belgrade meeting rooms during the afternoon of Friday in March. I see multiple meeting rooms mentioned, like Mercury, Earth, and others, which suggests the user is looking for specific extensions for these rooms. I should clarify which rooms need extensions assigned and ensure the request is handled appropriately by the right team member. It\u2019s a bit jumbled, but I'll focus on the key information about the extensions.**Categorizing meeting room extensions**\n\nThe user wants to assign phone extensions for several meeting rooms, including names like Mercury, Earth, and others. This seems related to IT infrastructure, so I need to pick a fitting category. It could fall under \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" However, since it's specifically about getting access to meeting room extensions, \"Access\" seems to fit best. I\u2019ll categorize this request as \"Access\" and prepare to respond with a JSON object like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I might add a brief note too.**Formulating the response**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket and output the category in JSON format. It's crucial to follow the specified format without adding any extra text. I'll respond with exactly what\u2019s required, which is: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This way, I\u2019m ensuring I\u2019m adhering to the guidelines and providing exactly what the user needs without any fuss. I\u2019ll prepare to present the final output just like that!"
