The ticket mentions adding new member engagers, which suggests it's related to access permissions. This could fall under \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project,\" depending on the specifics. \"Access\" typically refers to permissions and login details, while \"Administrative rights\" deals with admin privileges. Since the request is about adding a new member to a group, I'll categorize it as \"Access,\" though it could also hint at \"Administrative rights.\"**Determining the right category**\n\nI see that the request mentions \"add new member engagers,\" which implies adding someone to a group, likely not requiring admin rights. So, \"Access\" seems like the best fit here. However, I should also think about \"Internal Project,\" if \"engagers\" refers to a project team. Ultimately, since it\u2019s about adding a member to a group, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format my output as a JSON object with this decision.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
