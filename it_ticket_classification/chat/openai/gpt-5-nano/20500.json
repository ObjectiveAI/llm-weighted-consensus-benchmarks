The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket seems to be suggesting enhancements for reports related to expense analysis, which makes it tricky. It's not related to hardware, HR, or access. It could fit under \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but also potentially \"Miscellaneous\" due to its generic nature. \"Purchase\" might apply since it discusses costs, but it's mostly about report generation in Oracle.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
