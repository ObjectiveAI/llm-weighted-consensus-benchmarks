The content seems to involve adding someone as an owner for an event they can't manage themselves. This suggests it relates to permissions or ownership of something, which falls under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given that, I'll classify this ticket as \"Administrative rights\" since it aligns best with their request for modifying ownership.**Determining the Right Category**\n\nI need to decide how to categorize this request. The phrase \"add as owner\" clearly suggests granting an ownership role, which typically relates to administrative rights. Given that the ticket mentions aspects of event management, it further supports this. Since the task involves permissions, I\u2019m settling on \"Administrative rights\" as the most fitting category. Now, I\u2019ll format this categorization into the required JSON structure for clarity. The \"category\" field will be labeled correctly!**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI see that the system instruction specifies a schema for categorization. I'll create a JSON object that includes just the category, which should be \"Administrative rights.\" It's essential to stick strictly to the format and include no extra text or explanations. I\u2019ll verify that the JSON string is valid before finalizing my output. The strict requirement is clear: I'll output only the JSON object as specified: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. Let's go ahead and deliver that!"
