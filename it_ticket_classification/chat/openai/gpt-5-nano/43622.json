The ticket mentions a \"faulty network cable,\" which seems clearly like a hardware issue. While I could categorize it as \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Hardware\" fits best since it's specifically about a physical component.\n\nTo respond, I'll formulate the output as a JSON object. The correct output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Including a brief justification seems useful here too, as I want to ensure clarity.I need to follow the specified format for the IT ticket categorization. The instructions indicate that I should provide only the category in a JSON object. The expected output will be exactly that: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. \n\nI considered if there could be multi-categorization options, like \"Network,\" but that category doesn't exist. The ticket's focus is on replacing a faulty network cable, so \"Hardware\" is definitely the right choice. Now, I'll deliver that response clearly."
