Given the provided text, it seems to fit best in the \"Internal Project\" category since it involves updates to a dashboard. I\u2019ll create a JSON object with this category for the system, adhering to the specified enum values. This helps ensure efficient ticket management!**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket. It could fit into \"Miscellaneous,\" but there's no clear IT hardware or access involved. The mention of \"rejected candidates\" relates to HR, specifically HR Support, but it\u2019s not centered around HR tasks directly. The user, labeled as an \u201canalyst,\u201d requested adding graphs and tables to a dashboard, which suggests it might belong in the \"Internal Project\" category. Ultimately, I need to select the most fitting option from the available categories.**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nI'm leaning toward categorizing this task as \"Internal Project\" since it involves building dashboard components. \"Miscellaneous\" could serve as a fallback, but I'd prefer to be more specific. The text mentions \"dashboard,\" \"rejected candidates,\" and \"grades,\" which ties in with HR, so \"HR Support\" feels relevant as well. However, terms like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" don\u2019t apply here. Ultimately, it\u2019s a close call between \"Internal Project,\" \"HR Support,\" and possibly \"Miscellaneous.\"**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nIt seems the ticket is specifically asking to add a new graph and table related to grades and rejected candidates, making this part of an internal project to modify an HR dashboard. So, \"HR Support\" feels like the most accurate category here. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object as required, formatted as: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI need to remember not to add any extra content since the instructions are clear about categorizing the IT ticket simply and directly. This should keep everything clear and concise!**Selecting the Final Category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding between \"Internal Project\" or \"HR Support.\" I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" because the content references \"candidates,\" \"grades,\" and \"dashboard,\" which fit typical HR analytics. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll format my response as: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI want to make sure everything is clear, noting the repeated phrases like \"obi add a new graph and table,\" but given the context, it does align with HR metrics. Now, I\u2019ll stick to just the JSON output!"
