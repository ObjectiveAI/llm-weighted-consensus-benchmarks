It appears that after a holiday, they encountered connection issues. The first issue is that they can't connect to the server and received a message about \"connections host default ports failed.\" I wonder if this could relate to SSH or VPN complications. The second issue seems linked to a certificate problem that's causing a verification failure, which is lingering after two years of smooth operation.**Categorizing Server Access Issues**\n\nThe user mentions \"server hello after returned holidays,\" which makes me think of a TLS handshake. The phrase \"unable to verify name or password\" indicates a potential certificate name mismatch or login issue. They also referenced log files where connections have failed. Given all this, I need to categorize the IT ticket. It seems most appropriate to classify it under \"Access\" since it relates to server connectivity and login issues. I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" for categorization.**Finalizing JSON Output**\n\nI\u2019m getting ready to provide the final answer as a JSON object. The category needs to be \"Access,\" in line with the user's request to categorize the IT ticket. The structure should be minimal and adhere to the specified JSON schema. So, I'll simply output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThat\u2019s it, no need for extra notes since it\u2019s straightforward. Just making sure I\u2019m following instructions properly to keep it clear and concise!"
