I'm weighing the options: \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best since it relates to developing internal system features. \"Administrative rights\" might apply if it were about permissions, but that's not the case here. Overall, my conclusion is that it should go under \"Internal Project.\"**Delivering category response**\n\nThe user simply asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I just need to provide the category. I'll output a JSON-like object. Based on the content of the ticket, which includes various internal software improvement requests, \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems to be the best fit. I\u2019ll ensure to use the correct structure for the category object and respond with exactly this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That's it, and I won\u2019t add anything extra!"
