The ticket text is quite messy and mentions a critical alert concerning database job failures and recovery points. It doesn\u2019t seem to fit Hardware, HR, Access, Purchase, or Storage directly, but since it's related to data source and recovery points, maybe it could fit under Storage.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm thinking this ticket is about database jobs and recovery points, with terms like \u201cdiscontinuity,\u201d \u201clog for database,\u201d and \u201cincremental jobs fail.\u201d The categories to choose from are fairly limited: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nGiven the critical alert regarding database job failure and its likely relation to data integrity, I believe \"Storage\" fits best since it pertains to data storage and recovery points. So I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as Storage.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
