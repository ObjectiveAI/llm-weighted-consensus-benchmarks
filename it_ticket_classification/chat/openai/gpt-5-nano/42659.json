The ticket mentions an annual leave request issue needing manager approval; this seems clearly related to HR Support, not IT access or hardware issues.\n\nThough I considered \"Administrative rights\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" the \"HR Support\" category is clearly applicable. So my final output should state: category: HR Support, formatted like JSON.**Preparing response format**\n\nThe system specifies that I need to format the response as an object, specifically with a category string. So, I\u2019ll prepare the output as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It's important to keep it minimal and avoid any unnecessary text. \n\nI just need to ensure the format is correct and clear. Got it! I'll produce the response now without adding anything extra."
