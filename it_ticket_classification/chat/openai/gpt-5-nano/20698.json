They mention \"wireless working,\" which could indicate issues with connectivity. Given this context, I think \"Hardware\" would be the best category, but \"Access\" could be relevant if it relates to network access specifically.**Determining ticket category**\n\nOkay, I see that \"wireless working\" might indicate a request to fix Wi-Fi, but the mention of a \"cable\" suggests they want a physical connection. The request to \"please wire\" seems to reinforce that they're looking for a hardware solution, so categorizing it as \"Hardware\" feels right. It doesn't quite fall into \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project.\" \n\nNow I'll format my response as a JSON object with the category field. It should look something like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
