The potential categories include Hardware, Administrative rights, Internal Project, or Miscellaneous. Initially, I thought it might be a Hardware issue since it's about the servers. \n\nHowever, contacting a senior manager could hint at Administrative rights. But ultimately, the central concern is the mail delivery failure related to the old server. Given that, I think \"Hardware\" is the best category here.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
