The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. I have to decide which category fits best. It\u2019s important to choose carefully so that the issue can be addressed correctly. Let\u2019s make sure to select the most appropriate option!**Identifying ticket details**\n\nThe ticket content mentions various topics like upgrading the application version, sprint planning, and managing the backlog. It also touches on things like admin screens and the ability of administrators to modify their own screens, as well as extended administration privileges. Based on these details, it seems the ticket could fit into categories like Internal Project, Administrative Rights, or Access. I need to determine the best fit to ensure it gets resolved efficiently!**Deciding on category**\n\nIt looks like this ticket is focused on internal project management and upgrading the application version, with aspects like sprint planning and managing the backlog. The category \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit since it covers project planning elements like epics and sprints. However, it also mentions \"administrators modify own screens,\" suggesting some administrative rights might be applicable. Ultimately, I'll lean toward \"Internal Project\" since that aligns more closely with the overall content. Now, I\u2019ll prepare to return a JSON with the designated category!**Creating JSON output**\n\nI need to format my response as a JSON-like object with the field \"category\". The allowed categories are \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative Rights\". After reviewing the ticket, it seems \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category based on its focus on upgrading application versions and managing the backlog. I\u2019ll make sure the capitalization is correct and provide only the JSON output, which will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
