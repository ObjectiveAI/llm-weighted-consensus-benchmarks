The user\u2019s message includes phrases like \"add me,\" which suggests they want access, possibly as an Agile Lead. \"PM\" could refer to \"project manager\" or \"privilege management,\" and \"passed certification\" indicates they completed certification, likely for that role. I\u2019m weighing between \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access,\" but \"Access\" seems like a better fit since they want to be added to a group or role. I'll proceed with that for the output.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
