The available categories include \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project.\" There's no distinct \"Software\" category, but since this is clearly not a hardware issue, \"Miscellaneous\" might be the closest fit. I'll stick with that for now.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the category for this IT ticket since it appears to be a general software issue. If it was related to a project, I might think about \"Internal Project,\" but it doesn\u2019t seem that way. The user just wants me to categorize it. The response should follow a JSON format with just the category. So, I\u2019ll confirm: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} is the way to go. Let's deliver that!"
