It mentions recruiters changing links in the browser, so maybe this relates to access control. Since it's about an internal career site, I\u2019m considering \"Internal Project\" as a category. \"HR Support\" could fit too, given the context of job postings, but \"HR\" isn't explicitly listed\u2014only \"HR Support.\" I think my best guess is \"Internal Project,\" although \"Access\" could be relevant due to the link modifications.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe user mentions that \"recruiters manually change\" the link, which seems related to URL parameters rather than directly about access control. There are category options like \"Administrative rights\" relating to permissions. I think it could be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" if there's a problem with sharing the link. However, the mention of \"expected behavior\" and \"links automatically transformed\" suggests some automation involved. Overall, \"Internal Project\" feels like the safest choice for this ticket, so I\u2019ll go with that category.**Finalizing IT ticket response**\n\nThe dataset I'm working with expects the content in a specific format, which is `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. The schema provides details about the properties and category options available. However, it's missing certain required fields. My goal is to stick to the expected output format without any additional commentary, so I\u2019ll present it simply as `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. Conciseness is key here to meet the requirements!"
