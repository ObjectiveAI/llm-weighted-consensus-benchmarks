I want to ensure that I'm accurately placing each ticket in the right category so that the right team can address the issue quickly. This way, it helps everyone involved to resolve matters efficiently!**Investigating Ticket Issue**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a ticket about a leaver form that isn\u2019t working properly, particularly with a missing Belgrade location. The user is struggling with constant reminders to fill out the leave request, which are also embarrassing for their line manager. They mention issues like mandatory fields not completing, the \"entity part for year,\" and the \u201ccheck out\u201d button being unresponsive. This definitely needs priority investigation to resolve the problems and ensure the user can complete the form successfully.**Classifying IT Issue**\n\nI\u2019m dealing with an IT issue in the HR/Leave system, and I\u2019m considering the best category to classify it. HR Support seems like the most fitting option since it relates to a non-functioning form and issues with the location field. The output needs to be in a JSON format, specifically requiring a \"category\" field to be set to \"HR Support,\" which matches one of the defined categories. I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s formatted correctly and adheres to the specifications!**Formatting the Response**\n\nI need to focus on providing just the required JSON object for the category response. The instruction is clear: I should respond simply with the category. So, I'll present it as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. While I could add reasoning, that\u2019s not necessary since the instruction emphasizes a minimal response. I want to make sure I stick to the guidelines and deliver exactly what\u2019s being asked without any extra content!"
