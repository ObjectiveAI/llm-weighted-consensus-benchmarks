They want it classified into categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and a few others. The ticket mentions issues with Oracle Fusion, specifically about duplicate entries and similar sheet attachments. \n\nIt seems more like a software or workflow issue, but the closest fit could be \"Internal Project\" since it relates to the Oracle Fusion system, even though \"Software\" isn't an option.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI believe the best category for this IT ticket is \"Miscellaneous.\" The user likely prefers this option if nothing else fits. The ticket discusses Oracle Fusion, mentioning multiple entries and issues with duplicates. \n\nSince it's a software problem, \"Miscellaneous\" seems most appropriate. I should respond with a simple JSON object that captures this without overcomplicating things. Following the instructions, I'll present it like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. This should meet the user's request effectively!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
