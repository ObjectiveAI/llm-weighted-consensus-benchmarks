The ticket discusses approvals related to timecards, managing settings, and administrative rights. Given the context of process changes and frustrations about lacking proper tools for managing timecards, it seems best to categorize it under Access and Administrative Rights. I think Administrative Rights would fit well due to the mention of UI elements in a project management tool.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe discussion in the ticket involves \"permissions,\" \"accessible path,\" and \"manage settings,\" which makes me think it fits into the \"Access\" category since it concerns timecard management and approvals. While \"HR Support\" is listed, this seems more about tools and process issues rather than HR. \"Administrative Rights\" also seems relevant since it deals with permissions for actions like approvals. In conclusion, I'm leaning towards categorizing this IT ticket as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} or possibly \"Administrative rights.\"**Analyzing approval issues**\n\nThe content discusses issues related to timecard approvals by Oracle, specifically the incorrect approvals and the lack of proper tools for managing these issues. There are mentions of managing settings, tracking tasks, and updating performance data, which appears to create frustration due to improper approvals cluttering the human approval queue. The submitter is asking for fixes to improve the process, suggesting it's crucial to revert the approvals for managing timecards effectively. Overall, this focuses on needing better tools and processes.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI see that the ticket discusses elements like \"update performance data,\" \"manage settings,\" \"timecards,\" and \"permissions,\" which points toward \"Administrative Rights,\" especially since it involves who can approve timecards. However, there\u2019s also a hint of \"Internal Project,\" as it relates to a project management tool. The categories include Access and Administrative Rights. While Access typically relates to login permissions, the specific focus on permissions and admin actions leads me to choose \"Administrative Rights\" for this ticket, given its emphasis on access control.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
