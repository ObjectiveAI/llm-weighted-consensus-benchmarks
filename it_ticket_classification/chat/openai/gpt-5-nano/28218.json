It could tie into internal development, which might fall under \"Internal Project\" or could be labeled as \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\nThe user wants me to categorize the IT ticket, so I\u2019ll output a JSON object with the appropriate category. Let's proceed!**Determining category for ticket**\n\nI'm examining content that mentions git and an update package, and it doesn\u2019t seem to fall under hardware, storage, or HR. \n\nIt might relate to \"Administrative rights\" since it concerns package updates by the owner. However, it seems more plausible to categorize this as \"Internal Project,\" given the mention of git. I'll create a JSON object reflecting that choice. \n\nSo, I need the proper format with the required structure, ensuring the category is nested correctly within an object!**Providing the JSON structure**\n\nI've got the schema for the category, which clearly outlines how the JSON should be structured. \n\nWe need to output only the category value, formatted as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} to align with the schema and keep it straightforward. \n\nConsidering the words mentioned in the ticket, such as \"git\" and \"update package,\" it does look like it relates best to \"Internal Project.\" So, let\u2019s deliver just the JSON without any extra explanation. Here we go!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
