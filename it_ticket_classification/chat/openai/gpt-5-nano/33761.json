Thus, I'm concluding that the best category for this ticket is \"Purchase.\" I'll respond with a JSON object: {\"type\":\"category\",\"category\":\"Purchase\"} to keep things organized!**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI see there's a defined schema for the response. It specifies that I need to return a JSON object that includes a \"category\" property, which is a string from the allowed categories. In past tasks, the response often included a \"type\" field, but here it seems that's not necessary. So, the correct response should simply be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I'll keep it straightforward without any extra commentary and provide that!"
