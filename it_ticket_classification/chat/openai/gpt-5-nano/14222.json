The user seems to be requesting access to book these rooms. After analyzing it, I'm leaning towards the \"Access\" category since it involves permissions related to booking. However, it could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" since they mention wanting access, especially with the term \"Senior\" indicating a possible user's status. I'll choose appropriately!**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019ve determined that the appropriate category for this booking request is \"Access.\" This relates to user permissions for meeting rooms rather than administrative rights, which are more about performing admin tasks. The phrase \"booking room access on floors\" clearly points to the need for access to those rooms. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object, making sure to include the \"category\" key with the value \"Access.\" Here\u2019s how I\u2019ll structure it: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
