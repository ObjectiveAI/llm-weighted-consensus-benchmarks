The allowed categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Internal Project.\" \n\nSince the ticket pertains to system notifications, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is probably the best fit. It doesn't seem to fall under any other category like hardware or HR support, so I'll go with that to fulfill the user\u2019s request.**Categorizing ticket clarification**\n\nThe ticket asks for clarification about why a notification was received twice from different senders. This seems to relate to email notification duplication, which is likely a system issue. Looking at the provided options, the closest category is \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\nSo, I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object with the category specified. Based on the instructions, I\u2019ll respond purely with: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. This keeps it clear and straightforward, as the user requested!**Finalizing category decision**\n\nI\u2019m double-checking whether \"Access\" might be more appropriate for the two resolved notifications. However, since the ticket doesn\u2019t explicitly mention access issues, I don\u2019t think that category fits. It's just about the resolved notifications, so \"Miscellaneous\" still seems like the best choice. \n\nI\u2019ll finalize my answer as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. This keeps it aligned with the user\u2019s request and focused on the nature of the issue."
