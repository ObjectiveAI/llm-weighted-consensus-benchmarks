I\u2019m weighing \"Administrative rights\" against \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it focuses on internal processes, \"Internal Project\" might fit well. But I wonder if \"Administrative rights\" makes sense too, especially since there's a lot of discussion about who has permission to approve changes and manage authorization. It's a bit tricky!**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nI\u2019m trying to determine the best category for an IT ticket that focuses on change management updates, approvers, and workflow anomalies. The options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the emphasis on internal processes and tool configuration, I think \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting choice rather than \"Administrative rights,\" since it's not really about user access or hardware. The ticket really leans into internal project management!**Determining the category for a ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a ticket that mentions \"flow anomalies\" related to change request workflows. It's heavily focused on approvals but isn\u2019t about a specific user\u2019s access. While there are arguments for \"Access\" due to permissions, I think \"Internal Project\" really makes the most sense here. Now I need to craft the final response as a JSON object, sticking to the simple format requested. So, my output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
