It seems like they\u2019re having trouble accessing documents that require a password, which suggests this is an access issue. They mentioned they're able to open links but not documents, and their password was recently changed. So, I'll categorize this as \"Access\". \n\nNow, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object in the required format, reflecting this category.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nI see that I need to provide a JSON object with the category value \"Access.\" The schema indicates that the category should be part of an object. Usually, I might just output something like `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`, but the instructions emphasize following the schema format closely. \n\nSo, to keep it precise and clear, I\u2019ll stick to the requirements and respond simply with: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`.
