It seems like this could potentially fall under \"Access,\" as they\u2019re experiencing difficulties accessing specific files. I'll confirm and categorize it accordingly.**Identifying ticket issues**\n\nThe content suggests this user is facing trouble opening files for approval, possibly related to Oracle documents. They specifically mention an error about the browser. I wonder if they meant to say \"browser should be using,\" which points to an access issue. Given this, I should probably categorize this ticket as \"Access,\" since the user seems to be experiencing difficulties accessing these files. It\u2019s important to get this right for better support!**Categorizing ticket by access issues**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories available: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Since this ticket is about issues with accessing files for approval, it wouldn't fit hardware, HR, or purchases. While it might seem like \"Administrative Rights\" could apply if admin permissions are needed, the mention of \"browser should use\" leans me toward considering it a browser compatibility issue. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" Now, I'll format this as a JSON object for the output!**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m ready to respond with the category in JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. While it might be tempting to provide a rationale, the instruction only specifies categorization, so that extra detail isn\u2019t necessary this time. The required format is clear, with the \"category\" field outlined. I\u2019ll stick to the format and go ahead with the response now."
