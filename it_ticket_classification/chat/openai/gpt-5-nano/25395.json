That could relate to either \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The term \"ext mob\" likely refers to \"external mobility,\" suggesting some kind of mobile access issue. Overall, it points to changing approval workflows for holidays.**Selecting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI have categories to choose from: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket is about approval workflows, specifically regarding calendar holidays and PM approvals, which doesn't fit Hardware, HR, Storage, Purchase, or Internal Project. While it might relate to Access or Administrative rights since changing flows often involves permission levels, the term \"ext mob\" is unclear. I should categorize it and ask the user for clarification about \u201cext mob.\u201d**Formatting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to provide the ticket category as a JSON object based on a specific schema. The valid categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket mentions \"approvals\" and \"changing flows for holidays.\" I\u2019m thinking it could fit as \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" but since it relates more to business process changes rather than just access control, I might lean toward \"Access\" for this context. I'll format it accordingly.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe user mentioned \"change flows holidays,\" which suggests workflow changes. It might fit under \"Internal Project\" if this relates to ongoing work. The reference to \"pm approvals\" likely points to project management, so \"Miscellaneous\" could work if nothing else fits. However, if adjustments need special permissions, it might be \"Administrative rights,\" but that isn't clearly mentioned. Overall, the request seems to involve modifying approval workflows for HR matters, possibly fitting into a \"Workflow automation\" or \"Process change\" category.**Selecting a Category for the Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the category for this ticket. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if admin privileges are needed, the user didn\u2019t explicitly ask for that. \"Access\" pertains more to system logins, and this request seems focused on changing workflow processes. \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the safest option due to the ambiguity. I believe categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" will accommodate the vague request while still being relevant. So, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} since that fits the JSON format perfectly."
