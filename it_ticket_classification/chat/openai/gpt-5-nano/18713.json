The categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" The ticket mentions updates, dates, and contract SOW, which could fit under \"Purchase\" if it\u2019s about procurement. However, \"Internal Project\" could work if it's related to project management documents. Given the context, I'll lean towards categorizing it as \"Purchase.\"**Outputting JSON for categorization**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket, so I'll provide a JSON object with the category set to \"Purchase.\" According to the system's rules, the category needs to be presented as a specific object format. I'll keep it concise, ensuring that it aligns with the schema stated in the instructions. \n\nThe final output will be:  \n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}  \n\nI won't add extra details since the main instruction is to provide just the JSON.**Deciding on the category**\n\nI'm reflecting on whether \"Internal Project\" might be a better fit for this ticket since it discusses updating the Statement of Work (SOW) within an internal context. The user seems to want to update information on the SOW\u2014perhaps related to procurement documents. \n\nWhile \"Purchase\" could apply if it's about contracts or purchase orders, \"Internal Project\" feels right considering SOW is part of project scope. Ultimately, I'll lean towards categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" for relevance.**Choosing the category**\n\nI believe \"Internal Project\" is the safer choice for categorizing this ticket since the Statement of Work (SOW) is typically associated with project documents. The user is asking for updates on the SOW itself, which doesn\u2019t seem to relate to purchasing.\n\nSo, based on their message about updating contract information and dates, it aligns with internal project management. I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" and respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
