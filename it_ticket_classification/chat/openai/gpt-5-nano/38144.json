The categories available are \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative Rights\". Considering the specifics mentioned, \"Miscellaneous\" seems most fitting since it's likely a software issue. However, \"Internal Project\" might apply if it ties to a specific project environment, but I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best choice here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket states there's a Maven error while trying to run job configurations, which feels more like a developer or CI issue rather than hardware, access, or storage problems. It could fit as \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" I lean toward \"Internal Project\" since there\u2019s a mention of a robot job, indicating it might be related to internal automation. However, to keep it simple and generic, I think we should categorize it as \"Miscellaneous.\" So, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Outputting JSON format**\n\nI see that the instruction specifies that I need to output a JSON object with a category property. The required format is clear: I should provide something like {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Even though I could add a brief explanation, it\u2019s important to stick to the required format. So, I\u2019ll make sure to keep it simple and just output the JSON object without any extra text. Let's go with that approach!"
