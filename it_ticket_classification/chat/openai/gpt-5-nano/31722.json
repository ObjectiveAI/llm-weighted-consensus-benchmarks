It seems to mention a problem with video and a camera in the meeting room. This could potentially be a video conferencing issue. The available categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since it talks about a camera and room, it seems likely to be a Hardware issue, but I might also consider Miscellaneous.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI think the best category for this IT ticket is \"Hardware\" since it focuses on a camera in a meeting room that's capturing the whole area. The user's message refers to a specific meeting room and indicates issues with video, possibly suggesting a camera that might be tilted or stuck in a feed. The other categories like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" don't fit this situation, making \"Hardware\" the most suitable option. I also need to format this into a JSON object with a category field.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
