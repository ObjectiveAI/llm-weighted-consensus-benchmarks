They provided a list of potential categories including \"HR Support\" and \"Access.\" Given that it\u2019s about a new starter and a starter form, it makes sense to categorize it under \"HR Support\" since it relates to onboarding. I'll suggest that category in my output.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket that's about completing a starter form for a new employee who will join in February. This links to HR onboarding, but it also seems related to IT access, as they may need accounts created. They provided categories like \"HR Support\" and \"Access,\" and since this is about provisioning, I think \"Access\" is the best fit. I should output just a JSON object for the category field.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
