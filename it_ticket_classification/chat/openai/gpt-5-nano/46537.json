They mention \"filters when nothing is selected\" and a dropdown related to an \"offers field.\" It feels like this is a software or dashboard bug, so the possible categories include Internal Project, Miscellaneous, or Access. However, Access might not fit here, so I lean towards Internal Project or Miscellaneous depending on the specific details.**Identifying IT ticket category**\n\nIt looks like we've got a potential software bug related to a dashboard filter, but there\u2019s no \"Software\" category available. The likely options are \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"HR Support\" don\u2019t fit. Since the user wants a single category, I\u2019m thinking \"Internal Project\" might be the best choice since it involves an internal dashboard issue. The mention of \"dashboard highlighting filters when nothing is selected\" indicates a UI behavior concern, possibly regarding case sensitivity.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to choose the best category for the IT ticket per the user's instructions. Since the issue seems related to a dashboard UI/UX concern, I can suggest either \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I should mention that \"Software\" isn't available as a category. Based on the provided JSON schema, I will respond with the selected category in the required format. My final output will likely be something like: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, which fits best given it concerns an internal dashboard feature.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
