It seems clear that this is likely an access request, so I should categorize it as \"Access.\" However, it could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" if they are specifically requesting access rights. I'll make sure to format the output as a JSON object with the appropriate category.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe category options include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" which are separate. The user\u2019s text suggests they are requesting access to a new network, but it\u2019s not explicitly for administrative rights. Since the user asked to categorize this IT ticket, I'll choose the most fitting category: \"Access.\" The output will be a simple JSON object, so I\u2019ll format it accordingly as {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra analysis. Let\u2019s deliver that straightforward response!"
