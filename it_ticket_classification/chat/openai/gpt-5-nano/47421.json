The provided categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and more. It sounds like this issue pertains to HR tasks, so \"HR Support\" seems appropriate. However, if the issue relates more to access or permissions, \"Access\" could fit too. I'm weighing these options to choose the best category for this ticket.**Classifying IT ticket category**\n\nThe user mentioned \"error when tried add annual leave request,\" which relates to the HR system and suggests an application error. Given the options, \"HR Support\" is a clear fit because it addresses HR-related issues. The \"Access\" category isn't appropriate here since there\u2019s no mention of login or permissions. I'm planning to categorize this as \"HR Support\" since it's explicitly about the annual leave request. The output will be in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Formatting the output correctly**\n\nI see that I need to provide a JSON object with the category based on the user's issue with adding an annual leave request. The schema specifies that the category must be one of several enumerations, and \"HR Support\" is clearly the best choice here. While I briefly considered \"Miscellaneous,\" it doesn't fit as well. So, I'll go ahead and finalize the response as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. We'll keep it precise and to the point!"
