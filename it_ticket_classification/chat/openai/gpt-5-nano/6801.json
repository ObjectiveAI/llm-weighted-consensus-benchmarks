The content mentions disabling an access card, mailbox activation, a leave request, and some forms. It seems to fit best in the \"Access\" category since it deals primarily with access card issues. Although there's an HR element with \"maternity leaver,\" the focus here is on IT tasks related to access management, especially for an employee leaving. So, \"Access\" feels most appropriate, though \"Administrative rights\" could work too.**Categorizing IT ticket as JSON**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket, and I'm settling on \"Access.\" The prompt specifically asks for just the category, so I should format my output as a JSON object. The schema requires an object with a \"category\" field containing a string from an enumerated list. My final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nIt seems clear that reasoning isn\u2019t needed since the instructions didn\u2019t ask for it. So, I\u2019ll stick with just delivering the JSON object."
