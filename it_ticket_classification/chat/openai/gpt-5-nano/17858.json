Since it seems to involve granting access to these codes in Oracle, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access.\" However, if admin rights are needed, that could be relevant too. It's a bit tricky!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket taxonomy, which includes categories like Access requests and Administrative rights. The text mentions \"oracle,\" suggesting software access, specifically to project codes. This hints at the \"Access\" category for the Oracle environment.\n\nHowever, there's also the \"Internal Project\" category, which might relate to internal tasks. The user wants a categorized assignment. I should respond with a JSON object that includes the appropriate category. So, I'll ensure to format it according to the guidelines!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
