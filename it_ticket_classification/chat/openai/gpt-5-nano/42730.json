They mention things like \"wrong project code,\" \"notes sent Friday,\" and \"cannot submit vacation because approvals.\" It seems they might have issues accessing something or need permission to submit their vacation request. The categories could fit \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d \u201cAccess,\u201d or maybe even \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d or \u201cInternal Project.\u201d I think \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could be the best fits here.**Deciding ticket categories**\n\nWhen categorizing IT tickets, issues related to submitting vacations typically fall under \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project.\" Considering the user's message, \"Access\" seems suitable if it involves permissions necessary for vacation approvals. \"Administrative rights\" could also fit if they lack certain permissions. However, there\u2019s mention of a \"wrong project code,\" which hints at an issue in the system, possibly needing \"Internal Project\" or \"Purchase.\" It looks like there might be multiple issues at play here!**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking to categorize an IT ticket that likely relates to a \"wrong project code.\" This could fit into \"Internal Project,\" especially since the message includes references to project management. While \"Access\" might cover submission issues due to approvals, it's more about workflows rather than typical access problems. So, it makes sense to categorize this ticket under \"Internal Project\" given the emphasis on project code and project management. That feels like the best choice!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
