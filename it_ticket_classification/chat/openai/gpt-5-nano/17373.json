It mentions known opportunities and requests to create new ones with repeated \"opportunity id.\" This ticket doesn't seem related to hardware or access, so I might lean towards \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or even \"Purchase\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" However, \"Administrative Rights\" feels separate from the task at hand, so I'll focus on either \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI think the ticket seems more suited for \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It talks about \"opportunities,\" which suggests business rather than IT context, possibly related to a process like Salesforce. Since this isn't about hardware or software, \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t fit. If it\u2019s part of a project for creating opportunities on Wednesday PM, I'd lean towards \"Internal Project.\" If it's unclear, maybe \"Miscellaneous\" is safer. It might be good to ask the user for clarification if needed!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket, and the text suggests it's focused on creating opportunities for Wednesday PM. Since it doesn't pertain to requesting admin access, hardware, or other categories, it seems best to categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" This aligns with it being a task related to internal initiatives. \"Miscellaneous\" might work if it's unclear, but I'll choose \"Internal Project\" as the most suitable category. I could respond in a JSON-like format to provide clarity!**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that defines the category based on the IT ticket. The expected output should be formatted like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It will be concise, presenting the information clearly. The instruction specifies to provide just the category, but I could consider adding a brief note if needed. Still, the main focus is delivering it in the correct JSON format, so I'll make sure it's formatted properly! Here\u2019s the output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
