The message talks about \"project support,\" \"additional configuration,\" and mentions \"angular,\" which might refer to a development framework. So, it seems relevant to consider it for project work. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as it aligns better, though \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" could also fit if it's about configuration rights. However, I'm not entirely sure since it feels a bit garbled.**Categorizing project support request**\n\nThe user shared a message that seems to originate from a ticket asking for support with an Angular project. The categories to consider include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since it's related to project support and configuration, \"Internal Project\" appears to be the most fitting option. It might also qualify as \"Miscellaneous\" if there's ambiguity, but I believe \"Internal Project\" is the right call. I'll respond accordingly using the required JSON format.**Outputting JSON for category**\n\nIt looks like I need to output a JSON object with the selected category as \"Internal Project.\" The instructions are clear; the user probably just wants the category label. I should keep it straightforward and follow the required format exactly, which means no extra text or punctuation. So, I\u2019ll simply provide: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019m double-checking to make sure everything looks good! This should work just fine."
