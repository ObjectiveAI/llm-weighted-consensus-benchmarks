We have \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" which seem fitting for a bug in internal software. The ticket's from a software tester about a UI/UX issue, where a newly created item is crossed out by default. Since the ticket is specifically related to internal software, it makes sense to categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" I'll respond with a category object that reflects that.**Formatting category response**\n\nThe instructions say I need to output a category field in a specific schema. So, I should respond with a JSON-like object that includes the category, which should look like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI notice the schema defines a more complex structure that outlines what the response should contain, but it really wants just the category value. I think I'll provide the full object format to meet their requirements while keeping it straightforward. Even though it seems odd, I'll stick to the format given for clarity.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
