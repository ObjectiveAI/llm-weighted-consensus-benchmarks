I need to output a JSON object with that category, sticking to the provided format. The schema does specify the structure expected, and it mentions that we should include the \"category\" field. So, I think I should keep it simple and respond with just the following: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. That's clear and aligns with what I understand from the instructions.**Outputting the category**\n\nIt looks like the format I need to use is very straightforward. I\u2019m set to output exactly: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. There's no need for extra commentary or information; just this succinct response will do. I'll make sure it\u2019s clear and adheres exactly to what is expected without any additional fluff. Keeping it simple is key, so I'll stick with this direct output."
