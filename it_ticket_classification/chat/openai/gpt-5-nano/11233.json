I'll take a moment to analyze the details in the ticket and ensure it maps to the most appropriate category. This way, we can provide efficient handling of the request!**Parsing the IT ticket**\n\nI need to break down the user message, which is an IT ticket mainly about \"cancellations within incidents configuration.\" Key points include \"reason cancellation dropdown,\" \"currently free text,\" and \"investigation.\" It also mentions \"test,\" \"automation,\" and \"template.\" The user seems to be discussing configuring dropdown options for cancellation reasons in ServiceNow since requests logged incorrectly should auto-populate the cancellation reasons. I\u2019ve got to ensure I'm accurately capturing all the necessary details for an effective response!**Determining the right category**\n\nI'm trying to decide how to categorize the IT ticket. Of the options\u2014 \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights\"\u2014 \"Internal Project\" seems the most fitting. This ticket is about incident management in ServiceNow, which aligns well with internal configuration changes. \"Miscellaneous\" could also work as a catch-all, but I think \"Internal Project\" captures the essence better since it involves an internal system configuration adjustment. Let\u2019s go with \"Internal Project\"!**Finalizing the JSON output**\n\nI've decided to categorize the IT ticket as \"Internal Project,\" since it involves configuring ServiceNow incidents within that environment. Now, I\u2019ll create the required JSON-like object: it will need a \"category\" field, and the format specifies that it should be a string enum. So, I'll output: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. While the instructions don\u2019t require justification, it might be nice to mention it briefly. However, my main focus is on providing the category value as requested!"
