The ticket content is a bit jumbled, but it's about implementing a feedback survey for \u201cSnow.\u201d It might be related to Snow Software or Snowflake. They're looking to proceed with the same rules for the feedback survey and want to start this process in November. It sounds like more clarification might be needed.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket. It could be \"Internal Project\" since it involves implementing feedback survey rules for the Snow instance. Other options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and \"HR\" don't seem as fitting here. While \"Administrative rights\" might relate to permissions, the focus is on the survey functionality. So, \"Internal Project\" seems most appropriate. I\u2019ll craft a concise response, classifying it as \"Internal Project\" with justification that it involves implementing feedback surveys for Snow, including rules, quotas, and sampling starting in November.**Formatting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI see that the instruction asks for a specific category in a JSON-like structure for the IT ticket. The required output must contain a \"category\" key with a corresponding value from the provided options. Based on our discussion, \"Internal Project\" fits best.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll create the JSON object like this: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. It seems safest to just provide the JSON without adding extra text, as the instruction emphasizes outputting only the category. Alright, let\u2019s go with that!"
