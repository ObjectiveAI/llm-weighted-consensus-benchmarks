This seems HR-related since it's about the line manager and likely involves the HR systems. Therefore, \"HR Support\" appears to be the most relevant category. Although I might consider \"Administrative rights\" if access is necessary, I feel confident that \"HR Support\" is the best choice here.**Finalizing IT ticket response**\n\nI\u2019m going to categorize this IT ticket as \"HR Support.\" The user specifically asked for a categorization, so I\u2019ll keep it concise and straightforward. I need to output a JSON format for the response, given the system's requirements. The structured format looks like this: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. While I could add a brief note, the instructions emphasize returning the category only. So, I\u2019ll stick to the required format and simply respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
