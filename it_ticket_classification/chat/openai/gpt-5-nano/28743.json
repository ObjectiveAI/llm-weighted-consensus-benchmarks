Since there's no direct \u201cSoftware\u201d category in the options, the best fit for the BIOS issue is \"Hardware.\" I think I\u2019ll go ahead and categorize it as such!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket and provided specific text. I need to respond with a JSON object according to the schema given. The category should likely be \"Hardware,\" considering the mention of BIOS and device drivers, but I'm trying to be thorough here. I see there's also a small chance it could relate to \"Access\" due to the word \"disable.\" However, given the context, I'll stick with \"Hardware.\" \n\nSo my output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
