They mention \"write rights,\" \"migrate content,\" and \"add descriptions/links,\" which leads me to think it's related to access rights, administrative rights, or possibly an internal project. I'll focus on determining the appropriate category from Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. It seems access rights might be the best fit here.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe request clearly falls under Access or Administrative rights. They mention \"new mobile practice write rights,\" \"migrate content,\" and \"add descriptions/links.\" This suggests it's about access permissions, so I'll categorize it as Access. The mention of \"write rights\" leans me toward that choice, even though there could be data migration involved. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object indicating the category as \"Access,\" since that's the most fitting option.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI need to produce the expected JSON format for the category here. The schema indicates we should have a minimal JSON object containing the category property. I believe the correct response would be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Since the system's instructions emphasize accuracy, I\u2019ll ensure \"Access\" is capitalized exactly as shown in the enum. I won't add any extra commentary to keep it simple and to the point.
