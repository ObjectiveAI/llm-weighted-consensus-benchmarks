It seems to involve deleting certain labels from project epics, which may lead to confusion. I need to determine which category fits best from the options available: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I'll likely classify this ticket as \"Administrative rights\" since it involves managing application labels. I need to respond with the category in JSON format.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket is focused on deleting labels from project epics, which are causing confusion. This pertains to project management tools like Jira or Azure DevOps. It doesn't fit the categories of hardware, HR support, access, storage, or purchase. I think \"Administrative rights\" is suitable since it involves modifying project configurations. However, it could also be categorized as \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" because it deals with internal project management tasks. I'll choose the best classification based on this analysis.**Evaluating ticket categorization**\n\nI need to categorize this ticket, which is about cleaning up labels in project management. The categories to choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since it's not about access and focuses on changing project labels, \"Administrative rights\" seems like a good fit. However, it may not involve elevated permissions. \"Internal Project\" could work too, as it relates to tasks within an internal project. I'll weigh these options carefully.**Determining the correct category**\n\nThe content of the ticket focuses on removing labels to reduce confusion, which falls under an administrative change rather than a bug or feature. I believe the best category for this ticket is \"Administrative rights,\" as it involves modification. While \"Miscellaneous\" is an option, it seems less appropriate. Therefore, I should respond with the following JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I\u2019ll ensure the response contains only this JSON format without any extra commentary. Let's proceed!"
