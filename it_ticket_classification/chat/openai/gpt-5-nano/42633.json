The available categories for this incident include options like Hardware, HR Support, and Access. I think \"Miscellaneous\" fits best, as it's a technical problem that doesn't quite fit in other categories. The JSON response needs to define the category field clearly. So, I'll output it as: {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}. Keeping it straightforward with no extra commentary seems ideal!**Finalizing JSON Response**\n\nThe system requires me to respond with a specific category, so I'm preparing to deliver a JSON object. It should include the category \"Miscellaneous,\" spelled exactly as needed. I just need to ensure I don't escape anything unnecessarily. The final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Alright, I think I\u2019m ready to deliver this clearly and concisely!"
