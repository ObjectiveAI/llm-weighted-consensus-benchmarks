The details indicate they've tried logging in multiple times with the wrong password, leading to an account lockout. This situation definitely correlates with the \"Access\" category, which typically encompasses login and password issues. \"Administrative rights\" might apply if it were about permissions, but I don't think that's the case here. Other categories like \"HR Support\" or \"Hardware\" don't fit at all.**Finalizing category output**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the category for the IT ticket, and it's clear that \"Access\" is the right choice. The expected output should be a JSON object that specifies this category. I need to follow the defined JSON schema, which is straightforward: it should just be {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to make sure it\u2019s properly formatted since the system will parse it. So, I\u2019ll keep it simple and output only the necessary JSON object without any additional commentary.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
