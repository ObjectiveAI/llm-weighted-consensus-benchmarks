The key terms seem to point towards either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" as the potential categories. Since it focuses on user access to boards and sprints, \"Access\" might be the better fit. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, considering it involves adding user permissions. I'll choose \"Access\" for this ticket.**Selecting Category for Ticket**\n\nI'm deciding between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" for the ticket. It discusses adding a user, invites, boards, backlog, and sprints, which points more towards access management and onboarding. So, I think \"Access\" is the right choice. The output needs to be a JSON object with the category specified. I'll respond simply with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra commentary is required since the user just asked for the categorization."
