The term \"console\" implies an admin console, evoking thoughts about access permissions. The mention of \"improvement\" may relate to an internal project. Overall, while the user asked for a category, it\u2019s essential to reflect the problem-solving area instead of project status. Therefore, I think \"Internal Project\" might be the best fit.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI'm noticing a problem with the phrase \"hosts disappeared console,\" which raises concerns. I\u2019m weighing between \"Hardware\" and \"Internal Project\" as better options. Since \"hosts\" and \"console\" relate to hardware, \"Hardware\" seems most appropriate. While \"Access\" could be considered if it were about login or permissions, this isn't the case here. I'll respond with a concise JSON object, like `{\"category\": \"Hardware\"}`, and just a brief justification, following the formatting the user requested.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
