I'll output a JSON with the category as \"Access.\"**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nI see that the ticket mentions \"confidential notice\" and \"confidential proprietary information,\" which could relate to the printing environment for sensitive materials. However, the main focus appears to be on \"card leaver,\" indicating someone leaving the organization and needing their access removed. While it might relate to \"HR Support\" for off-boarding, \"Access\" feels more accurate given the context of removing access rights. I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access\" and prepare a JSON-like structure for the output.**Outputting IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe prompt asks me to categorize an IT ticket, and it specifies that I should respond with a JSON object. Based on my analysis, I\u2019m determining that the correct category is \"Access.\" I need to ensure the formatting is precise as per the provided schema.\n\nSo my final response will be:  \n{\"category\":\"Access\"}  \n\nI'll stick to this format, using proper case and no extra text, just as instructed."
