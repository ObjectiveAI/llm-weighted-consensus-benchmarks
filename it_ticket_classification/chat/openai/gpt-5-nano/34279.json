Since it looks like a procurement request, I think the best fit would be the \"Purchase\" category, especially since it seems to involve hardware. I'll classify it as \"Purchase.\"**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI need to output in a JSON-like format according to the instructions. The requirement states to create an object with a category field set to the chosen string. Since I classified the IT ticket as \"Purchase,\" I'll produce: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It's important to be concise and deliver only the category in the response. The user requested, \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" so let's make sure we provide just that!"
