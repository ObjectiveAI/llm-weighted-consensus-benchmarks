It appears to be an access or login issue, with messages indicating authentication failures and requesting contact with the administrator. Based on this context, the most suitable category seems to be either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's issue is about logging into Oracle with a new user account, and the authentication has failed. Since it mainly concerns access, the most fitting category appears to be \"Access.\" It could also consider \"Administrative rights\" if it involved permissions, but it seems more focused on connection issues without permission problems.
