It mentions adding an overtime line for a project called \"real control portal\" and various modifications regarding its status. The provided categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Since it relates to software development, it seems like it could fall under \"Internal Project,\" although \"Software Development\" isn't an option.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the most appropriate category for an IT ticket related to adding an overtime line and modifying a portal. It seems to fit best under \"Internal Project,\" but \"Miscellaneous\" and \"Administrative Rights\" are also possibilities. Since the ticket specifically discusses project modifications and status approvals, I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project.\" I need to format the answer as a JSON object with the category field as specified in the instructions. This should look like: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
