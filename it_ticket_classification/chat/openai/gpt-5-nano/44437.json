Maybe I can break it down by urgency: high, medium, and low priority. Then there's the type of issue, like software bugs, hardware problems, or access issues. Oh, I want to make sure this process is clear so it helps users get the right support quickly! Let\u2019s do this!**Analyzing user complaint**\n\nThe user provided a detailed complaint about the Oracle expenses mobile app, highlighting several issues. They mentioned trouble uploading receipts, connection problems, and the app's requirement for higher resolution photos. They suggested taking pictures at full resolution or uploading via desktop. The user's frustration is clear, and they\u2019re asking for clarification on how the app works, as well as a fix since it doesn\u2019t seem fit for purpose. It's crucial to address these concerns!**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket according to allowed categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nSince this ticket is about a mobile app, I'm thinking it might fit under \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Access\" could fit if it were a login problem, but it's mainly about functionality issues. The user mentioned \"connection\" and \"upload\" problems, which complicates things. I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best choice here!{\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}"
