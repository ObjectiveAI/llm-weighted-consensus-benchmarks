The content discusses active tasks and errors, making it potentially fit into \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access.\" There's a request for confirmation about currently active tasks since there's a note about ongoing issues. However, it doesn't relate to hardware or storage. It seems likely to be \"Administrative rights\" or possibly \"Internal Project.\"**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nIt looks like the ticket is related to tasks, so it might fit as \"Internal Project\" since it involves project task management. The categories are broad, but here\u2019s my thinking: if the issue is about access or login, it would go under \"Access.\" However, since the ticket refers to confirming active tasks and mentions an \"administrator,\" it seems more about project management tasks. I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" since it concerns task status.**Formatting the IT ticket response**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that \"Administrative rights\" might not be the correct choice since the issue isn\u2019t about permissions. The user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, so I should respond with a JSON object. It looks like the right format is: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, based on the allowed categories provided. However, I'm wondering if I should keep the answer minimal or ask clarifying questions. Despite that, I'll proceed with delivering the required format for the response."
