I\u2019m trying to determine whether it fits better under \u201cHardware\u201d or \u201cStorage.\u201d Since it\u2019s about memory upgrades and installation requests, it definitely leans towards \u201cHardware,\u201d but \u201cPurchase\u201d could also work due to the ordering aspect. Overall, I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit for this ticket.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at this IT ticket and considering how to categorize it. The user requests installation tickets, which points to a memory module upgrade. While \u201cPurchase\u201d could fit due to the procurement aspect, the primary focus seems to be on hardware. I\u2019m leaning toward \u201cHardware\u201d since that\u2019s the main subject.
