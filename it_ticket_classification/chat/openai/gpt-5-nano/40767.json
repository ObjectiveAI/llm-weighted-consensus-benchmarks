It\u2019s important to identify whether it\u2019s a bug, a feature request, or a service request. I wonder if we should also consider the priority level. Should I ask for more details to ensure we categorize it properly? I want to make sure it goes to the right team and is resolved quickly. Let\u2019s take this step by step to get it right!**Interpreting Security Exceptions**\n\nThe user reported a technical issue relating to a security exception while attempting to click a meeting link sent on Thursday. Their message is a bit jumbled, but it seems they\u2019ve been facing this problem for a few weeks when trying to join meetings. Essentially, they're encountering errors associated with an invalid certificate in their browser. I need to ensure that we understand this correctly and guide them on how to resolve the security exception effectively.**Categorizing Access Issues**\n\nIt looks like the user has been having trouble joining meetings for weeks, facing exceptions when clicking links in their browser. They mentioned never being prompted to add an exception and encountering an invalid certificate error. This sounds like an access issue, likely when trying to join meetings, possibly via platforms like Zoom or Microsoft Teams. While it's possible it relates to administrative rights, \"Access\" seems to be the best fit for categorization. I\u2019ll structure the output as a JSON object with the category \"Access\".{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
