It could fall under \"HR Support,\" given the mention of leave balance. But since it also talks about a \"deleted card,\" it might fit in \"Access\" if it's about restoring access. I need to decide which category best aligns with the user's intent.**Classifying the ticket**\n\nI'm looking at the user message where \"annual leave\" clearly points toward an HR issue. The ticket seems to involve a \"deleted card\" or something related to \"leave balance,\" so it makes sense to categorize it under \"HR Support\" given it's about HR processes. The \"awaiting approval\" part reinforces the HR workflow aspect. I will respond with a JSON-like object structured like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That should fit the required format perfectly!**Confirming category response**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket and has provided the ticket text. I can confirm the best fit is \"HR Support,\" so I'll keep my response succinct. I\u2019ll say something like: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It's clear and to the point! If the user needs more details or wants to explore multiple categories, they can always ask. For now, I\u2019ll stick to this concise response."
