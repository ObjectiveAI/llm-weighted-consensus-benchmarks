Given the options available, it seems to fit best under \"Access,\" although \"Administrative rights\" could also work, since it's about granting rights. Plus, \"pm\" might refer to \"project manager\" or \"permission management,\" and \"interim head\" likely indicates some temporary leadership role.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nGiven the available categories, \"Access\" seems broad but suitable for this ticket about permissions. The mention of \"write permissions\" does suggest it's related to access rights. However, \"Administrative rights\" is more specific and typically involves higher-level access. Since the user stated \"permissions on new February PM,\" I think it makes sense to go with the broader category of \"Access\" for simplicity. I'll respond with a JSON object that includes \"category\" set to \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
