The ticket mentions details about a leaver form, mailbox access, and various rights related to IT services. Given the categories available\u2014such as Hardware, HR Support, Access, and more\u2014it seems most appropriate to classify this ticket under \"HR Support\" due to its focus on employee transitions and related access issues. I'll ensure to categorize it correctly for efficient processing!**Determining the Correct Category**\n\nI need to select the category that fits best for the IT ticket. The text repeatedly refers to \"leaver\" and includes terms like \"leaver form,\" \"leave date,\" \"AD rights,\" \"mailbox,\" and several others. This suggests it's focused on the leaver process, access removal, and deprovisioning. Given that, I believe \"Access\" is the most appropriate category. Based on the instructions, I\u2019ll output the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Although \"Administrative rights\" could work too, the content mainly relates to access.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
