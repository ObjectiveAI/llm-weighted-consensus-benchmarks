The user provided a message asking to fill out a bulk starter form for an internship scheduled in July. Based on the content, it seems best suited for \"HR Support\" since it relates to interns and a formal process. While \"Internal Project\" might seem a fit too, I think HR Support is the most appropriate category here. Let's see how that works!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions filling out a \"bulk starter form,\" which I see as related to onboarding new interns, making it an HR-related administrative task. The appropriate category seems to be \"HR Support,\" which is explicitly listed. Since the user has asked for a categorization, it makes sense to respond with the category in a JSON format. I'll provide it as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} to follow their instruction correctly. I think that's straightforward and keeps it clear!"
