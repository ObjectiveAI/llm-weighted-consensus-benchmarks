The ticket requests to add a team member to a project scheduled for \"Wednesday December PM,\" and it also mentions adding the member's holidays, which seems related to scheduling. \n\nGiven that the ticket focuses on adding a team member, it could fall under \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or even \"Administrative rights.\" \"Access\" seems most relevant for project access needs, while \"Internal Project\" fits project management.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI think \"Access\" is the most suitable category since the core request is about granting access to a project. The mention of \"add his holidays\" hints at scheduling, which seems more like a Human Resources function rather than IT. Still, it might relate to recording holidays. The main focus here is still on adding a team member. I\u2019ll categorize this IT ticket as \"Access,\" and I may want to request clarification on details like the project name, member email, role, and holiday dates.**Responding with JSON**\n\n\"Access\" is clearly the right choice for the category here. The instruction I have says to respond with a JSON object, specifically just the category. The expected output is formatted as a JSON category object, so I\u2019ll provide exactly this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nEnsuring it\u2019s valid JSON is crucial since the prompt mentions that my output will be parsed by code. I won\u2019t add any extra notes or details since the instruction specifies to produce only the category. Let's proceed with that!"
