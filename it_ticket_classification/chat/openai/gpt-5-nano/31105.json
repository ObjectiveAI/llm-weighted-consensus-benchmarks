It mentions forms, compliance, and specific processes. Given the context, it looks like this could fit under \"HR Support\" since it's focused on employee departures and related procedures. Other category options include \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\", but \"HR Support\" seems most appropriate here.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nOkay, I\u2019m examining the category options for this IT ticket. The user\u2019s message highlights the \"leaver process,\" \"disabled accounts,\" and references to forms. It appears that \"Access\" might be suitable since it deals with account disabling. However, \"HR Support\" could also fit well, focusing on HR workflows related to employees leaving. Ultimately, I need to classify this correctly, so I\u2019ll choose \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" based on its content regarding offboarding and access management.**Deciding on the category**\n\nThis ticket is centered on the leaver process and various forms, but the core IT actions involve logging tickets, processing changes, and managing account access. The user\u2019s references to \"disabled\" accounts and the urgency of the \"leaver form\" suggest the \"Access\" category fits best. I need to respond with a JSON format that accurately represents this. The final response should look like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll just keep it clean, without any extra text."
