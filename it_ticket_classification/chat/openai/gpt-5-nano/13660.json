There's a hint about access and administrative rights, possibly for adding rights to a system. The mention of an internal project could relate to something in Oracle PM, suggesting that an address might be added as part of that project. Since it's about adding an address in a project management context, I think \"Internal Project\" fits best.**Assessing categorization criteria**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize a request about adding an address. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if login or permissions were involved, they only mentioned adding an address. This could relate to Oracle PM, potentially as a feature request, which might fit \"Internal Project\" or even \"Miscellaneous.\" Given the context, \"Internal Project\" seems best, as it refers to tasks in project management. If still unsure, we might lean toward \"Miscellaneous\" for a broader classification.**Determining category selection**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out the best category for a request about adding an address. The categories seem precise, and \"Access\" could apply if they were adding permissions, but it\u2019s specifically about an address, not access. \"Administrative rights\" feels close but doesn\u2019t exactly match. Given that it relates to Oracle PM, I think \"Internal Project\" fits best due to the task\u2019s nature. I'll represent this request in a concise JSON object with the category as \"Internal Project\".{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
