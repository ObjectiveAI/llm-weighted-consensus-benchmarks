It includes requests to delete or reverse the forwarder mailbox. The relevant categories I have are Access, Administrative rights, and Miscellaneous. This seems closely related to access management and the mailbox forwarding process. I'll lean towards categorizing it as \"Access\" since it involves permissions and access control due to the employee's offboarding. Let's proceed with that!**Outputting JSON for IT ticket**\n\nI could consider categorizing this IT ticket under Administrative rights since it deals with mailbox forwarding and deprovisioning. However, \"Access\" seems more appropriate. The user is looking for a JSON response with the \"category\" field defined. \n\nI\u2019ll format the response as required, so the output will be:  \n{\"category\":\"Access\"}  \n\nThis follows the guidelines perfectly, and I\u2019ll keep it clear without any extra text. Let's finalize that JSON!"
