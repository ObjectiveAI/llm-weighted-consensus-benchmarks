The ticket text is focused on approving requisitions and mentions \"approve requisition\" multiple times, which indicates it falls under \"Purchase\". Although \"Administrative rights\" could be considered if it involved access approvals, there's not enough evidence for that. I think \"Purchase\" is the most suitable category. A JSON-like response with this category field would work well.**Formatting the output**\n\nI need to provide an answer using a specific JSON format based on the provided schema. The instruction says to categorize the IT ticket, and the schema expects a JSON object with the category property. I'm going to output: `{\"category\": \"Purchase\"}`. It\u2019s really important to make sure the casing matches the expected enumerations, like using a capital \"P\" in \"Purchase\". I'll just return the JSON object without any extra text to keep it clean and straightforward."
