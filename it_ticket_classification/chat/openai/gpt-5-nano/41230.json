They mentioned an \"Oracle approval error.\" From what I see, this seems related to approvals, so it might fit under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket discusses issues with receiving approvals and errors, which further supports categorizing it accordingly. I'm aiming to choose the best category based on the user's description. Let's assign the ticket to either Access or Administrative rights.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned various phrases related to an \"Oracle approval error\" and struggling with holiday approvals. This seems to point toward approval workflows and error handling, likely involving access rights. I think I should categorize this ticket as \"Access\" since it relates to the approvals needed for holidays. While there are mentions of project work and permissions, the focus on the approval process stands out the most. So, \"Access\" feels like the best fit here!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering if \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d might be a better fit, especially since the issue seems to be around permissions while approving holidays. However, the mention of \"Oracle approval error\" leads me to think this is more about access rights tied to an Oracle system. I still believe \"Access\" is the best category since the ticket relates to approval workflow failures and permissions issues. I\u2019ll suggest next steps but mainly focus on categorizing the ticket as \"Access.\" Here's the suggested structure: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
