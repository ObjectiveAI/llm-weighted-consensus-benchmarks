It mentions a \"new starter\" and includes phrases like \"starter form\" and \"license replacing him,\" which suggest it might relate to onboarding and licenses. It seems likely this is about user access or administrative rights. The term \"center swap\" is a bit unclear, but I think the best category would be \"Access,\" focusing on user permissions and licenses.**Categorizing Ticket Options**\n\nI'm considering the best category for this IT ticket. \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it's about granting access permissions, while \"Access\" usually covers user accounts and logins. The phrase about \"license replacing him\" suggests it might involve software licensing or a role transition, which relates to access. It also could fall under \"HR Support\" due to the onboarding aspect with \"new starter\" and \"starter form.\" However, the user just needs it categorized, not to respond directly to the ticket.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nFor this IT ticket, I think the right category is \"Access,\" relating to new user access and licensing. The user has asked me to categorize it, and I need to output a JSON object in a specific format. It should include the \"category\" as a string with the value \"Access.\" So, I\u2019ll respond straightforwardly with just the required object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll make sure there's no extra text included; just the object itself."
