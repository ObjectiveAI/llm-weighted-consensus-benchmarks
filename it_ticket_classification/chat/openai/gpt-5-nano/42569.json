If they end the work relationship, they want to know if anything can be done regarding user access, specifically on administrative rights. This ticket is about a user still active in Oracle, focusing on access termination and deprovisioning. I'll categorize this under \u201cAccess\u201d because it aligns best, even though \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could apply. I should provide the category in a clear format for the response.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
