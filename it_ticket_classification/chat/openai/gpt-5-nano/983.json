I\u2019m considering the possible categories like \"Storage,\" \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" The ticket seems to focus on access rights and shared storage, particularly the mention of a mapped drive. I think the best fit would likely be \"Storage,\" considering that it emphasizes file management and installations, along with shared folders. So, I should output this in JSON format.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019ve determined that the \"Storage\" category fits the ticket best because it discusses file server storage and shared folders. While \"Internal Project\" could apply due to the installation aspect, the core focus revolves around file management and access rights. Therefore, I'll structure the output in the required JSON format, ensuring it contains just the category string. The final output will be simple: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I'll make sure to follow the structure exactly as needed."
