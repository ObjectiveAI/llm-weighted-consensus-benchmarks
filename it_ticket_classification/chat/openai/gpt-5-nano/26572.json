It concerns restricting access to \"backup on demand\" folders, which clearly falls under access control. I'm considering the distinct categories of \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the request involves modifying permissions, it likely fits into the \"Access\" category, but if it involves granting permissions, it could be \"Administrative rights.\" The user's need to restrict access is key to determining the right category here.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI realize this ticket is primarily about access management regarding \"backup on demand folders.\" While it could relate to storage, the key action here is restricting access. So, I believe categorizing it as \"Access\" is most fitting. If I need to be precise, \"Access\" relates directly to restricting permissions, unlike \"Administrative rights,\" which typically concerns admin privileges. Therefore, I'll respond in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, keeping it simple and direct."
