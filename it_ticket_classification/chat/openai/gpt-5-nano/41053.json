The ticket mentions a problem with file uploading, which might fit into \"Storage,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it\u2019s not entirely clear, \"Miscellaneous\" could work, but \"Storage\" might make more sense if it's about the file storage itself. \"Access\" might apply if permissions are the issue, but they didn\u2019t explicitly request access. This seems tricky, but I'm leaning towards \"Storage\" for now.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI think the best category for this IT ticket might be \"Miscellaneous,\" especially since the issue isn't clear. However, \"Storage\" also makes sense, as uploading files relates to storage operations. It could be \"Access\" if the user can't reach the storage location. They didn't mention error messages or file size. The ticket does mention an address, which could seem like personal data, but I\u2019ll focus on categorization only as requested. I'll respond with the chosen category.**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to format the response as a JSON object since that\u2019s how they want it. The category schema specifies that I should submit it as an object with a string for the category. My first thought is \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Access\" could also work if permission issues are involved. However, since the ticket mentions \u201cfile uploading failed,\u201d it feels more related to \"Storage,\" as it focuses on the file storage aspect. Given that, I'll go with \"Storage\" as the most relevant category."
