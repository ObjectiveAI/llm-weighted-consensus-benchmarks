The content clearly revolves around onboarding forms for a new intern. Given these details, the most appropriate category from the provided list would be \"HR Support,\" since it deals with hiring and onboarding processes. I'll make sure to categorize it correctly for better tracking and resolution!**Analyzing IT Ticket Context**\n\nI think this IT ticket is about HR integration, access provisioning, or administrative rights. The categories include HR Support, Access, and Administrative rights, which are relevant here. The references to \"starter form\" and \"filled starter forms\" suggest the user needs help creating or filling out onboarding forms for a new starter or intern. While it leans toward HR, it involves IT's role in system access. I should categorize it as HR Support, as that fits best.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user's message mentions \"filled starter forms\" and \"please fill starter form,\" which makes it a bit ambiguous. They might be trying to route to HR, but since this is an IT ticket, I shouldn't jump to conclusions. If it's about granting administrative rights, that could fit under \"Administrative rights,\" but it seems more related to onboarding and access provisioning. The best category is likely \"Access,\" as it pertains to starting forms for a new intern. I'll categorize it as \"Access\" in the JSON response.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI see that I need to create a JSON object to categorize the IT ticket. The format is specified as having \"type\":\"object\" with \"properties\" that include \"category\" as a string. Based on the provided information, I'll ensure the correct category is \"Access.\" The instructions clarify that I shouldn't add extra text, just deliver the exact JSON structure. So the final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let\u2019s go ahead and deliver that!"
