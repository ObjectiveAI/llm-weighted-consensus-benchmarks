I want to ensure they\u2019re sorted by type, priority, and department to improve efficiency in handling them. It\u2019ll make it easier for the tech team to address issues based on urgency and assign tasks correctly. I need to check if there are any existing categories we should use or if we need to create new ones. Clear categorization will definitely help streamline the support process.**Categorizing user ticket**\n\nThe user provided a ticket description that seems to mix Romanian and English, mentioning issues about updating a repository and problems with configuring an Android client and Firebase dependencies. I need to categorize this ticket among options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context, it likely fits under \"Access,\" since it involves repository access and dependency resolution. Let's pick that as the best category!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket talks about build failures, dependencies, Firebase, and an Android client, which definitely falls under software development. I'm considering the best category for this\u2014it seems like \"Internal Project\" fits best, though \"Miscellaneous\" is a possibility too. However, since it's an issue directly related to an internal project rather than hardware or access, I'll go with \"Internal Project.\" The final response should just be in JSON format: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. This should accurately reflect the ticket's context!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
