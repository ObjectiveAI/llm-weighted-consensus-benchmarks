The text mentions issues with meeting options disappearing, functionality changes, and synchronization with calendars, which suggests problems related to a meeting function in a calendar system. Since \"Software\" isn't listed, \"Miscellaneous\" might fit, but \"Access\" could also apply. I need to decide the most appropriate category among \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and others. Overall, this involves some interpretation!**Deciding category for ticket**\n\nThis ticket is about meeting functionality and calendar synchronization, so it doesn't relate to permissions or hardware. I'm considering whether to classify it as \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it's focused on software features like disappearing meeting options, it doesn't fit into categories like HR, access, or storage. \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the safest choice. I need to respond with the category in a specific JSON format. So I'll create that JSON object shortly.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
