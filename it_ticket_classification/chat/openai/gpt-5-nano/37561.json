It looks like this ticket is mainly about investigating a problem related to those approval emails. So, it might fit under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\"**Determining the Right Category**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket's content, which includes terms like \"oracle,\" \"rise ticket for call,\" \"samples,\" \"engineer,\" and \"multiple approval mails.\" I\u2019m trying to pinpoint the best category for it. It doesn\u2019t seem to fit \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" or \"Hardware,\" and \"HR Support\" isn't applicable either. Since it's a general IT support issue focusing on an approval process, \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the best fit. I'll categorize it accordingly and prepare JSON output.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket in JSON format. The user provided the ticket text and asked for categorization. I determined the category as \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\nThe output should be strict in format, like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.\n\nI might want to provide a justification, but since the user just wants the category, I will stick to that. Just the JSON response, no extra text. I'll make sure it looks exactly as needed."
