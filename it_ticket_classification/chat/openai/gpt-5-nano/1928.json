Given the mention of \"add new servers to access policy,\" it seems to relate to changes in access control. I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing this ticket as \"Access\" since it\u2019s about managing server access, although \"Administrative rights\" could also fit.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the ticket, and while \"Administrative rights\" might fit, it\u2019s not a perfect match. The phrase \"assign order\" is a bit unclear\u2014it might be an error or a ticket assignment request, but it adds confusion. Ultimately, I think the best categorization is \"Access\" since it directly relates to the servers' access policy. The output needs to be a JSON object formatted as {\"category\": \"Access\"}, and I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s just the JSON with no extra text for clarity.**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nThe content of the ticket mentions \"add new servers to access policy\" and includes \"please assign order.\" I think this means a request to update the access policy and possibly assign the task to someone. Since this revolves around managing access, categorizing it as \"Access\" is fitting. I\u2019ll prepare the output as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Okay, let's go ahead with that!"
