They mention needing access to \"pas\" for Friday PM and refer to restricted sharing and form links. It seems to involve access control and viewing links that owners manage. They also note a high priority. I need to decide if this fits best under Access or Administrative rights since there's a specific category for that. I'll choose the category carefully!**Finalizing access category**\n\nThe ticket is about access control rights for viewing forms in the cost center folder. I think it's best categorized under \"Access,\" as it seems more general than \"Administrative rights.\" Phrases like \"restricted shared\" and \"ownership view\" indicate it's about permission management rather than granting admin privileges. So, I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format for the category: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra commentary needed; just keeping it clear and straightforward!"
