The ticket mentions issues with an \"error\" related to a \"card\" and \"remove entries for week.\" This sounds like it could be an access issue, maybe connected to an access card or a financial card. Based on the context, it seems to lean more toward \"Access\" than anything else.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket could potentially fit into \"Administrative rights\" if it concerns permissions for removing entries. However, it\u2019s pretty garbled with phrases like \"issue related card... could submit card due following error.\" This suggests it might be about a \"card submission\" issue. If it's more about card data, it could relate to \"Storage.\" The mention of removing entries implies they want to delete something weekly, so \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, but I need to choose the best fit.**Interpreting ticket details**\n\nI\u2019m parsing the ticket, which mentions an error about submitting a \"card\" entry and wanting to remove entries for the week. This suggests the user might need \"Administrative rights\" to delete those entries, which typically involves permission requests. However, it could also indicate a bug related to the \"card submission.\" If that's the case, I might categorize it under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s linked to development work. Ultimately, \"Administrative rights\" seems to fit best for permission-related queries.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
