The user provided a somewhat jumbled request about amending notifications linked to low satisfaction scores. The available categories from the system include options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I need to determine which category best fits the request. It seems like figuring out the relevant category is crucial for processing this ticket effectively!**Interpreting user content**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a complex request that involves amending notifications for tickets related to low satisfaction scores, specifically about a license issue. It seems to relate to an internal support request focusing on the feedback handling process, complaints, and possibly adding features to improve communication and resolution. There are mentions of overall satisfaction and the difficulties in finding relevant information without assistance. It definitely feels messy, but I\u2019m keen to clarify and address it appropriately!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize the IT ticket based on the user's request. It touches on communication steps, feedback handling processes, and includes a license reference, yet the available categories don\u2019t specifically say \"Customer Support\" or \"Feedback Handling.\" I\u2019m considering \"Internal Project\" since it seems related to improving processes for handling feedback and notifications. \"Miscellaneous\" could also fit, but since the user specifically asked for a categorization, I think I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It feels like the best match!**Finalizing the IT ticket category**\n\nThe user is asking to initiate a complaint and follow the feedback handling process, which indicates it\u2019s more aligned with \"Internal Project.\" I want to keep it straightforward and just classify this accordingly. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object to match the format expected: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It seems clean and efficient, focusing only on the essential information without any extra text. Let\u2019s go ahead with that!"
