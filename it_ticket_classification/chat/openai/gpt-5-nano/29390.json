I see references to both an old monitor and a request, which means it could be categorized as either \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" If it\u2019s a request to acquire new equipment, \"Purchase\" fits, but if it's more about a hardware issue or installation, \"Hardware\" would be the choice.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"pc monitor request\" indicates it's a hardware request. Since the user asked me to categorize the IT ticket without needing an explanation, I think \"Hardware\" is the right choice because it's about monitors and procurement. Although it could also lean toward \"Purchase\" since they're requesting a monitor, the wording implies more of a need for assistance rather than placing an order. So, I'll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Determining the category for the request**\n\nThe main focus is on hardware, specifically a monitor. If the user is asking for a monitor, it might fit into the \"Purchase\" category if they're looking to procure one. The text mentions \"pc monitor request,\" indicating they may want assistance with multiple screens for VMs and IDEs. However, \"request\" suggests it could also be a service inquiry rather than an order. Given these details, I must decide between categorizing it as \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase\" based on what's typically expected.**Deciding on ticket classification**\n\nIn categorizing the IT ticket, I see that \"Hardware\" is typically for issues or requests related to physical devices, while \"Purchase\" focuses on acquiring new hardware. The user's phrase about requesting a monitor hints at a potential purchase, but they also mention multiple screens and old equipment, implying it could be about setting up something rather than buying. Since there\u2019s no clear mention of \"buy\" or \"order,\" I think classifying it as \"Hardware\" is the safest option.**Finalizing the ticket classification**\n\nThe instruction is to categorize the IT ticket, and while \"Purchase\" could be more precise, I think \"Hardware\" is the most fitting choice since it directly relates to hardware devices like monitors. The phrase \"request pm pc monitor\" is a bit unclear, possibly meaning \"per PM\" as in project manager, but it reinforces the hardware focus. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" and respond succinctly with the output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
