The user mentioned they're having issues with uploading a contract, indicating a potential problem with \"Storage\" or \"Access.\" However, since they're also asking for assistance in attaching it for approval, it might actually relate more to \"Administrative rights\" due to permissions needed to upload or push for approval. I'll structure this information in a JSON format with the appropriate category.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned \"approval id baa dc,\" which suggests a workflow might be needed for approval, but it\u2019s not really clear. For categories, \"Access\" typically applies to login or permission issues, while \"Administrative rights\" cover admin privileges. The issue could also relate to \"Storage\" if it's about file quota. Since the user is trying to attach a file for approval, it could fit as \"Miscellaneous,\" but I\u2019ll focus on Access, Administrative rights, or Storage.**Determining the category**\n\nThe situation seems to revolve around uploading a file, which could point to a \"Storage\" issue if there\u2019s a restriction in the system. However, the request for help pushes me toward \"Administrative rights,\" since it seems they need permission to attach the file for approval. The user specifically asked if someone could attach the file, suggesting that the access permissions could be the root issue. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Access,\" focusing on the permissions needed to upload or attach.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
