I think the best fit is `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}` because the user's task relates to handling HR data for a line manager change. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant since such changes often require admin privileges in systems. Still, since \"line manager\" is primarily about HR, I'll stick with \"HR Support\" as it aligns with the request more closely.**Finalizing category response**\n\nI need to return `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}` as the final response. The user emphasized \"line manager change\" twice, which confirms that HR Support is the right category. To keep it concise and straightforward, I\u2019ll just provide this classification, unless they ask for triage steps later. Since the request instructs to categorize an IT ticket, it makes sense to stick to only the category in the JSON format. So, this response should be clear and simple!"
