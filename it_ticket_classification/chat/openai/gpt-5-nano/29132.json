The available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nI'll analyze the user's request to find the best fit among those categories. Since this seems related to a purchase and is asking about installation, I\u2019ll likely categorize it under \"Purchase.\" \n\nI\u2019ll get that formatted into a JSON response with the appropriate category.**Categorizing IT ticket content**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket content which includes details about a new purchase and installation of replacement glass for emergency exit buttons. The keywords like \"new purchase,\" \"log installation,\" and \"mandatory receipts\" suggest that it's primarily about purchasing items. \n\nSince the focus is on a purchase, I believe the best category for this IT ticket is \"Purchase.\" Now, I just need to format that into a JSON object string as instructed. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll return: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI'm double-checking to see if there's a better category than \"Purchase.\" While \"Hardware\" could fit for replacement glass, the focus on purchasing, installation logging, and receipts strongly ties it to procurement. Other categories like \"Internal Project\" don't seem relevant.\n\nSince \"Purchase\" clearly aligns best with the content, I'll respond with the required JSON output. So, I'll deliver: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
