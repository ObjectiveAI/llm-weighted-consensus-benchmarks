I see connections to both \"Storage\" and \"Internal Project,\" but \"Storage\" seems to be the most fitting category since it's primarily about backups. I should classify this ticket under \"Storage\" while noting its relevance to an internal project as well.**Determining the category**\n\nI'm assessing categories for an IT ticket focused on backing up machines and storing backups. The primary theme is data storage, so \"Storage\" seems like the best fit. I need to respond with a JSON object that includes the \"category\" field. Given the format requirements, I\u2019ll present it like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. However, I might still wonder if \"Internal Project\" could be more accurate, as it relates to a specific project. But storage is the main focus.**Finalizing the response**\n\nThe ticket refers to \"project July PM\" and mentions \"next annual leave agile ext,\" which might stand for an extension of agile practices. However, the main focus is on backups, so \"Storage\" is the most appropriate category. I want to keep my response concise and strictly follow the instruction to categorize without adding extra text. Therefore, I\u2019ll produce the JSON object with the category as follows: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. Time to deliver this!"
