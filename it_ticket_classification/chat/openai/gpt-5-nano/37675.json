We might also consider \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Storage\" seems like the most accurate choice. Let's go with that!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe issue is clearly about insufficient disk space preventing a Windows upgrade, so the category should be \"Storage.\" I need to respond with the correct JSON object format, which requires me to include the category as a string: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. It's crucial to ensure the capitalization is accurate. Since the user asked for categorization, I'll stick to just providing the category object without any extra details. Let's finalize that response!"
