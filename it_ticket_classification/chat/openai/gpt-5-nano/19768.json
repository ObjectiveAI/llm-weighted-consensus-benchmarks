The phrasing is a bit unclear, but it seems to be asking to switch access cards possibly for March. There's a mention of shifts starting today and a request related to work schedules. Given the context, I feel this ticket falls under the \"Access\" category, as it's about providing access to cards for users.**Classifying IT ticket details**\n\nThe user mentions \"cleaning swapped shifts starting today,\" which suggests they might be scheduling shifts for cleaning staff. The content focuses on access cards and shifts, pointing toward access control and scheduling. I believe the \"Access\" category is fitting. However, if it involves access rights to a system, \"Administrative rights\" could also apply. But since it specifies \"switch access cards,\" I'm concluding that it relates to physical access cards. Therefore, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
