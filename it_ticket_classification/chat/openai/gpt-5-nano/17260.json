Key phrases include \"technical evaluator to be added Friday\" and \"please add technical evaluator requisition.\" From the categories available, I think \"Access\" could fit, since granting access might be required. \"Administrative rights\" could also be suitable for permissions related to the evaluator's role. I'm considering the best match!**Deciding on access category**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the IT ticket that seems to request adding a technical evaluator, likely a user role related to access provisioning. I\u2019m considering categorizing it as \"Access\" since that fits best. Alternatively, it could be \"Internal Project\" if it relates to a specific project. However, the use of \"requisition\" hints at a procurement aspect, which also leans toward \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the details, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" for this case!**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on the format for the output, which requires a JSON structure. It specifies that I need an object type with a \"category\" field. Since I've decided on \"Access,\" the final JSON snippet will be `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I need to make sure there\u2019s no extra text, just the clean JSON output as instructed. Double-checking, everything aligns with the category list, so I feel confident moving forward with this response!"
