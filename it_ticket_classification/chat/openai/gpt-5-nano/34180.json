They mention being able to access their calendar yesterday but facing difficulties today, including an error when trying to add a meeting. Given the available categories, \"Access\" seems to fit best, although \"Administrative rights\" could also apply since it involves calendar access. I need to select the most relevant category based on the issue described.**Identifying IT ticket issues**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the user\u2019s message about not being able to access team members' calendars. It seems they're experiencing an access issue, and they mentioned an error about identifying the calendar owner, likely pointing to access rights. For categorization, \"Access\" fits well. However, I\u2019m also considering \"Administrative rights\" since there may be a permission aspect at play. Ultimately, it appears to be about needing proper rights to view those calendars from team members.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
