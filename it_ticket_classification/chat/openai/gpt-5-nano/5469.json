So, I'll categorize this ticket under \"Access,\" since it primarily relates to permissions and access to the board. \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant. But access seems to be the main focus here.**Categorizing access requests**\n\nThe message states, \"access to board ... please view add clone issues tasks board view detail.\" It seems they're asking for access to a board, likely related to project management (like Jira or Trello). The user wants permission to view, add, and clone tasks or issues. This clearly points towards the \"Access\" category. \n\nWhile \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if admin privileges were requested, they didn't explicitly ask for that. Hence, I think \"Access\" is the best fit. I\u2019ll categorize it as such and include a note about the request's specifics.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to respond in a specific format: a JSON-like object with a \"category\" field. The prompt shows that they want us to categorize the IT ticket. It clearly states \"Categorize this IT Ticket:\" followed by the ticket details. The category needs to be one from the provided options. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll output it as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to ensure I'm following the format exactly, using a capital \"A\" for \"Access.\" Keeping it concise with no extra text is key here. Let's deliver that!"
