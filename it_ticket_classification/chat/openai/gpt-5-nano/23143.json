The relevant categories are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket clearly focuses on user access, especially since it mentions disabling the account and removing from groups. Since the core issue is about access control, it seems like the best category here would be \"Access.\" So, I'll classify this ticket under Access.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to ensure that I'm consistent with the IT ticket categorization. The user has asked for the ticket to be categorized, so I should respond with something simple. \n\nI\u2019ll format the response as JSON with the category field. Based on the ticket details, the category will be \"Access.\" The system guidelines suggest that I keep the response minimal, focusing solely on the category without additional commentary. So, I\u2019ll proceed with: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
