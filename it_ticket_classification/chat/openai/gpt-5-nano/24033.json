The ticket's content seems messy but revolves around storage drives, backups, and drive mapping. With repeated mentions of \"drive,\" \"storage,\" and related terms, it seems most appropriate to categorize it under Storage. There\u2019s also some overlap with Hardware, but Storage likely captures the main issue better since it focuses on drive functionalities and configurations.**Providing JSON Output**\n\nThe appropriate category for this IT ticket is clearly Storage. I need to prepare a JSON output according to the specified format. The required output should be a JSON object with the property \"category\" set to \"Storage\". Although I see a more complicated schema mentioned, it feels unnecessary for just providing the category. So, I\u2019ll simplify it to the standard format: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. It\u2019s clear and gets straight to the point!"
