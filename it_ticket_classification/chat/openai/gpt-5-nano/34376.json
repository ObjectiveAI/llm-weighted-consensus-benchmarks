The user requested categorization for a ticket concerning access issues related to a build machine and code repository. Given that the ticket mentions access being blocked, it clearly falls under the \"Access\" category. Now, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON-like object to reflect this decision.**Determining Access Category**\n\nThis ticket clearly relates to access issues regarding a build machine and code repository after servers were migrated. It mentions being unable to access the build machine and that it's causing a blocker. Given these points, \"Access\" is indeed the right category for this issue because it directly involves permissions and access. Since the user wants me to categorize it, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object with the category set to \"Access\" as instructed.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nThe provided schema indicates that I need to respond with a JSON object, specifically with a \"category\" key. So, I'll craft the response as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The formatting should remain simple, as the app expects it in plain text. Although I could add a brief rationale, it seems unnecessary since the user requested just the categorization. Following the policy of providing only what's needed, I\u2019ll finalize the output with just the JSON structure."
