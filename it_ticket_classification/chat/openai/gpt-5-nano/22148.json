The user wants to create separate installation tickets for upgrading machines, which seems to involve hardware provisioning. The available categories include \"Hardware,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and others. It doesn\u2019t seem like they are requesting administrative rights, so I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit here. I'll output this as a JSON object with the category specified.**Deciding on Category**\n\nI\u2019m categorizing the task related to hardware and software installation. It seems like it could fit into \"Hardware\" since it involves installation tickets and upgrading machines. While \"Internal Project\" might apply to procedural tasks, \"Hardware\" is more relevant here because it's about provisioning equipment. They mention \"purchased,\" which suggests items have already been bought for these upgrades. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" and prepare the output as a valid JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe task asks me to categorize the IT ticket and deliver it as a JSON object. The schema specifies that I should include a \"category\" field. I\u2019ve determined \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category, so I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. While I might want to include a justification, the instructions say it\u2019s not required. To keep things straightforward, I'll keep it simple and just provide the JSON output as specified."
