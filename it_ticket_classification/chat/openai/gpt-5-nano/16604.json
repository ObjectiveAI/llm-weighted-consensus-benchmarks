Given that it references \"leaver,\" \"AD rights,\" and \"revoking access,\" I think the most fitting category is \"Access.\" I'll go ahead and create the JSON output accordingly.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI\u2019m considering the category options, and \"Administrative rights\" is another viable choice because it specifically relates to admin rights. However, since the text focuses on AD rights and user access, it seems most appropriate to categorize it under \"Access.\" For the JSON response, I need to make sure it meets the spec precisely. So, I\u2019ll format it as {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra comments or details. Let\u2019s go with that!"
