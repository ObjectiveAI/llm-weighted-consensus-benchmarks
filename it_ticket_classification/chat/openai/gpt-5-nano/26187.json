However, there\u2019s a mention of \"telephony,\" which could also point to a different category. Overall, I\u2019m leaning toward \"Storage\" as the most appropriate classification.**Formatting category response**\n\nThe phrase \"monthly backup\" clearly indicates that backups relate to storage, so I'll categorize it as \"Storage.\" I need to respond in JSON format as instructed, starting with the prompt \"Categorize this IT Ticket.\" \n\nSince the category options include \"Storage,\" it fits the criteria perfectly. The required format seems to be a JSON object detailing the category. To confirm, I\u2019ll format the output as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. \n\nI could also include a brief justification for clarity.**Outputting the category**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket without adding any extra content unless specified. Since the prompt directly asks to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" it seems best to respond with just the category in JSON format. \n\nI\u2019ll provide the answer as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. Keeping it simple and straightforward aligns with the user's request! So, I\u2019ll go ahead and proceed with that response."
