The user is requesting to grant access for these reports, which are opening blank, and there are mentions of ex-employee details. Since this primarily concerns access control and permissions, it seems fitting to categorize it under \"Access.\" However, \"Administrative rights\" might also be relevant; still, \"Access\" feels like the best fit overall.**Choosing a ticket category**\n\nI'm looking at a ticket regarding access to reports and the confusion around granting rights to heads of departments (HODs). The request clearly focuses on access and viewing issues with the reports, which are opening blank. Given that the main point revolves around access rights, the most appropriate category here is \"Access.\" I need to format my response as a JSON object specifying the category. Alright, let\u2019s get that structured correctly! \n\n```json\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n```**Responding with JSON format**\n\nI see that I need to categorize the IT ticket using the specified format. I'll create a simple JSON object with the category set to \"Access.\" The schema guides me to ensure it fits the correct structure. So, my response will be straightforward: no extra explanations needed. Here\u2019s how I'll format my answer: \n\n```json\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n```"
