They mentioned wanting to \"share filters\" and \"allowing him to share filters.\" This suggests it could be related to access control or permissions, which leads me to think it fits best under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The reference to the project might also link it to \"Internal Project.\" Let's decide on the most fitting category based on that!**Determining the right category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning toward categorizing this request as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since both could apply somewhat. However, the user seems to want to adjust permissions for sharing filters, so \"Access\" really fits best. It\u2019s about granting permission rather than admin privileges. I\u2019ll go ahead and format this as a JSON object indicating the \"Access\" category, capturing the essence of their request accurately! It\u2019s crucial to get the categorization right for effective resolution.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
