The text mentions \"end of employment,\" \"termination date,\" and \"shut off,\" which indicates it's related to HR or access issues. The relevant categories are \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and possibly \"Administrative Rights.\" Given the context, it seems like the best fit would be either HR Support or Access, especially since it suggests the need to deactivate accounts.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis IT ticket is about disabling access due to termination, so I need to categorize it. The relevant categories are \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\" Since it\u2019s focused on removing access, I think \"Access\" is the best fit. The user needs the response in a specific JSON format, with just the category field. So, my response will be a simple JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text\u2014just the JSON as requested!**Confirming the category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the earlier \"Valid channels\" which show that I need to respond with a specific JSON format for the category. The instruction mentions a \"category\" type with possible values, and I normally respond with something like {\"category\":\"Access\"} based on the context. \n\nWhile \"HR Support\" could be a candidate, the main action is to \"shut off AD,\" which indicates it\u2019s an access-related task. So, I\u2019m going with \"Access.\" My final response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
