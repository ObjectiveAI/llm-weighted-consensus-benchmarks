The ticket mentions problems with network connections after a move, which clearly relates to hardware. So, I should classify this under the \"Hardware\" category since it directly involves a hardware device. I'll prepare the output in JSON format with the category field.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI need to follow the provided format for this IT ticket categorization. The schema requires me to respond with a JSON object, specifically including the \"category\" property with a value from the allowed list. Based on the user\u2019s ticket details, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" So my final response will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I have to ensure it's only the JSON object without any extra text or notes, just the category as instructed."
