While I considered other categories like Administrative rights and Miscellaneous, the most fitting choice here is \"Hardware,\" since that aligns best with the problem presented regarding the phone.**Delivering Category Response**\n\nThe text mentions keywords like \"meeting room,\" \"outage,\" and \"morning restart,\" suggesting an issue with room devices. I need to categorize this IT ticket as either \"Hardware\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context, it seems \"Hardware\" is the best fit. I should respond with a structured format, specifically a JSON object indicating the category. The final response will be: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}` without any extra text. It\u2019s important to ensure it\u2019s a valid JSON object."
