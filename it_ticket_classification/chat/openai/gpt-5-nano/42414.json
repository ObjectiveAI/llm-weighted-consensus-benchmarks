The note mentions, \"access cards are not working,\" which clearly falls under the \"Access\" category since it's about access cards. There\u2019s a bit of unclear text at the end, likely referring to when it was sent and who it's addressed to. However, the main issue is about the access cards. So I'll categorize this as \"Access\" and respond in JSON format.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to format my response as a JSON object for the IT ticket categorization. The required format specifies a structure with a \"category\" key, and based on the ticket content, I\u2019ll use \"Access.\" It seems that I should only return the JSON object without any extra text to keep it clean. So, my final response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to make sure everything is accurate and follows the specified format!**Clarifying Final JSON Response**\n\nIt seems there's no need for translation; I only need to provide the category. I want to keep it straightforward by not adding any extra text. The final output should simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s formatted properly. It\u2019s important to follow the instructions carefully, so I\u2019ll ensure I'm quoting correctly and sticking strictly to what\u2019s required."
