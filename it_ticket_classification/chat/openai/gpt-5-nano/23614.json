While \"Storage\" could be a consideration in terms of email storage, it feels more accurate to classify this under \"Access.\" So I'll go ahead and classify it as \"Access.\"**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe request states, \"please add shared mailbox rights needed,\" which suggests the user is asking for rights to that mailbox. This could fit under \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Access\" is also a strong contender since it covers general access requests. I think the best fit here is \"Access\" because it's specifically about accessing a shared mailbox. So, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" Now, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object with the category set to \"Access.\"**Preparing response format**\n\nI need to make sure I return the correct format based on the user's request. I\u2019ll deliver a response as a JSON object with the category set to \"Access.\" So, my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Yes, this should align perfectly with the requirements. I\u2019m ready to deliver this response!"
