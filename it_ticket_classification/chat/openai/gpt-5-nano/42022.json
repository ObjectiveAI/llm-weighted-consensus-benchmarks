The reference to an Oracle error when submitting cards likely points to an access-related problem, possibly indicating a user permissions issue. It seems this doesn't relate to internal projects; I'll focus on access or administrative rights for categorization.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe user mentions submitting cards for approval in Oracle and references the accounts payable department. The key problem is the error that shows up when trying to submit, which leaves me questioning the best category. Hardware and storage are not applicable, and it\u2019s unlikely to relate to HR or internal projects. It could potentially be an access or administrative rights issue, with \"purchase\" being a possibility too. I need to pick the most fitting category for this ticket and prepare a JSON object with that category field.**Choosing the right category**\n\nConsidering the situation with the IT ticket, the mention of an Oracle error linked to \"cards for approval\" suggests it fits under the \"Purchase\" category, since it relates to corporate spending approvals in accounts payable. While \"Miscellaneous\" or even \"Administrative rights\" could be considered, \"Purchase\" seems the most appropriate. I need to prepare a JSON object with the category field filled correctly with \"Purchase.\" My final output will just be the JSON object with that category.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
