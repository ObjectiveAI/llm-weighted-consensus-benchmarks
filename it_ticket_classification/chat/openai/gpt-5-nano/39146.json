The possible categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Given that the issue seems related to the room's equipment, \"Hardware\" seems like the best fit, as it likely involves the AV system. \"Access\" isn't appropriate since it's not about permissions. I'll respond with the category in JSON format, identifying it as \"Hardware.\"**Creating JSON response**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to return the category in a JSON format, based on the provided ticket. The schema indicates that I should create a JSON object with a property \"category\" which can be one of the specified enum values. The text from the user indicates a hardware issue with the meeting room, so I'll categorize it as \"Hardware\". I\u2019ll format my response as a single JSON object without any extra commentary. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
