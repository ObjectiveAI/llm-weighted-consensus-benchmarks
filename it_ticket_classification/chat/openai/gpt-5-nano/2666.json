It seems to revolve around access issues and HR management. Since it mentions attrition management, the \"HR Support\" category seems fitting. However, there's also a component related to access, which could place it in the \"Access\" category too. Given the allowed categories, I'll lean towards using \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate choice.**Categorizing IT ticket content**\n\nThe user is asking about accessing attrition management reporting, likely to track details related to planned or unplanned leave and acceptance or decline requests. This sounds pretty HR-related. Since this is an IT ticket, \"Access\" seems like a strong choice, especially since the request starts with \"access to attrition management reporting.\" There is also an \"HR Support\" category that fits, but \"Access\" appears to be the most relevant for permissions to a specific report or system.**Identifying ticket category**\n\nThis request seems to be related to attrition management reporting, asking about selecting details for planned and unplanned leaves and how to handle accept or decline requests. The user\u2019s text is a bit jumbled, which makes it tricky to categorize appropriately. Given that it involves accessing a reporting tool, \"Access\" appears to be the most straightforward choice. The \"HR Support\" category could work as well, but since it centers on access, I\u2019ll go with \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
