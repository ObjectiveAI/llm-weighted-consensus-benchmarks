It could fit into \"Internal Project\" since it relates to survey distribution. \"HR Support\" might also be relevant, but it\u2019s more centered on IT. \"Miscellaneous\" could work too, given its mixed content.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket that involves scheduling an annual IT satisfaction survey, along with invites and reminders. It seems to be best suited for the \"Internal Project\" category, since it relates to managing a project within IT. I considered \"Administrative rights,\" but that doesn't fit here. \"HR Support\" might apply if it were about HR satisfaction, but this ticket clearly pertains to IT. If necessary, \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback, but I should choose one primarily.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize this IT ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it involves scheduling and reminders, which aligns with a project task. Now, I need to format the response as a JSON object according to the system\u2019s schema that requires an object with a \"category\" field. So, I\u2019m preparing to respond with just the necessary JSON: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll ensure the formatting is precise and deliver it without any extra text."
