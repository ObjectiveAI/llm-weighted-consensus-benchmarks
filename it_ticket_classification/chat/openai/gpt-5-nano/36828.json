According to the schema for categorization, the best fit for this issue is \"Storage.\" While \"Hardware\" could also be considered, \"Storage\" seems more appropriate given the context provided in the request about capacity management and upgrading.**Finalizing JSON Output**\n\nI've decided to categorize the IT ticket as \"Storage.\" According to the instructions, I need to provide only the category in the JSON format without any extra text. The tool specifically requires the response to be structured like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I've confirmed that \"Storage\" is an acceptable value according to the schema. So, I'll produce the final output as a single JSON object. I'm all set to craft that response!"
