The user\u2019s message is a bit jumbled, but it seems to involve requests like \"list all sales,\" scheduling weekly content, and adding someone by Friday morning. This feels like it touches on content scheduling, possibly related to the marketing or content team. The category options are limited, so it could fit under \"Internal Project\" if it's about an internal project or \"Administrative rights\" for permission requests.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe content mentions \"weekly sharable content out Friday afternoon,\" indicating a workflow or content calendar. The request to \"list all sales\" could mean they want a sales report, while \"please add him by Friday morning\" might involve adding someone to a schedule. It's a bit unclear, but I think it\u2019s best to categorize it as \"Internal Project\" due to the content scheduling aspect. However, if \"add him\" refers to access rights, \"Access\" could also be appropriate. I need to pick one category.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s message seems to contain several requests, like \"list all sales,\" adding someone by Friday morning, and scheduling weekly content for Friday afternoon. This suggests it's related to coordinating content release. I think the safest category is \"Internal Project.\" Since the user specifically asked to categorize this IT ticket, I need to provide a JSON-like response. I\u2019ll format it as described, ensuring it includes the category string and a brief justification.**Deciding on output format**\n\nI need to return the category as a JSON object. The best choice seems to be \"Internal Project\" because the primary focus is on coordinating weekly content. While \"Access\" could fit since it mentions adding someone by Friday morning, the main tasks are related to content scheduling. Since the instructions say the output might need to be parsed or displayed, I\u2019ll keep it simple. I\u2019ll finalize the output as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
