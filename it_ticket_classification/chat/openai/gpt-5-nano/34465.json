The most fitting category appears to be \"HR Support\" since it relates to HR processes. While \"Access\" could be considered if it's a permissions issue, it seems more HR-related overall.**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe ticket is about an Oracle timesheet issue and blocked annual leave requests, which clearly indicates it's related to HR. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" \n\nI need to respond with a JSON format because the instructions ask for a specific schema. That means I\u2019ll create an object with a category field. I\u2019m deciding on the output to be just the JSON object, as that's what the instructions emphasize. Here\u2019s how it should look:  \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
