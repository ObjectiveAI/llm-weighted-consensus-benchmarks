They mention issues with wireless connections on their laptop, which suggests a connectivity issue. It seems like the best fit would be \"Hardware\" since it likely pertains to the laptop's wireless hardware. \"Access\" also crossed my mind, but that typically relates to user access rights or logins. Given the context, categorizing it as \"Hardware\" feels appropriate here.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI need to create a JSON-like structure for categorizing an IT ticket based on specific instructions. The guidelines indicate that I should respond with a category object. I plan to output it as a JSON object with the category field set to \"Hardware,\" ensuring the format is exact. It must match the allowed values, like using a capital \"H.\" The user wants just the category, so I\u2019ll deliver only the JSON object without extra comments. Here it is:\n\n{\"category\": \"Hardware\"}"
