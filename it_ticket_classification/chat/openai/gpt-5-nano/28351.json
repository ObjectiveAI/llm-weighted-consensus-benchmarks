The provided categories are: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The user's ticket text is quite messy but mentions \"forbidden software,\" \"internal audit,\" and \"report,\" among other things. None of the categories perfectly match those terms, but I\u2019m thinking \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous\" could work best. I'll format the result in JSON as needed.**Categorizing forbidden software ticket**\n\nThe ticket is regarding forbidden software found during an internal audit, requesting a report and reminding colleagues about software policy. I\u2019m thinking the best category might be \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" It's focused on policy compliance rather than granting access. \"Internal Project\" doesn't really fit, and \"HR Support\" seems unlikely. However, \"Access\" could be suitable since it relates to restricted software. If nothing else fits, \"Miscellaneous\" could work, but I\u2019m leaning towards \"Administrative rights.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"forbidden software\" and requests a report, so the user wants me to label the category. I believe \"Administrative rights\" fits best since it pertains to software installation restrictions and policy enforcement. It's not \"Security\" since that\u2019s not in the provided category list. \"Storage,\" \"Hardware,\" and \"Software\" aren\u2019t relevant either. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Administrative rights,\" and I need to ensure my output is in the correct JSON format. I\u2019ll respond with: \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to provide a JSON object with the field spelled as \"category.\" The proper format for the output should be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nNo extra text should be included, so I'll ensure it\u2019s a clean JSON object in standard format. I want to double-check that I\u2019m not using any incorrect quotes or formatting mistakes. Okay, it seems I'm ready to provide the final answer!"
