The term \"leaver\" implies it's about someone exiting the company. Therefore, the most suitable category seems to be \"Access\" since it's focused on controlling and managing access rather than HR issues.**Providing JSON response**\n\nI need to deliver a response in JSON format based on the prompt. The schema indicates I should create an object with a category property that matches one of the predefined options. In this case, I should respond with {\"category\":\"Access\"} since the ticket relates to access cards for an employee leaving. While \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant, \"Access\" is the more appropriate category for controlling physical access. I\u2019ll make sure to keep the response strictly as valid JSON without any extra text.**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nSince this is a technical IT issue, categorizing it as \"Access\" feels most appropriate. Therefore, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format that matches this category: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's straightforward, and it ensures that I\u2019m aligning with the requirements given in the prompt. I'll go ahead and produce that response."
