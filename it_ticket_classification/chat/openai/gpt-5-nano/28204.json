It seems to relate to onboarding a new employee, which places it between HR Support and Access categories, perhaps also Administrative rights or Miscellaneous. Since the content specifically mentions a \"starter form,\" it likely is tied to setting up an account for the new employee. I'll lean towards HR Support or Access for a clearer classification.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI believe the appropriate category for this IT ticket is \"HR Support\" since it's about a new starter. However, if there's a need for access provisioning, I might consider \"Access\" as well. Without more details, sticking to HR Support seems best. I want to confirm that my output needs to be a JSON object for coding purposes, so I\u2019ll format it accordingly as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to follow this format for correctness!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned a \"new starter\" form, which clearly relates to onboarding and HR support. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and format my response as a JSON object. While there\u2019s a possibility it could involve \"Administrative rights\" if admin access is required, I think it's best to keep it simple. So, I\u2019ll focus on the clear category and respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Let's keep it straightforward!"
