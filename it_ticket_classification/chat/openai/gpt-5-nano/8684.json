The mention of \"add to cloud and infrastructure services list\" and \"planning officer infrastructure\" makes me think it relates to an internal project. However, there are also mentions of environment and print, which might lead me to \"Administrative rights.\" But categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" seems more fitting since it focuses on improving their cloud infrastructure. It\u2019s a bit unclear, but I\u2019m leaning toward that option!**Parsing IT Ticket**\n\nLet's break down the text about the IT ticket. The phrase \"add to cloud and infrastructure services list\" suggests it's about enhancing that list. There's also mention of a planning officer and environmental considerations, but no category for Environment or Green IT exists. The best category seems to be \"Internal Project,\" given that it's an internal task related to cloud infrastructure. However, I might also consider \"Purchase,\" as they could be requesting something for procurement. Overall, it's a bit ambiguous, but leaning towards \"Internal Project\" feels right!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe text doesn't specifically mention purchasing anything, and \"print\" might imply a request to print, although that's unclear. I need to return a JSON-like object with the category. The format requires a category name that must match one of the allowed values. Given the mention of \"planning officer infrastructure,\" it seems \"Internal Project\" fits best. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" The output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This should satisfy the requirement!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
