While it could also fit under \"Purchase\" if they're seeking a new one, the core focus is on hardware. So, the best fit here seems to be the \"Hardware\" category, as it aligns more directly with the request.**Finalizing category output**\n\nThe request for a \"second monitor\" suggests provisioning rather than purchasing, but the Purchase category could apply if buying is implied. However, since the text doesn't refer to cost or procurement, it leans more towards a hardware provision for a software engineer. Therefore, the correct category is \"Hardware.\" I need to format the output as a JSON object with just the category field, ensuring the spelling is precise. So, the final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
