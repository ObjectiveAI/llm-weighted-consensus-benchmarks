I need to figure out which category fits best based on those keywords. Let's see which one resonates with the user's intent!**Categorizing incoherent IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m examining what seems to be a chaotic IT ticket. It mentions phrases like \"upgrade zone,\" \"assets,\" \"version,\" \"endpoint,\" \"growth,\" and \"status,\" which make it a bit unclear overall. However, it feels like it could be about upgrading endpoints and assets or checking on upgrade statuses. I think I could potentially categorize this ticket under \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Storage.\" I really need to consider which fits best!**Aligning IT ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m working on how to categorize an IT ticket. The user's ticket seems to focus on upgrading the zone, assets, endpoints, version numbers, and growth. It looks like it could relate to upgrading endpoints and may represent a project. I'm leaning towards classifying it as \"Internal Project,\" which makes sense since it pertains to infrastructure upgrades. I need to format my response as a JSON-like object: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. Looks like I\u2019ve got a solid approach here!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
