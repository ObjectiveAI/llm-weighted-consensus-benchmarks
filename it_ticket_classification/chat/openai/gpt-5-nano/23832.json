The main focus here is on administrative rights and access control. I believe \"Administrative rights\" is the best category to use, so I'll format my final response as a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.\n\nWhile the user just asked for the category, it might be helpful to include a brief note, but ultimately, I\u2019ll follow the instruction to keep it concise and to the point without extra text.**Verifying category format**\n\nI'm considering the category format, and I've noticed that it specifies \"Administrative rights\" with a lower-case 'r' for \"rights\". It's important for me to match this exactly to adhere to the provided guidelines. So, I\u2019ll ensure that when I present the category, I use the exact casing shown in the list: \"Administrative rights\". Consistent formatting is key here, so I'm feeling good about sticking to the given standards!"
