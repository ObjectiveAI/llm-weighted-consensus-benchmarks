The user mentioned \"password reset,\" \"expire days,\" and \"change pc,\" which all relate to access and account issues. Given the terms in the message, it seems to fall under the \"Access\" category since it involves account credentials and potential locks. I want to ensure I'm picking the right category that reflects the user's needs accurately.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing this IT ticket as \"Access\" since the issue involves password resets and account expiry, which clearly pertain to system access. While there was a thought about \"Administrative rights,\" the mention of \"change pc\" and \"ctrl alt delete\" still points more directly to access issues. I\u2019ll make sure to output a valid JSON object with the category correctly formatted. So, the final response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
