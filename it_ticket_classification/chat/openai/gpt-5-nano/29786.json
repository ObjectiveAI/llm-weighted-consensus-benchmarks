They mentioned needing help completing a form for Tuesday's onboarding. I see a few possible categories, including \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" It definitely has an onboarding focus, so I think \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" makes the most sense since they might be related to setting up accounts and system access.**Categorizing an IT Ticket**\n\nThe user's message revolves around a new starter in Bogota needing help with forms, which seems related to onboarding. The possible categories are \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" Since this is an IT ticket, I might lean toward \"Access\" for provisioning if it\u2019s about accounts. However, \"HR Support\" fits better since it mentions completing forms for onboarding. I\u2019ll stick with \"HR Support\" because the focus is likely those HR-related forms. Then I need to present the category in JSON format.**Evaluating the Ticket Category**\n\nBased on the keywords like \"new starter,\" \"joining,\" and \"form completing,\" it seems related to the onboarding of a new employee, which typically involves HR. However, this is an IT ticket, and I see categories for \"HR Support\" and \"Access.\" Since access setup is critical for new starters, I think \"Access\" might be the safer choice for this ticket, especially with a focus on setting up accounts in the onboarding process. But I also need to consider the administrative aspect involved in helping with the forms."
