It\u2019s important for ensuring the right team addresses the issue quickly. I should consider factors like urgency, type of problem, and the affected systems. Breaking it down into clear categories makes it easier for everyone involved. I wonder if there\u2019s a specific format or system already in use that I should follow. Let\u2019s make sure it\u2019s organized well for everyone's benefit!**Classifying user request**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a confusing message from the user about displaying something called \"sonar\" on a TV within their network. It might relate to SonarQube, possibly involving dashboards. My goal is to classify this request into one of the categories provided. Given that the request pertains to a product and how it\u2019s displayed, it seems it could fit best under \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll need to ensure I\u2019m being accurate and clear in this classification!**Determining the category**\n\nThe user is looking for a lightweight solution to display Sonar on a TV, which feels like an Internal Project since it's focused on implementation rather than hardware issues. While \"Hardware\" might apply if it were about the TV itself, the emphasis is on software solutions for displaying Sonar dashboards. Although \"Miscellaneous\" exists, \"Internal Project\" fits best based on the user's description. I\u2019m thinking I should respond with a JSON format to categorize the ticket as required!**Generating output format**\n\nThe output format for this task is clear: I need to provide a category object that includes a \"category\" string. In this case, it should look something like: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I shouldn\u2019t include any extra explanations since the user only asked for categorization. However, I could consider proposing clarifications if necessary. For now, I\u2019ll ensure that the formatting is correct and produce the specified JSON-like object! Here we go: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
