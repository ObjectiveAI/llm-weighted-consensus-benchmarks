The categories I have to choose from include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. The content seems like it relates to changing names for interviewers and managing the ownership of interviewers, which makes \"HR Support\" a strong candidate. However, it could also fit into \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll need to decide on the best fit!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering various IT-specific categories to classify this ticket. The \"Access\" category fits well since it involves adding and removing interviewers, which relates to access control. \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, focusing on permissions. Considering the user's request to \"create owner interviewers,\" it seems to lean towards access management. There\u2019s some ambiguity regarding terms like \"naming format\" and whether they fall under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" For clarity, I believe \"Access\" is likely the best choice!**Formulating category response**\n\nThe ticket discusses changing names for interviewers and deleting them, which implies modifying user accounts according to a naming format. This points to provisioning access, so \"Access\" seems to be the right category. Now, I need to return a JSON object with this category. The required format matches the schema, needing only the category property. Therefore, I\u2019ll finalize my response as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll stick to just this JSON output with no extra text."
