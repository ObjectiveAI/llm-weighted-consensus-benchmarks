The text mentions a \"new starter\" and refers to a \"starter form,\" \"induction,\" and needing assistance to complete something. It seems primarily related to HR and administration onboarding. \"HR Support\" feels like the closest category, but since it\u2019s an IT ticket, it could also fall under \"Access\" if it's about system access for the new starter. So I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support.\"**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing the content, which seems to be about a starter form for a new employee's induction. Although it's a bit ambiguous, it looks like it pertains to completing that form. The right category is likely \"HR Support,\" as it relates to onboarding. I considered \"Administrative rights\" since that deals with system access, but it doesn't fit here. I could also think of \"Internal Project,\" but ultimately, \"HR Support\" is the best choice. Now I need to present this categorization in a specific format.**Formatting the category response**\n\nI see that the category format follows a JSON-like schema, and I need to respond with just the category string in that specific format. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" since the text mentions induction and assistance for the form, though I also thought about \"Administrative rights\" because it involves access for a new starter. However, given the ambiguity, I\u2019ll stick with \"HR Support.\" So, my final answer will simply be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I should provide this cleanly!"
