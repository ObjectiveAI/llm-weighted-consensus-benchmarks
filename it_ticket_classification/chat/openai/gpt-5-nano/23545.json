From what I can see, it mentions \"new purchase po\" and \"unshielded patch cable,\" suggesting a focus on procurement and hardware. Given the context, I think the best fit for this ticket would be either Purchase, since it's about a new purchase order, or Hardware, since it deals with a patch cable. Also, \"log installation\" indicates an installation task.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe content definitely mentions \"new purchase po\" and an installation request, which leans towards categorizing it. I could go with \"Purchase\" since it's about a new purchase order, but \"Hardware\" is also relevant because of the patch cable. However, since \"Purchase\" is specifically mentioned, I think it\u2019s the best fit. \n\nI'll respond with the appropriate JSON format: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. Let\u2019s do this!"
