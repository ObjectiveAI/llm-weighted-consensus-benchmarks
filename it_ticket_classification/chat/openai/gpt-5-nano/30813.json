The list mentions things like \"purchase order requisition,\" \"supplier,\" \"buyer,\" and \"tax justification,\" which all point towards financial details involved in procurement. It seems clear that this ticket relates to purchasing, so I\u2019ll categorize it under \"Purchase\". I'll present this in a structured format for clarity, as that\u2019s what the user is asking for.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nThe user needs me to provide a JSON-like object with a category field. The format is clear: it needs to be { \"category\": \"Purchase\" }. I\u2019ll make sure I follow the schema requirements exactly, which confirm \"Purchase\" is valid. I should present this as plain text without any additional comments to keep it clean. So, I will output it strictly as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. That way, there\u2019s no confusion!"
