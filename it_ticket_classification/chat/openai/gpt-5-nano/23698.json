The text is a bit jumbled but seems to describe a specific issue with this application. I have a category taxonomy to choose from: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The mention of \"Yammer feed\" makes it unlikely to be hardware, but it could fit under Access, Internal Project, or Miscellaneous.**Deciding category for IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket references \"site link,\" \"feed threads ingroup type view wide feed shown,\" and \"analysis discipline,\" suggesting an issue with a specific feed. It doesn't fall under \"Application issue,\" which isn't in my categories. The best fits are probably \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" If it's about fixing a Yammer feed on an internal site, \"Internal Project\" makes sense since it's related to a project. The user is asking for a JSON-like output to categorize the ticket, so I'd respond with either{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Analyzing ticket details**\n\nI need to break down the ticket text, which is a bit messy. It mentions that the \"Yammer feed on analysis discipline\" isn\u2019t working properly on \"one com.\" This could imply the issue is specific to a site related to \"analysis discipline,\" possibly referring to a group. The phrases hint that the feed isn't functioning right on one computer, but I wonder if \"one com\" might refer to a domain instead. I\u2019ll need to clarify that further.**Interpreting ticket information**\n\nThe ticket is quite a mess, but it mentions \"not working properly on one com,\" and there are repeated references to \"analysis discipline.\" I see some Romanian text that translates roughly to \"no idea about third party and supplier,\" which might indicate that it's touching on third-party involvement. I'm thinking this could relate to \"Access,\" as it seems to be about accessing the feed. However, I'm still weighing my options for the proper category.**Finalizing category response**\n\nThe ticket mentions various terms like \"site right id pointing analysis feed,\" which could imply issues with access or permissions, but it's not explicit. To be safe, I'll choose \"Internal Project\" because it relates to a site feed within the context of \"analysis discipline.\" While \"Miscellaneous\" could fit too, \u201cYammer feed not working\u201d would typically be categorized as a \"Software/Application issue,\" which isn't an option here. Therefore, \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. I\u2019ll follow the format for the JSON output and respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
