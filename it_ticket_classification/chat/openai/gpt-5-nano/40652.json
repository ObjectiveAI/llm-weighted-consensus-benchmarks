While it could relate to HR data, it primarily involves IT. \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could apply if it were a permissions issue, but the problem seems more like a software bug. \"Miscellaneous\" might cover general IT issues, and \"Internal Project\" could fit if the report is part of that, though it's unclear.\n\nUltimately, I need to choose the best category and return it in the specified JSON format.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
