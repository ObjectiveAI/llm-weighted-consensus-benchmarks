The mention of \u201cphone console\u201d could relate to hardware or access permissions, which hints at \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d or \u201cAccess.\u201d Since it's so garbled, it could fit into \u201cStorage,\u201d \u201cInternal Project,\u201d or even \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d I think I might just need to ask for clarification to ensure I'm categorizing it correctly!**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket and provided a patchy text. I can suggest the category \"Miscellaneous\" for ambiguous cases since it's a catch-all. There could also be options like \"Access\" if it relates to resource path removal or \"Administrative rights\" for permission issues. However, the text doesn't clearly indicate those. Given the limited info, I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll format my response as a JSON object to comply with the requirements. Here goes!  \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
