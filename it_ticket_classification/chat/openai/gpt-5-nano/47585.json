The user specified it as \"th floor printer,\" which I believe refers to the third floor printer. It seems to be a recurring issue, so I should categorize it. The best fit would likely be \"Hardware,\" since a printer is hardware. While \"Miscellaneous\" is an option, \"Hardware\" is more specific to the problem at hand.**Responding with JSON format**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that includes the category for the IT ticket. The instructions specify a certain format, so I\u2019ll make sure to follow that precisely. Since the issue involves a printer, it should be categorized as \"Hardware.\" Even though there are other possible categories, they don't apply here. My final response will be structured like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I won't add any unnecessary commentary. Let's stick to the format!"
