Given this context, I'd lean toward categorizing it as \"Access,\" which often includes user creation and onboarding tasks. However, \"HR Support\" might be relevant too, since it ties to employee documentation and processes.**Evaluating ticket categories**\n\nThe message includes terms like \"new starter\" and \"starter form.\" At first glance, it seems related to granting \"Administrative rights\" for a new employee. However, it also suggests HR onboarding, which typically falls under \"HR Support.\" Since these categories are IT-focused, \"HR Support\" might address HR-related issues, but not strictly IT ones. Parsing the message further, it seems they're asking to fill out and return forms concerning onboarding and access provisioning for a new starter.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe prompt requires me to categorize an IT ticket by providing a JSON-like category object. I need to decide between \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket content revolves around onboarding, not hardware or purchases. Given that \"Access\" typically refers to granting system access to new hires, and considering phrases like \"fill and return the starter form,\" I lean toward \"HR Support\" for onboarding documents. However, if admin privileges are involved, \"Administrative rights\" could be appropriate.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nThe text doesn't mention admin rights, so I can rule that out. \"Access\" is indeed one of the allowed categories, and it seems fitting since the ticket relates to starter forms for a new hire, likely involving access provisioning. However, phrases like \"please find attached\" suggest it might not explicitly indicate new user access. The alternative category, \"HR Support,\" pertains to HR processes rather than IT. Given that the content clearly involves onboarding, I'll lean toward categorizing this ticket as \"HR Support.\"**Finalizing category selection**\n\nIn the context of IT, onboarding often involves HR, but IT handles \"Access provisioning\" once they receive the new starter form. This ticket primarily concerns onboarding documentation. The safer category might be \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but since the user specified \"IT Ticket,\" I should consider the provided categories. The phrase \"starter form\" indicates it's not about hardware or storage. For new starter forms, \"HR Support\" feels fitting, yet \"Access\" aligns with typical IT workflows for provisioning tasks. Therefore, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
