They\u2019re having audio issues when connecting headphones, as they can only hear sound through the speakers. This seems linked to presentations or perhaps during conference calls. Given this, I should categorize it under \"Hardware\" since it involves audio equipment issues. The user, who is an applications engineer, needs assistance quickly, so I\u2019ll make sure to prioritize this ticket!**Categorizing IT support issue**\n\nI am trying to determine if this IT support issue is hardware or software-related. The user can\u2019t hear sound through headphones, only through the speakers, and the issue arises when presenting. It could involve \"presentation mode\" features or audio device detection. Since the problem is clearly related to the headphones, I will categorize it under \"Hardware.\" Also, I need to format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I'll make sure to follow the required structure!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
