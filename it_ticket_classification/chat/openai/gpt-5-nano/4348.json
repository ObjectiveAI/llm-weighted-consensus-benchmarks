The ticket mentions terms like \"db backup,\" \"prod database,\" and \"permissions.\" It seems to fit with categories like \"Storage\" due to the backup context, or possibly \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" since it also requests permissions for restoring the backup. The best choice seems to be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" as they align closely with the needed permissions for this task.**Categorizing IT ticket for backup**\n\nThe user likely wants to create a backup of the production database, indicated by \"generate backup prod database paste.\" The mention of \"permissions order restore backup questions\" suggests they need permissions for restore steps. In categorizing IT tickets, tasks related to backups generally fit under \"Storage.\" Since \"Administrative rights\" could apply if permissions are explicitly needed, I\u2019ll go with \"Storage\" here as it's most relevant. I\u2019ll format the response as requested in JSON: \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
