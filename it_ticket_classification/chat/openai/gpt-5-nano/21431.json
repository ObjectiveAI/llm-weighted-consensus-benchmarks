It mentions a new purchase for a docking station and requests to log the installation, which clearly indicates it's about procurement. While \"Hardware\" could apply since it involves a docking station, \"Purchase\" fits better because the focus is on the procurement and relevant documentation. So, I\u2019ll output a JSON-like object with the category marked as \"Purchase.\"**Outputting categorization**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to produce a JSON object with the category based on the specified options. Since the ticket is about a purchase request, I\u2019ll use \"Purchase\" as the category. I have to ensure that only the JSON object is displayed with the correct formatting. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} without any extra commentary. Let's keep it neat!"
