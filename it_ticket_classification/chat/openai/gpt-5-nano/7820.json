The most suitable options might be \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since this is about setting up recurring tasks for scanning wireless networks in data centers, I think \"Internal Project\" fits best. However, \"Administrative Rights\" could apply if the user needs to assign tickets to the coordinator, but it doesn\u2019t quite focus on admin rights themselves.**Selecting the right category**\n\nThis seems more like a procedural task rather than a specific IT asset, so I\u2019m going with \"Internal Project\" as the category. We need to respond with a JSON object, specifically in the format that just includes the category without any extra text. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.\n\nI\u2019ve double-checked the allowed values, and everything matches up. \"Internal Project\" is correctly formatted with a space and a capital \"P.\" I feel confident with this choice!"
