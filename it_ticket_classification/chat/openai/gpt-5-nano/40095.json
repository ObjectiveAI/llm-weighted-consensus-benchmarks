It seems they\u2019re asking to coordinate with a supplier for a price quote and possibly requesting a purchase or delivery. Since this involves procurement for equipment related to a building expansion, it likely fits into the \"Purchase\" category. Alternatively, it could also be classified as \"Internal Project\" if it is part of an ongoing internal effort.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI see that the user has mentioned liaising with a supplier for a price quote and there's a reference to a \u201cmust have card per.\u201d While it could refer to access cards, the context of the ticket leans more towards a request for procurement due to the mention of \"expansion quotation.\" Therefore, I think the most appropriate category is \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll output this as a JSON object with the category clearly defined.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to output a JSON object with the category for the IT ticket. The instruction clearly indicates that it expects a format like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I want to make sure there's no extra text in the output, keeping it clean and straightforward. So, my final output will simply be the JSON reflecting the appropriate category. I\u2019ll go ahead and deliver that now!"
