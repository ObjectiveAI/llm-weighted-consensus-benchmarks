My output will clearly indicate that the ticket is classified as \"Access.\" Let\u2019s get that formatted correctly!**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to provide the final answer as a JSON object for the category. The instruction specifies that I must include the property \"category\" with one of the allowed strings. In this case, I\u2019ll set it to \"Access\" since that fits the user's request for categorizing the IT ticket.\n\nI should keep it concise, so I\u2019ll respond with just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.
