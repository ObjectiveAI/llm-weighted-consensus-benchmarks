The ticket mentions extending a mailbox and issues with mailbox memory and archiving. It seems to relate to email mailbox storage and possibly the archive policy. The \"Storage\" category seems most fitting since it's largely about managing storage quotas, but it could also touch on \"Access\" if it involves permissions. \"Administrative rights\" might apply, but it's not the main focus.**Classifying the ticket**\n\nThe user wants to categorize an IT ticket about extending a mailbox. I believe \"Storage\" fits best since it concerns mailbox storage, archive policy, and memory. My response should be a JSON object with the category key, just as specified.\n\nSo, the final answer will be:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}\n\nI need to remember to keep it to just this JSON object without any extra text! That should cover it.**Classifying the storage issue**\n\nThe user's description points out a bug related to archive policy and memory extension, which clearly falls under storage management. So, I will categorize it as \"Storage.\" \n\nI'll respond with the necessary JSON format:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}\n\nThat's it! Time to finalize that response."
