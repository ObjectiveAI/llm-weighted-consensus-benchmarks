The categories available include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Since it specifically mentions \"annual leave,\" which is tied to HR, I'd say it fits best under \"HR Support.\" However, there's a mention of authorization, which could also relate to \"Administrative rights.\" But ultimately, this ticket aligns more closely with HR processes, so I'll go with \"HR Support.\"**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI see that the issue with adding annual leave is related to an HR process within the HR system. If the problem is due to access, it could fall under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" if they lack permission. However, because the ticket is primarily about annual leave, the best category is \"HR Support.\" I'll respond with a JSON object, clearly indicating the category, as that\u2019s what's required by the system.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
