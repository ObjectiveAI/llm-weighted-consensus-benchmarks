The ticket content mentions cable checks and replacements for various meeting rooms across different locations. I'm thinking this is related to hardware, specifically cabling infrastructure. The focus on cables and replacements suggests it fits best under the \"Hardware\" category since it involves network and AV hardware in the meeting rooms.**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket. While \"Internal Project\" or \"Maintenance\" could work, \"Hardware\" feels like the most fitting choice given the focus on cable checks and replacements. The ticket notes mention multiple locations and specific meeting rooms, which reinforces that it's about IT hardware maintenance.\n\nThe instructions ask for a JSON format, so I'll produce: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This aligns with the system's requirements. Let's keep it concise and stick to the category formatting."
