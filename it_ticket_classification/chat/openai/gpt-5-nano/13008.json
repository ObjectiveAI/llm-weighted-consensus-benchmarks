The text mentions \"remove from ad\", which might refer to Active Directory (AD) or an advertisement. It seems like the user is requesting access or removal from a directory. The phrase suggests it might fit into the \"Access\" category, as it relates to permissions. Alternatively, it could go under \"Administrative rights\" if it's asking for admin access. I'll make sure to classify it properly!**Clarifying IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe user provided a ticket to categorize, mentioning \"remove from ad.\" I need to figure out which category fits best. It could relate to access, as it seems to involve removal from Active Directory (AD). It might fall under \"Access\" for access provisioning and revocation. Alternatively, if it's asking for elevated permissions, it could be \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d However, since the content indicates removing a user from AD, \"Access\" is likely the best fit. I'll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Access\"}.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I\u2019ll just respond with the category. Based on the content, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. There's no need for extra commentary, but I want to double-check that I\u2019m not misclassifying. The phrase \u201cremove from ad\u201d clearly indicates an access removal action, which makes \"Access\" the right choice. I\u2019ll make sure to deliver the JSON structure without any additional text."
