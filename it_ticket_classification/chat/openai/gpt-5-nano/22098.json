                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user provided a sentence that seems garbled and possibly in multiple languages. It mentions \"mail technology\" and \"exclusively personnel employment contract.\" This likely relates to HR since it involves an employment contract. I\u2019m thinking about how to categorize it within the provided schema: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and more. Given the mention of the employment contract, it seems most appropriate to categorize this as \"HR Support.\" I will output a JSON with that category.**Interpreting IT ticket content**\n\nThe content includes phrases like \"mail technology\" and \"add exclusively personnel employment contract myself,\" which suggests a request to add an employment contract to a mail system. I\u2019m considering if this could relate to \"Administrative rights,\" but there's no clear mention of access. The phrasing is a bit messy, likely needing interpretation. It might indicate a request for access to that document. Overall, it feels like an HR-related request rather than technical support.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket could be about an \"exclusively personnel employment contract,\" possibly indicating a request for exclusive access to it. Alternatively, they might want to create an email signature related to mail technology. I need to choose the best classification from the available categories like Hardware, HR Support, or Access. Given the mention of \"employment contract,\" it suggests that this is more oriented toward \"HR Support,\" even though there\u2019s a chance it could relate to access rights.**Interpreting ticket classification**\n\nThe phrase \"unit fie automat la\" might be a Romanian phrase, but I'm not entirely sure of its meaning. The request involves \"employment contract,\" prompting me to categorize it as \"HR Support,\" even though the ticket also mentions \"mail technology.\" It appears to be a request to add an \"exclusively personnel employment contract\" to the mail system. I think it\u2019s best to classify it as \"Storage\" for documents while also seeking clarification from the user. I\u2019ll format this as a JSON object for clarity.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe request involves an \"employment contract,\" which typically falls under HR functions. However, within the IT context, it could relate to access rights. The phrase \"add exclusively personnel employment contract myself\" likely indicates a desire to grant access to a contract file. Since there\u2019s no specific mention of administrative rights, \"Access\" seems like the best category. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"} as the prompt asks for the category only."
