I need to accurately classify it to ensure proper handling.**Classifying survey-related tickets**\n\nI'm analyzing a ticket related to sending surveys and managing contacts. It involves manually extracting lists, correcting misspelled names, removing inactive contacts, and discussing automation to streamline these processes. The provided categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and more.\n\nGiven the emphasis on automation and backlog, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit, but I also consider \"Administrative Rights\" or \"Access\" for enabling sync. It looks like I need to finalize the appropriate category while also noting a possible escalation to the Engagement team.**Finalizing the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket. While \"Administrative Rights\" might seem relevant due to requests for feature enabling, it doesn't fit perfectly. \"Internal Project\" feels more appropriate.\n\nI need to output this in JSON format as instructed, which should reflect: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.\n\nI\u2019ll craft it as a JSON object based on the schema guidelines, ensuring the format is precise and following the instruction to provide only the category.
