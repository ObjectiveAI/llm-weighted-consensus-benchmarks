The user is asking about broken patch cords in meeting rooms, and I'm guessing it's referring to the 7th floor. The issue is that a latching tab is broken, causing the plug to be easily pulled out. I think this falls under the \"Hardware\" category since it involves cables. It might also relate to maintenance, but Hardware looks like the best fit.**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to create a JSON-like category object for the IT ticket, following specific formatting instructions. The response should include \"type\": \"object\" and \"properties\" that outline acceptable categories. In this case, I'll categorize the issue as \"Hardware.\" Therefore, I\u2019ll produce the response in the needed format as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I want to ensure it matches the expected JSON schema, as the user specified that clearly. This response should align perfectly with the required format.**Outputting the category in JSON**\n\nI need to create a JSON object that includes a \"category\" field, specifically using one of the values listed in the schema. It looks like I don't necessarily need to include the type wrapper, so my response will simply be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This output is straightforward and aligns with the user's request to categorize the IT ticket. The description of broken patch cords supports that \"Hardware\" is the correct choice, so I think this final response is solid."
