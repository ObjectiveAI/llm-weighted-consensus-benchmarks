The user provided a garbled message about a \"new cosec area,\" which might actually refer to \"co-sec area.\" They also mentioned terms like \"shared area file\" and \"external mob,\" hinting that they could need access to some shared resources.\n\nLooking at the categories available, I think this ticket best fits \"Access\" or possibly \"Administrative rights\" since it seems they might need permission to something. I'll decide on the category accordingly.**Categorizing access request**\n\nIt looks like the user is asking for write access to a shared area or file, based on their request mentioning \"shared area file.\" The term \"ext mob glee zone\" might refer to \"external mobile,\" but I'm not completely sure. Given that this seems related to permissions, the best category for this ticket is \"Access.\" \n\nI\u2019ll categorize it as such and prepare to respond with a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll ensure \u201cAccess\u201d is capitalized correctly before finalizing it."
