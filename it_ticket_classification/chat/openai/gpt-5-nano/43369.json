The text mentions problems like not being able to join meetings and getting kicked out of calls, which likely indicates access difficulties. \n\nI see that the predefined categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It seems clear that the \"Access\" category is the best fit since the issues are primarily about joining meetings and accessing video conferencing tools.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m examining the IT ticket details for proper categorization. The user mentioned issues primarily related to accessing meetings, which leads me to rule out categories like Hardware and HR Support, since it\u2019s not about physical devices or employee-related matters. I think \"Access\" is the best fit based on the information provided. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll prepare the output as a JSON object with the category set to \"Access\": \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}. This should align with the requirements while keeping it straightforward!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
