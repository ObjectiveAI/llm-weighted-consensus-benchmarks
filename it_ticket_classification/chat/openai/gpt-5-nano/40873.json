This should meet the required format while clearly addressing the user's problem! Let's get that sorted out.**Creating access category JSON**\n\nI see that the user might be dealing with an Oracle database login issue, which indeed falls under the application login category. I\u2019ll go ahead and categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" Since the required response format is JSON, I will produce it without any additional text.
