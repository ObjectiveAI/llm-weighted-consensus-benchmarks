Looking at the category options provided\u2014Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights\u2014the best fit seems to be \"HR Support.\" I'll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} since it aligns perfectly with the context!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing an IT ticket related to a \"new starter,\" and it seems to involve provisioning access. However, the text mentions items like \"starter form induction\" and \"attached return form,\" which definitely suggests it's HR-related. Based on this, I believe the proper category is \"HR Support.\" I need to ensure my output is strictly the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}, without any extra text.
