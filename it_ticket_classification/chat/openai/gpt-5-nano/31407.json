They seem to be asking about monitor specifications and approvals, which leans toward the \"Purchase\" category since that\u2019s for requesting new equipment. However, it could also fit into \"Hardware\" if it involves existing hardware issues. The emphasis on \u201capprovals\u201d and \u201cspeed\u201d indicates a request for new hardware is likely.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's mention of \"let approvals required\" suggests this ticket is related to getting approvals for a purchase. I think the best fit for categorization is \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll need to format my response correctly as a JSON object with the \"category\" key. Despite also considering \"Hardware,\" since it's about monitor details, \"Purchase\" feels more appropriate. So, I'll respond simply with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"} \n\nLet's just deliver that without any extra content."
