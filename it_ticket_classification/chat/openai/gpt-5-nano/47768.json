It looks like the ticket deals with vacation rule settings after a remote session, where the reassign option isn\u2019t working properly. The user is asking for help in configuring this in Fusion, which is likely part of an approval workflow. It\u2019s definitely more about internal processes rather than hardware or HR support. It could be classified under Access.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThis ticket is focused on reassigning approvals during a user's leave, which might initially seem like it falls under Administrative rights. However, it's centered around configuring a vacation rule in Fusion, so it may also fit under Internal Project. The ticket mentions tasks that involve user-level settings instead of system permissions, touching on how to activate the vacation rule. Overall, it\u2019s more about troubleshooting and setting up this feature than about direct access or permissions.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering that this ticket may fit under \"Internal Project\" since it specifically involves a Fusion tool. It also touches on configuring an admin-level rule, but it doesn't request admin access directly. The user is focused on a vacation rule for reassigning approvals, which might make \"Administrative rights\" relevant but not a perfect fit since it's more about workflow settings. \"Miscellaneous\" could work as a general category, but I'll lean towards \"Internal Project\" based on the context. I should prepare the output in JSON format accordingly.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nIt seems clear that this ticket relates to configuration within an internal project environment, so \"Internal Project\" appears to be the best fit. While \"Administrative rights\" could suggest needing admin privileges, the user isn't requesting access; they're focused on configuring a rule. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll follow the required format for my output, so I\u2019ll produce just the JSON without any extra commentary. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
