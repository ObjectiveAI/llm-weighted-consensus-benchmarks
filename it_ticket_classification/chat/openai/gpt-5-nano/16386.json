The user\u2019s message seems related to onboarding a new starter. Phrases like \"new starter tower\" imply hardware, while \"create his credentials\" suggests access. Considering these elements, the categories \"Access,\" \"Hardware,\" and \"HR Support\" seem relevant. The mention of \"testing discipline\" might also indicate which department is involved in this request. Let's proceed with categorizing it!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI see the tasks involve providing a computer tower and creating login credentials, which means this is related to IT onboarding. The challenge is to categorize the ticket correctly. While \"Access\" fits because of the credential request, \"Hardware\" is also relevant for the new starter tower. Since the category list lacks options like \"Onboarding,\" I'll choose \"Access\" since it focuses on provisioning user accounts. I should respond with a JSON object to categorize this ticket properly.**Formatting IT Ticket Response**\n\nI need to provide the category in a specific JSON format. The structure clearly indicates that I should categorize this IT ticket by selecting from the listed values. I'll choose \"Access,\" as it fits the request for creating credentials. It's important to stick strictly to the required format, so my response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll ensure that the string matches exactly, making sure \"Access\" has a capital A. Let's go with that!"
