It mentions terminated employees and the leaver process, which indicates it's about deactivating users. The categories I have to choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.\n\nSince the focus is on offboarding and access deprovisioning, the best fit looks like \"Access,\" as it relates directly to user access management for terminated employees.**Deciding on IT ticket categorization**\n\nI see that offboardings sometimes fall under HR, but the text specifically mentions \"terminated employees active,\" \"import done July,\" and \"leaver process.\" The request to \"please perform leaver process\" indicates that it's an action for IT to offboard someone. Based on this, the appropriate category appears to be \"Access\" due to the focus on deprovisioning user access. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"} as per the instruction to provide only the category."
