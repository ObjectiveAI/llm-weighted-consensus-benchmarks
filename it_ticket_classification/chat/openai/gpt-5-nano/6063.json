The ticket text strongly suggests it\u2019s about making the due date field editable, which likely involves Access or Administrative rights since editing a field could require specific permissions in a project management system. However, it also feels like a product feature request or a bug fix, so I want to be careful in my categorization.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m examining the best category for the ticket related to project development, particularly for making the due date field editable. \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems to fit well, since it relates to project development tasks. While it could also involve \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d for permission to edit fields, the request specifically mentions making a field editable. So, I think \"Internal Project\" is the way to go. I\u2019ll respond with the categorized type in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe task is to categorize the IT ticket based on the prompt. I'm aiming for clear and accurate output as a category object. The permitted categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others, with \"Internal Project\" standing out for this ticket. I want to ensure that everything is spelled correctly and follows the required format. So, I\u2019ll produce the JSON output as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Now, I\u2019m ready to deliver that!"
