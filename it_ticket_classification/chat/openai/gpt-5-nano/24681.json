The ticket contains phrases that hint it's about access rights, with mentions like \"add persons rights,\" \"cannot find him,\" and \"order assign him.\" It looks like this request should fit into the \"Administrative rights\" category. I\u2019ll format the output as JSON, ensuring the category property reflects that. Let's make this clear and concise!**Deciding Ticket Category**\n\nThe user\u2019s messages indicate this ticket is likely about access rights. Phrases like \"add persons rights,\" \"cannot find him,\" and \"please assign\" suggest it\u2019s related to account management. I\u2019m considering whether to categorize it under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" While \"Access\" is more general, \"Administrative rights\" is specific and pertinent to the request. Since the content leans towards rights and assignments, I think going with \"Administrative rights\" makes the most sense!{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
