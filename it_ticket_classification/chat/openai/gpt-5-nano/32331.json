But if it\u2019s about routing calls, maybe Access fits? However, since there\u2019s no Telecom category, Miscellaneous seems best. The user wants this categorized in a specific JSON-like format. So, I\u2019m deciding to go with \"Miscellaneous\" for clarity. I\u2019ll keep it that way!**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to ensure that my JSON object is correctly formatted, so I'll provide the category as \"Miscellaneous.\" The exact response should read: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. It's important to quote precisely and match the required field to avoid any errors. I want to keep it clear and concise, making sure the user gets the information they need without any confusion. This way, I\u2019m sticking to the guidelines effectively!"
