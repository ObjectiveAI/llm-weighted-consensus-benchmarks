It seems like they're dealing with feedback problems, possibly linked to latency or equipment in the meeting room. Based on the categories provided, it doesn\u2019t quite fit \"Hardware\" or \"HR Support.\" Instead, it sounds more like a communication issue, so I'd categorize it under \"Miscellaneous.\" That seems the best fit for this context!**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the ticket based on the user's description of calls with the NJ team encountering feedback issues. This appears to be a hardware or telecom problem related to the conference phone and its meeting room setup. While \"Internal Project\" might fit if it's about fixing the problem, \"Hardware\" is the more straightforward choice. So I'll create a JSON-like object with the category being \"Hardware\": {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. This should meet the requirements nicely!{\"category\": \"Hardware\"}"
