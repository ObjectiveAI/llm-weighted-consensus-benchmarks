The input seems to include information about a leaver, including details about their mailbox, access rights, and some requests for backup and inventory storage. \n\nGiven the content, it looks like it should fit best under \"HR Support\" or \"Access,\" but I need to analyze it carefully to confirm.**Evaluating leaver process**\n\nI'm analyzing the leaver process outlined in the ticket, which includes details like the leaver form, leaving date, location, mailbox, roaming profile, and access rights. It appears to touch on both \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" especially with mentions of \"AD rights,\" \"mailbox,\" and \"token.\" Since the ticket primarily focuses on revoking access and processing an employee leaving, I believe it best fits under \"Access,\" but it also has elements relevant to \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll finalize this choice carefully.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
