It\u2019s important to ensure that it's categorized correctly so the right team can address it efficiently. I\u2019ll look at the details provided in the ticket to decide whether it's related to software, hardware, or network issues. Clarity is crucial here, and I want to make sure I\u2019m not overlooking any important information. Let's get this right!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI see this user-provided text is quite a blob of information! It mentions an IT ticket for a leaver, covering aspects like a leaver form, mailbox access, and details about roles or approvals. To categorize it, I\u2019ll need to identify key themes. Since it revolves around employee offboarding and access rights, it seems to fit under \u201cHR Support\u201d or \u201cAccess\u201d based on the options available. Let\u2019s ensure it\u2019s categorized correctly for the right team!**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI need to select the best category for this IT ticket. The text covers various elements related to an employee leaving, mentioning things like leaver forms, AD rights, and mailbox access. Since user access removal is a critical part of the exit process, I think \u201cAccess\u201d is the most fitting category. While \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d might seem relevant, it generally falls under \u201cAccess.\u201d \u201cStorage\u201d could apply too, but the main focus is on user access provisions. So, \"Access\" seems best!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
