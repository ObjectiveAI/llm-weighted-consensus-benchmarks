It seems they're reporting an electrical outage on the 3rd floor and requesting assistance. They mention power issues and a need for someone to look into it, but the provided categories don't include \"Facilities,\" which could fit. The closest options might be \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Hardware,\" but there's some ambiguity. I'll have to decide the best fit.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket regarding a power outage and socket issues. Though it seems related to facilities or electrical, the available categories don't include those. It could fit under \"Hardware,\" but that's not entirely accurate since it's a building issue. Given the options, \"Miscellaneous\" might be the safest choice. The user asked me to categorize it in the required JSON format, so I'll output \"Miscellaneous\" accordingly.**Formatting final category response**\n\nI need to provide a brief justification for the category choice, even though the instructions mainly require just the category itself. The JSON object must follow proper syntax, so I\u2019ll ensure that\u2019s correct. I think \"Miscellaneous\" fits best, even though I briefly considered \"Hardware\" due to the socket mention. Ultimately, because it\u2019s about a power outage, \"Miscellaneous\" is more appropriate. So, my final response will be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. That's all I need!"
