The mention of an \"ID image CD\" could indicate a support request related to documentation. Considering the categories available, this ticket is likely best categorized under HR Support, given the onboarding context.**Categorizing as HR Support**\n\nI need to determine the category for an IT ticket which could potentially be \"Internal Project\" or \"Access\" if it's about system access for a new starter. The mention of \"id image cd\" seems to refer to an ID image or document. Given that \"new starter\" strongly points to HR onboarding, the best match for the category is definitely HR Support. So, I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object with the category set to \"HR Support.\"**Finalizing JSON Response**\n\nI need to ensure that the property is \"category\" with the value \"HR Support\" and that the object follows the necessary schema. The correct format for the response should be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I should stick strictly to this format without anything extra. Although a brief explanation might help, it's likely that they want just the JSON payload based on the instructions. So, I'll finalize by providing just that JSON object."
