The categories I have are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the message is confusing and seems to revolve around devices and terminal issues, I'm leaning toward categorizing it under \"Hardware\" or possibly \"Access\" due to the mention of device sign-off.**Parsing content for IT ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing the content, which mentions devices needing clearance for Friday and has a lot of phrases about sign-offs, adding devices, and terminals. It sounds like it could relate to \"Hardware\" since there are mentions of devices, terminals, and switches. On the other hand, it might also refer to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" if it's about clearance or rights management. However, because the focus leans more toward devices, I think \"Hardware\" is the best category choice.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
