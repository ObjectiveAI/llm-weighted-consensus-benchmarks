The ticket mentions issues with setting meetings, which might relate to calendar scheduling. It could fit under \"Miscellaneous,\" but for calendar access issues, \"Access\" makes sense. If it\u2019s about permissions to set meetings, \"Administrative rights\" could work too. The closest categories seem to be \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nSince this ticket is about scheduling meetings, it relates to calendar access rights or permissions in the system. I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category since it's specifically about access to calendars and the ability to set meetings. The required output format is a JSON object, so I should just provide the category value. I'll format it simply as:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}  \n\nThis is the intended final response, and it\u2019s concise with no extra explanation needed."
