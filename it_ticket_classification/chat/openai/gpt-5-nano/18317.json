I'll format my response as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It's all about ensuring I follow the required structure exactly, including using the correct enumerated category.**Determining the right category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"chargers, adapters, backpacks,\" which are accessories related to hardware. Although \"agreements\" and \"signed off\" could hint at a \"Purchase\" request, the focus seems to be on \"mobile on the road agreements.\" This might imply distribution or use related to mobile devices or vehicles used by road crews. To keep it simple and safe, I\u2019ll categorize it under \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format for clarity, avoiding any extra text."
