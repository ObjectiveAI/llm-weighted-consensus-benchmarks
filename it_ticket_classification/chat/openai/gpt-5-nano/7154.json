The text contains several elements, including leavers, Active Directory accounts, memberships, and high priority issues. Looking at the provided categories, it seems the most fitting one would be \"Access,\" given the focus on removing accounts and memberships related to leavers. It's crucial to ensure that the categorization captures the intent behind the request accurately.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nIt looks like the main category for this IT ticket would be \"Access,\" since it involves Active Directory accounts and group memberships. There's also a possibility of \"Administrative rights,\" but the focus is on access removal for leavers, which aligns best with the \"Access\" category. \n\nI will respond using the required JSON format without any extra text, providing the output as: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. That keeps it simple and clear!**Confirming category**\n\nI\u2019m considering if \"HR Support\" might also fit because the ticket mentions leavers and includes phrases like \"information compliance officer extension\" and \"extended paternity leave.\" However, since the main focus is on removing AD accounts, which falls under access management, I think \"Access\" is definitely the best choice.\n\nI'll just provide the response as a JSON object without any additional text. So, the final output will be: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`."
