There are possible categories like \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" The request appears to lean more towards \"Hardware\" as it involves a piece of equipment. However, if it's specifically about procuring the item, it could also fit under \"Purchase.\" Ultimately, \"Hardware\" seems like the best choice.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI'm deciding how to categorize an IT ticket, which could go under \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" Looking at the options, since it\u2019s about requesting a physical item (an extension cord), it seems to fit better in \"Hardware.\" However, if it\u2019s specifically a request to purchase, it could also be \"Purchase.\" Still, \"Hardware\" feels like the most straightforward choice. I should respond with a JSON object that includes the \"category\" field reflecting this decision.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
