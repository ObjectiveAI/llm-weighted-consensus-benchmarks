It indicates they need someone to step in when absent. \n\nWhile terms like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and others come to mind, the focus on procurement points me toward the \"Purchase\" category. Since the user wants this categorized without extra explanation, I\u2019ll just provide a simple JSON output. \n\nHere it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
