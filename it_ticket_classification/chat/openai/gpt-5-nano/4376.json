They also mention \"allocate please also assign queue,\" which suggests provisioning or queue management. However, since the core of the request is for a phone back cover, the best category seems to be Hardware.**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking that the request could also fall under \"Purchase\" since they\u2019re asking to buy a phone back cover. However, the mention of \"allocate\" and \"assign queue\" hints at IT helpdesk processes. Given the category options, I'll stick with \"Hardware\" since it\u2019s a physical item. I need to format this as a JSON object, using \"category\" as the key and \"Hardware\" as the value. Here\u2019s the output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
