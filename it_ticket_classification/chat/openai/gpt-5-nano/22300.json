Overall, \"Access\" seems like the most suitable category here.**Determining the right category**\n\nI'm deciding on the category for an IT ticket that seems to center around access change and approver roles. I believe \"Access\" is the most fitting category since it directly relates to what the user mentioned. \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, but the inclusion of \"holiday approver\" suggests a broader approval workflow. \n\nUltimately, I'll proceed with \"Access\" and prepare to output the JSON format as required: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. Simple and straightforward!"
