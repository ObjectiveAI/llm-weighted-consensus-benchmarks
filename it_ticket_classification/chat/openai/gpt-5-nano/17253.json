The system offers categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The user's text suggests it\u2019s about a \"people manager change form,\" mentioning \"approver by default\" and requesting an explanation. It seems to relate to HR and could fit under Access or Administrative rights if it involves permissions. I'll need to decide the best category based on the specific context of the ticket.**Classifying IT ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m looking at category options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The user's mention of a \"people manager change form\" likely relates to HR, which could fit under HR Support. However, since this is an IT ticket and involves approving changes, it could also be categorized under Administrative rights or Access. If it pertains to changing permissions for a manager role, it typically falls under Access. I should provide a JSON object with the chosen category.**Formatting the output correctly**\n\nI need to format my output as a JSON object according to the system's requirements. The required format needs me to include a category value. I must respond without extra text, just like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} or another relevant category like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nLet\u2019s analyze the user\u2019s text for clarity. They talk about a \"people manager change form,\" indicating a request to change a user's supervisor. This suggests it aligns best with \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access.\"**Interpreting the request for change**\n\nThe user might be requesting to change a manager via a form, with \"Friday PM\" possibly indicating a deadline. The phrases \"change form\" and \"approve person join\" are a bit unclear. However, the mention of \"approver by default\" suggests that they want clarification on that specific aspect within the workflow for manager changes. This request is mainly about access and permissions. The most appropriate category would be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it's related to approval settings in a system.**Deciding on the category**\n\nI\u2019m weighing between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" for categorizing this IT ticket. \"Access\" typically relates to user permissions and login matters, while \"Administrative rights\" focuses on privileged access. The phrase \"approver by default\" hints at a workflow setting, but since it also involves \"people manager change form,\" it suggests HR processes. However, since it\u2019s an IT ticket, the safest bet would involve \"Administrative rights,\" reflecting the changes in approval permissions. I\u2019ll finalize with the JSON output: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
