While \"Internal Project\" seems like a suitable category since it's about team allocation, \"HR Support\" could also fit if it's linked to the people development team. However, since it's not explicitly asking for HR help, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best choice. Let's format the response in JSON for clarity!**Formatting the category**\n\nI need to output a JSON object for the category field. Since the user wants to categorize the IT ticket, I\u2019ve determined that \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting option based on the context provided. The required format is clear: it has to be a JSON object with a \"category\" key. So my response will be simple and straightforward: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to keep it concise with no extra text!"
