The ticket mentions customizing a project list report and suggests tasks like adding columns and assignments. I\u2019m considering which category fits best from the options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since it primarily focuses on project reporting and customization, \"Internal Project\" seems the most appropriate category for this request.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI see there\u2019s also an \"Administrative rights\" category, but it doesn't really fit here. The \"Access\" category relates to login rights, which isn\u2019t relevant either. \"Storage\" and \"Purchase\" don't apply, nor does \"Hardware\" or \"HR Support\". \"Miscellaneous\" could work for general tasks, but since this is about a project report, \"Internal Project\" feels right. The ticket mentions needing to assign it, but I\u2019ll stick with \"Internal Project\" for the final category. I need to output this as a JSON object according to the specified format.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
