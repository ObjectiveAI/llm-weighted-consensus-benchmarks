Phrases like \u201clast day desktop\u201d might imply someone is leaving or returning a desktop, and \u201cbring monitor\u201d suggests a monitor is involved too. So I think this fits best under the \"Hardware\" category since it relates to physical devices.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI need to figure out the best category for the IT ticket based on the options like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Purchase,\" and others. The phrase \"last day desktop ... bring also had monitor\" suggests that they may be returning equipment on their last day of work. It seems fitting to categorize this ticket under \"Hardware\" since it involves physical items. So, I\u2019ll just respond with the formatted JSON: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. No extra text needed!"
