The ticket mentions the removal of a proposal, high importance, and issues with approvals and flows. \n\nLooking at the provided categories, terms like \"change flows,\" \"delete proposal,\" and \"approvers left\" suggest it might fit into \"Administrative rights\" due to the nature of the approval process and tasks to be carried out. I'll go with that category for now!**Choosing ticket category**\n\nIt looks like this is an internal process issue related to approval flows. I\u2019m considering whether it fits into \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" The text mentions not being able to proceed due to approvers leaving, which points towards access rights or permissions.\n\nThe request is to delete a proposal, so \"Administrative rights\" seems like a strong fit since it relates to the ability to modify approvals. However, \"Access\" fits too since it\u2019s about access rights. I think I'll go with \"Administrative rights\" as the best option!**Categorizing IT ticket in JSON**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket but hasn\u2019t provided any additional instructions. I need to present my response as a JSON object with a key labeled \"category.\" \n\nThe options include categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. Based on the ticket details mentioning issues with approvals and flows due to \"approvers left,\" it seems \"Administrative rights\" is the most fitting choice. \n\nI\u2019ll format the final response as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
