It mentions \"log installation,\" \"purchase requisitions,\" and \"administrator,\" which makes it tricky. \"Purchase requisitions\" hints at the \"Purchase\" category, but \"installation\" suggests it could be \"Hardware,\" especially since it includes \"mobile phone.\" \n\nSo, I must determine if this is truly a hardware request or if it's more about procurement. The categories include Hardware, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights, Access, and Miscellaneous. It's a bit tricky!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm thinking the best fit for this ticket is \"Purchase\" because it mentions \"order number\" and \"purchase requisitions,\" suggesting procurement. The mention of \"log installation\" is tricky, but it doesn\u2019t clearly indicate a hardware upgrade, even though \"mobile phone\" hints at hardware being involved. \n\nI want to keep it simple and respond in the format required, which is likely JSON. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. That feels right! Let's deliver that."
