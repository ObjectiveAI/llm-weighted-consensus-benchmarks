The term \"new value\" also suggests this is a change request, which helps guide me in classifying it.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best way to categorize this IT ticket about adding \"poseidon.\" It could fit under \"Internal Project\" if it's a development task, but it seems to be more about \"Administrative rights,\" since the user is asking for an admin change to the system. The phrase \u201cadd poseidon\u201d doesn't relate to hardware, storage, purchases, or HR. \"Miscellaneous\" could work for general requests, but I think \"Administrative rights\" is the most appropriate category for this situation.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to choose a single category for the IT ticket request. The user specifically asked to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" so a clarifying question might be unnecessary. According to the prompt, I should provide a JSON object for the category selection. Options are limited to categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nConsidering the request to \"add poseidon,\" \"Administrative rights\" seems like the best fit. Although \"Access\" is relevant, it focuses more on granting rights, which isn\u2019t directly mentioned in the request.**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for this IT ticket regarding adding a new value. It might be a system configuration change rather than an access issue. \"Administrative rights\" pertains to user permissions, while \"Access\" is focused on access-related problems. Since adding a new value likely requires admin privileges, I think \"Administrative rights\" is the most appropriate category. \n\nI'll return a JSON object with the category set as \"Administrative rights.\" Keeping it simple, I\u2019ll ensure the format is a valid JSON string: \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
