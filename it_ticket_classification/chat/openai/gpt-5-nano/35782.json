It emphasizes user responsibility for files and advises on keeping current versions if there are dependencies. While it could involve \"Administrative rights\" since admin access might be needed for upgrades, it\u2019s mainly a process announcement rather than a direct request. It seems more aligned with \"Internal Project,\" as it relates to a scheduled upgrade for all PCs. \"Miscellaneous\" might also apply, but it doesn\u2019t fit hardware or storage issues directly.**Categorizing Windows upgrade ticket**\n\nThe ticket primarily concerns the unavailability of the Windows upgrade option, a forced upgrade, and related scheduling and dependency announcements. I need to categorize this as either \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I think \"Internal Project\" fits best since it's about a mandatory organizational upgrade and involves change management communication. So I\u2019ll respond with a concise JSON object: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"} as required by the system instruction. Time to deliver!"
