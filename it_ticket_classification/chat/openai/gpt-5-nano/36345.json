This seems to involve timecard approvals and possibly a workflow issue. It's likely related to HR processes, so the category \"HR Support\" feels appropriate. I should also consider \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" if permission issues are involved, but \"HR Support\" is the best fit here. I\u2019ll format the response properly as an object with the category field.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to determine if I should provide just the JSON response without any extra text. The instructions indicate that the category must be one of the enumerated options. I\u2019ll format it correctly as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.\n\nThe ticket concerns unapproved timecards and the need for investigation into why they are submitted while still in the approver's queue. It seems to be an HR/payroll issue, confirming that \"HR Support\" is indeed the right category. So I'll respond with just the required JSON format."
