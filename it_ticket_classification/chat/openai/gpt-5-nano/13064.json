The ticket mentions \u201cinstallation of memories\u201d and upgrading RAM, which indicates it falls under the category of \"Hardware.\" We should format the response as a JSON object that contains the category field. So I'll craft the output as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI've double-checked everything, and hardware clearly fits best here! It aligns with the schema requirements too.**Finalizing output format**\n\nI see that the \"type\":\"object\" indicates I'll be providing a structured output. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Now I just need to ensure I format it correctly and polish it up if needed. This JSON structure aligns perfectly with what\u2019s required, so I can finalize it now. It feels good to double-check everything and wrap it up in the correct format!"
