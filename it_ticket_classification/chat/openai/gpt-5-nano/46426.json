The important points include the expense approval workflow and access issues. Given the content, this seems to fit best under \"Access\" since it deals with permissions and visibility. However, it could also relate to \"Administrative rights\" due to the need for rights to run the status. It's definitely not related to hardware.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe phrase \"cannot status\" likely indicates an inability to change the status of the ticket. The user emphasized urgency, which adds to the need for clarity. I see that this ticket relates to visibility and approval, suggesting it should be categorized under \"Access\" since it involves permissions for expense reports. It might also be linked to \"Administrative rights\" if admin permissions are necessary. However, \"Access\" feels like the best fit here, so I should prepare to present that in a JSON object.**Preparing category response**\n\nThe system requires a specific format for the response: a JSON object with a \"category\" property. The user has asked me to categorize the IT ticket, so I need to provide just the category itself. I realize I can go ahead with the response: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}` because that's the appropriate categorization based on visibility and approval issues. While it might be typical to include a short sentence for human readability, I'll stick with just the JSON to be clear and structured, as instructed. So, here it is: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`."
