It mentions a \"new starter\" and involves changes to the starting date, with references to \"starter forms attached.\" This seems to relate to HR onboarding processes. The two potential categories that come to mind could be \"HR Support\" for handling onboarding changes or \"Administrative rights\" if access is required for forms. I'll lean towards \"HR Support\" since it fits the context better.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing content around a \u201cnew starter\u201d and updates related to starting dates, along with attached forms. This points to HR onboarding, which makes me think the best category is \"HR Support.\" However, I need to confirm that I\u2019m correctly identifying it as such. The possible categories are clear, and HR Support is indeed one of them.\n\nI\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object correctly, ensuring it includes the \u201ccategory\u201d string as specified. So, the JSON will look like this: {\"category\":{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
