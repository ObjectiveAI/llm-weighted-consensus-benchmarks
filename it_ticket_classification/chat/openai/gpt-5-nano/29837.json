It mentions things like \"how submitted approved expense reports looked over,\" which seems relevant to Oracle applications. I\u2019m thinking it might fit into either \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" if it pertains to submission and approval. On the other hand, if it doesn't quite fit those, it could fall under \"Miscellaneous.\" This is a bit tricky!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm working through how to categorize the IT ticket about expense reports. It could be \"Access\" if it's about submission and approvals, but the phrase \"how submitted approved expense reports looked over\" suggests it's more about the process in Oracle. It might fall under \"Internal Project\" relating to project management, especially since \"PM\" could mean \"project manager\" or possibly \"Payroll Manager.\" We need to choose the best category, steering clear of hardware, HR, storage, or purchases. This one's a bit complex!**Selecting the best category**\n\nI'm considering the categorization of this IT ticket about expense reports. The term \"PM\" often relates to Project Management, but it might also refer to Project Manager expense reports in this context. Since it deals with the workflow and approvals of expense reports, it could fit best under \"Administrative rights\" if it focuses on submission and approval permissions. However, \"Access\" also seems relevant if it\u2019s about how submissions are made. I need to choose the most fitting category for clarity!**Determining the right category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this IT ticket as \"Administrative rights\" since it involves who can submit and approve expense reports. However, the user didn\u2019t explicitly ask for access, just an explanation of the process. I could also consider \"Miscellaneous,\" but that's not really helpful. The ticket content mainly discusses workflow rather than just access issues, so I think \"Administrative rights\" is likely the most fitting choice for how permissions are handled within Oracle.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nThe user didn\u2019t ask for a rights change, but the ticket discusses the process, leading me to think \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option if I'm unsure. However, with typical classifications needing predetermined categories, I believe \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit. I\u2019ll craft the final response as a JSON object, strictly with the category field, since the instructions focus on the output without commentary. \n\nSo, here it is: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
