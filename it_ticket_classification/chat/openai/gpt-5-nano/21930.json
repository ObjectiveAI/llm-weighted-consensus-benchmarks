The text is a bit messy, mentioning things like hardware management and accessing restrictions. It seems the most fitting category might be \"Hardware,\" but I\u2019ll also consider \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Access\" because of the mentions of rogue users and access issues. There's certainly a lot to untangle in this ticket!**Categorizing Workstation Move**\n\nI need to categorize a request about moving a physical workstation and configuring network ports. It definitely relates to hardware management, so \"Hardware\" seems like the best category since it involves relocating a device and making network adjustments. \"Internal Project\" might fit if it's part of a bigger task, but categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" don't apply. I'll keep it straightforward and respond with JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Outputting Category**\n\nI think it\u2019s best to follow the instruction and simply output the category without any extra commentary. Since the focus is on the categorization, I\u2019ll provide just the object in the required format. Keeping it clear and straightforward is important, so I\u2019ll stick with that approach. Let\u2019s proceed with that clean output!"
