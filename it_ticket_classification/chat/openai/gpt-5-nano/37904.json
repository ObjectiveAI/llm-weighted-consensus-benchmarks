It seems like a software problem. The user mentions that approvals have stopped working and they plan to hold on formally approving items via the web app until further investigation. I might categorize this under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" since it's related to permissions. It's worth considering if it fits into \"Miscellaneous\" too.**Categorizing approval workflow issue**\n\nThe issue here isn't about gaining access; it's specifically about the approval workflow failing. In the IT ticket taxonomy, \"Access\" pertains to login and user permissions, while \"Administrative rights\" concerns admin privileges. Since the problem relates to \"approval functionality,\" it\u2019s not about system access. \n\n\"Purchase\" is quite relevant as it pertains to requisition approvals within the purchasing workflow. Given that the ticket focuses on the approval process, I think categorizing it as \"Purchase\" is the best fit. However, \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback option if needed.**Outputting category for IT ticket**\n\nThe user is requesting a category for the IT ticket, and I know the categories available: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nBased on the content, I should categorize it under \"Purchase.\" I realize the instruction specifies that I only need to output the category in a structured format. So, I\u2019ll respond with: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nThat seems to be the correct approach!"
