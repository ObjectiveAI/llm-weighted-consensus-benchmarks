The mention of \"discipline\" is a bit unclear, maybe indicating a project element? I\u2019ll weigh these aspects against the allowed categories to make the best choice. This seems to focus on internal processes mostly.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI'm looking at the details of this IT ticket concerning \"leaver notification testing.\" Given that this relates to HR processes, I initially lean towards \"HR Support.\" However, since it mentions removing access for leavers, \"Access\" seems more fitting. The notes about \"head testing\" and \"discipline\" are pretty vague, but they might imply tasks around access control. Since leaver notifications typically concern account disabling, I conclude that \"Access\" is the best categorization. I'll respond with the required JSON format for clarity."
