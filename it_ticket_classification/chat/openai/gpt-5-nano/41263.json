It\u2019s important to classify it right to streamline the support process and ensure it gets to the right team. I\u2019m thinking about breaking it down into categories like software issues, hardware issues, networking problems, or access requests. This attention to detail could really help in resolving the ticket efficiently. Let\u2019s move forward with that!**Categorizing IT ticket content**\n\nThe user provided a block of text that appears to be an IT ticket regarding a full mailbox. It mentions deleting attachments, reducing mailbox size, and emptying the deleted items folder. From the provided categories, it makes sense to classify this under \"Storage,\" as the issue revolves around managing mailbox capacity. This categorization will help direct the ticket to the appropriate team for resolution. Let's ensure we handle it efficiently!**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nThis IT ticket relates to storage issues, specifically concerning mailbox size. I think the best category here is \"Storage,\" since it directly addresses the mailbox quota problem. While \"Administrative rights\" might apply if there were a request for those, it doesn\u2019t seem to fit as closely in this case. I need to respond in JSON format. The expected output should simply be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I\u2019ll stick to just that!{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
