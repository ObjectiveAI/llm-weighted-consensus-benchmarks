The ticket text is quite garbled, mentioning things like \"amend customer feedback owners\" and \"membership snow,\" which might be a typo. It discusses \"complaint reference id,\" \"assignment,\" and \"assign feedback tickets queue,\" indicating a focus on ensuring added feedback owners for an assignment or ticket queue. It seems like it\u2019s about clarifying feedback ownership management.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize this IT ticket, considering options like Administrative rights, Internal Project, or Access. The ticket mentions \"feedback owners\" and \"assignment,\" suggesting it's related to workflow and process management, pointing towards Miscellaneous or Internal Project. It\u2019s definitely not a hardware or HR issue. The repeated phrases indicate it\u2019s about adding feedback owners to a ticket assignment in the system. I guess it might fit best under Administrative rights, since it involves permissions for assigning tickets.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI'm evaluating how to categorize this IT ticket, and \"Administrative rights\" seems suitable since it's about access control and permissions. However, since the text is unclear, maybe \"Miscellaneous\" fits better? The mention of \"assignment snow\" possibly refers to ServiceNow, suggesting internal project management. The ticket looks focused on adding feedback owners in ServiceNow, so it might relate to administrative rights needed for ticket assignment. Yet, \"Access\" is a separate category for system permissions, which is also a consideration.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI see that the user isn't requesting access to a system directly; they need to adjust the feedback owners for tickets, which involves a permission change. The category \"Administrative rights\" seems most suitable since it pertains to admin features. Alternatively, \"Internal Project\" could fit if it's about a workflow change in ServiceNow. Given the instruction to categorize the IT ticket, I'll format my response as a JSON object stating: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} without any extra text, ensuring it meets the required schema exactly.**Formatting the JSON Response**\n\nI usually respond with a JSON object, so for this, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. To ensure I\u2019m following the required schema, I remembered the instruction about categorizing the IT ticket. Even though there's a specified \"type\":\"object\" schema given, the emphasis is on delivering the actual object itself, not the schema. So, I'll stick with the simple response: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}, making sure to keep it succinct and clear."
