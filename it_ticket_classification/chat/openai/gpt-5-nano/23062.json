I should interpret keywords like \"requests vs windows,\" \"audits,\" and \"connected networks.\" It could fit under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" but the categories I'm working with are limited, making interpretation challenging.**Interpreting IT ticket details**\n\nI\u2019m assessing the IT ticket based on key terms. The mention of \"audits\" hints at security or compliance, while \"assets\" and \"connected networks\" suggest it relates to network requests. It could involve \"Administrative rights\" for responding to requests or fall under \"Access,\" given the focus on user permissions and network access. The text is quite ambiguous, mentioning network configuration. I\u2019m considering asking the user for clarification since it\u2019s not entirely clear what category fits best.**Choosing the best category**\n\nI need to choose a fitting category for the IT ticket and provide a brief justification. Given keywords like \"audits,\" \"assets,\" \"connected networks,\" and \"public,\" it seems tied to network security and asset management. While \"Internal Project\" might apply, I think the best choice is \"Access,\" since it relates to permissions and access control, especially with the mention of \"respond requests.\" I'll format my response as {\"category\":\"Access\"} to meet system requirements.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
