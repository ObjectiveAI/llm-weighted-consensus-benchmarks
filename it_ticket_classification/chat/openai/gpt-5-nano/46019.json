Making the right category can help in prioritizing this ticket efficiently. Let's make sure that we get it right to streamline the resolution process! I want to be thorough and accurate here.**Analyzing user text**\n\nThe user seems to have submitted a ticket about an Oracle error regarding their maternity leave. They're requesting action since they're having issues claiming their leave from last week in July, and they're encountering strange errors when logging in or searching for leave types. It also mentions that each submission should follow an established weekly process. They seem frustrated but also refer to available training materials and potential notifications for their manager if the issue remains unresolved.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
