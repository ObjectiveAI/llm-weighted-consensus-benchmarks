The user's ticket mentions a \"feedback request issue,\" specifically stating they cannot add a request. This seems software-related rather than hardware-related. While it's not HR or directly about access, it might involve access permissions if they can't add the request due to limited permissions. I need to figure out the best category here.**Refining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket states, \"cannot add feedback request\" and mentions a feedback period. This implies it's about creating feedback requests within a system possibly used by testers. The phrase \"test consultant\" might hint at an individual involved. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it's likely a permissions issue with adding feedback requests, either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" might fit best. I need to finalize my choice based on this analysis.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nThis ticket might fall under \"Internal Project\" if it's tied to an internal system, but I need to focus on the main problem. The \"feedback request issue\" seems to indicate a feature that isn't working, likely an access or permission problem. The phrase \"only feedback period left\" implies there's a deadline in place. The phrase about needing someone to look into it suggests they want assistance. Given these considerations, \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit, leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" for issues that don't fit neatly.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nThe ticket might be categorized under \"Internal Project\" if it's part of that type of system. The user wants this categorized in JSON format, so I need to create a JSON object with a \"category\" field that's a string from the given enum. The formats to consider include \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The issue seems related to a feedback feature, not hardware or HR, so \"Access\" might fit best since it's about permissions, but it's not explicitly stated.**Choosing the category**\n\nThe ticket mentions, \"cannot add feedback request\" and \"only feedback period left,\" which might indicate a bug rather than an access issue. While \"Internal Project\" could be a consideration if this relates to a specific project role, it seems more like it's lacking a precise classification. I think \"Miscellaneous\" fits best here, so the final output should be a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. To keep it clear, I\u2019ll stick to just providing the JSON without any extra text."
