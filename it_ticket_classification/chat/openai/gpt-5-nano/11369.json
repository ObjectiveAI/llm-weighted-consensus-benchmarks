The categories are varied, including Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. Given the context of \"starter form\" and the need for help with completion, it aligns with either Access for provisioning or HR Support. It really seems like this ticket is related to onboarding, so I\u2019ll lean towards categorizing it under HR Support.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s request mentions a \"starter form\" linked to completing it for a new hire joining in October. I initially considered \"Administrative rights,\" but that doesn\u2019t quite fit. The options \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" seem more appropriate. It\u2019s an IT ticket but discussing an onboarding process. Since \"Access\" involves provisioning necessary systems for the new starter, I think that\u2019s the best choice. Overall, I\u2019ll categorize it under \"Access\" for new starter provisioning.**Selecting the right category**\n\nThe request mentions a \"starter form\" that needs completion, which suggests onboarding information typically handled by HR or IT. However, it doesn't explicitly ask for HR support; it\u2019s primarily about onboarding. Since this is an IT ticket, categorizing it as \"HR Support\" might misfile it. \"Access\" aligns better with IT processes as it relates to new starter onboarding. Therefore, I'll format my response in JSON, indicating \"Access\" as the chosen category with the rationale included.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category. Based on the context, I'll format it simply as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The instructions suggest keeping it minimal and straightforward, focusing on just the category without any extra text. It seems that this is the preferred format, so I'll go ahead and just provide that clean output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This way, I\u2019m ensuring I follow the instructions correctly."
