Since the user's issue directly relates to being unable to log into ServiceNow due to an expired or changed password, \"Access\" seems the most fitting. I\u2019ll structure the output as a JSON object declaring the category as \"Access.\"**Creating JSON format**\n\nI need to create a JSON object that follows a specific format outlined in the instructions. The required structure includes \"type\": \"object\" and specifies that there should be a \"category\" property with certain enumerated values. I've determined that the appropriate category for this ticket is \"Access.\" So, I'll format my response as a JSON object as follows: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I just want to keep it clear and straightforward without any additional text."
