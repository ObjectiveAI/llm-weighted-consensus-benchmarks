It discusses project adjustments that are stuck in a pending status, with a request to \"kill pending processes.\" The relevant categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It seems like this ticket fits under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" perhaps even \"Administrative rights\" since it involves adjustments to software processes but doesn't mention hardware or storage directly.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe mention of \"applications analyst\" and \"production\" hints that this is about an internal application. I think the category \"Internal Project\" fits best because it\u2019s focused on project adjustments and pending processes. Although \"Administrative rights\" could apply since they may need elevated privileges to kill processes, the main issue seems related to functionality rather than access rights. Thus, \"Internal Project\" is the most suitable category. I\u2019ll output the required JSON format as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
