It seems related to an IT audit in Poland, mentioning importing and ensuring the accuracy of records. The user requests a clean upload of the attached files and talks about a review process for results. This ticket could fit under categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Storage.\" It's a bit jumbled, but I\u2019m working through it!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing an IT ticket for categorization. The options available include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The content focuses on an audit, data import, and communication about accuracy. It could fit as an \"Internal Project,\" given it involves auditing Poland records. However, \"Miscellaneous\" is also an option. Based on the details, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best choice since it relates to the ongoing audit project regarding accuracy and user communication.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
