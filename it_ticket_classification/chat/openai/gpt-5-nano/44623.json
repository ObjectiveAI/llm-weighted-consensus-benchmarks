The ticket mentions an audio issue during calls, where the client can hear but we cannot hear them. This seems related to a hardware issue, likely with a headset or VOIP. The best fit seems to be \"Hardware\" for the audio device. While \"Miscellaneous\" is another option, it's not quite ideal for this context. So, I'll confidently go with \"Hardware.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI see that many ticket systems have categories like \"Hardware\" or \"Software,\" but there\u2019s no \"Software\" option available. \"Miscellaneous\" could cover unexpected issues. The problem seems related to audio issues when using specific connections. The grammar in the description is a bit confusing, but it suggests an issue with the calling system or VOIP. Since it involves audio devices, I think categorizing it as \"Hardware\" is the best choice, although \"Miscellaneous\" could also work.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
