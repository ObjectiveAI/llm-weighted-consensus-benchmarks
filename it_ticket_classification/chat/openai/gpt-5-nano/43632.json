The choices are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. It\u2019s really important to pick the category that fits best so I can ensure it\u2019s routed to the right team. I\u2019m going to think about the specifics of the issue and determine where it belongs. Let\u2019s get this sorted out!**Identifying ticket issue**\n\nIt looks like this ticket revolves around the recurring problem of being \"unable to select contacts\" within a specific template related to line managers. I\u2019m sensing that this could be an access issue, especially since the descriptions mention the inclusion and exclusion of users in the corresponding table. I\u2019ll need to make sure to specify that in the ticket and consider how it affects the users involved. Let's clarify this for better assistance!**Categorizing ticket issues**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this ticket that involves selecting contacts within a line manager field template. It seems to fit best under \"Access\" because it relates to permissions regarding viewing or selecting contacts. However, I\u2019m also seeing \"Administrative rights\" as a possible option since it might overlap with permissions. Since the user mentions \"unable to select contacts\" multiple times, I believe \"Access\" is the most suitable choice. Now, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON-like category object as instructed!{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Access\"}}"
