This clearly points to a hardware issue, so I should categorize it as \"Hardware.\" \n\nI'll prepare the JSON output accordingly. Although I considered if \"Facilities\" might apply, the existing options don\u2019t include it, so \"Hardware\" is the best fit. \n\nMy final response will simply be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
