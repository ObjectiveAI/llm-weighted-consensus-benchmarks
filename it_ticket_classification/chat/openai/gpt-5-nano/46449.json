The available categories are somewhat limited. \"Internal Project\" could apply for development contexts, but it seems more like a troubleshooting or access issue. There\u2019s no category for \"Networking,\" so I\u2019m leaning towards either \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access\" due to the connectivity aspects mentioned in the ticket.**Classifying the IT Ticket**\n\nThis appears to be a technical issue rather than a hardware one, so \"Miscellaneous\" seems like it could fit well. There\u2019s also an \"Access\" category related to user permissions and authentication, but since the user is asking for help, it feels more general. Given that there's no specific category for these issues, I think I should classify it as \"Miscellaneous\" and respond in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
