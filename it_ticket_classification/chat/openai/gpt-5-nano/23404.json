There are hints about the timing on \"friday pm\" and mentions of \u201cTomcat instances running on a physical machine.\" The priority is important because it pertains to testing an application. So, I think \u201cAccess\u201d is the best category.**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt seems clear this ticket is primarily about access issues since it mentions \"no access from local network.\" It involves Tomcat instances on a physical machine and an important priority for testing an application. While there are some hardware aspects, the focus is on network access. Since we need to categorize it and stick to one category, \"Access\" fits best. So, I\u2019ll respond with the category in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
