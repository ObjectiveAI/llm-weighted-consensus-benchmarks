The details indicate issues with data recovery after a clean install, where the laptop was wiped and data cannot be found. This points to a storage concern, so \"Storage\" seems like the most fitting category. I don't think \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" apply here, so I'll finalize my response as a JSON-like object with the category set to \"Storage.\"**Formatting response correctly**\n\nI need to follow the instruction on using the specific format for the category field, which involves outputting a JSON object. It looks like the schema provided indicates that it should involve properties, but for this task, my response should contain something like {\"category\":\"Storage\"} as the category value. I need to confirm that \"Storage\" is indeed the right choice based on the user's mention of backup issues and data recovery. So, I\u2019ll make sure to stick to the required format and output that value clearly.**Finalizing response format**\n\nI need to produce the response as {\"category\":\"Storage\"} since that fits the category based on the user\u2019s issue with missing backups. There seems to be a schema provided that hints at needing a wrapper with \"type\":\"object,\" but I believe in this situation, I should stick to just the required JSON output. Although I briefly considered \"Administrative rights\" due to the clean install, that's not relevant here. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and only output the JSON."
