While \"Access\" might also seem relevant for Oracle login, the focus here is clearly on the purchasing process, so I'll stick with \"Purchase.\"**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category for the IT ticket. The required format includes a \"category\" key with an enumerated value. Based on the content that mentions \"Oracle,\" \"approved purchase,\" and \"amount,\" it fits best in the \"Purchase\" category. I need to ensure the JSON is properly formatted, so it will look like this: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to keep it minimal and clear in my final response."
