It seems to mention the \u201cAmigo browser\u201d and asks to remove it. There\u2019s also a note about unwanted and potentially dangerous applications being installed by clicking \u201cnext\u201d too many times. So, I need to figure out which category this ticket fits into. There are options to consider, and I want to make sure I get it right!**Choosing the right category**\n\nI'm reviewing the provided categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The user's message talks about removing the Amigo browser and unwanted applications, which suggests it relates to malware removal. It might fit under \"Administrative rights\" if uninstalling requires permissions. Alternatively, it could be \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" I'll need to choose the category and prepare a JSON object following the required format.**Determining the category**\n\nI\u2019m clarifying the ticket, which is about removing the Amigo browser and other unwanted apps. The user is asking for information on installing something and mentions risks from clicking \u201cnext\u201d too many times. This relates to security and malware removal, but there's no explicit \"Security\" category. The closest fit is \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights\" if admin permissions are needed. Since it\u2019s about software and not hardware, \"Miscellaneous\" seems best. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
