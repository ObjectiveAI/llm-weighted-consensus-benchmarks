It seems like the user's request concerns access to Sonar, specifically related to the caps project user and issues with authorization. The details mention that the caps pilot is not authorized anymore despite having previously worked with the correct credentials and an error message appears. \n\nI'll classify this request into the \"Access\" category, as it relates to permission issues for a specific tool or system.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nThis IT ticket relates to user access issues with Sonar and the error messages indicating problems with privileges. The key phrases highlight the need for \"more privileges\" and \"not authorized,\" so I\u2019m considering whether to categorize it under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nWhile both categories apply, since the content primarily deals with permissions and authorizations, \"Administrative rights\" seems like the safer choice to accurately represent the user\u2019s concerns about privileges. However, \"Access\" could also fit, but I'll go with \"Administrative rights\" to be precise.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
