It looks like categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" makes the most sense since it's a pilot project. There\u2019s also an option for \"Access,\" but the focus is on build/deploy problems. I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" and provide the information in a JSON format according to the specified schema.**Clarifying JSON output**\n\nI need to provide output for an IT ticket categorized as \"Internal Project.\" The schema suggests I need to wrap this in a specific format. The actual response should be a JSON object that contains the category field. However, the schema specifies the structure, which is a bit confusing since I normally just respond with the category. To clarify, I'll respond with: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}` while keeping in mind the required schema format.**Providing JSON response**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to respond with the category, which is \"Internal Project.\" The instructions say the answer must be in a JSON format containing a \"category\" field. I'll ensure my output is strictly formatted as: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. It seems straightforward, and there's no need for additional notes since they just want the category. So, I\u2019ll stick to delivering that final JSON object."
