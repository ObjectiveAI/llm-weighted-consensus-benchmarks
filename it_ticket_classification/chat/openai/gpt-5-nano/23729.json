The user\u2019s request looks a bit chaotic, mentioning a new starter and account changes for interns. I need to identify the main focus so I can choose the right category that aligns with their needs. Let's determine which one fits best!**Analyzing IT Ticket Details**\n\nI'm breaking down the user's message to understand their request better. It mentions a new starter receiving a PC scheduled for Thursday in December. There\u2019s also something about interns transitioning to colleagues within a testing discipline and needing to adjust account statuses since internships are ending. Overall, it seems related to HR and onboarding processes, specifically about account management and employment status. I might lean towards categorizing this under HR Support.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the ticket categories: \"Access\" pertains to user account access, while \"Administrative rights\" relates to rights needed to modify accounts. \"HR Support\" fits inquiries about personnel, and \"Hardware\" seems relevant for the new starter\u2019s PC. The ticket mentions changing account statuses and closing accounts when internships end, which suggests it\u2019s mainly about onboarding. However, I need to choose just one category, and it looks like \"HR Support\" is the most fitting.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
