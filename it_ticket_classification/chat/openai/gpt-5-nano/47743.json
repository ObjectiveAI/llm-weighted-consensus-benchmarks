So, I need to figure out the best fit since it's quite specific.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering options for categorizing an IT ticket related to Outlook invites failing. It might fit into \"Miscellaneous,\" since it doesn\u2019t match categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project.\" If it\u2019s about teamwork within those fusion teams, it could technically go there, but the safer choice is \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\nSo, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object containing just the category.
