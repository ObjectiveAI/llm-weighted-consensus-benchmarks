Since the user is discussing servers and instances being restarted, it seems appropriate to categorize this as Hardware. I'll go with that for clarity and accuracy.**Interpreting IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m parsing the user's message, which seems a bit convoluted. They likely want a log of servers that restarted on Wednesday PM and might be asking to apply something to those instances. \n\nGiven the context, it seems appropriate to categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project.\" It deals with server restarts, which aligns with project management tasks rather than other categories like Hardware or Administrative rights. I think I've got a solid understanding here!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering different categories for the IT ticket. There's a possibility it could be \"Administrative Rights\" if they need permission to log or apply changes. They seem to be looking to log which servers restarted and maybe assign tasks related to that. \n\nWhile \"Internal Project\" could fit well, I\u2019m also thinking about \"Miscellaneous\" as it serves as a catch-all for vague tickets. Ultimately, \"Internal Project\" seems the best choice based on the context, but I\u2019ll keep \"Miscellaneous\" in mind too.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
