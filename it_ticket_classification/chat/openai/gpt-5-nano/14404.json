The text mentions several issues related to time card status and annual leave approval, which makes it seem connected to HR. Because of this, it might fit best under \"HR Support.\" There\u2019s also some mention of access and administrative rights, so those could be possibilities too, but HR seems most relevant given the context. Let\u2019s go with \"HR Support.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket, which talks about time card status and approvals. This definitely fits under \"HR Support\" since it\u2019s related to payroll and annual leave. I considered \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access,\" but it\u2019s clear the focus is on HR-related issues like time card resubmissions. So, the best choice here is \"HR Support.\" I need to respond with a JSON object stating this category as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Let's make sure everything aligns with the provided category list!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
