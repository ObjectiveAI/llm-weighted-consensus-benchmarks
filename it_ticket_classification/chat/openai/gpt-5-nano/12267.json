It seems this could relate to an \"Internal Project\" or potentially \"Access\" if it involves mapping hosts. I\u2019ll weigh these options carefully to find the best fit for the ticket.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI see there's an \"Administrative rights\" category, while \"Access\" refers to permissions. The text mentions \"design lead\" and \"host,\" possibly indicating a mapping project tied to a specific host for \"Wednesday July PM.\" It\u2019s a bit unclear. I need to output a JSON with the appropriate category. Given the mention of \"new mapping,\" I think \"Internal Project\" might be the best choice, especially since it hints at leadership involved. I'll format it correctly as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Determining the right category**\n\nI see mentions of \"host\" and \"mapping,\" which suggest this could involve network or project mapping. \"Administrative rights\" might fit if it's about gaining privileges for mapping, but that\u2019s not clear. \"Access\" could also apply to host access or mapping. With some vagueness, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best option since it notes a \"design lead\" and \"new mapping,\" indicating a project context. I\u2019ll format my response as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Including a brief rationale could be helpful too, but I'll focus on just providing the category in JSON."
