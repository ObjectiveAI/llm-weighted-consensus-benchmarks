The user mentioned issues related to \"no data sent\" and \"viewing data,\" particularly with budgeting screens. I'm considering categories available: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. It seems like \"Access\" could fit best since it refers to data viewing problems, but \"Miscellaneous\" is an option if it's unclear. It might even fall under \"Internal Project\" if it's about an IT system. Let's categorize it!**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm deciding on the best category for the IT ticket, and it looks like \"Access\" fits well. The user mentioned issues with \"viewing data,\" indicating a possible visibility issue tied to access permissions. So, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" The response needs to be in JSON format, so I'll output it as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI want to keep it concise without adding extra commentary since the prompt specifies a JSON object only. Let's stick with that!"
