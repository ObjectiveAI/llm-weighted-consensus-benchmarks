The text mentions an \"approval error\" and frustration over submissions that were approved but not entered, which indicates it\u2019s likely related to some kind of access or permission issue. It could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" since that involves user permissions. However, \"Miscellaneous\" might apply too, given the text's garbled nature. I need to choose between \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Parsing IT ticket message**\n\nI'm analyzing the user\u2019s message: it mentions an \"approval error\" and a problem with something that was approved but not entered, indicating an issue likely related to workflow approvals. This seems to point towards the \"Access\" category, as it involves permissions or access requests. While \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant, \"Access\" seems to fit better with the context of approvals. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no explicit category for \"Workflow/Process\" or \"Approval.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"approval error sent Monday\" suggests that the approval email was sent out by the system, but an issue arises since something that was submitted still needs approval. I think this falls under the category of \"Access\" because it relates to approvals, likely for access requests. Now, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object per the given structure: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll keep it concise and straightforward, without adding extra comments."
