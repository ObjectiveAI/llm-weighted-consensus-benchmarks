Based on the sparse content, viable categories could be \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Access\" if permissions are involved.**Choosing a Ticket Category**\n\nThe user's message, \"please create unknown pipeline,\" suggests they're requesting to create a pipeline related to an internal project. I should categorize it as \"Internal Project,\" although it might fit \"Administrative rights\" if it involves permissions. The inclusion of \"codes\" hints at a software builds pipeline, possibly for CI/CD. While \"Miscellaneous\" is a catch-all, there's a specific request here, so \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit for routing purposes.**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nThe phrase \"unknown pipeline\" lacks clarity, and terms like \"codes\" and \"additional information\" don\u2019t provide much context. However, the safest category appears to be \"Internal Project\" since it pertains to pipelines within a project framework. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object, with the category set as \"Internal Project.\" The output will strictly follow the expected format: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nNo extra text is needed. Let's keep it concise!"
