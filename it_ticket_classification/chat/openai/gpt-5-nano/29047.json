The reference to \"lead twitter\" might suggest the lead is on Twitter, yet it doesn\u2019t clarify that the issue involves access. The phrase \"view broken\" likely relates to the UI rather than being an access problem. So, I'm concluding that we categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" and prepare to respond in JSON format.**Preparing the final JSON response**\n\nI thought the final answer should just be the JSON object without any extra text. The instruction specifically mentions a \u201ccategory\u201d property for the response. Based on the user\u2019s input, it seems \"view broken\" points to a UI issue and is a high priority given the stack trace included. The mention of \"lead twitter\" might suggest they\u2019re involved there. Overall, I'll proceed with the response: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
