They mentioned several things, like allocated storage, environment files, and costs. The best fit seems to be the \"Storage\" category, as it directly relates to their concerns. They also mentioned procurement, so \"Purchase\" could apply, but the main focus is on storage. Overall, \"Storage\" feels like the most appropriate category to choose. Now, let's make sure to output this in the required JSON format.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond to this request by formatting a JSON object correctly, specifically with the \"category\" field. Based on what I've assessed, the category is \"Storage.\" Following the system instructions, I should ensure proper capitalization. \n\nEven though costs are involved, the main focus is on increasing storage space, so \"Storage\" is definitely the right choice. I\u2019ll just output the JSON format without any extra text, something like: \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"} \n\nOkay, I'm all set to deliver this!"
