The ticket describes issues with approving requests, indicating it\u2019s likely an access or permissions problem. It mentions failures in the approval workflow within ServiceNow. Overall, this clearly aligns with the \"Access\" category, as it's about controlling permissions for approvals.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to determine the right category for an IT ticket, considering \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the ticket focuses on approval of requests, it leans more toward the \"Access\" category, which covers permissions issues. The user is expecting a response in a JSON-like format with the category specified. So, I'll format my response accordingly. It\u2019ll end up looking like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and might include a brief justification for why I chose that category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
