The ticket text mentions a lack of space on a drive affecting their automation framework, which clearly relates to storage issues. The keywords like \"lack of space,\" \"partition,\" and \"storage issue\" indicate this is about their storage. So, I'll categorize it as Storage.**Crafting response in JSON format**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON category field based on the instructions. The format requires a category object, which means I should simply output it as a JSON string. Since it's likely a \"Storage\" category, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward with no extra analysis.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll craft the response as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}\n\nThat should do it!"
