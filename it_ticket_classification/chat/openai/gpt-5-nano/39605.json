The required output structure asks for: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}. \n\nSo I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Returning category JSON**\n\nI see that I need to return a JSON object based on the specified schema. It shows we should output a JSON with a category value. In this case, since the ticket belongs to the Purchase category, I will return: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. \n\nI only need to provide the JSON without any extra text, ensuring that it's concise and correctly formatted according to the schema provided. Alright, let's go ahead and output that JSON."
