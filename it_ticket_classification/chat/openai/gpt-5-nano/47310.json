The user states that they can only upload contracts using Explorer and are facing delays because they are unable to view documents. This leads me to think the ticket should be categorized under \u201cAccess,\u201d as it's about issues related to viewing and uploading documents due to browser compatibility constraints.**Evaluating Ticket Category**\n\nThe phrase \"IE Chrome issue\" seems to pertain to compatibility between Internet Explorer and Chrome. The user mentioned working on an \"internal project,\" but it's mainly about access to view documents and upload contracts, which is causing delays with a client. I think \"Access\" is the best category since these issues likely relate to access rights. While \"Administrative rights\" could be considered if it's about permissions, the ticket closely aligns with access issues related to browser compatibility.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
