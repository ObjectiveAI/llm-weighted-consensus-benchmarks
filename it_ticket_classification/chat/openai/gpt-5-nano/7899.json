Each category has its distinct purpose, so I\u2019ll ensure that I classify them correctly for efficient processing.**Interpreting Video Capabilities Request**\n\nThe user shared a lengthy text regarding video capabilities and solutions for video conferencing, highlighting various aspects like rooms with large TVs and thin clients. It seems they\u2019re looking for the best technical solutions and options that allow video calls while supporting secondary inputs. I need to consider how these capabilities can be interpreted and discuss potential solutions further. Also, it\u2019s noted that this communication might contain confidential information.**Categorizing Video Capabilities Ticket**\n\nThe user references \"Bucharest,\" probably as a location, while seeking the best solution for video capabilities, collaboration, and video calling across multiple teams. They mention needs like secondary input and infrastructure across various locations. This appears to be a typical IT infrastructure request about implementing video conferencing. I think \"Internal Project\" fits well since it involves video capabilities, but \"Hardware\" is relevant too because of the physical setups like TVs and thin clients. I need to choose the most appropriate single category for this ticket.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nIt seems like \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category for a project focused on implementing video conferencing capabilities across offices, which includes both hardware (like zero clients and large TVs) and software solutions. The user wants to discuss further about infrastructure across various locations, suggesting a technical design rather than just hardware. I\u2019ll respond with the necessary JSON format, keeping it concise and focused on the category: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
