I need to consider the different categories we have, like software issues, hardware problems, or network troubles. I wonder which one fits best for this ticket. It's important to route it to the right team to ensure a quick resolution. Let me make sure I'm being thorough and not missing anything that could help in categorization.**Categorizing ticket text**\n\nI see the user provided a detailed ticket about a password issue. It includes various technical aspects, like login errors and password resets. I need to classify it appropriately using the predefined categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since it primarily involves access issues due to a password problem, I think \"Access\" would be the best fit, but I want to be sure before finalizing it.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at this IT ticket, which is about password and login issues, leaning towards the \"Access\" category. The content discusses problems with invalid credentials and password resets, so \"Access\" definitely feels appropriate. I need to respond with a JSON object formatted correctly, containing the category. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to make sure everything is in the correct structure, matching the expectations. So, I'll keep it concise and just provide that JSON.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
