The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the information about connection issues and the mention of \"certificate template,\" it seems likely that \"Access\" might be the most appropriate category since it relates to network connectivity.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIn the IT ticket taxonomy, the \"Access\" category is meant for login and access issues, while \"Hardware\" would cover hardware problems. Given the mention of \"connection problems,\" this likely pertains to remote access or VPN issues. The phrase \"certificate template column\" could relate to Active Directory and might indicate a need for \"Administrative rights.\" However, it\u2019s safest to categorize it under \"Access\" since it directly relates to connection issues. The response should be formatted as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Preparing JSON Format**\n\nThe system requires the output in a specific JSON format, focusing on the \"category.\" The defined schema is clear: it should be an object with a category property. Given that the user's issue is primarily about \"connection problems,\" it seems best to categorize this as \"Access.\" However, I considered \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" due to the mention of the \"certificate template column,\" but \"Access\" still fits best for network connectivity concerns. So, the final response should be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
