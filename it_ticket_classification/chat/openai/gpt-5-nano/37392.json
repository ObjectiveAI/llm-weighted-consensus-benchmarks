However, the repeated instructions to \"submit your time cards for approval\" and raise incidents seem to relate more to access issues with the timecard system. Ultimately, the content is about submission errors and rejections, so I believe categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit since it doesn\u2019t cleanly fit other categories. I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI'm considering whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Access,\" since it mentions login issues and calendar view problems, along with software features like \"delete entry causes timecard switch error.\" However, it doesn't seem to relate to access permissions. So, \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the safest option. The instruction is clear that I should only respond with the category object. I\u2019ll just output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} without any extra text."
