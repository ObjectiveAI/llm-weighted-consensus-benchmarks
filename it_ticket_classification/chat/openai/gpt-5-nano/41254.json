The text discusses a keyboard key not working, which seems pretty straightforward. I'll output a JSON-like object with a category field. This issue likely falls under \"Hardware\" since it's about a physical keyboard malfunction. There is a chance it could also be categorized as \"Access\" if the keyboard issue affects login access, but I think \"Hardware\" is the more appropriate choice here.**Selecting ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the category for the IT ticket regarding a keyboard key not working. The options include categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Since the issue is clearly hardware-related, \"Hardware\" seems the best fit. Some might consider \"Access\" if it involves a login key, but it's specifically about the laptop's keyboard. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} as required, since the instructions ask for a straightforward output.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
