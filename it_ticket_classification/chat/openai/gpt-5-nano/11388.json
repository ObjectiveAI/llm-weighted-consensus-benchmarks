Phrases like \"shipment received,\" \"installation tickets,\" and \"old machines retrieved\" stand out, indicating it relates to hardware assets and procurement. I\u2019m considering \"Hardware\" because it mentions older devices, but \"Purchase\" also fits due to the reference to a PO number and buying old devices. Overall, it seems related to IT operations, so a decision is required.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m going through the categories provided: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the main focus seems to be on hardware asset management and installation tickets, I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit. There's mention of \"old machines retrieved\" and the purchase aspect tied to PO numbers, which could point to \"Purchase.\" However, the primary request is about creating installation tickets, making \"Hardware\" the most appropriate choice. I'll format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
