Since the allowable values include things like Hardware and Access, I\u2019ll make sure to follow the schema provided for correct formatting of the output. \n\nOkay, let's format that correctly!**Assigning ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the ticket based on its content, which is about increasing mailbox size and managing mailbox storage. It includes phrases like \"delete items\" and \"empty deleted items folder,\" pointing clearly to a storage issue rather than administrative rights. \n\nGiven that it's all about storage quotas for the mailbox, I\u2019ll categorize it under \"Storage.\" Now I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object, ensuring I follow the specified requirements and provide only the category value.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to provide that in the specified schema. It looks like I\u2019m supposed to output a JSON object with the category as \"Storage.\" The earlier specifications indicate that the output should match the required format, particularly emphasizing that the key is \"category\" with the respective value.\n\nBased on this understanding, I\u2019ll just output the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} directly, keeping it concise and without any extra text!"
