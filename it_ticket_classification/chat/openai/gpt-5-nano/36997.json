Given that these are physical doors, the most fitting category seems to be \"Hardware.\" It looks like this ticket is about hardware issues affecting access to specific areas.**Classifying IT Ticket Again**\n\nI'm considering whether the ticket relates to \"Access\" since it mentions \"doors issues,\" which could imply access control problems like badge readers. It\u2019s also possible that these are physical doors, linking to the \"Hardware\" category. However, as this is an IT ticket and reflects a concern about access control, it seems logical to categorize it under \"Access.\" \n\nIt appears the user is requesting urgency, suggesting we should format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
