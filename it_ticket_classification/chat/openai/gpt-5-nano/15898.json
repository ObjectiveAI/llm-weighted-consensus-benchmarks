Also, \"Access\" could be relevant if it's about permissions, while \"Administrative rights\" might apply too. However, terms like \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Internal Project\" don't seem relevant here. So, it\u2019s likely to fall under \"Storage\" or \"Access.\"**Categorizing IT request**\n\nThe user's request includes, \"copy his mailbox,\" which could suggest they want to copy or back up a mailbox. If it's related to backing up, that clearly falls under \"Storage.\" Many IT tickets categorize backups this way. If they\u2019re looking for access to copy the mailbox, it could be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but the mention of \"backup\" leans towards storage. I should respond with a JSON format, indicating the category as \"Storage.\" So I'll prepare the response now.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
