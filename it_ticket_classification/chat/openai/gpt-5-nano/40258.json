The categories I can use are predefined as hardware, HR support, access, miscellaneous, storage, purchase, internal project, and administrative rights. Since the issue revolves around sockets, it seems to fit best under hardware. I'll need to output a JSON object that specifies the category accurately, ensuring it matches the provided guidelines. This should be straightforward!**Determining the IT ticket category**\n\nThe user's message mentions having a problem with \"sockets\" on what seems to be the \"4th floor.\" It appears to refer to either electrical or network sockets. Since \"networking\" isn't an available category but the issue is likely hardware-related, I\u2019ll classify it as \u201cHardware.\u201d Other categories like \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" don\u2019t seem applicable. Though \"Miscellaneous\" could be a possible fallback, \"Hardware\" is my best bet for this ticket. Let's go with that!**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nIt seems clear that this is a hardware issue, given the mention of \"sockets.\" Since the message implies the problem was solved, I should categorize the ticket as \u201cHardware.\u201d I need to ensure my output is a JSON object, following the exact instruction. \"Miscellaneous\" could be a backup, but \"Hardware\" fits best. I\u2019ll just include the category in the JSON format, and no extra text is necessary. Here\u2019s the final output:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
