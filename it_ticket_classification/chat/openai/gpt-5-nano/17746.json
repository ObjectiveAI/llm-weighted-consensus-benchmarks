                    "reasoning": "**Evaluating elastic limit increase**\n\nI'm trying to understand how to increase the elastic limit for a static machine. It involves logging under a name and assigning a queue, then testing after the change. They mention allocated maximum numbers, approvals, and order increases, which makes me think this is related to computing resource limits rather than hardware or HR. It doesn't seem like direct access control but rather administrative rights connected to purchasing and resource allocation.**Categorizing internal resource requests**\n\nI'm considering the best category for this request focused on internal resource management. \"Storage\" doesn\u2019t really fit, and \"Miscellaneous\" is too broad. \"Purchase\" seems relevant since increasing license or capacity might require a purchase. There\u2019s also a mention of \"Administrative rights,\" indicating a need for access when logging in and assigning resources. Given the context of provisioning on Elastic instances, \"Purchase\" might be the safest choice, as it aligns with requests for increased limits and resource orders.**Categorizing request for elastic limit increase**\n\nThe user mentioned that \"elastic limit finally increased by name tool.\" This suggests it might relate to provisioning a resource in an internal project. While I usually think \"Infrastructure: Cloud/Elastic instances\" for such tickets, that category isn\u2019t an option here. The closest ones are \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Purchase.\" Since the ticket discusses increasing the elastic instance limit, which often involves ordering capacity, categorizing it as \"Purchase\" makes sense. I\u2019ll respond with the appropriate JSON format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
