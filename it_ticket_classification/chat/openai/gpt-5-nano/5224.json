They mention a \"new starter\" and the need to create credentials. It sounds like they\u2019re requesting help onboarding someone by creating an account based on an attached form. This seems to fit best under the \"Access\" category since it's about user accounts and access to systems. HR support is relevant too, but it's primarily an access issue!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIt seems the most suitable category for this IT ticket is \"Access.\" Although \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" could be considered, \"Access\" is more general and fits better, especially since the request is focused on creating credentials. I need to provide the response in the required JSON format. The correct output should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra text to keep things clear and straightforward!**Returning JSON Category**\n\nI need to provide just the JSON for this IT ticket category. The ticket highlights a \"new starter\" and mentions \"create his credentials,\" which confirms it's an Access issue. Although it could arguably relate to \"HR Support\" due to onboarding, the primary task here is about access permissions. So, the definitive category for this IT ticket is \"Access.\" I'll return the response as follows: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let\u2019s move forward!"
