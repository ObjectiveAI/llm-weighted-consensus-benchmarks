The predefined categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given that the user is asking for a bigger mailbox, I think \"Storage\" is the most appropriate category, as it relates directly to mailbox quota rather than administrative rights or access.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nIt seems the best category for the IT ticket is \"Storage,\" since the request is about increasing mailbox storage quota. Though there\u2019s a mention of local archiving, the main focus is on allowing bigger mailboxes. The user has specifically asked for a categorization, so I'll respond with a JSON object. According to the system's requirements, I'll format it correctly as {\"category\":\"Storage\"}, ensuring it has the necessary quotes and nothing extra."
