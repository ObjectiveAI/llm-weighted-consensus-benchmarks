The potential categories include \"HR Support\" and \"Access.\" Since the message emphasizes the HR process, I\u2019m leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the best choice. However, it could also be \"Access\" if it pertains to onboarding and permissions for the new starter. I'll consider both options carefully.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s message doesn\u2019t explicitly mention access or credentials; instead, it's focused on completing a starter form for induction, which seems to fall under administrative HR onboarding tasks. Therefore, I'll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" I need to provide a JSON-like response, so I\u2019ll format it correctly to match the schema. The output will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I don't think \"Administrative rights\" applies here since those terms aren\u2019t mentioned, so \"HR Support\" feels right!"
