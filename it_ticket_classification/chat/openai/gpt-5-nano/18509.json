The potential category options include \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" and others. It seems to focus on purchasing hardware and managing receipts, which indicates it's primarily about procurement. While \"Hardware\" is relevant due to the mention of monitors, the main action suggests that the \"Purchase\" category is most appropriate for this ticket.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and it mentions several key phrases like \"new purchase,\" \"purchase order,\" \"monitors,\" \"log installation,\" and \"receipts.\" This indicates that it's about purchasing hardware monitors and coordinating their installation. While \"Hardware\" could apply because of the monitors, the focus on purchase orders makes \"Purchase\" the best choice. The key request is to categorize, so I'll respond with a JSON object in the format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
