It seems to relate to budgeting or procurement. I think \"Purchase\" fits best, but since there\u2019s no explicit purchase action, I could also consider it as \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project.\" It's a bit tricky!**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to categorize this IT ticket. \"Internal Project\" could work if it relates to a project cost review. However, \"Purchase\" fits better since it pertains to procurement and mentions an attached Excel document about costs. It suggests a request for budget or cost estimation for a project. \n\nI should probably categorize it as \"Purchase,\" although \"Internal Project\" could fit since it involves checking costs within a project. It\u2019s tricky!**Choosing ticket category**\n\nThe text mentions \"project costs\" and \"checking costs\" repeatedly, along with \"application\" potentially relating to a cost for an application. I lean towards categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" since it's focused on checking project-related costs. \n\nWhile \"Purchase\" could apply, it seems more about buying rather than tracking costs. With the user mentioning an \"attached excel doc,\" it looks like they're budgeting for the project. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and respond with a JSON object that includes the category!**Structuring JSON response**\n\nI need to create a JSON object according to the given schema, which requires a \"category\" field with a string value from the allowed categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nSince I'm categorizing the ticket as \"Internal Project,\" the response will look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to keep it concise with no extra text."
