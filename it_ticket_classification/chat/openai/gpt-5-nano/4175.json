They mention \"new delivery\" and several hardware items like a mouse, headset, cables, and a keyboard. It's possible this could fall under \"Hardware\" because of the focus on receiving new items. However, there's also mention of \"PO,\" which might suggest it relates to purchases, so it could fit into \"Purchase\" too. I think \"Hardware\" might be the best initial category here for this ticket.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user's message indicates they're dealing with a delivery that includes various hardware items, like a mouse and headset. The repeated \"po\" could suggest purchase order numbers, but since they want to log it, I think the best category here is \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll respond with the required output format, giving them a concise JSON object that specifies the category as \"Hardware.\" I want to ensure it's clear and meets their needs without additional commentary."
