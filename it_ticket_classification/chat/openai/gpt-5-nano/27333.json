So, I think I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" That seems like the most fitting choice!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing the phrase \"permission to send to all staff,\" which seems to be asking for approval to email everyone. The part about \"add shared mailbox\" also implies a need to access or create a shared mailbox. The keywords suggest that the user wants to categorize this ticket for triage purposes. Given that it relates to permissions, \"Access\" feels like the most suitable category. I should respond with a JSON object formatted as specified by the user.**Responding with JSON Category**\n\nThe system indicates that I need to respond with a JSON object for the category. The allowed values include categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the content, phrases like \"permission to send to all staff\" and \"add shared mailbox\" relate mainly to access permissions, making \"Access\" the most fitting category. However, I consider \"Administrative rights,\" but since it's more about access control, I\u2019ll stick with \"Access.\" I'll format the response in JSON as required.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
