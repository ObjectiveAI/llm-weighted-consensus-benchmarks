The ticket mentions things like a \"new purchase,\" a \"purchase order,\" and \"adaptor\" installation, which suggests it's related to hardware. \n\nThe system has specific categories, such as \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. Since this ticket is focused on logging a hardware installation, I'll classify it as \"Hardware.\" \n\nThe final JSON output will look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Determining the appropriate category**\n\nI think the \"purchase\" category fits best for this IT ticket. The user mentions \"new purchase\" and \"purchase order,\" which clearly points to Purchasing. While \"Hardware\" could work too because of the adaptor plug, the focus seems more on procurement and installation. \n\nThe other categories, such as \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project,\" don\u2019t seem relevant. So, I'll go with \"Purchase\" and output it in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
