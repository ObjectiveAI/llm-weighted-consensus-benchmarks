It looks like they're asking to investigate a clone incident button in ServiceNow. The aim is to have the task summary describe populated with the same information as related incidents and prevent closure. This request seems to fit as a feature enhancement in ITSM. I have to decide which of the provided categories like \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" fits best for this request.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize the ticket, which is focused on ServiceNow ITSM features. It's definitely not about hardware, access, storage, purchasing, HR, or administrative rights. The most fitting categories are \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it's a feature request for a clone incident button to improve internal processes, \"Internal Project\" seems appropriate. I\u2019ll structure my response as a JSON-like object, using the required format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} as the final answer.**Finalizing Category Response**\n\nThe system's \"category\" schema requires a JSON object with a \"category\" field. I will respond with {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} since that\u2019s the fitting category for this ticket. Although it crossed my mind to provide a brief justification, I think it's best to keep it minimal, as the user simply asked to categorize. I\u2019ll make sure to spell \"Internal Project\" correctly according to the expected format. Now, let\u2019s finalize this response!"
