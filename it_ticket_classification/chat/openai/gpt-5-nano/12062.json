Categories to consider include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, and Administrative rights. Which one fits best?**Determining the ticket category**\n\nThe ticket seems to request adding someone to a project, possibly granting access to resources, which could mean it fits under \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it's clearly project-related, I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project.\" However, \"Access\" is specifically for permissions, and the phrase \"add administrative rights\" isn\u2019t included. The user's message also seems a bit jumbled. I'll go with \"Internal Project\" as the most appropriate category, ready to present it in the required format as { \"category\": \"Internal Project\" }.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
