Given that the primary focus is on access and credentials, it seems most fitting to categorize it as \u201cAccess\u201d due to the login and credential issues.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI see that \"Mailbox full\" could relate to storage, but the main issues here revolve around access, login, and server connectivity. It makes the most sense to categorize this ticket as \u201cAccess.\u201d I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object, focusing solely on the category. The required format involves providing a \"category\" field with the string value \"Access.\" It looks good, so I\u2019ll just go ahead and respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
