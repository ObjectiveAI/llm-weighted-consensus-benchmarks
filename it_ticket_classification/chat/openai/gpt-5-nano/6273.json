There's no direct \"Software\" category, so maybe \"Internal Project\" applies if it\u2019s internal. However, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the best option overall. I also considered \"Administrative rights,\" but the ticket doesn\u2019t specify if admin rights are required. Since it mainly concerns installing an application, my final choice is leaning towards either \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\"**Deciding on category**\n\nI need to categorize a request for an application installation. While \"Internal Project\" might fit tasks within a project, this feels like a standalone request, so \"Miscellaneous\" seems more appropriate. I have to provide a JSON object with the category field, and the format allows only specific types. Although I considered adding a justification, the prompt only asks for the category. Following the guidelines, I\u2019ll just output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} \n\nThat seems like the safest route!"
