It sounds mostly focused on hardware since they mention purchasing devices and installation. Given this context, the category that best fits seems to be \"Purchase.\" I'll ensure to properly classify it so the user gets the assistance they need!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on the user's text. It mentions \"purchase,\" \"device,\" and \"installing device,\" suggesting it fits either the \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware\" category. Since it's focused on the procurement process related to received items and includes a new purchase order, I think \"Purchase\" is the best fit, as the database likely uses it specifically for procurement issues.
