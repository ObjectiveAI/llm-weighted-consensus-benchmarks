I have a specific list of categories to draw from: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll create an output in a JSON-like format with a \"category\" property. The goal is to accurately classify the ticket based on the content. I\u2019ll start by parsing the ticket now.**Categorizing upgrade messages**\n\nThe user discusses an upgrade process that includes a free drive head analysis and mentions planned days off. The text is a bit garbled, but I can see references to the upgrade process, moving personal files to a separate drive, and storage tools for identifying the largest files and folders. Given the recurring mention of \"storage,\" it feels appropriate to categorize this IT ticket as \"Storage.\u201d I'll confirm this choice based on the content.**Clarifying category format**\n\nI noticed there's a mention of \"administrative rights\" and \"access,\" but those don\u2019t seem to apply directly here. The main focus remains on storage, especially with references to upgrades and moving files. I plan to categorize this IT ticket as \"Storage.\" However, I need to ensure I follow the specified format, which asks for a JSON object with the category clearly enumerated. So, the final output should simply be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
