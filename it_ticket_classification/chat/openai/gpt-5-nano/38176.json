From the available categories, I\u2019m considering \"Hardware\" since it fits with the card malfunction. However, \"Access\" seems even more relevant because it relates to access control. The mention of \"new range\" may hint at different types of cards, so that reinforces the idea of access issues. I'll go with \"Access\" as the best choice!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering what \u201cnew range\u201d means, possibly a new range of cards, and if the phrase \"open for incident for finding\" suggests they\u2019re looking for a root cause. I\u2019m torn between \"Access\" and \"Hardware\" for the category. Since the issue is about cards not working, it likely relates to access control, making \"Access\" the more suitable choice. I\u2019ll format my response in JSON like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Just keeping it simple!"
