It seems to fit best under either Internal Project or Administrative rights since it discusses creating an approval flow. Let's categorize it accordingly!**Categorizing Workflow Design**\n\nThis looks like a workflow design for approvals, likely tied to an internal project. The options seem limited: it doesn't fit categories like Hardware, Access, Storage, or Purchase. \"Internal Project\" feels quite fitting since it discusses creating a workflow for bench approvals. The terms \"bench\" and \"oracle\" hint at this application area. Now, I need to respond with a JSON object for the category. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let's keep it straightforward!"
