The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It seems to relate to timekeeping, so \"HR Support\" might fit best. However, since it's an IT ticket about a system operation, I'm pondering if \"Internal Project\" or even \"Miscellaneous\" could work, but ultimately, \"HR Support\" feels like the closest match for submission-related issues. I'll prepare the JSON object for that category.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
