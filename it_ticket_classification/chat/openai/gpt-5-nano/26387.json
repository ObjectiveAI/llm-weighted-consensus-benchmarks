The category options feel pretty limited here!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket seems to be related to an \"annual service recovery test,\" which involves disaster recovery, documentation, templates, and test code. It feels like it could fit under \"Internal Project\" since it's about project planning for service recovery testing. However, it might also fit \"Miscellaneous\" if it doesn't neatly drop into one category. Given the references to \"restore location\" and \"restore templates,\" it could also go under \"Storage,\" especially because it relates to backup and restore. I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit here!**Providing category JSON**\n\nIt looks like the ticket involves \"document template forms\" and \"restore template documentation,\" which seems connected to creating templates and tests for disaster recovery, marking it as an internal project. Given the limited category options, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best fit here. Since the instruction is to provide a JSON object with the category, I\u2019ll format the final answer like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll be sure to ensure it\u2019s valid JSON without any extra text!"
