It seems they\u2019re experiencing problems with updates not saving correctly and encountering error messages. They\u2019re likely referring to an HR system or scheduling tool. I think the best categories for this ticket might be \"HR Support\" since it relates to work patterns, but \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could fit too. I'll need to decide which is most appropriate.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI think we\u2019re looking at a ticket related to an HR system concerning work patterns and schedules. It seems that \"HR Support\" is the right category since it directly relates to work hours. The instructions are clear that I need to respond in a specific JSON format, so I\u2019ll present it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI also need to ensure there\u2019s no extra text included, just the JSON.
