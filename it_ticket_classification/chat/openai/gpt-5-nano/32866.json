Ultimately, I need to choose a category that fits\u2014likely \"HR Support\" fits this ticket best, even if it's a bit unclear.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user's message mentions HR and maternity leave, which suggests that \"HR Support\" could be the right category. Alternatively, it could be linked to \"Access\" if it's about obtaining access rights to Oracle for HR. Since the phrase \"should be only HR\" implies that only HR can access Oracle, it seems related to access control. However, if it's about scheduling due to maternity leave, then HR Support fits better. I'll categorize it accordingly as HR Support.**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to provide the correct format for the user\u2019s request. They require a JSON-like object containing a category field. Based on my reasoning, I'll choose \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate category. \n\nSo, I should format my output strictly to reflect that category:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nIt\u2019s essential to ensure that the response meets the exact specifications laid out in the prompt, focusing on providing just the category value instead of the schema or any additional details.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
