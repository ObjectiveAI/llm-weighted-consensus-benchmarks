It might also fit under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" but \"Access\" seems most appropriate here.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user wants to be added, and I'm considering the categories available: \"Access\", \"Administrative rights\", and \"Internal Project\". The phrase \"add me to development\" suggests it's about joining a development project group, which aligns with \"Internal Project\". However, since it's primarily a request for access to resources, I believe \"Access\" is the most appropriate category.\n\nNow, I need to respond in JSON format, strictly including this category without any additional text. I'll format it correctly.{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Formatting IT Ticket Response**\n\nI need to follow the specified JSON format for the \"category\" tool. The output must be precisely parsed by code, which means I have to be accurate. The schema indicates that it requires an outer object with the property \"category,\" and the allowed value is \"Access.\" \n\nSo, the minimal valid response is indeed: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra text; I'll keep it simple and direct. Ready to respond with that!"
