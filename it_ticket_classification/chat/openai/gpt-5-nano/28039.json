The ticket is about a \"new starter\" and contains references to a \"starter form\" and an \"attached completed form.\" Since it likely concerns onboarding, HR Support seems like the best fit. It could also touch on Access or Administrative rights, but HR Support stands out as the primary category.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket and the options include \"Access,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It seems most likely to fit under \"HR Support\" since it deals with new starter forms and onboarding. While \"Access\" might relate to creating user accounts, the text doesn't specify anything about login or access rights. Instead, it focuses on HR and administration. So, the best choice here is clearly \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the category key.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nThey provided a category schema for the ticket, which requires me to output a JSON object with a category selected from enumerated strings. I'll go with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} as it fits the context best. It's important to make sure the quotes are escaped properly in the final output. The instructions don\u2019t specifically call for an explanation, so focusing on the JSON format is the priority. I\u2019ll finalize and output that JSON object accurately."
