Given the predefined category list, I think it might fit under \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous\" if it doesn't clearly belong anywhere else. The mention of planning officers and amendments suggests that \"Internal Project\" could be the best option since it seems to relate to project management. I'll go with that category!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
