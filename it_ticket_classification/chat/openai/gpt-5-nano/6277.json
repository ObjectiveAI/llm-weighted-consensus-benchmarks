From the ticket, it seems this pertains to network issues rather than hardware. Since the description strongly relates to bandwidth restrictions impacting connectivity, I should categorize this IT ticket under \u201cAccess.\u201d I'll format the output in JSON with the appropriate category field. Let's make sure everything is clear and accurate!**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm working on categorizing the IT ticket. The options I'm considering are \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or possibly \"Internal Project.\" However, \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Administrative rights\" don\u2019t fit. \"Hardware\" might apply if bandwidth were a hardware issue, but it's more about network performance. Since there's no distinct \"Network\" category, \"Access\" seems closest to cover connectivity issues stemming from bandwidth restrictions. I think I should go with \"Access\" for this ticket and format it in JSON!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
