The possible categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since this is primarily about permissions for sharing files, \"Access\" seems like the best choice. I can't suggest a subcategory like \"Permissions,\" so I'll go ahead and pick \"Access\" and respond in the required JSON format.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nThe task requires me to categorize the IT ticket and provide a JSON output. The schema tells me to include a category field, so I\u2019ll create the JSON object with \"Access\" as the selected category. This means I should output it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to ensure that it\u2019s just this JSON object without any additional commentary or details. Keeping it simple and concise is the goal here!"
