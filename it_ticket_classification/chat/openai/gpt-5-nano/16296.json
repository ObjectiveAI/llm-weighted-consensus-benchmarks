The ticket mentions \"bucket for internal project,\" which suggests it might belong to the \"Internal Project\" category. However, there's also a mention of charts and an \"attached form,\" which could imply it relates to \"Storage\" or even a project management task. Overall, it\u2019s quite unclear because the content is garbled.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm leaning toward classifying this ticket under the \"Internal Project\" category since the user explicitly mentions \"internal project\" multiple times. The categories list includes \"Internal Project,\" so it likely fits there. However, there's also a mention of a \"bucket,\" which could suggest \"Storage\" if that refers to a storage bucket. Given the clear focus on creating a bucket for an internal project, I should categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" I'll need to format my response as a JSON object with the appropriate category field.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
