The schema outlines several categories, including \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the ticket is about a temporary need for an external hard drive, it relates closely to \"Hardware\" but could also fit under \"Storage.\" I\u2019m trying to decide which category is the best fit for this specific request. Ultimately, both options are valid, but I\u2019ll have to choose one.**Deciding on category for the ticket**\n\nSince the request is for an external hard drive, I need to choose the most precise category. While \"Storage\" could fit since it's a storage device, \"Hardware\" seems more appropriate given it's about obtaining a physical device for testing. The ticket explicitly states the need for an external hard drive. I\u2019ll decide on \"Hardware\" as the primary category. Finally, I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That keeps it clear and straightforward."
