The ticket includes mentions of notifications for tasks due by Thursday and various details about task assignments and suppliers. \n\nSince it involves project management and notifications, it seems to fit best under \"Internal Project.\" That appears to encapsulate the essence of what the user is asking. I want to make sure I get this right!**Deciding on the ticket category**\n\nI'm considering which category fits the IT ticket best. It mentions \"selected owner,\" \"task owner,\" and notifications, suggesting it's more about project management or workflow. The best choice appears to be \"Internal Project\" since it focuses on tasks and assignments within a project. \n\nEven though \"Miscellaneous\" is an option if things are unclear, \"Internal Project\" clearly addresses the content of the user's request. They want a categorized response, so I should format my output as a JSON object with that category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
