The potential categories from the system include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the context, it seems most fitting to select \"Internal Project\" since it involves site decommissioning and migration processes, although \"Administrative rights\" could also be considered due to the file uploading component.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI think the best category for this ticket might be \"Internal Project\" because it seems to involve site migration and transition. The user mentions removing a site and uploading files, which indicates they're looking to close down the old site and provide guides for the process. While \"Administrative rights\" seems relevant due to the site removal, \"Internal Project\" feels more suitable given the focus on migration and asset transfer. The message is a bit messy, but that's the general idea!**Selecting the category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding between categorizing the ticket as \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Storage.\" Since there are mentions of \"upload files\" and deadlines, it points to file transfer tasks. However, \"Internal Project\" seems the best fit for site migration-related tasks. So, I\u2019ll opt for \"Internal Project.\" Now, I need to format it correctly as a JSON object, specifically: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, and I\u2019ll confirm that this is all I need to provide!"
