This seems to relate more to \"Administrative rights\" or \"Purchase\" since those terms fit requisition approvals. In the IT ticket taxonomy, \"Purchase\" makes the most sense. The content mentions various factors like \"approvers framework\" and \"costs splitting locations,\" which leans towards procurement workflows. So, categorizing this as \"Purchase\" is the best approach. I'll format the response as a JSON object with the category property. \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
