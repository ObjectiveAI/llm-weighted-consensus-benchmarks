The user's message is a bit chaotic, mentioning issues around synchronization among teams, approvers, and the specified manager. These details about manager documents and approval workflows hint it might fall under Access or Administrative Rights. However, it could also be an Internal Project or Miscellaneous. It's quite a jumble!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to classify this IT ticket based on the categories listed: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative Rights, and Miscellaneous. It appears to deal with access permissions and synchronization of approval workflows, especially regarding the specified manager on documents. Terms like \"approver\" and \"documents\" lead me to think it fits under Access or Administrative Rights. However, the mention of \"annual leave\" leans toward HR topics. Ultimately, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" since that seems most fitting for provisioning issues.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket discusses mismatched approvers, synchronization issues, and managers specified on documents, focusing on access and approval rights. It seems best to categorize this as \"Access.\" Although \"Administrative Rights\" might fit as a subcategory for privilege escalation, the main theme points to general access provisioning. The reference to the \"right manager specified documents when joined\" confirms it's about onboarding and access. I'll format my final answer as a JSON-like object with the category as \"Access.\" Here we go: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
