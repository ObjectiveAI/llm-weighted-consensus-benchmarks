When I see \"hello please add,\" it seems like a request to add someone, but it\u2019s not clear. \n\nThe most fitting category could be \"Access\" for adding a user, but there's no explicit access request. If it's about a project or HR support, I might lean towards \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It seems unclear, so \"Miscellaneous\" might be best.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nWhen I read \"new head of am tuesday february head hello please add thanks head,\" it seems the user might be trying to communicate something like, \"New head of AM on Tuesday, February: please add.\" \n\nNot very clear! I\u2019m thinking \"Access\" fits best since \"please add\" might mean adding access or a user. However, I should note that the ticket text is garbled and consider asking for clarification. It's important to respond with the appropriate JSON object containing the \"category.\"**Outputting the category**\n\nI realize the output for categorizing the IT ticket needs to be a JSON object that matches the required enum. The instruction is clear: \"Please categorize this IT Ticket.\" \n\nGiven the context, I\u2019m thinking I should return: {\"category\":\"Access\"} since the user is asking to \"add\" something, likely access for the new head. The phrase \"new head of am Tuesday February\" points towards that. \n\nWhile \"Miscellaneous\" could also work if it\u2019s unclear, I believe \"Access\" is sufficient for this case. Let's make sure to format it correctly: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
