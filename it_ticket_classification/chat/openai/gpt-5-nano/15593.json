The user seems to be requesting adjustments and permissions related to project management. They mention issues with modifying forecasts and needing to double-check rights. So, this sounds like it falls under either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" both of which deal with permissions. I'll need to choose the most relevant category based on their request.**Choosing the IT ticket category**\n\nThe user wants to modify a PM report and is asking for double PM rights, which seems to indicate an access rights issue. I need to categorize the IT ticket as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the focus on permissions to modify reports, \"Administrative rights\" feels like the right choice. There\u2019s a possibility of \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but this situation clearly relates to permissions. So, I\u2019ll classify it as \"Administrative rights\" and output it in a JSON format: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
