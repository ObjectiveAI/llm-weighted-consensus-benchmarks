Given the context, it likely falls under \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll create a JSON object that clearly indicates the category. The output will say, \"Categorize this IT Ticket:\" followed by the appropriate category. It's essential to process the content accurately to ensure proper classification!**Evaluating IT ticket category**\n\nIt looks like I\u2019m dealing with a jumble of phrases regarding a \"new starter\" service and onboarding. The phrases mention a starter form and annual leave, indicating this might be HR support. However, the categories I'm considering include \"HR Support\" and \"Access,\" as it might involve systems access related to ServiceNow. There's no specific \"Onboarding\" category, but it seems \"HR Support\" is appropriate, while \"Access\" could apply if it's about granting system rights. I'll need to clarify!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket, which mentions \"ServiceNow\" and a \"starter form,\" along with \"administration officer\" and \"upcoming annual leave.\" It looks like this relates to HR operations, likely about onboarding paperwork. While there\u2019s a possibility of it relating to \"Administrative rights,\" I think \"HR Support\" fits best, as it\u2019s about onboarding a new starter. I\u2019ll output a JSON object with the category set to \"HR Support,\" ensuring it matches the required schema.**Outputting the category in JSON**\n\nIt looks like the instruction indicates that I only need to provide the category in a JSON format, not an explanation. My best approach is to create a simple JSON object that states the category as \"HR Support.\" Since the system needs to parse this properly, I\u2019ll stick to the required format without additional commentary. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ll format it: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Let's proceed with that!"
