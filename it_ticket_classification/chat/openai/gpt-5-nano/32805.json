It looks like it's discussing a client request for changes related to scheduling and logging a call with a design lead. Even though there's some mention of HR, it seems to primarily fall under IT issues. I'll categorize it into one of the options provided. The most fitting category appears to be \"Internal Project\" given the context of changes and scheduling.**Parsing IT ticket content**\n\nI\u2019m parsing the content here. It mentions scheduling an instance for Friday July PM and indicates that a change has been made, asking to log a call and assign tasks. It also talks about a client request for changes and stopping the plan for an instance that is currently running. Given the context, this looks like it might fit best in the \"Internal Project\" category as it relates to project management tasks. Here's where I'll categorize it!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe text touches on \u201cdesign lead\u201d and mentions a client request to change plans for an instance. It seems related to change management, and there\u2019s a request to log a call about scheduling. Since there's no mention of hardware purchase or storage, I believe the best fit is \"Internal Project,\" as it pertains to an IT instance used in a project and involves client requests and changes. So, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and respond with the required JSON format. \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
