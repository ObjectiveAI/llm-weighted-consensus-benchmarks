It sounds like they found a solution but still need support. Now, I\u2019m considering the best category from the provided options. The phrase \"cable map drive\" likely refers to a network drive. This issue seems to relate to either storage or access, so I need to think about which fits better.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm evaluating how to categorize the IT ticket about a folder needing to be removed frequently after changes to a mapped drive. This could fall under \"Storage,\" \"Access,\" or possibly \"Administrative Rights.\" Though the user didn't mention rights, they seem to want help with a recurring folder issue. The mapping has resolved something for them. I think the best fit is \"Storage,\" since it directly relates to files and folders on a network share. I'll respond with the category in JSON format: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nThe user requested to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to provide the response in a specific JSON format. This should include just the \"category\" field without any extra comments. From my analysis, the best category is \"Storage,\" as it relates to network drives and the folder needing frequent removal implies it's about file management. I've checked to see if \"Access\" might fit better, but since this issue revolves around drive mapping, \"Storage\" is definitely the right choice. So, I'll go with: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}."
