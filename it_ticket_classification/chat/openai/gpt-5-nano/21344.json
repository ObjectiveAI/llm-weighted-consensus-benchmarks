The keywords indicate this is tied to purchasing and logging an installation, so it seems logical to assign it to the \"Purchase\" category. However, since installation isn't a listed category, I should definitely stick with \"Purchase\" as the best fit.**Categorizing IT ticket response**\n\nI\u2019m going with \"Purchase\" for the IT ticket since it clearly mentions a new purchase order. I need to format my response correctly as a JSON object based on the provided schema. The allowed categories include \"Purchase,\" and that's the one that makes sense here. I'll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I should be careful to ensure that it\u2019s formatted properly, sticking to the instruction to only include the category in this format. Here it is!"
