They provided a text that looks like it's about employees who are not active, and something about investigating. To categorize this accurately, I'll consider the predefined categories like Hardware, HR Support, and Access. It sounds like this might relate to HR Support since it seems to be dealing with employee account activity. I'll keep working on interpreting the details.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm working on decoding the user's IT ticket. The message is unclear, but it seems to touch on employees' access statuses and an item about investigating. The mention of \"active\" employees suggests it\u2019s related to user accounts. The category \"Access\" seems to fit best since it\u2019s about access status; there\u2019s also a possibility for \"Administrative rights,\" but that doesn\u2019t seem accurate here. Overall, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" and format the response as instructed.**Preparing the output format**\n\nI need to create a category object based on the ticket classification. The format is specified as a JSON-like string, which should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The prompt emphasizes responding with just the category. While I\u2019m considering whether \"Administrative rights\" might fit, the focus seems to lean towards \"Access\" due to the context of the ticket. I'll make sure the output is precise and adheres to the required format. Let's produce that!"
