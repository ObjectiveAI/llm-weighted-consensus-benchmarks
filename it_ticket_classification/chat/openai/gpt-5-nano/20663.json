This ticket could relate to an Internal Project given it's about a new project code, or potentially Access, Miscellaneous, or even Purchase. The mention of Oracle Fusion suggests it's project-related, leaning towards the Internal Project category.**Categorizing project as JSON**\n\nThe ticket text \"new project code oracle fusion friday february pm\" can be divided into components: \"new project code\" likely refers to an internal project, \"oracle fusion\" is a software, and \"friday february pm\" hints at scheduling. It looks like the best category is \"Internal Project.\" I need to format my response in JSON, structured like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} while ensuring it follows the required schema. However, I did think about \"Access,\" just in case it relates to access for Oracle Fusion.**Delivering final category JSON**\n\nSince there's no explicit access mention, I'll go with \"Internal Project\" for categorization. Now, I need to prepare the final answer in JSON format with just the category, no extra commentary necessary. The user has asked me to categorize the IT ticket clearly, so I'll deliver the JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That's it! Now, let\u2019s provide that to the user."
