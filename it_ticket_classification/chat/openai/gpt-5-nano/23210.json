The details make me think it belongs to \"HR Support\" or \"Internal Project\" because it discusses usage and costs related to a project. However, since it pertains to reporting, \"Internal Project\" seems most fitting. I\u2019m considering \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" but those don\u2019t align as closely. The mention of financial aspects isn't covered in the existing categories.**Selecting Category for IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that the best fit for this ticket is \"Internal Project\" since it focuses on reporting related to a project. While \"Miscellaneous\" could also apply, the context makes \"Internal Project\" more appropriate. The sender, identified as \"Application developer,\" likely needs this report. I need to respond with a JSON format as instructed, only including the category without any extra commentary. So, my output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
