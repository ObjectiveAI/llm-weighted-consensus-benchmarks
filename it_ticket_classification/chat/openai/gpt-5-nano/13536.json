The categories provided include things like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it seems to involve onboarding, I think \"HR Support\" fits best. However, if access to systems is needed, that could make \"Access\" relevant too. Overall, it looks like this ticket relates to the onboarding process for a new starter.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI see that the text doesn't specifically mention access or hardware. It talks about providing a \"starter form,\" which suggests it's more about onboarding. So, I'm thinking \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category here, rather than \"Administrative rights,\" which doesn't relate to forms. Although \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous\" don't seem to fit either. I need to respond with a JSON object containing the selected category, following the required format without adding additional explanations.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
