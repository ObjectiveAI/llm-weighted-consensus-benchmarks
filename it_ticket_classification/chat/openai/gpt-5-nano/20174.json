The text suggests it's related to onboarding since it mentions filling out a form for a joiner. I\u2019m considering whether to label it under \"HR Support\", as it directly relates to new hire procedures, or \"Administrative rights\" if it focuses more on access permissions. The ambiguity makes it tricky, but it definitely seems tied to onboarding in some way.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nSince this task is clearly about onboarding, I think \"HR Support\" is the best fit for the category. The user has asked me to categorize the IT ticket, and it looks like I should respond with a JSON-like format. The structure requires a category string, so I'll go ahead and create that object: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll keep it simple and straightforward, without adding extra explanations unless the user asks for more clarification."
