The text mentions \"new starter keys,\" \"AD credentials,\" and a \"starter form,\" indicating it's related to onboarding a new employee. Since it includes requests for access and credentials, I think it fits best in the \"Access\" category. Another option could be \"Administrative rights,\" but it seems clear that \"Access\" best captures the user's needs regarding new starter setup.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI realize that the \"Administrative rights\" category deals more with privileges, while onboarding that requires AD credentials seems to fit better under \"Access.\" Though \"Internal Project\" could be an option if it were project-related, I think \"Access\" is the right choice. The user requested to categorize the IT ticket, so I need to format my response as a JSON object with \"Access\" as the value for the category field. I'll respond accordingly.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
