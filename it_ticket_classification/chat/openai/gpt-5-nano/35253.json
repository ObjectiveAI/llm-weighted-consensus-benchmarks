Since it clearly deals with leave management, the best fit seems to be under \"HR Support.\" That category aligns with the HR context of the ticket.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nThe ticket involves an annual leave request and mentions errors in the leave balance screen, indicating it's an HR system issue with leave management.
