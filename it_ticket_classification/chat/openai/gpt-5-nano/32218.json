The category schema includes options like Hardware, HR Support, and Administrative Rights. The text mentions terms like \"people manager change\" and \"administration officer,\" which makes me think it relates to HR Support. However, \"Administrative rights\" might also fit given the context. Overall, I think the best choice here is \"HR Support\" since it seems most relevant to personnel management.**Deciding the IT ticket category**\n\nThe text mentions \"change\" and \"administration officer,\" along with \"manager change,\" which may indicate administrative rights changes or user role adjustments. Since \"Access\" isn't a listed category, I should focus on \"Administrative rights,\" especially because it ties back to \"administration officer\" directly. The user likely wants to categorize this as \"Administrative rights\" rather than \"HR Support,\" since it's more about permissions. So, I think \"Administrative rights\" is the best choice for the category.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
