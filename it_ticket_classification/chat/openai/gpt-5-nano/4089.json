The available categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" Given the mention of access and requests, it seems to fit best under the \"Access\" category. However, it might also relate to \"Administrative Rights,\" though that's more specific to elevated privileges. Ultimately, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" based on the primary focus.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s message references \"accept decline requests,\" which suggests it's about managing access requests. This fits within the \"Access\" category, while \"Admin rights\" seems a bit too narrow. Parsing the message, it seems they might be asking for guidelines related to access. However, the focus on requests indicates it should mainly go under \"Access.\" I should format my response as a JSON-like category output: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and possibly include a brief justification.**Formatting category response**\n\nThe system specifies that I need to respond with a JSON-like object structured for a category. It should look like this: { \"category\": \"Access\" }. I realize that I only need to output the content without the schema details or extra formatting. The instruction clearly says to provide the category object. So I\u2019ll keep it concise and respond properly without any additional text. My final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
