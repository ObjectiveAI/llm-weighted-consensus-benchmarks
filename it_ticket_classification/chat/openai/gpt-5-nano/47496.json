It clearly mentions issues related to dropped calls and unusable connections. Given this context, it feels like a networking or connectivity issue, which might fit under \"Access\" if it's about login problems. However, the mention of engineers and meetings makes me think it could also be categorized as \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll aim to categorize it correctly based on this interpretation.**Evaluating IT ticket category**\n\nThe user's message mentions issues like unusable connections and dropped calls, which suggest a possible network issue. However, my options don't specifically include \"Networking\" or \"IT.\" While I could go with \"Miscellaneous\" as a catch-all, \"Access\" might fit if it's addressing login problems. Additionally, there's a chance it relates to \"Internal Project\" or even \"Hardware\" if related to network hardware. Since the categories are limited, I think \"Miscellaneous\" may be the safest choice for this ambiguous ticket.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
