The user's message seems quite messy, mentioning management code for Oracle and something unclear about \u201cpas pas Thursday pm code.\u201d They appear to be asking for help with creating codes for cost forecasts and filling out codes in Excel. It sounds like they might need assistance with their project.**Interpreting IT ticket details**\n\nIt sounds like the ticket is about Oracle and possibly \"PAs.\" The user seems to want help with creating code for forecasting costs and filling in Excel. They mention something about codes being due \"per Thursday pm,\" which is a bit garbled. I\u2019m thinking this might fit best under \"Internal Project\" since it involves code generation for forecasts and Oracle integration. Alternatively, it could also be seen as \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Internal Project\" seems more fitting for a development request.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants help filling in codes in Excel and creating cost forecasts. This could suggest a need for \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" but since they aren't explicitly requesting that, it seems more focused on generating code. Given the context of internal project work, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" \n\nI will respond with a JSON object, following the provided schema, outputting: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. This keeps it simple and direct!**Finalizing the response**\n\nThe user requested a categorization, and while it's not mandatory to provide justification, including a brief line might be helpful. However, the tool specifies that I should output only a JSON object with the \"category\" field. \n\nSo, I'll provide exactly that: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}` without any extra text. This format keeps it straightforward and meets the requirements perfectly!"
