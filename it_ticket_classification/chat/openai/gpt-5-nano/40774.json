They're describing a server issue with intermittent connection problems related to Confluence production servers and access for users to log in during specific periods. Given that \"Access\" seems to relate to user login issues, it feels like the best fit. The urgency of the request\u2014asking for high priority\u2014adds to the need for this classification. Let's make sure to assign it correctly!**Refining IT ticket categorization**\n\nI'm thinking through the categorization of this IT ticket. It really focuses on a \"server issue\" with intermittent connection, which points to an infrastructure problem. \"Hardware\" might work if it\u2019s about server hardware, but it doesn\u2019t seem relevant here. \"Access\" feels most appropriate since users are experiencing login issues, and the mention of \"intermittent connection\" ties into that. While there\u2019s no explicit mention of permissions, that connection aspect hints at access problems. So, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Access.\"**Finalizing IT ticket response**\n\nThe user has requested a high-priority investigation, so I need to craft a JSON-like category object. Based on our analysis, the right category is \"Access.\" I\u2019ll respond with just this category in the required format. The instructions specify that I should present a JSON object with the category field, ensuring it aligns with the schema provided. So, I\u2019ll finalize my response as: {\"category\": \"Access\"} and make sure there\u2019s no extra text."
