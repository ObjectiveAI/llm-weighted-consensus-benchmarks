Based on the content, it seems they might be referring to Oracle software issues. The phrase \"change into leave\" might be about vacation leave or a lease. It\u2019s unclear, but since the key topic appears to be related to software, I'll categorize it under \"Miscellaneous\" and format it in JSON: {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}.**Selecting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering multiple categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Hardware.\" Since the \"Oracle problem\" seems related to software, it wouldn\u2019t fit under hardware at all. The mention of a screenshot suggests something is confusing about the user's issue. They talked about \"change into leave,\" which might imply a request for access changes, but it's unclear. Given the ambiguity, \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the safest choice since it\u2019s broad enough to encompass their concerns.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the provided categories and trying to analyze the user\u2019s message. The mention of \"oracle problem\" suggests it\u2019s software-related, and since they talk about \"change into leave,\" it seems to connect with HR, particularly Oracle\u2019s leave management system. This indicates it might be an HR IT issue, especially with the details around changing their status. I think categorizing this ticket as \"HR Support\" makes the most sense since it's specifically about leave in the Oracle HR system.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
