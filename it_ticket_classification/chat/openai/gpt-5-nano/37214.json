While \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" could also be considered, they're not as relevant. So, I'll finalize the response with the category as \"Storage\" in the required JSON-like format.**Finalizing JSON Output**\n\nI need to produce a JSON object with the category set to \"Storage\" based on the user's request for mailbox capacity increase. The required format indicates a category field should be included without any extra text. My final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.
