Key points include submitting annual leave requests and calendar views for holidays. Given the HR-related context, it looks like this ticket falls under HR Support.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the options for categorizing this IT ticket: it could be \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project,\" among others. The content seems HR-related, focusing on leave management, absences, public holidays, and calendar views. So, I'll go with \"HR Support.\" I need to format this as a JSON category object since that's what's required. The proper JSON output will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.
