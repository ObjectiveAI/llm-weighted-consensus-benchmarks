This ticket is primarily about \"URL redirection\" or \"URL routing.\" It has high importance, and the user is looking for assistance to resolve the issue.**Categorizing IT ticket categories**\n\nI have several categories available for the IT ticket: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The ticket seems to fit best under \"Internal Project\" since it's about setting up a redirect related to the marketplace link for connectors. While \"Miscellaneous\" is an option, the task is definitely a software/configuration issue rather than just a general one. So, I think \"Internal Project\" is the most appropriate category to use here.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe category for this IT ticket is \"Internal Project.\" I need to respond with the required JSON-like structure as per the instructions. The format should include the \"category\" field, sticking to the allowed values specified. So, I will output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nIt's essential to keep it concise and straightforward without additional commentary, ensuring it fits correctly within the system's expectations for the response format.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
