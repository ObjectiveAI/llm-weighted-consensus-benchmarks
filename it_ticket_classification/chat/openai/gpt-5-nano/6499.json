It's talking about installing desktops and connecting monitors, mice, and keyboards, so it's likely about hardware setup and software installation. The categories I have are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The best fit seems to be \"Hardware\" since it revolves around hardware setup and software installation, even though both elements are mentioned. \"Miscellaneous\" seems too generic.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that \"Hardware\" is the best category since the ticket mentions hardware components like a desktop, monitor, mouse, and keyboard, as well as software installed locally. Therefore, the category will be \"Hardware,\" and I\u2019ll justify this by stating that the user asks for help with installing their desktop and connecting these devices. I\u2019ll output this in the specified JSON-like format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That seems straightforward, and including a brief note should cover it!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
