The user mentions a \"known pipeline,\" which makes me think it could relate to an internal project or perhaps access rights. \n\nI\u2019ll need to decide among categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Since \"per opportunity id\" suggests a connection to tasks related to Salesforce opportunities, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Internal Project.\" So, my output will look something like: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Deciding IT ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m looking at some generic IT support categories to classify this ticket. The request seems to involve creating a pipeline per opportunity ID, suggesting it fits best under \"Internal Project.\" \n\nThere\u2019s a possibility it could also relate to \"Access\" if access to the pipeline is necessary, but there's no mention of that. Overall, since the message seems a bit jumbled, I think \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category to route the ticket.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
