It mentions a \"starter form\" and appears related to onboarding. The options for categorization include things like HR Support, Access, and Administrative rights. Given the context of the message, it seems most aligned with \"HR Support,\" but I might also consider \"Administrative rights\" depending on the specifics regarding the user's need for access.**Examining ticket categorization**\n\nThe ticket repeatedly mentions \"administration officer\" and \"new starter\" which suggests it's about the onboarding process and completing forms. The options don\u2019t explicitly include \"Onboarding,\" but \"HR Support\" seems to fit well. I also see references like \"form complete\" and \"unable file,\" which might hint at \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, the main focus here appears to be on completing the onboarding process, so \"HR Support\" feels like the best category choice for this ticket.**Preparing JSON for ticket categorization**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category as \"HR Support.\" The schema requires a structured object, so I\u2019ll format it like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.\n\nWhile \"Access\" could be considered due to mentions of a \"starter form\" and a contractor, it doesn\u2019t seem explicit enough in the content. Therefore, I'll stick with \"HR Support\" as the appropriate category and respond with the clean JSON object without any extra text."
