They're saying their phone has poor battery autonomy and is blocking. They're requesting to replace the device. \n\nThe relevant categories I\u2019m considering are \"Hardware\" (since it\u2019s a hardware problem) or \"Purchase\" (because they want a replacement). I\u2019m trying to determine which category fits best for this scenario. I think \u201cHardware\u201d feels like the most appropriate choice here.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nThe user has a faulty device and is asking for a replacement. In many ticket systems, hardware issues usually fall under \"Hardware,\" and replacement requests are often categorized as \"Purchase\" or sometimes \"Internal Project.\" However, since the request clearly relates to a hardware issue\u2014the mobile phone's performance and battery life\u2014I think \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate. While mentioning \"Purchase\" makes sense, I'll go with the simpler and more direct choice of \"Hardware\" for this IT ticket.**Formulating category response**\n\nThe user provided a prompt for categorizing an IT ticket, and I need to output a JSON object based on the given schema. The category options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Since the ticket is about a hardware problem and the user is requesting a replacement, \"Hardware\" seems like the best fit. While \"Purchase\" could be another option, I'll stick with the clearer choice of \"Hardware\" and just return the JSON object. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
