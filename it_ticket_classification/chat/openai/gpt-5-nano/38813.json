The ticket mentions access issues, specifically noting problems with credentials renewed after maternity leave. Since the main focus is on general access, I think the best category here is \"Access\" rather than \"Administrative rights,\" as it's not specifically about admin privileges. I\u2019ll need to craft a structured response as a JSON-like object.**Structuring category output**\n\nThe system needs me to create a category object with specific fields. The prompt clearly asks to categorize the IT ticket in a certain way. I\u2019ll respond using the required JSON format, so that means it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to double-check that I\u2019m not adding any extraneous content, just providing the category itself. So, the final output will be exactly: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra explanations here!"
