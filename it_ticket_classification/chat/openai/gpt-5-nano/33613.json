The ticket is a bit jumbled but seems to focus on a purchase request and approval process, along with installation. Given the context, it seems best to categorize this as \"Purchase,\" as that seems to be the central theme within the ticket.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to output JSON with the category field set to \"Purchase.\" The required format involves creating a category object that specifies type as \"object.\" Based on what the system says, I should format my response as:\n\n{\"category\": \"Purchase\"}\n\nI don't need to include the \"type\": \"object\" wrapper; I just need the JSON object itself. Since \"Purchase\" is the best fit given the context, I\u2019ll keep the response concise and accurate. Let's deliver that JSON!"
