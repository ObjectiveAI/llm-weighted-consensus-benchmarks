While \"Administrative rights\" could also be an option, it seems more appropriate to classify it as \"Access.\" This seems clear!**Formatting Access Issue**\n\nI need to address a ticket that mentions problems with being prompted for a password despite entering the correct one. Since the user is asking to open a ticket regarding this issue, it's clear that it falls under \"Access.\" \n\nThe output should be formatted in JSON according to the system's requirements.
