It's a bit tricky, but I'm focused on making sure I get it right for optimal processing!**Analyzing IT request**\n\nIt sounds like this request is about migrating old files and archiving them. The message mentions links to guidelines, deadlines for file transfers, and a transition to a new site that's launching soon. There\u2019s also a note about preparing easy-to-follow guides for users as they navigate this change over the next couple of weeks. I\u2019m focusing on how to categorize this request based on its operational nature involving file management and site improvements!**Categorizing ticket options**\n\nI think the best category for this IT ticket could be \"Storage\" since it involves archiving old files and file transfers, with a deadline in October. The mention of \"site\" and \"files\" supports this choice. However, the categories are somewhat limited, so \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative Rights\" could also fit. I need to parse the request carefully since it mentions deleting old attachments too, which is relevant for categorization. Let's see how I can finalize my choice!**Determining the best category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to suggest deleting old files based on the request mentioning archiving and migration. The project involves transitioning from an old site, uploading files, and adhering to a deadline in two weeks. It seems to center around migrating a site and managing files, so it could fit under \"Internal Project.\" However, \"Storage\" might also apply due to the archiving aspect. \"Administrative Rights\" doesn\u2019t seem relevant, and \"Miscellaneous\" feels too vague for this specific task.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
