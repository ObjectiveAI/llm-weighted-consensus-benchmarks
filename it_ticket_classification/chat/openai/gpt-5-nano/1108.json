I'll prepare a JSON output including this categorization.**Identifying IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m working with a schema that requires a category for the IT ticket. The text mentions multiple terms related to an employee leaving, like \"leaver form,\" \"AD rights,\" \"roaming profile,\" and so on. It seems focused on offboarding and access removal processes. \n\nI think the \"Access\" category fits best, as it pertains to managing an employee's access during the offboarding process. So, I\u2019ll prepare the final JSON output with this category solely included.**Determining the Right Category**\n\nI'm considering whether the IT ticket fits better into \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" since it includes terms like \"AD rights,\" \"mailbox,\" \"roaming profile,\" and others related to deprovisioning. However, the focus seems to be on managing access. \n\nSo, I'll categorize this IT ticket as \"Access.\" I'll keep it succinct and prepare the JSON output accordingly for the user."
