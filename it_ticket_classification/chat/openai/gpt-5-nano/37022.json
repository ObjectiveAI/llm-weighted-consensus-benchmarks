They\u2019re experiencing a build failure related to Android build tools and licensing \u2014 this sounds like a software development issue. Unfortunately, the categories listed don\u2019t include \u201cSoftware\u201d or \u201cDevelopment.\u201d The closest options seem to be \u201cInternal Project\u201d or \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d Given the context of the problem, I think \"Internal Project\" might fit best since it pertains to a project build issue.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis IT ticket is about a build failure in Android tools licensing, which points to a development issue within an internal project. \"Internal Project\" seems like the best category, although \"Administrative rights\" could also apply due to license acceptance. However, the issue mainly revolves around the build failing due to unrecognized license acceptance. Given the limited options, \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting. So, I'll respond with the JSON format as required: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That's it!**Responding with JSON Format**\n\nThe system message clearly states that I need to output in the category object format, and given the urgency of the issue, \"Internal Project\" feels right. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and respond with the appropriate JSON object without any extra commentary. I want to ensure clarity and precision in my response. So, I\u2019ll format it like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That should fulfill the requirements perfectly!"
