I think this could fall under \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" Since the form is more focused on onboarding rather than IT hardware, I'd categorize it as HR Support or Administrative rights. However, if login credentials are needed, it might fit under Access.**Analyzing onboarding form request**\n\nThe text mentions a \"new starter\" and a \"starter form,\" along with a working location until the opening. It seems to come from the administration team requesting the new starter to complete onboarding paperwork. Given that it pertains to onboarding, I think categorizing it as \"HR Support\" fits best. If it were about gaining access, that would fall under IT, but there\u2019s no mention of access credentials or specific rights needed for filling out forms.**Finalizing category output**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to choose \"HR Support\" as the appropriate category. It seems I need to decide if I should output just the category field or a complete JSON object. Given the format specified in the instructions, it looks like I should create a JSON object with a \"category\" field. So, the final answer will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I want to keep this clear and straightforward without any extra content. Let's deliver this!"
