The content's grammar isn't great, but I think it fits into a category like \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nI'll output this as a JSON object with the appropriate category from the allowed list: [\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", \"Administrative rights\"]. It looks like it relates to corporate intranet awards.**Categorizing Approval Workflow**\n\nThe content mentions \"nomination submitted for your approval\" and details on reviewing nominations. This indicates it's about an approval workflow and accessing the zone approval tab. The best fit might be \"HR Support\" since it relates to award nominations. However, \"Access\" could also apply because it mentions accessing a link for approvals. The ticket clearly revolves around an HR award process, so I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"HR Support.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user has been asked to review and approve a nomination, with an approval link provided. The text mentions \"nomination details\" and directs the user to a \"zone approval tab,\" but it doesn\u2019t indicate any access issues, just action to be taken. \"HR Support\" seems like the most fitting category since it relates to an award nomination process within HR functions. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}, while ensuring the format is correct. Maybe including a brief note would be helpful too!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
