It sounds like this is mainly an \"Access\" issue since they're unable to access the files. However, it could also involve \"Storage\" if the files are located on a server. Overall, \"Access\" seems to be the most appropriate category for this ticket!**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nIt makes sense to categorize this ticket as \"Access\" since the user mentions they \"cannot access files.\" This suggests issues with permissions or access rights. However, it could also relate to \"Storage\" if the problem stems from file corruption. \n\nGiven the details about \"Excel files\" and the urgency mentioned, I\u2019ll categorize it definitively. I'll format my response as a JSON object with the category set as \"Access.\" So, the final output will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Following Output Instructions**\n\nThe instruction provides a clear schema for categorizing the IT ticket. It specifies the valid categories as Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since we're categorizing this ticket as \"Access,\" I\u2019ll format the output correctly. \n\nThe final response will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nNow, I can proceed with this response without any issues!"
