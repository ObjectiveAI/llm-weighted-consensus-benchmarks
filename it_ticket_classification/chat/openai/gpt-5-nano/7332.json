The ticket mentions \"oracle and pas project setup,\" details about assignments, and requests for action. \n\nGiven the key terms like \"setup,\" \"reference number,\" and \"completed setup,\" it seems appropriate to categorize it under \"Internal Project.\" This context aligns well with the details the user supplied.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing this IT ticket, which seems to focus on project setup and software involvement; it mentions Oracle and potentially the Product Assembly System. I'm considering \"Internal Project\" since it discusses project setups, templates, and completed setups. However, there's also the possibility of categorizing it under \"Access\" due to references to assignments and rights. Still, the overall context leans more towards \"Internal Project\" based on the multiple assignments and internal setup focus.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing the content related to the \"oracle and pas project setup.\" It seems to align well with \"Internal Project\" since it revolves around project tasks and instructions. The frequent use of \"setup\" in phrases suggests it's about project management rather than a hardware issue. Therefore, I plan to categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and format my response in a JSON-like structure as required: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I could ponder \"Administrative rights\" too, but the instruction mainly points to categorization.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
