The categories I have include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and a few others. Since this seems related to network connectivity after moving, \"Access\" might fit best. \"Hardware\" could also apply, but the mention of \"unit manager\" suggests escalation. Still, I'll go with \"Access\" since it relates to connectivity issues.**Formatting the IT ticket response**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket, and it looks like I should provide a JSON object with just the category property. The schema includes specific options like \"Access,\" \"Hardware,\" and others. I need to be careful to spell \"Access\" with a capital A since that's what the schema requires. The final output will be a JSON object with this category, and I'll make sure to follow the instruction precisely without any extra commentary. So, it\u2019ll be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
