This seems related to hardware or infrastructure. It could fit under \"Hardware,\" \"Internal Project,\" or even \"Miscellaneous.\" While \"Storage\" is a category, it seems hardware-focused because it's about physical installation. So, I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit, but it could also be \"Internal Project.\" I'll finalize it as \"Hardware.\"**Choosing the best category**\n\nI need to select the best category for this IT ticket. The ticket mentions \"SAN floor,\" \"meeting room floor,\" and an \"extra new network cable,\" which indicates it's about installing hardware. The categories available include \"Hardware\" and \"Internal Project.\" Since this request is about adding network cables, it fits best under \"Hardware\" rather than \"Internal Project,\" which is more about ongoing tasks. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware\" and format the answer in JSON as required.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
