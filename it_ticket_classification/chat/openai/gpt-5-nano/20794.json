The ticket mentions a \"new starter\" and \"starter form,\" suggesting it's about onboarding. I have several categories to choose from: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and a few others. Given the HR-related nature of the request, I think \"HR Support\" might fit. However, if it's related to access provisioning, \"Access\" could also be appropriate. I\u2019ll lean toward \"HR Support\" but consider \"Access\" as a backup.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned a \"starter form\" and attachments related to provisioning access for two new users, which suggests it's about onboarding. They also included a specific time for a Wednesday in February. Since the user wants me to categorize this ticket and respond in a JSON format, I know I have to choose between \"HR Support\" and \"Access.\" Given that the content emphasizes onboarding and forms, \"HR Support\" seems to be the most relevant category here. I'll format my response accordingly.**Finalizing the category selection**\n\nI'm deciding on the best category for the IT ticket, weighing \"HR Support\" for onboarding or \"Administrative rights\" if it's about access. Since it mainly concerns a new starter and forms, \"HR Support\" feels like the safest bet. I\u2019ll go with that and format my response as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. The schema requires the category to be a string, so I\u2019ll stick closely to that\u2014just the JSON object, no extra comments. Let\u2019s lock it in!"
