The term \"pm\" might refer to a project manager, suggesting an internal project. \n\nI'm thinking that this ticket could neatly fit into either \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" provisioning. The other categories seem less relevant based on the content. It's a bit chaotic, but I'm getting there!**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering that this ticket likely involves setting up access for a new starter. Words like \"new starter\" and \"please fill\" suggest there might be forms involved. I think \"Access\" is the best fit since IT tickets usually handle provisioning for new staff accounts, emails, and VPNs. The mention of \"former intern\" adds to this as it indicates someone moving on from an internship. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and present the JSON format as required!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm contemplating whether this ticket should be classified under \"HR Support\" since it mentions \"new starter\" and \"former intern.\" However, given that this is an IT ticket, \"new starter\" leans towards IT access provisioning. The taxonomy includes \"HR Support,\" but access requests are more commonly handled under \"Access.\" So it seems the best category is indeed \"Access.\" I\u2019ll output the JSON format without any extra text as requested. Here it goes: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
