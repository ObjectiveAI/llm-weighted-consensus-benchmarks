The user provided some text regarding a line management change and assigning a proper line manager. This seems to fit under \"HR Support,\" since it's about management rather than IT issues. I should prepare to output a JSON-like object that follows the schema given. So, I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It looks like this is the best fit!**Clarifying ticket categories**\n\nIn the IT ticket system, I see \"Administrative rights\" could work if it's about assigning or removing someone as a line manager. \"Access\" might also fit since it's related to permissions, but it\u2019s really about updating user attributes like the line manager in HR/ERP. It\u2019s interesting because while this sounds like a permission adjustment, it\u2019s not about granting IT access. It seems that \"HR Support\" is still the most suitable category for this request.**Parsing the ticket details**\n\nOkay, let's break down the user's request: they want to remove a person and assign the correct line manager. This seems to fit under either \"Administrative rights\" or \"HR Support.\" Since the ticket deals with HR processes and specifically mentions \"line management change,\" it feels safe to categorize this as \"HR Support.\" \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object that looks like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll ensure this is the only content unless the user expects any extra comments.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
