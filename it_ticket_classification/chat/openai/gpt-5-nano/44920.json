I think it could fit as a \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or possibly \"Administrative rights\" request. I\u2019ll classify it carefully to ensure it\u2019s placed correctly!**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned, \"hi working can you please take a look,\" which suggests a general IT issue. Since the categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit for this ticket because it isn't very specific. There's no indication of hardware or administrative rights being involved. Therefore, I\u2019ll be preparing to respond with a JSON object that categorizes it as \"Miscellaneous.\"{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
