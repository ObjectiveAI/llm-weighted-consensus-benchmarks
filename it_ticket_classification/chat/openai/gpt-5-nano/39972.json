It looks like the best fit for categorization could be either \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" It may also fit under \"Administrative rights\" due to the mention of notification settings. Given these points, I'm leaning towards one of those options for categorization.**Categorizing IT Ticket Content**\n\nI see the content mentions various things like \"not sending ticket updates\" and \"customer visible notes.\" It really seems related to notification issues within an IT service management context. Given the limited categories available, \"Miscellaneous\" appears to be the most appropriate because it covers diverse topics. There's also a chance it could fall under \"Internal Project\" if it's about the ticketing system. Ultimately, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" and format my response as a JSON object."
