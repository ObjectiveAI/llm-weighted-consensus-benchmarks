The key terms like \"leaver,\" \"two leavers,\" \"leave,\" \"leaver form,\" and \"starter form\" suggest it\u2019s related to HR. Because of these references, it makes the most sense to categorize it under \"HR Support.\" \n\nThe ticket seems to be about offboarding and onboarding procedures, which aligns with HR topics. Other categories don\u2019t quite fit as well. So yes, \"HR Support\" is the best choice!**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe text mentions \u201ckeep him working consultant part his options,\u201d suggesting a contractor\u2019s status. I\u2019m torn between \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights\" as suitable categories. However, given the context \u2014 particularly references to \"leaver form\" and \"starter form\" \u2014 it really seems to lean toward HR processes. This could involve access provisioning as someone leaves or starts, but since the focus is on forms related to employment status, I think I should categorize it as \"HR Support.\"{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
