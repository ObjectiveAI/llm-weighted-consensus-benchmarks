It sounds like it relates to a network connectivity problem, possibly involving a VPN or something similar. Given this context, it seems like the appropriate category would be \"Access.\" I'll proceed with that categorization.**Categorizing as JSON**\n\nIt seems the ticket is about users unable to connect due to a change, so I'm categorizing it as \"Access.\" Though \"Networking\" might fit, it's not one of the provided categories. The options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. Based on the instruction for the final output, I should deliver it simply as a JSON object without any extra commentary. So, my final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
