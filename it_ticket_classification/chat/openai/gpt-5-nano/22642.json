Given the context, \"Storage\" seems to be the best fit, as it directly relates to attachment size and storage limits in email.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's request suggests I categorize this IT ticket. There are multiple categories, but \"Storage\" seems most fitting based on their mention of an oversized attachment. They might be asking about handling these attachments in relation to SOX controls. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they need permissions to change size, \"Storage\" is the safest bet. I\u2019ll format my response as specified: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. That keeps things clear and concise."
