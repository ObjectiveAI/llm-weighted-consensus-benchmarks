The ticket mentions \"editing rights,\" \"permissions,\" and \"access control.\" It feels a bit messy, but the key phrases indicate it's about managing access rights to documents. Phrases like \"we changed permissions\" and \"everyone should be able to document but only one should be able\" really stand out. So, I\u2019ll classify this ticket under the \u201cAccess\u201d category since it pertains directly to that area.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ve determined that the ticket should be categorized as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the ticket's focus on editing rights and permission changes, \"Administrative rights\" feels more accurate. The phrases mentioned, like \"editing rights\" and the request to investigate further, reinforce that this is about access control. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Administrative rights\" as the category. To format this for the system, I need to output a JSON object with the category.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
