I should categorize it as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it involves adding a member to a forecast, that suggests a permission requirement for a system or module. Although \"Administrative rights\" relate to granting admin privileges, the focus here seems to be on provisioning a user. I'll lean toward classifying it under \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
