It looks like they're asking to create access for a user, possibly for a trade show booth computer. The mention of \"agile coalition\" likely refers to a team or project they want associated with this access. Given this context, the appropriate category to choose would be \"Access\" from the system's categories.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nIt's pretty clear this request falls under \"Access\" since the user wants to grant access to a specific user. It could also be linked to \"Internal Project,\" but given they specifically mentioned adding a \"booth user,\" access management is key here. I think I need to respond with a structured JSON output. The format needs to be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI\u2019ll stick to that exact structure, ensuring clarity in my response!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
