However, \"Administrative rights\" doesn't seem likely here. Since the description is quite vague, \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the safest bet for classification.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that \"Access\" could apply if it's about permissions, but since this ticket deals with a format mismatch during an upload through the referral tool, it seems like a software issue. I suspect \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" might fit better, depending on the context. The response needs to be in a specific JSON format. I believe \"Miscellaneous\" is the safest choice since it's a general IT issue, not directly related to hardware or access.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is the best category since there's no specific project involved, just a generic error with a tool. Now, I need to format my response as a JSON object containing the category \"Miscellaneous.\" The user asked for the categorization explicitly, so I'll make sure there\u2019s no extra text, just the JSON format. I want to ensure it's valid by conforming to the required schema. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ll present it: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
