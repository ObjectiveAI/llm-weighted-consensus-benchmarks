The text mentions \"network cables required\" and talks about getting two cables allocated. Given this context, it seems like the best fit is \"Hardware\" since cables are hardware items. Although it could hint at a purchase request, I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" as it\u2019s specifically about the cables themselves. Let\u2019s stick to the defined categories to keep it clear!**Determining IT category**\n\nI need to output a category type for the IT ticket, and I'm reflecting on which enumerated value fits best. \"Hardware\" seems the most appropriate since they\u2019re asking for network cables. \"Purchase\" would be relevant if it were about buying, but mentioning \"allocate\" suggests they might want to manage assets. The term \"infrastructure\" doesn\u2019t quite match the categories listed. So I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" and provide the response in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. No extra text!"
