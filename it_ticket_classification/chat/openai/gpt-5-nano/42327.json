The user provided a message related to a \"screen investigation\" and requested to open a low priority incident queue for it. I need to choose from categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and a few others. It looks like the issue is tied to hardware, specifically something about the screen, so \"Hardware\" seems to be the best fit based on the details given.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI need to create the final answer as a JSON object, specifying the category as \"Hardware.\" The format I'm working with requires a specific structure, which should include a \"category\" field. So, the output will be: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. Although the instruction initially seems to hint at providing a string, the schema clearly specifies it should be in object format. I'll keep it straightforward and avoid unnecessary explanations in the response.**Clarifying Output Format**\n\nThe task is to categorize the IT ticket, and I believe the output should simply be {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. However, I\u2019m unsure if I should include the full schema structure since the instructions just say to categorize. The user's prompt is a bit straightforward, asking only to categorize. Yet, I want to ensure I meet the system's expected format, which mentions that the output should follow the category object schema. It\u2019s best to provide the category as simply \"Hardware\" in this case.**Finalizing JSON Output**\n\nI've determined that the response should be a JSON object with a \"category\" key. The correct final answer will be {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. I'll keep it simple and straightforward, avoiding any unnecessary explanations. The structure is clear, and I\u2019m confident this is what they expect as the final output. So, I\u2019ll finalize it now and provide the response as {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}."
