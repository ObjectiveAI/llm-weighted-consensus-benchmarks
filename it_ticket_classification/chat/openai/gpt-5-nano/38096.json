They've described server performance issues during an update and mentioned that after approving some updates, everything goes down. They also need to increase resources, like CPU cores or disks, and have a test environment issue with other servers waiting on updates that also have errors. Given the description, it sounds like this ticket fits into the \"Hardware\" category.**Determining category for the IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants to increase resources, specifically CPU cores and disk space, which relates to hardware and resource scaling. The categories we have are Hardware, Storage, and Purchase. Since the request involves server resources, it leans towards \"Hardware,\" although \"Storage\" might apply due to the mention of disk. It doesn't fit HR, Access, or Administrative rights. Since the wording suggests a configuration change instead of a purchase, I'd categorize this as \"Hardware.\"**Categorizing IT request**\n\nThe user is requesting an increase in CPU cores and disk space, which points to a hardware upgrade related to server performance. While \"Storage\" could apply if the focus were solely on disk capacity, the main concern is performance during updates. To keep it straightforward, I'll categorize this as \"Hardware.\" \n\nI need to format my response as a JSON object with just the category field. Here it is: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
