The ticket mentions an employee leaving, maternity leave, and exit analysis, all pointing toward an HR-related topic. It seems best to lean toward \"HR Support\" since the others don't quite fit. Even though \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" could potentially apply, they seem less relevant based on the content. So, \"HR Support\" it is!**Finalizing category assignment**\n\nI'm confirming that \"HR Support\" is indeed the right category for this IT ticket. I thought about \"Administrative rights,\" but the content primarily focuses on the leaving process and exit interviews, so it fits better under HR. The required format is a JSON object, so I\u2019ll structure the output correctly. Following the guideline, my final response will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Let's deliver this in concise form for clarity!"
