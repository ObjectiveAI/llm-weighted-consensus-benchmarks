The content discusses git, space for a project, and mentions a mobile automation framework. It seems like this might relate to issues around accessing git repositories or needing storage space. I\u2019m considering \"Storage\" since it discusses space and \"Access\" for permission-related issues. I need to choose the most fitting category from the options available, keeping it clear and straightforward for the user!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe user's request is a bit jumbled but seems to refer to \"git space for a project,\" which hints at issues with storage in a Git repository. There are mentions of procedures and obtaining more details, suggesting a need for access. I'm weighing the categories: perhaps \"Storage\" for space issues, or possibly \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" if privileges are required. Given the phrasing, \"Storage\" seems most fitting, but \"Internal Project\" could also apply if it relates to the \"July PM\" project. I need to decide!**Mapping ticket category**\n\nI'm deciding on the correct category for the IT ticket. It seems to suggest a need for storage with the phrase \"space for a project,\" which points me clearly toward \"Storage.\" If the user needed access or administrative rights, I would choose \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" respectively. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object, like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. The instructions say to keep it simple, so I won\u2019t add anything unnecessary!"
