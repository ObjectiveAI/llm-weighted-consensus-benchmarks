So, \"HR Support\" might be the best fit.**Evaluating IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket might relate to \"Access\" since the user mentions \"cannot modify\" regarding trial submit days. The phrase about \"annual leave\" adds some confusion, so I think asking clarifying questions could help. They want this ticket categorized, and I'm considering \"HR Support\" because of the mention of compliance and leave. However, since Oracle is involved and there are access issues, it might actually fit better in the \"Access\" category. It's a bit tricky to parse!**Clarifying IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user mentions \"cannot modify because trial submit days annual leave took,\" which is quite confusing! It suggests they might not be able to modify due to a trial period or that they took annual leave. The phrase \"accepting withdraw\" hints they might want to withdraw something. Considering all this chaos, I feel like the best categories might be \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"HR Support.\" Since it involves Oracle and modification issues, \"Access\" could be the most fitting option.**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning toward categorizing this ticket as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The phrase \"cannot modify\" along with \"trial submit days\" suggests there might be access restrictions during a trial period. Since the user has asked for a single category, I feel like \"Access\" is the broader option that covers permission issues. However, \"Administrative rights\" is more specific to those rights requests. Given this context, I think I should categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" and format it as a JSON-like object.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
