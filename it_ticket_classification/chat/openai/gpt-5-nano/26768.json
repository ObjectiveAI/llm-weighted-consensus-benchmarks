The ticket discusses Oracle timecards related to maternity leave and mentions action reports, forms, and submission processes. It seems to be primarily HR-related, which suggests \"HR Support\" is the best category. While it could also fit \"Access\" due to timecard system mentions, there's no explicit access issue indicated. Therefore, I think \"HR Support\" is the most accurate choice.**Identifying IT ticket category**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an HR-related IT ticket about Oracle Timecards. The categories include \"HR Support,\" which is indeed on the list. Since the ticket focuses on maternity leave and timecard issues, it fits perfectly under \"HR Support.\" I need to respond with a JSON object, formatted correctly. It should look like this: {\"category\":{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}}. I want to make sure I follow the required JSON schema and get it right!**Formatting response correctly**\n\nIn this case, I need to be careful about the JSON format for the category. While I could output {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}, I want to confirm that the schema indeed requires an object with the property \"category\" as a string. To be safe, I\u2019ll provide the JSON response as is, without any extra commentary. It\u2019s important for me to keep it succinct and straightforward, giving the user exactly what they asked for."
