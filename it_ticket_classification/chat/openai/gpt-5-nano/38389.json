The ticket description is lengthy and repetitive, focusing on tasks related to survey preparation, data quality, contacts, and scheduling reminders. It seems to align more with an \"Internal Project\" category since it deals with survey program deployment and administration. It's definitely not hardware, HR-related, or about access. So yeah, \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best here!**Formatting response in JSON**\n\nI see that the answer needs to be in JSON format with the category labeled as \"Internal Project.\" The prompt specifically requests this categorization, so I'll structure my response like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It seems important to keep it concise, and while I wonder if I should add justification, the instructions say to respond with just the category. So, I\u2019ll deliver the response in the required format!"
