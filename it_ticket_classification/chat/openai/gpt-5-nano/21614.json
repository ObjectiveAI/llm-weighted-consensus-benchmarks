I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object according to the schema they provided. The category will be set to \"Purchase\" to align with the user\u2019s needs.**Generating JSON Output**\n\nI need to create a JSON object with a \"category\" field based on the instructions given. The value for this field will be \"Purchase,\" as it aligns with the content of the ticket. I'll format the output strictly, ensuring that it's valid JSON without any extra explanation. Since \"Purchase\" is clearly one of the accepted values, I\u2019ll proceed directly with: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. There\u2019s no need for additional nuance since \"Administrative rights\" isn't mentioned in the request."
