There are available categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. The ticket mentions needing two monitors for Macs by Wednesday PM. This seems to fit under \"Hardware\" since they're requesting equipment. However, it could also fit \"Purchase\" if they\u2019re specifically looking to acquire new monitors. The content is focused on hardware needs, which leans me towards \u201cHardware\u201d as the appropriate category.**Categorizing IT ticket request**\n\nThe ticket indicates \"two monitors needed,\" suggesting it's likely a hardware request rather than a specific purchase. Given their ticket taxonomy, \"Hardware\" seems to be the safest category since it pertains to physical devices like monitors. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" I'll format my response as a JSON object, specifically: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"} to meet the required format. The extra prompt about \"Image input capabilities\" isn\u2019t needed, so I'll just output the JSON.**Identifying hardware request**\n\nThe ticket clearly states, \"two monitors needed for Macs Wednesday PM,\" which confirms that it\u2019s a hardware request. Since it's about obtaining physical devices, I\u2019m sure this should fall under the \"Hardware\" category. With that understanding, I\u2019m ready to categorize it appropriately. Let's proceed with the response."
