However, it could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" if code creation relates to access rights. I think \"Access\" is the best fit here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket, which means I need to return a JSON with a category field. Based on the ticket contents, \"Access\" seems like the best choice since it involves access requests and code creation. \"Administrative rights\" could apply, but it's not explicit enough. The content relates to Oracle project issues, reinforcing my choice of the \"Access\" category. I\u2019ll make sure to output the JSON object properly formatted!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
