Since it seems related to user experience and system bugs, I'm leaning towards \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" The mention of submitting cards for approval and possible access issues suggests \"Access\" could be appropriate. I need to choose carefully!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on categorizing this IT ticket, which mainly discusses issues with timecard submissions and errors. It doesn\u2019t seem to address login issues, so I think \"Miscellaneous\" fits best. \"Administrative rights\" could apply if the user needed permission to edit or recreate timecards, but it seems more appropriate to choose \"Miscellaneous\" here. I\u2019ll prepare the final response as a JSON object, specifically using this format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. No extra commentary needed!"
