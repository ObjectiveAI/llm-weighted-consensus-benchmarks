It seems to fall under HR Support or maybe Finance since it involves approval systems. The mention of Oracle Fusion leads me to think it relates to HR/ERP workflows. However, the provided categories are limited, so I'll classify it as \"HR Support\" since it aligns well with human resources processes.**Determining the right category**\n\nI need to choose the right category for this IT ticket. It revolves around a wrong approval flow in Oracle Fusion, relating to corrections in the approval process. The categories I\u2019m considering are \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Given that the issue pertains to HR processes like expense reports and certifications, \u201cHR Support\u201d seems the most fitting. I'll categorize it accordingly and suggest a ticket title like \"Wrong approval flow in Oracle Fusion (expense report).\u201d**Formatting the output**\n\nI need to format my response as a JSON object with a specific structure. The required format shows that the category should be one of the given options. I plan to categorize it as \"HR Support\" since that seems most appropriate for the situation. I\u2019ll double-check the spelling and spacing to ensure it\u2019s accurate. To stay concise and follow instructions properly, I\u2019ll respond with just the JSON output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} without any extra text."
