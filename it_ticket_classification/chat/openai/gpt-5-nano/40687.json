It references an \"incident error\" connected to hours sent by Oracle and annual leave assignments. The message seems to express confusion about the incorrect hours and mentions that the issue can wait until more problems are resolved. Overall, it sounds a bit garbled, but I see the user is concerned about this situation. I'll need to clarify and address it directly!**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe discussion centers around the issue of \"annual leave hours calculation vs. hours shown\" in the Oracle system, suggesting it's related to HR/payroll. I believe categorizing this as \"HR Support\" is appropriate. I'll need to create a correct JSON object based on the given instructions, ensuring to quote everything properly. The final output should just be the JSON object: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}` without any extra text. Let's make sure it\u2019s accurate!"
