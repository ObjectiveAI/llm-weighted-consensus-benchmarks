The ticket mentions complaints about slow uploads and downloads, which indicates it's an IT operations issue. However, there's no explicit category for \"Network/Bandwidth.\" The options I have are \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" I think \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit for this situation.**Deciding on Category**\n\nIt looks like I need to categorize an IT ticket, and I\u2019ve reviewed the options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. None of them seem to match perfectly. \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the best choice since it's a generic category for issues that don't quite fit elsewhere. I need to respond in JSON format with the category specified. So, I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
