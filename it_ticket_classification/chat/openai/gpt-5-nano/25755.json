The user's request is a bit unclear but seems focused on changing project codes and possibly altering some information. It sounds like it might relate to administrative rights, but it doesn\u2019t fall under hardware, storage, purchase, HR support, or access. So, I'm leaning towards categorizing it as an administrative task related to project management.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking this ticket could fit into the \"Administrative rights\" category if it\u2019s about changing codes in a system, as that typically requires admin privileges. However, since the user is asking about project codes, \"Internal Project\" seems more appropriate for tasks around internal project management. They mentioned \"change newly created codes according scheme,\" which reinforces that it\u2019s related to an internal project. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and respond with the JSON object.**Confirming response format**\n\nI think it might be helpful to consider if we should ask any clarifying questions, but since the prompt clearly states \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" it seems the user wants a direct category response. I\u2019ll provide the category value in the specified JSON format. It\u2019s essential that I ensure the casing matches the provided enum, which is \"Internal Project.\" So, I\u2019ll go ahead and output it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
