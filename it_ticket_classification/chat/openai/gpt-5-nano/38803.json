The system has a category list: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the user's message, it seems to primarily relate to a connectivity issue, which likely falls under \"Access.\" I\u2019ll confirm that this is the most fitting category for this ticket.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s message indicates they can connect to the network with a new PC and mention setting up the machine and moving things over, likely data. This leads me to consider categories like \"Access\" for network permissions or \"Hardware\" for the new PC setup. Since the primary focus seems to be on connecting to the network, I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate category for this IT ticket. It clearly relates to their connectivity issue.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
