The ticket text is quite unclear, but it mentions \"change rights,\" which suggests it's about access or administrative rights rather than hardware or storage. Given the focus on changing rights and the request to assign these rights, it seems most appropriate to place this ticket under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It looks like it\u2019s requesting assistive action regarding permissions.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"please assign change rights\" indicates a request for granting access privileges. The mention of \"right restrictions\" implies it's about permissions. Since the ticket revolves around rights and access, I\u2019d categorize it as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" If it's specifically about user permissions, \"Administrative rights\" seems more fitting, as this involves elevated privileges. The request to assign change rights suggests it\u2019s more about modifying privileges, which aligns with the \"Administrative rights\" category.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
