The ticket mentions an error related to submitting something, possibly linked to invoices, and uses terms like \"expenditure item date\" and \"urgent\". It could relate to \"Purchase\" due to the focus on expenditures and outstanding invoices. However, it may also hint at \"Access,\" but that seems less likely.**Assigning ticket category**\n\nI need to assign a category for the ticket based on the text. \"Internal Project\", \"Storage\", \"Hardware\", and \"HR Support\" don't fit. It seems like a \"Purchase\" issue since the ticket talks about an invoice submission error related to the procurement system. There's also a mention of needing to log a ticket and urgency. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase\" and respond with a structured JSON object reflecting that category.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
