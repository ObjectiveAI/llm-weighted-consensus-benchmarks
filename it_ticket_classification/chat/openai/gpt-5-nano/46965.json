The message points out that employee details are displayed twice, likely indicating a duplicate row problem in the HR data system. \n\nI\u2019m considering the categories: \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d doesn\u2019t seem right, and while \u201cHR Support\u201d fits since it involves employee data, \u201cAccess\u201d might be appropriate if it\u2019s about how the data is displayed. \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d could work too if I\u2019m unsure, and \u201cInternal Project\u201d could apply if they're working on a project related to this.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nThe content suggests there\u2019s a bug causing employee details to display twice. This issue likely falls under \u201cHR Support\u201d since it relates to employee records. While \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d isn\u2019t relevant and \u201cAccess\u201d doesn\u2019t capture the duplication aspect, \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d could be a safe fallback if I'm unsure. \n\nIf necessary, I can also consider \u201cInternal Project,\u201d but that doesn't quite fit. Ultimately, I'll categorize it as \u201cHR Support\u201d since it directly involves employee data. So, I may output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
