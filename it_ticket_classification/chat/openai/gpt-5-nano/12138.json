I think the best fit for the category is \"HR Support,\" since it pertains to starting and forms, rather than \"Administrative rights.\" Now, I want to categorize the ticket as \"HR Support\" and provide a brief justification about the new starter onboarding. If needed, I could also ask for further details like which specific form and any deadlines. I should respond with a JSON-like format for the category classification.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
