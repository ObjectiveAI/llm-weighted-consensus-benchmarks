It seems like \"Internal Project\" fits best since the user's ticket relates to infrastructure creation. The allowed categories include terms like \"Administrative rights\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" but I think \"Internal Project\" is appropriate. I'll go ahead and format the output as a small JSON object for clarity. Here\u2019s what it should look like: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`.**Formatting response for categorization**\n\nI see that the user needs a categorization and wants the answer in a specific format. I'll make sure to provide just the category in JSON format, as that\u2019s what the \"Valid channels\" require. It's straightforward enough, so let's focus on keeping it simple. I\u2019ll prepare the output as a small JSON object and ensure it aligns with the user's request for clarity. Time to get this done!"
