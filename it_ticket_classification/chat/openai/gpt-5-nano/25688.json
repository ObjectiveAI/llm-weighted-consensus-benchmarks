They mention editing forecasts and seem to need access to the forecast system, possibly the Project Accounting System. The urgency is clear with a request to respond by the end of the day. So, it seems the best category would be \"Access\" since they are specifically requesting access to the system and editing capabilities.**Selecting ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket and I'm looking at options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. This ticket is focused on an access request for multiple members to the \"PAS forecast\" system and editing privileges. Both \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" apply here. However, \"Access\" seems the best fit for general login access, while \"Administrative rights\" would imply higher permissions. Since it\u2019s mainly about granting access, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" for the category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
