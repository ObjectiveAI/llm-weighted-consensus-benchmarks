The user mentions \"educate users,\" which doesn't clearly align with access or administrative rights. The mention of a \"change request\" points towards \"Internal Project,\" making it the most fitting category for this request. \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d could be an option too for unclear messages, but since we have specific terms like \"cr number\" and \"status,\" I think \"Internal Project\" is the way to go!**Formatting the category response**\n\nI need to provide the category in the required JSON format for the IT ticket. It should look like this: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. The instructions say to categorize the ticket clearly, and it's better to focus solely on delivering that category object. Including a brief justification seems unnecessary, as the main instruction emphasizes the category itself. So, I\u2019ll stick with just the JSON output. I\u2019ll send back: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let\u2019s get that done!"
