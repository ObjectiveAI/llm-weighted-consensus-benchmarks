The text hints that it could relate to issues accessing the system to submit a time card, which could suggest \"Access.\" However, it also connects to HR, as timecards are typically related to HR/payroll processes, making \"HR Support\" a strong candidate. I think \"HR Support\" fits best, considering the focus on payroll-related issues.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm trying to figure out the best way to categorize an IT ticket regarding a time card. Since the phrase \"time card\" relates to payroll, \"HR Support\" seems fitting. However, the issue might involve access permissions because the user mentioned they \"cannot submit.\" There\u2019s also \"Access\" as a category. Given that the ticket is focused on submission issues, I might lean towards classifying it as \"HR Support,\" but \"Access\" could also be relevant depending on the permissions involved. It's tricky!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
