This should help streamline the categorization process!**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm confirming that the appropriate category for this IT ticket is \"Internal Project,\" since it fits the context better than \"Miscellaneous.\" For the proper response format, I\u2019ll present it as a JSON-like object:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI\u2019ll stick to the expected schema to ensure clarity, but I realize the user just needs the categorization itself. So, I\u2019ll keep it simple and deliver the JSON directly. It\u2019s all about being clear and concise!"
