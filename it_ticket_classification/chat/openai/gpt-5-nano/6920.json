They mentioned something about an issue with their Edge browser regarding credentials and a login mask being empty every morning when trying to connect. It seems they need a default username to be filled in, and there\u2019s confusion with the wording. I should categorize this under Access since it relates to login and user credentials. Let\u2019s clarify this for the user!**Clarifying Access Issue**\n\nHmm, I think \"mask\" refers to a password field, and the user is saying that their username field is empty every time they log in. They want a default username filled in, highlighting an access issue in the Edge browser. It could relate to a VPN or SSO. I see it mostly fits the \"Access\" category since it's about credentials. I could also consider \"Administrative rights\" if they need privileges to modify autofill. Ultimately, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\"**Delivering Category Classification**\n\nThe user is asking for a straightforward categorization of the IT ticket, so I need to respond with the specific JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nIt seems they want this classification without any extra commentary. I\u2019ve briefly considered if \"Administrative rights\" might fit, but it seems more aligned with access since it\u2019s about autofill settings. I'll stick with \"Access\" as that's the best classification. I'll ensure the JSON format is correct. Let\u2019s deliver it!"
