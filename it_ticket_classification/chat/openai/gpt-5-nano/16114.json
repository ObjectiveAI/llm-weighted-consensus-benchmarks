The text mentions a \u201cgrey blank card\u201d and \u201cprobably require swap,\u201d which suggest a hardware issue. It seems like they\u2019re asking for a replacement or installation related to a card or possibly a phone. The mention of \u201cinstallation\u201d also reinforces that this is likely a hardware concern. I think \u201cHardware\u201d is the best category for this ticket.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a phrase from the ticket: \u201cgrey blank card number going phone present.\u201d This makes me think it could refer to something like a blank SIM card, especially with the mention of a \u201cswap.\u201d It feels more suited to a hardware category due to the focus on phones and cards, while \"Purchase\" also crossed my mind. However, I believe \"Hardware\" is the best choice. Thus, I\u2019ll prepare my response in JSON format as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Preparing the output**\n\nI'm ready to provide the output in the specified JSON schema: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. The instructions indicate that I should categorize the IT ticket, and it seems like the focus is strictly on delivering that category in JSON format. Although I wonder if adding a brief note might be helpful, the examples suggest that I should primarily deliver just the category. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and output only: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
