It seems to relate to an inventory update for old monitors, requesting actions for each location. The core message mentions users refusing to take the monitors and needing further instructions based on the provided information. Given the context, it looks like the right category could be \"Hardware\" or possibly \"Storage\" since it's about managing hardware inventory.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to decide on the right category for this IT ticket regarding the inventory of old monitors. \"Hardware\" seems to be the best fit since it involves physical devices. While \"Internal Project\" could apply if there\u2019s a project to manage the inventory, it\u2019s mainly about asset management and updating an Excel file. Therefore, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Hardware.\" Next, I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object containing the category.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
