The user's message is quite messy but seems to deal with the departure process for an employee, including details about access revocation, mailboxes, and profiles. It looks like it\u2019s mostly about \"Access\" since it mentions AD rights, roaming profiles, and tokens. \"Administrative rights\" could also apply as a subcategory here.**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket mentions various items related to an employee leaving, like the leaving date, mailbox, roaming profile, and admin rights. Its main focus is on the offboarding process, which involves removing access to systems. \"Access\" seems like the best fit since it covers these elements. \"Administrative rights\" could apply as well, especially if it refers to removing admin permissions. However, I\u2019ll settle on \"Access\" and prepare my response in the required JSON format, as instructed.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, so I\u2019ll create a JSON object that specifies the category as \"Access.\" \n\nI need to follow the required format outlined in the prompt. It shows that the \"category\" needs to be a string from a specific enum of categories. \n\nSo, the correct JSON object will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. \n\nI\u2019ll proceed to deliver that without any additional text."
