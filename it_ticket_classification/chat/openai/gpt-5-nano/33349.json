But there's no \"Security\" category, so \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the default choice. We need to respond with a JSON object indicating the category, so I think I'll go with {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I need to stick to categorizing without proposing additional steps.**Finalizing ticket response**\n\nI need to respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. It's important to ensure the case is correct, as allowed values include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Although they didn't ask for an explanation, they specifically requested the categorization. The best way is to provide it as plain text, but the schema indicates we must use JSON format. I'll keep it simple and just include the JSON response without extra text."
