This seems to relate to software development, particularly regarding policies and feature planning. The categories available include \"Internal Project,\" which feels like the best fit since it aligns closely with internal tasks, including planning and repository management. I considered \"Administrative rights,\" but it seems less applicable. \"Miscellaneous\" could work, but I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project.\"**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating the details from the IT ticket, which references terms like \"commit policy,\" \"image,\" \"hook repository,\" and \"plan add feature.\" This suggests it's about internal project development policies. The \"Internal Project\" category seems like the best fit. I considered \"Access,\" but there\u2019s no clear mention of repository access rights, just a mention of hooks. \"Administrative rights\" wouldn't apply either, as there's no need for admin access. So, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and prepare a JSON object format for the response.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
