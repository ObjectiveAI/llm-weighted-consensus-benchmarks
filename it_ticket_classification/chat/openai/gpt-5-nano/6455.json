It includes requests for features like adding fields and a sprint goal option, which point to software project management needs. Initially, I thought of \"Hardware,\" but that doesn\u2019t fit. \"Internal Project\" looks like the best choice here since it's about project management features. While \"Miscellaneous\" might also fit, \"Internal Project\" is more specific. \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" don't apply either.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"adding fields,\" a \"sprint goal option,\" and other features, indicating it's from a software tester focused on project management. I think the best category for this is \"Internal Project\" since it relates to features within an internal management system. I need to respond in the correct format, which looks like a JSON object. The response should be structured as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} to align with the required schema. Let's finalize that!**Finalizing the response format**\n\nIt looks like I need to keep my response straightforward and minimal, following the guideline to avoid heavy formatting. The required category for the ticket is definitely \"Internal Project\" based on the context of adding fields and a sprint goal in a project management tool. I\u2019ll structure my response as a simple JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll avoid any extra text, sticking to just that JSON format since that addresses what the user asked for."
