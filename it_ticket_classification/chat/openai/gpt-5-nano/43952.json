It seems connected to potential storage or file sharing issues. I\u2019m leaning towards either \"Storage\" for the large recordings or \"Access\" for the server availability question.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions issues with \"large attachments\" and using third-party file sharing, focusing on storage and file sharing. They inquire about server availability and the ability to share recordings. There's a mention of needing clarity on accessing these resources. Since they\u2019re asking about server access and sharing files, I\u2019m considering classifying this ticket as \"Access\" primarily, but it could also fit into \"Storage.\" The mention of \"Administrative rights\" seems irrelevant here.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nThere's a clear category for \"Storage,\" which relates directly to data storage issues like handling large attachments. The ticket mentions \"size MB\" and inquiries about Confluence's ability to handle such files, indicating storage and attachment size concerns. While a ticket about an \"unavailable server\" usually falls under \"Access,\" in this case, \"Storage\" feels most relevant because they are primarily asking about storing and sharing recordings. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Storage.\"**Understanding Ticket Details**\n\nI need to parse the specifics of this ticket carefully to assign the right category. It discusses issues like \"server not available\" and refers to size limits for customer info attachments. There's mention of using Confluence as an alternative solution for storing larger files and suggestions for using third-party file sharing. The repeated references to \"size MB\" indicate that this is primarily about storage. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Storage.\"**Formatting the Output**\n\nI need to output a JSON-like object with a category field. It must follow the specified format of {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. The schema indicates that the structure should be an object with properties, but it seems that for my response, just providing {\"category\":\"Storage\"} is sufficient. So, to keep it clear and concise, I\u2019ll go ahead and finalize the output as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. That should meet the requirements perfectly!"
