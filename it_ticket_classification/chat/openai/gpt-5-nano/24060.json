Although it's confusing, it seems to relate to installing hardware for devices or setting up voice features. Given this context, I think the category should be \"Hardware,\" since it revolves around mobile phones and installation.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the user\u2019s request, and it\u2019s a bit tricky, mentioning \"installation tickets\" and \"cards,\" which might be SIM cards. I think it\u2019s safe to categorize it as \"Hardware\" since it relates to devices. I'm considering whether it could be \"Internal Project\" or \"Purchase,\" but that seems less likely. The system instruction is clear that I should only respond with a JSON object for the category. So, I\u2019ll keep it simple and return: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
