The user mentions that something is \"not working\" and describes issues with loading a video before a client meeting, despite trying multiple times.\n\nFrom the options \u2014 \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights\" \u2014 the best fit seems to be \"Miscellaneous.\" This captures the overall sense of frustration with loading issues related to the video.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nIt seems the user is looking to categorize an IT ticket regarding issues with loading a video before a client meeting. The message indicates it loads slowly or not at all, suggesting either a software or potential hardware issue. I might need to ask for clarification here.\n\nFrom the provided categories, \"Miscellaneous\" feels a bit broad, while \"Access\" could work if it relates to login issues. However, given the context of video playback, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit for this ticket.**Categorizing ticket in JSON**\n\nThe scenario involves a user stating that a \"video is not loading ahead of a client meeting.\" Since there's no specific \"Software\" category, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best option, although \"Hardware\" could apply if it were a hardware issue. There's some mention of \"sales id image,\" but it doesn't clarify much.\n\nI'll respond with a concise JSON object strictly focusing on the category: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I need to keep it simple and straightforward since that\u2019s what the user asked for!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
