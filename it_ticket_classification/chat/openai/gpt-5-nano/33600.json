The user\u2019s string seems a bit jumbled but focuses on disabling alerts for a password change, \"expire days,\" and some instructions involving \"ctrl alt delete\" for changing something. There are mentions of an analyst extension and a request to forward received information. It looks like I need to pull out the relevant parts and make sense of what the user is asking.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIt looks like I need to categorize an IT ticket into specific types like Hardware, Access, or Administrative Rights. The content refers to a password change alert and expiration days, focusing on user access. Given that, the \"Access\" category seems most fitting. There's also a mention of \"Administrative rights,\" but since it's primarily about managing password expiry notifications, I\u2019ll go with \"Access.\" I'll confirm that it's an allowed category and respond with the appropriate JSON object for this ticket.**Outputting JSON Schema**\n\nI see that the system requires a specific JSON format for categorization. It should simply state the category as a string. In this case, I\u2019ll wrap the output as `{\"category\":\"Access\"}` to follow the schema exactly. The prompt only asks for categorization without additional reasoning, so I'll keep it straightforward and focus on providing that JSON string. Let's make sure it meets the expected format and output it in the final channel."
