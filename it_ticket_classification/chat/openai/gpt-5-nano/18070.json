It seems to lean towards \"Administrative rights,\" even though \"Access\" could also fit. But since there's a specific category for \"Administrative rights,\" I'll go with that to ensure accuracy. This seems like the best approach!**Categorizing IT ticket details**\n\nThe content mentions terms like \"make users right ones,\" \"log in,\" and \"priority assigned,\" which suggest it's focused on user rights and reviewing location lists. Given there's reference to \"administrative rights,\" it seems essential to be precise. The choice is between \"Administrative rights\" or the broader \"Access\" category. Since the ticket seems to deal with granting administrative rights in Active Directory, \"Administrative rights\" is the most fitting choice.
