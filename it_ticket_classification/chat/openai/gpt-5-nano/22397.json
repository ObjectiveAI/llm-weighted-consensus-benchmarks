They mentioned a starter form and filling in details like the new employee's name and job title. The relevant category options include \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Given the context of onboarding a new employee, it seems most fitting to label this request as \"HR Support\" or perhaps \"Access,\" depending on whether it involves account creation or permissions.**Categorizing new starter request**\n\nIt looks like the user is asking for help with details about a new starter, likely related to setting up access. In IT, this typically falls under categories like \"Access\" for setting up accounts or permissions, and possibly \"Administrative rights\" for admin access. However, since the request focuses on filling out a form without mentioning IT tasks, I think categorizing it as \"HR Support\" makes the most sense. If I need to choose between these, \"Access\" might be more fitting since it deals with creating user accounts.**Creating category JSON**\n\nThe user is asking for help categorizing an IT ticket related to filling out a form and providing a job title, likely for onboarding. This falls into the HR domain, but since it involves provisioning accounts, I think the category could be \"Access.\" However, the request is a bit unclear because the text seems garbled with phrases like \"new starter number.\" I need to output a JSON object categorizing this IT ticket, which looks like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"} or possibly \"HR Support,\" depending on how we interpret it.**Deciding on category JSON**\n\nI believe \"Access\" is the most suitable category here, since this ticket concerns onboarding a new starter and involves provisioning accounts based on job titles. Although there\u2019s a mention of filling out forms and providing a name, which could lean towards \"HR Support,\" the main focus seems to be about access rights. Therefore, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object as follows: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI want to keep it straightforward and provide exactly what the UI expects, without any extra explanation."
