The ticket mentions \"build windows\" and \"rebuild computer,\" which likely point to a hardware issue. It seems to be a request related to infrastructure. Since the request is a bit unclear, I think I'll categorize it as \"Hardware\" or perhaps \"Miscellaneous.\" Let's see which fits best!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking I should categorize this as \"Hardware\" since it mentions building and rebuilding a computer and a Windows build. However, it could also fit under \"Internal Project\" if it's related to an infrastructure initiative. The term \"infrastructure\" seems to hint at a specific team but isn't a category itself. The ticket suggests they want to build Windows on a Thursday, and since there\u2019s no clear project mentioned, \"Hardware\" seems like the best choice!**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nI need to categorize the ticket according to the specified format. Though \"Infrastructure\" could map to \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" it seems like \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category since it directly relates to rebuilding computers. The user asked me to present this in JSON format. So, I\u2019ll make sure it adheres to the schema provided and simply respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nNo extra commentary, just the JSON output as required!"
