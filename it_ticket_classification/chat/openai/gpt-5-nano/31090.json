I'm trying to piece together what \"head ext\" could mean\u2014maybe it's \"headset\"? It appears they're asking for something related to hardware repair. Given the categories like \"Hardware\" and \"Internal Project,\" I might lean towards \"Hardware.\" Still, clarification seems necessary!**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nThe ticket appears to request a repair for something, so I think categorizing it as \"Hardware\" makes sense. The phrase \u201cfor Wednesday PM\u201d seems tied to scheduling, which isn\u2019t really needed for IT purposes. I could respond by stating: \"Category: Hardware\" and ask for clarification on what specifically needs repair. It looks like my output needs to be formatted as a JSON object, incorporating the category correctly. Sounds straightforward!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
