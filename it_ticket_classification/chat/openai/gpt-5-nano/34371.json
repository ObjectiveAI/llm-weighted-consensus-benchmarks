The ticket mentions \"change request,\" \"approval flow,\" and raising a ticket, which makes me consider \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project\" as possible categories. While it hints at access issues, there\u2019s no clear mention of access rights. Given that change requests often require admin rights for approval, I might lean towards categorizing it as \"Administrative rights.\" However, the categories are quite limited.**Categorizing ticket request**\n\nThe content implies it\u2019s a request to raise a ticket for a change request that might be stuck in the approval flow. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since the user is asking for categorization, I\u2019m thinking we should produce a JSON-like category object. It might fit \"Internal Project\" if it relates to internal changes. However, words like \"change request issue\" and \"approval flow\" suggest it might fall under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It's a bit tricky to pin down!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how the category \"Administrative rights\" fits tickets related to access and approvals. In IT, \"Change management\" might usually be under \"Other,\" but that\u2019s not an option here. Given that the ticket involves raising a ticket for a change request stuck in approval flow, \"Administrative rights\" seems the closest match. \u201cInternal Project\u201d could be fitting for specific projects. However, since it\u2019s mainly about the approval process, I believe \"Administrative rights\" is the best choice.**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to provide a response as a JSON-like object with the category. The instructions mention a specific JSON schema format, so I need to align with that. It says to output a JSON object with \"category\": \"Administrative rights.\" I realize I have to match the given structure exactly while still providing the category value. The right output should therefore be a JSON that reflects the schema but also delivers the category correctly. Let's proceed with that!**Providing the category output**\n\nI need to return the category as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. The instructions suggest that the app might only require this string format for the output. Even though I could add a short justification, the user specifically asked to categorize, which means it\u2019s better to keep things minimal. I think sticking to just the category will be clearer, so I\u2019ll deliver it concisely without adding extra notes. Let's do this!"
