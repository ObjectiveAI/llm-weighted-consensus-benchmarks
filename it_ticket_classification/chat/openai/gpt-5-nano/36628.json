The user mentioned an \"oracle notifications issue\" and needs to change settings to stop it from happening. It sounds like a software issue related to Oracle notifications, but there's no explicit \"Software\" category. I see categories like \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I think \"Miscellaneous\" fits best since it doesn't neatly align with others. I'll prepare a JSON object with this category.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket refers to a \"contact issue\" and mentions \"setting need change,\" which suggests it's about Oracle notifications. Given the categories, I\u2019m debating between \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" might relate but don\u2019t fit perfectly since the user isn't asking for credentials. \"HR Support,\" \"Purchase,\" or \"Hardware\" don't apply either. Since it\u2019s a bit unclear, I'll go with \"Miscellaneous,\" as it's a common choice for such situations.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the category for the ticket about an \u201coracle notifications issue.\u201d It could fit under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" The mention of notifications might also suggest \"Access,\" but that feels like a stretch. I realize I need to respond with a JSON object containing the category. Since \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is an accepted value, I\u2019ll go ahead with that. I might also want to provide a short justification, so I\u2019ll include it in the output. Here\u2019s the JSON: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
