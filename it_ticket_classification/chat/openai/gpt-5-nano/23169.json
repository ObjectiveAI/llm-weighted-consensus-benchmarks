I'll analyze the content and aim for clarity in my output.\n\nIt seems like the user wants to add someone to a shared mailbox associated with an application. So, I might categorize this as \"Access,\" considering the context of user permissions and mailbox accessibility, and structure it in the required JSON format.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI see the user's request indicates a need to categorize an IT ticket related to adding access to a shared mailbox. The phrase \"hello please add shared\" suggests they're asking for permissions, so \"Access\" seems to be the right choice. It could also be \"Administrative rights\" if they\u2019re focusing on that aspect, but since it\u2019s about mailbox access, I'll go with \"Access.\"\n\nI need to deliver this in the specified JSON format, sticking to what's required without extra explanations.**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nThe user provided a snippet, and the expected answer is likely a simple JSON object. I think it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. \n\nI want to make sure it\u2019s valid JSON. The request seems clear about adding someone to a shared mailbox, meaning it\u2019s all about access permissions. While \"Administrative rights\" could be a thought, they didn\u2019t specify that\u2014just the need for sharing the mailbox. Therefore, \"Access\" is definitely the best choice, and I\u2019ll keep it straightforward with no extra text."
