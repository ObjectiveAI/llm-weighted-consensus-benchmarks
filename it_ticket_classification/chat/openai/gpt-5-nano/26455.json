It sounds like there is confusion regarding multiple versions of a file, which is leading to display issues related to the contract ID. They also mentioned the need to enlarge the width of the name column to improve visibility. Based on the context, I think this ticket best fits the \"Administrative rights\" category due to the nature of the document handling involved.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m sorting through issues related to document display, file name column width, and versioning. It doesn\u2019t seem to fit hardware, access, or admin rights, so I\u2019m leaning towards either \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Storage.\" Given the mention of a high file count and document details such as contract IDs, I think \"Storage\" is the best fit. The problems seem to revolve around file version management and display, suggesting it's a storage management issue.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket might fit under \"Administrative rights\" if adjusting column widths needs admin access, but since they asked about enlarging the name column, it feels more like a UI issue. The required format for the category is a JSON object. The options are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Based on the high file count and version control, I think \"Storage\" is the most appropriate category. However, \"Miscellaneous\" could work too if I'm unsure. I'll format my response accordingly.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
