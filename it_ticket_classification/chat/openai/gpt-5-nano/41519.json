The ticket mentions issues with annual leave requests and their statuses, which points to HR processes. Hence, it seems to fit best in the \"HR Support\" category rather than \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" While \"Miscellaneous\" could apply, I believe HR Support is the most appropriate choice here, considering it's centered around leave request workflows in the application system.**Outputting Category JSON**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to respond with a JSON format that includes one of the specified categories. Since the ticket relates to annual leave status, \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category to choose. Therefore, I should provide the JSON object as follows: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI want to make sure it follows exactly the required format, without any extra text or explanations, just the JSON output as specified in the prompt.**Clarifying Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about whether \"Administrative rights\" could be the right choice here, especially if there are issues related to status updates. However, the ticket clearly discusses \"wrong status for past annual leaves\" and mentions discipline lead regarding leave requests, indicating it's more about HR processes. I feel confident that \"HR Support\" is the fitting category. So, just to be safe and clear, I\u2019ll provide the response in the required JSON format."
