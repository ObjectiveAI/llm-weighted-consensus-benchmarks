The options available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given that the ticket focuses on removing the admin account, it seems to align with \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" While \"Access\" can cover general issues such as account creation or deletion, \"Administrative rights\" seems a bit more specific to permissions.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"admin account to be removed\" indicates that the user is requesting decommissioning of an admin account, which falls under access management. While \"Access\" seems like a fitting category, given the emphasis on account removal, \"Administrative rights\" could also apply since it directly refers to admin accounts. However, since there's no request to adjust privileges\u2014only removal\u2014\"Access\" is a broader and safer choice for categorization. Overall, I lean towards selecting \"Access\" here.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI need to categorize as \"Access\" for this account provisioning and deprovisioning request. The instructions have prompted me to create a JSON-like category object, so I\u2019ll format it accordingly. The required output is a simple JSON object with \"category\": \"<selected category>\" following the provided schema. Given that \"Access\" fits perfectly here, I will keep my response minimal and just output the JSON object:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}  \n\nThis way, it\u2019s clear and meets the requirements!"
