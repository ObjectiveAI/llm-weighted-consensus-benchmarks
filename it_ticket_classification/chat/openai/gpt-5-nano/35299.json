I wonder where to categorize it. \"Miscellaneous\" seems to fit best since it doesn't clearly belong anywhere else. \"Hardware\" might apply if the issues relate to hardware, but that isn't explicit. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous\" and provide the JSON object as specified, without extra text. The final answer will be `{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}`.**Delivering category output**\n\nIt seems like the best approach is to simply provide the category. So, my final answer will be `{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}`. This keeps things straightforward and aligns with the instructions. I want to ensure I\u2019m delivering the right content efficiently and clearly. Alright, let\u2019s go ahead and deliver that now!"
