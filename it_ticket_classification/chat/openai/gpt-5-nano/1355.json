They wrote something that\u2019s a bit unclear: \"temporary mobile phone mobile phone hi please give mobile phone next weeks thanks floor blvd district.\" Since they mention \"mobile phone,\" it seems like they\u2019re asking for a temporary phone. The available categories include \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" Given they are requesting a temporary phone, I\u2019ll choose \"Hardware\" as the most fitting category, as it relates directly to the device.**Determining the category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for the IT ticket. The user could be requesting a new device, which might fit into \"Purchase.\" However, since they mentioned a \"temporary mobile phone,\" it might also relate to \"Hardware.\" In IT ticket triage, we categorize requests based on the context, and I think \"Purchase\" is most specific since it's about acquiring a mobile phone. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object with the chosen category: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}.**Formatting the response**\n\nThe user requested that I categorize the IT ticket, so I need to keep my response straightforward without extra commentary, as they didn't ask for explanations. Based on the categories schema, I'll return a JSON object. I'll make sure to capitalize \"Purchase\" correctly and avoid including any unnecessary text. Let\u2019s just focus on providing the JSON format. Alright, I'll respond only with the requested format. Here it goes!"
