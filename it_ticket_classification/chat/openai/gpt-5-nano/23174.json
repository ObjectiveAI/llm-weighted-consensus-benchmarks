Therefore, \"Access\" seems to be the ideal choice!**Determining the category for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering categorizing an IT ticket related to a password reset. Some teams might choose \"HR Support\" for HR-related processes, but since this is specifically about IT, \"Access\" is more fitting. I'll submit it as a JSON object, which the system requires. The format should just include the category field, like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. \n\nI\u2019ll keep it straightforward without any extra notes, so the final output is just that JSON object."
