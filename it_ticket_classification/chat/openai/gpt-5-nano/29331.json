It sounds like they\u2019re transitioning from an old site to a new one and need help with file uploads and guides. I\u2019ll categorize this ticket under \"Access.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user wants to categorize a ticket, which likely falls under \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The text mentions \"new access,\" \"migration,\" and deadlines for file uploads, indicating that it could be an \"Internal Project\" since it involves a site migration. The phrase \"new access PM re migration\" suggests project management involvement. Based on the context, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project.\" Now, I\u2019ll format it in the required JSON-like structure.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nIt looks like this ticket relates to an \"Internal Project,\" given mentions of \"new access,\" \"migration,\" \"upload files,\" and \"guides.\" This context emphasizes an IT project involving a site transfer and deadlines. So, categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" makes sense. I need to respond with a JSON-like object. Based on the format provided, it seems the correct structure should include a category string. I\u2019ll present my final answer as:\n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
