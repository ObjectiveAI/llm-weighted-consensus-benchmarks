The content mentions an issue with the status of opportunities in a CRM system, which doesn't fall under hardware, HR support, or similar categories. It seems related to data quality, which could suggest \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" However, since it's specifically about the status of opportunities rather than permissions or hardware issues, \"Miscellaneous\" might be the most fitting category here.**Selecting IT ticket category**\n\nI'm trying to categorize the IT ticket the user provided. It could lean towards \"Administrative rights\" if it involves data integrity, or \"Internal Project\" if it's related to a specific task. The categories feel aligned with helpdesk support, but this seems more like a data issue than access permissions. \"Miscellaneous\" could work as a catch-all for the CRM workflow problem. I think I'll choose \"Miscellaneous\" since it captures the essence of the user's request.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions an \"officer\" at the end, which might indicate it\u2019s a communication to someone specific. I need to consider the appropriate category from the list: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nThe content seems to indicate a CRM bug regarding opportunity statuses, meaning it relates to an \"Internal Project.\" Since it\u2019s about resolving an internal issue, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and prepare the appropriate JSON structure for the response.**Formulating JSON response**\n\nI need to output the correct JSON structure for categorizing the IT ticket. The required format includes \"type\": \"object\" and \"properties,\" so I can't just use the simple response of {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}. \n\nInstead, I should adhere to the schema and provide something like:\n\n{\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"category\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", \"Administrative rights\"]}},\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}.\n\nSince it's indeed an internal CRM issue, I\u2019ll choose \"Internal Project\" as my final response."
