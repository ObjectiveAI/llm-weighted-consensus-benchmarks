The keywords suggest it leans towards needing an access card for maternity leave. The categories available are \"Access\" and \"HR Support,\" and the latter could fit better since it's HR-related. With the mention of an attached form, I think \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category for this request.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm working on categorizing an IT ticket that requests help related to an access card and maternity leave. The mention of \"access card\" strongly suggests the \"Access\" category. Although there's a reference to HR-related terms, the intent seems to focus on IT tasks, particularly access rights, which makes \"Access\" the best fit. Given the user\u2019s instruction to categorize it, I\u2019ll just focus on one category and present it in a JSON-like format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
