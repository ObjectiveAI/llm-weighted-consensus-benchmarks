The ticket mentions issues with mailbox storage, needing to delete items, and improving mailbox capacity. It fits the \"Storage\" category best since that\u2019s directly related. I should format my output in JSON, as requested, with the category specified as \"Storage.\" This is straightforward, so I\u2019ll ensure it's clear and follows the given format.**Outputting the JSON Format**\n\nI see the system's instruction on the required output format specifies a JSON object structure. I should include the category as \"Storage,\" but there\u2019s some uncertainty about including the \"type\" and \"properties.\" It seems that, in practice, I may just need to provide the simpler format: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} rather than the full schema that's given. Keeping it straightforward should match what\u2019s typically expected, so I\u2019ll stick with that simpler format for clarity.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
