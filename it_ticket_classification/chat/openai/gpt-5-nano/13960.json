The content seems to be about onboarding a new starter in Bucharest and requesting to fill in a document date. Given the context, it likely falls under \"HR Support,\" since it pertains to onboarding. There's also a hint of \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" due to the mention of document filling. Overall, HR Support appears to be the most fitting category for this ticket.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI see that \"HR Support\" is a probable category for this ticket since it mentions a new starter, an update, and a document fill date. \"Access\" might be an option, too, but the message doesn't clearly indicate that. \"Administrative rights\" seems less fitting because it's specifically about onboarding. So, I think I'll go with \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object with the category property specified. Here\u2019s what it should look like: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Delivering ticket category**\n\nThe text mentions \"new starter,\" which strongly indicates that this is an onboarding matter. Therefore, \"HR Support\" really does seem like the best category for this ticket. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object, ensuring everything is precise. The output will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I'll make sure that it's structured correctly as a valid JSON, so let's go ahead and provide that!"
