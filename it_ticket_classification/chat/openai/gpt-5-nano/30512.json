The categories we can choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nIt looks like this ticket involves requesting an installation log for a purchased notebook bag. Since it mentions \"purchase order requisition\" and \"installation log,\" I'll classify this ticket under the \"Purchase\" category. It really seems to fit there!**Classifying IT ticket categories**\n\nI need to solidify the category options for this IT ticket. Here's what I've got: \"Hardware\" is for physical devices; \"Purchase\" relates to procurement tickets; \"Administrative rights\" covers requests for access rights; \"Access\" is for login issues; \"Internal Project\" applies to project tasks; and \"Storage\" is specifically for storage inquiries. The mention of \"document purchase order requisition implemented\" seems to indicate it's about procurement, and \"log installation\" might refer to the notebook bag installation. It feels best to classify this ticket under \"Purchase,\" and I'll format the response as a JSON object.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
