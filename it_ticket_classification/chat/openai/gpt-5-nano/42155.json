Once I decide on the fitting category, I should output it as a JSON object, like `{\"category\": \"Purchase\"}`, ensuring that it aligns with the ticket content. So, I\u2019ll look carefully!**Analyzing ticket content**\n\nThe ticket discusses issues related to purchase orders (PO), highlighting problems with category changes, locked fields, and approvals. It seems like users are struggling to create tickets due to these category issues, with a specific mention of errors when submitting. I need to identify which category fits best from the provided schema, considering the context around purchase orders and category management. I\u2019ll ensure my output accurately reflects this understanding while categorizing it properly.**Choosing the right category**\n\nIt looks like \"Purchase\" is the best category fit for this ticket since it relates to issues concerning purchase orders, approval flows, and resubmissions. I need to respond with a JSON object that states this clearly. The instruction emphasizes outputting only the category in the proper JSON format, so I should ensure that it's valid. I\u2019m aiming to keep it concise, so my output will simply be `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}` without any extra text."
