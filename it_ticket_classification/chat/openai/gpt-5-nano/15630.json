The text is quite messy, but it revolves around errors accessing resources via a hub or network. There are mentions of repeated access errors, browser issues, and network connectivity. I'm thinking it fits best in the \"Access\" category since it relates to problems accessing links and resources. Although it could possibly touch on \"Hardware\" with mentions of cables, the focus is clearly on access issues rather than hardware failures.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe text states \"connected cable pc without available further details needed,\" but it's primarily about access assistance. Thus, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" It\u2019s clear since the ticket involves investigating access issues for employees and clients. I'll respond with the category in JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's essential to follow the required structure exactly, so I\u2019ll output it as specified: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Brief justification isn\u2019t necessary, so I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and deliver just the category object."
