The proper structure would be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, ensuring it meets the required specifications for top-level properties.**Outputting category schema**\n\nI have a category schema to follow. The instruction specifies that I need to provide a JSON object with a property called \"category\" and its value should be one of the specified strings. Since the content I\u2019m dealing with is all about enabling and disabling accounts, along with ad mailbox management and contractor information, it clearly fits under the \"Access\" category. \n\nTherefore, the output should simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"} \u2014 nothing extra, just that!"
