The user mentioned \u201cbackup report,\u201d \u201cattached reports,\u201d and \u201cclients,\u201d which seem to relate to data storage. This leads me to think that the most suitable category is \u201cStorage\u201d since it deals with backups. It doesn\u2019t seem to fit \u201cInternal Project\u201d or \"Administrative rights,\" so I'm leaning towards \u201cStorage\u201d for this ticket.**Parsing IT ticket details**\n\nI need to break down the user's request regarding a backup report for Friday PM, which suggests it relates to data storage and protection. The text also includes mixed phrases about logging orders and attached reports, but the main focus appears to be on the backup report itself. Among the category options\u2014like Hardware, HR Support, and others\u2014\u201cStorage\u201d stands out as the most relevant choice due to the clear mention of a backup report. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \u201cStorage.\u201d**Outputting JSON object**\n\nI need to construct a JSON object with the category \"Storage.\" According to the required format, it should be structured as an object that includes a \"category\" key. So, I\u2019ll prepare the response as follows: \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"} \n\nThis keeps things straightforward with no extra text. I want to ensure it matches the schema properly and is clear for whoever is using it!"
