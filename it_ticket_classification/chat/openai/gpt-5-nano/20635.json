They mention \"for February\" and \"location floor,\" which makes me think it\u2019s related to hardware. I'm debating between \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase,\" since they might want equipment or to buy something. Still, given they're asking for existing hardware, \"Hardware\" seems like the best fit. I need to select one category for this IT ticket.**Finalizing the category response**\n\nI've determined that the best category for this request is \"Hardware,\" as there\u2019s no subcategory like \"Purchase\" available. Now, I need to respond with a JSON object that specifies this. The provided instruction mentions a schema for the response, so I should follow that format. I\u2019ll ensure my output is valid and structured like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to meet the requirements accurately. This seems straightforward, but I want to be sure I\u2019m doing it right!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
