The ticket text is a bit messy but it seems to be about modifying filter behavior, grouping work items, and adjusting search display. \n\nIt looks like these tasks relate to an internal project or application, which makes me think \"Internal Project\" could be the right category. I'll make sure to clarify that in the final decision!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m weighing options for categorizing this IT ticket into one of the specified categories, like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project.\" Since it\u2019s focused on modifying software behavior regarding filters and groups without mentioning access credentials or hardware, I lean toward \"Internal Project.\" \n\nIt feels like it\u2019s about software feature changes, so \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems to fit best. I need to respond with a JSON object for the category. I'll present it as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to follow the requirement to provide the category in a specific JSON format, focusing on the \"category\" key. The final output should simply be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra commentary or explanation\u2014just the clean JSON response. Okay, let's finalize it!"
