The prompt specifies a JSON format, but the available categories are limited. The issue seems to be related to software, but that option isn\u2019t available in the provided categories. \u201cHR Support\u201d seems fitting since it involves timecards, or perhaps \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d for general issues. I\u2019ll decide based on the flow of information.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket based on the user's description of an error occurring in the Oracle app while filling out a timecard. Although \"Access\" might fit if it were about login issues, the repeated errors indicate a software problem rather than access rights. It aligns more with \"HR Support,\" since it\u2019s an HR-related issue. I\u2019ll make sure to format my response as a structured JSON object the system expects.
