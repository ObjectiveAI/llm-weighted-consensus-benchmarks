It mentions \"dashboard\" and \"pipeline graph,\" linking it to a BI/analytics dashboard, which isn't listed. \"Internal Project\" seems fitting since it relates to internal IT tasks, possibly part of a CRM project. I could also suggest \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the user asked for categorization, I\u2019ll provide a single choice with a brief explanation, plus an option for them to recategorize if needed, proposing \"Internal Project\" as the category.**Defining project category**\n\nI\u2019m reasoning through the appropriate category for this request. It includes a dashboard, pipeline graph, and opportunity IDs, which are typical of CRM analytics and internal project work\u2014not related to hardware or access. I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. If it were about checking or fixing, maybe \"Miscellaneous\" could work too. The output should be in JSON format as outlined, specifically: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. So, I'll format my response accordingly!**Formatting the category output**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the schema, which indicates the output should be a JSON object with a single field, \"category.\" The value needs to be from the allowed strings. In this case, I'll use \"Internal Project\" based on the context. \n\nAlthough I want to provide a rationale, the instructions specify I only need to output the category itself. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and respond only with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} without any extra text. Let's go ahead!"
