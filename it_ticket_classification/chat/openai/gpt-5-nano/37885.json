It could be \"Internal Project\" if it relates to a change request or \"Administrative rights\" if there are permissions issues. The mention of an \"employee starting\" suggests they might be adding a new employee in Oracle Expenses. Here, \"HR Support\" seems relevant since this is an HR-like process. The valid categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Internal Project.\" Either \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" feels like the safe choice.**Analyzing HR system inquiry**\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand the context of the inquiry about the HR system related to Oracle and adding an employee. It seems like they want to add expenses in Oracle based on the sentence: \"can add expenses oracle.\" The phrase \"hi employee starting trying add\" suggests they might be introducing a new employee. Parsing through that, I think they're indicating a process issue, possibly needing permission or help with adding expenses. It's all a bit unclear!**Decoding user issue with Oracle**\n\nI\u2019m piecing together the user's message about \"Hi, employee starting.\" The grammar is a bit messy, but they seem to be saying they are trying to add something. The part about getting an error when clicking the open icon indicates a system issue. It sounds like they're asking for help and may have attached something. The issue seems related to access or permissions related to adding expenses, so \"Access\" could be the right category. \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d doesn't apply here since there's no mention of rights. \"Purchase\" might fit for expenses, but it\u2019s unclear.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI'm contemplating the best category for this IT ticket. While \"HR Support\" might fit since it's related to expenses, the ticket is specifically IT-related. However, since the error involves access to a feature in Oracle, \"Access\" feels like the most appropriate choice, especially since the issue arises when clicking the open icon. \"Internal Project\" isn't applicable here, and \"Miscellaneous\" wouldn't provide the precise label the user likely needs. So, I'll go with \"Access\" and format it in a JSON object as required.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
