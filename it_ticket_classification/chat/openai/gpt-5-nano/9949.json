The user provided content about filling out a leaver form, leaving date, and other aspects like mailbox and approvals. They want me to output a JSON object with a category field from the allowed categories. Given the mentions of \u201cAD rights\u201d and mailbox access, the most fitting category seems to be \u201cAccess,\u201d as it's primarily about access removal related to an employee's exit. Administrative rights could be a subcategory if needed.**Finalizing category response**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"AD rights\" and includes offboarding tasks like disabling access and managing mailboxes. Given this context, I\u2019m categorizing it under \"Access.\" The instructions specify that I need to respond with a JSON object, so I\u2019ll keep it simple and valid. The JSON response will be: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. There\u2019s no need for extra commentary since the format is clear and I\u2019m sticking to the requirements while ensuring it\u2019s valid."
