They mention issues with searching for meeting rooms and a need to show a list. I need to categorize this ticket from a provided list, which includes Hardware, HR Support, Access, and more. To me, it seems like this fits best under \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d as it doesn\u2019t strictly relate to hardware or HR but rather various operational issues.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm looking at a user request regarding the room finder and search results, which feels like a software or location service issue. I see potential categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Access relates more to login issues, and \"Administrative rights\" is about privileges. Given that it seems like a software feature concern related to the room booking system, \"Internal Project\" might be the most fitting category. \"Miscellaneous\" could work too, but it feels less specific. I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project.\"**Outputting Category in JSON**\n\nIt looks like I've decided on the category \"Internal Project\" for this ticket. The user needs a response formatted as JSON according to the instructions, which specify a category object with a string value. I think it\u2019s best to stick with \"Internal Project,\" even though \"Miscellaneous\" could fit due to the garbled text. Since they're just asking for categorization, I'll keep it minimal: my response will be exactly this format: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`."
