There are \"errors accessing several setup tasks,\" and since the user is asking about this, it seems best to label it under \"Access.\" Even though \"Administrative rights\" could work, it\u2019s not the core issue. The user mentions downtime and wants a notification, so \"Access\" fits best given the context of login and setup errors during the maintenance period.**Selecting the access category**\n\nI'm deciding to go with \"Access\" for the category. The format we need is a JSON-like object that includes a \"category\" field. So, I\u2019ll create the response like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The instructions are clear that we should only provide the category, but a brief note seems unnecessary. I\u2019ll make sure to have the capitalization right since \"Access\" should have an initial cap just like in the allowed categories. Time to respond with that!"
