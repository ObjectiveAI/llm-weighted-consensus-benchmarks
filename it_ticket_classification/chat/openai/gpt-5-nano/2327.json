The text seems a bit garbled, mentioning things like annual leave and sick leave, which leans toward HR information. I\u2019m considering \u201cHR Support,\u201d \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d or maybe \u201cInternal Project,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t seem related to hardware or storage. Since it deals with updating employee records about leave, it likely falls under \u201cHR Support.\u201d However, I should think carefully about the context of \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d too.**Categorizing HR Ticket**\n\nThis ticket is about updating HR records and might involve system access. It requests updates for records, resubmitting cards, and managing annual and sick leave. Based on this, I should categorize it as \u201cHR Support.\u201d The user wants a JSON object format for this category. I need to ensure the response is strictly in the required schema and simply output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text beyond that. Done!"
