The message suggests it's related to human resources or access, but I'm not entirely sure. I should lean towards HR Support, as it directly pertains to onboarding a new employee. Let's confirm that categorization!**Categorizing IT Ticket Options**\n\nI'm trying to find the right category for the IT ticket. It could fit into \"Administrative rights,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Access.\" The mention of a \"starter form\" hints it's related to HR onboarding, so \"HR Support\" feels appropriate. However, it might involve \"Access\" if they're asking for system access tied to the form completion. Given that it's about onboarding a new starter, I think \"HR Support\" is the best choice for this ticket.**Formatting the IT Ticket Response**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to respond with a structured JSON-like object. The category schema I'm working with expects a property called \"category,\" which should be a string from a defined list. Based on the content, \"HR Support\" feels like the appropriate choice given the onboarding context. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and just respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I won't include any extra text, just the JSON as required.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
