So, I'll focus on the specifics of each category first, to make sure I'm making the best choice when categorizing.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm evaluating how to categorize this IT ticket based on its content. It seems to touch on Access (like AD rights and mailboxes), Administrative rights, and deprovisioning. Since it's primarily about account deprovisioning related to a leaver, I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category. The ticket mentions \"leaver rights\" and \"approver\" multiple times, confirming its focus. So, I need to format the output as a JSON object with the category set to \"Access.\"**Outputting JSON Category**\n\nI need to follow the instruction to categorize the IT ticket and provide the JSON format as specified. The expected JSON output should contain the category field set to \"Access.\" The schema indicates how to structure this, and it seems I don\u2019t need to include the entire wrapper. So, I\u2019ll prepare the output as simply: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s clear and fits the requirements perfectly!"
