Given the focus on resources and ports, it seems like this ticket might fit best under \"Access.\" I'll need to confirm that my understanding aligns with the categories and the context given in the ticket content.**Confirming Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for the ticket, which could be Access, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. Since it mentions \"ports\" and \"resource accessible port,\" this seems primarily about network access. The phrase \"package users please add resource accessible port\" really suggests a focus on permissions and access control. I think the most appropriate category is \"Access.\" I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object to confirm this, ensuring it's concise and clear."
