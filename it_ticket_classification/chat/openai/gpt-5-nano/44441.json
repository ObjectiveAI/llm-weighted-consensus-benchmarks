They mention a \"notification for missing oracle for leaver,\" which is a bit unclear. I'm guessing \"Oracle\" might refer to the Oracle database, or it could simply be a typo. The term \"leaver\" likely refers to someone who is leaving. Overall, it seems they want to update someone's record but the message is quite jumbled. I\u2019ll need to clarify their request further.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI think the message suggests it could be about \"notification for missing access for leaver\" rather than \"oracle.\" There's a lot of potential misspelling in the original text. The user likely wants to update an employee's record after they\u2019ve left. Given the context, I\u2019ll categorize this IT ticket under \"Access\" or maybe \"Administrative Rights\" or \"HR Support,\" since it directly relates to user access to an application or database like Oracle.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's message mentions \"notification regarding for rd th,\" which is confusing, but it seems they're asking to update a leaver's record. The action to update suggests it falls under \"HR Support.\" However, since this is related to system access for a leaver, \"Access\" seems like the best category. They mention \"Oracle,\" which could imply a system or application that needs to be deprovisioned. If that's incorrect, \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback option.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
