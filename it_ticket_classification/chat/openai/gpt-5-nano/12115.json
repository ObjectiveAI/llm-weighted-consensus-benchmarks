The phrases mention details like the leaver's service, location, dates, and various approvals. Additionally, there are references to mailbox and rights issues, along with additional inquiries about devices and accounts. I\u2019ll ensure to organize this information effectively to help the user understand the request clearly. I'll focus on the key aspects surrounding the leaver's departure.**Categorizing IT Ticket Content**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on the provided schema, which includes categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. I\u2019ll aim for a JSON-like output with the appropriate category. The ticket appears to involve an employee leaving, including details like leave date, location, and various access issues related to accounts and profiles. Given the offboarding and access removal context, the most fitting category seems to be \"Access\" or possibly \"Administrative rights.\"**Classifying Leaver Changes**\n\nThe ticket is focused on offboarding tasks, specifically related to the removal of access like AD rights, mailboxes, and tokens. The best categorization here is \"Access,\" as it deals with access deactivation. \"Administrative rights\" could also fit if we're specifically discussing the removal of rights. However, the repeated mentions of access and related resources strongly point towards \"Access\" as the main theme. So, I\u2019ll ensure the output is simply formatted as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
