The ticket seems to involve multiple mentions of \u201cchange\u201d and \u201cdelete impacted,\u201d which indicates a request related to a change draft. Considering the categories available, it might fit into \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d The ticket includes terms like \u201cmonitoring engineer\u201d and mentions confidentiality, suggesting it's sensitive. With these details, it seems clear that \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could be the best fit for this request.**Interpreting access rights request**\n\nThe content suggests the user is facing issues with \"cannot delete impacted notice\" and refers to a \"change draft.\" This sounds like it's about access rights, particularly with phrases like \"delete impacted\" and \"change owner.\" While \"Administrative rights\" might fit as a subcategory, I think the primary category here should be \"Access.\" There are confidentiality mentions, indicating it\u2019s likely an internal memo. Overall, the focus seems to be on deleting an impacted change draft.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThis seems to be an IT ticket for deleting a draft or impacted notice, mainly about access rights or data removal permissions. I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as \"Access\" since there are clear mentions of deletion and ownership change. However, if it involves restricted content, \"Administrative rights\" might be more suitable. The user did ask to categorize the ticket, and per the required output format, I should respond with a JSON object indicating the chosen category. It\u2019s a bit tricky, but I think \"Access\" is the best fit.**Selecting category for IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket's content includes phrases like \"change owner,\" \"change engineer,\" and \"cannot delete impacted notice,\" which suggests it\u2019s about access rights, particularly concerning deletion permissions. While \"Administrative rights\" is a separate option, I think \"Access\" is fitting since it directly addresses access permissions. \"Miscellaneous\" doesn\u2019t seem to apply here. Given the focus on deletion and ownership changes, I\u2019ll choose \"Access\" and format the output as a JSON object with the specified category."
