Since it primarily involves procurement with the new purchase order, I think \"Purchase\" is the best fit. However, the mention of an installation device could suggest \"Hardware\" too, but I have to go with the more prominent category.**Categorizing IT ticket with JSON**\n\nI\u2019m considering the relevant categories: \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" and \"HR Support.\" Since the ticket is focused on a new purchase order and installation, \"Purchase\" seems to fit best. Although \"Hardware\" is also relevant because of the device installation request, the main focus is on procurement. I need to respond with a structured JSON-like object as per the prompt's requirements, so it should be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
