Since it's related to server access, I'm leaning towards \"Access,\" but I wonder if \"Hardware\" fits better. \"Miscellaneous\" doesn't seem appropriate either, but there's no specific category for \"Email\" or \"Networking.\" I'll go with \"Access\" as the best option.**Finalizing IT Ticket Response**\n\nThe ticket details an \"Outlook problem\" regarding server connection, so categorizing it as \"Access\" seems appropriate. I\u2019ll prepare the response in the required JSON format. The schema specifies that I should output a category string from a limited set of options. Keeping it concise, I\u2019ll return: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I don't need to add any extra comments since the instruction is simply to categorize the ticket. I'm ready to deliver!"
