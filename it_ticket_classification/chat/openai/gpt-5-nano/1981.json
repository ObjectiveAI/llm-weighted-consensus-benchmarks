The prompt gives me a taxonomy that includes Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Let's see which category best matches the ticket details. It\u2019s important to be accurate here, as proper categorization helps streamline the support process. I want to ensure I pick the most relevant option!**Categorizing Password Reset Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket that\u2019s about a password reset, which could fit into either the \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights\" category based on the context. The user mentioned pressing ctrl-alt-delete to change the password, and it's related to account access. Since it mentions resetting a password for an external account, I think \"Access\" is the most suitable category. I\u2019ll categorize it as {\"category\":\"Access\"} and format it in JSON according to the requirements.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
