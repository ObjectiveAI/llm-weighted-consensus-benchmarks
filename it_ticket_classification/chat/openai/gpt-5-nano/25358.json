The categories I have to work with are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the content, it seems the ticket is primarily about adding someone to a support queue and requests related to access rights. I'll determine the best match and format the output as JSON with the appropriate category.**Interpreting ticket for categorization**\n\nIt appears the user is requesting administrative rights to join a support queue. The text mentions \"addition to support queue\" and an intent to add themselves, hinting at a need for access. Phrases like \"picking requests starting December\" suggest they want to participate at the same level as other engineers. Since they\u2019re asking for access to the queue or possibly a leadership role, \"Access\" seems to be the most fitting category from my options.**Categorizing ticket as access**\n\nThe main request in the ticket is to \"please add myself to queue,\" which pertains to access or permissions. While there is a possibility of an \"Administrative rights\" category, it seems more appropriate to categorize this as \"Access\" since they want to be added to a queue. The mention of wanting to be at the same level as other engineers also supports this. I'll format my response as JSON, so it will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
