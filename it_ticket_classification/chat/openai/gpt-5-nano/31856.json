It seems there are multiple messages regarding changes in the People Manager Oracle, specifically about approval for changes. The mention of \"approved effective date\" suggests this is likely related to HR support. I\u2019ll want to consider who the intended recipient is for these updates and any further actions needed around this information.**Categorizing IT Tickets**\n\nI'm looking at the Oracle HR module for \"People Manager,\" which clearly falls under the \"HR Support\" category. Since that's the most appropriate option, I think I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object that reflects this category. The instructions specify how to structure it, so I\u2019ll ensure it aligns with the requirements. My output will strictly be the JSON format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That seems straightforward enough!"
