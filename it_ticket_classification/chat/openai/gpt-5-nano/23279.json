It mentions approval for \"leaver\" and vacation days, which seems HR-related. So, I'll categorize it under HR Support since it pertains to approving days off for an employee who is leaving. \n\nAfter that, I'll format it into a JSON object with the appropriate category from the list. It\u2019s vital to interpret the ticket correctly for proper categorization!**Classifying IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating the IT ticket to determine its category. The message mentions \"approval for leaver\" which suggests it\u2019s about leave or vacation days for someone leaving. This leans towards HR-related processes, so I think \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category. While I considered \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" those don\u2019t quite match the content of the request. It seems clear this ticket needs to be routed to HR support, confirming my choice of category as \"HR Support.\"{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
