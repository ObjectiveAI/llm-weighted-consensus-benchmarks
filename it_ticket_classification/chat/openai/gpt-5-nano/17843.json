It mentions \"call to action\" and seems to involve adding a user to a project for a call, suggesting it's likely about user access. Given the mixed wording, it could fit into either the \"Access\" category or \"Administrative rights.\" I need to decide which category better captures the essence of this request since the content is a bit messy but leans towards user access.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI have a set of categories to choose from for an IT ticket, like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and more. The phrase \"add user\" relates to access management, suggesting it fits under the \"Access\" category, especially if it's about giving a user access to a project. However, it might also qualify for \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context about a project and meeting, I lean towards categorizing it as \"Access,\" but \"Internal Project\" is also a consideration.{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
