They mention reports being unavailable and problems with generating them. I see keywords like \"pending,\" \"issue investigating,\" and \"assign him,\" which point towards it being related to an internal project or possibly miscellaneous issues since there's no category for software or IT support. Hardware is definitely not relevant. I'll decide on \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the right category for this IT ticket. It could be \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Administrative rights don\u2019t seem relevant here, and while \"Access\" comes to mind due to potential inability to access reports, the issue is about the reporting tool itself. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too vague. Based on the user's mention of \"incident\" and \"reporting unavailable,\" I\u2019m leaning toward \"Internal Project,\" as it seems more fitting since it directly affects report generation.**Categorizing the reporting issue**\n\nThe ticket relates to access issues with the reporting tool, but it\u2019s less about login credentials and more about not being able to generate reports. While \"Access\" could apply, I think the incident is better categorized under \"Internal Project\" since it concerns an internal initiative. However, given the general nature of the ticket, \"Miscellaneous\" might be the safest choice. It seems best to go with \"Miscellaneous\" for a broader classification. I'll present it simply as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
