The user input is quite confusing, but it seems to mention a new purchase order. Based on the details about the new PO and receipts, it looks like \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category. While \"Administrative Rights\" or \"Hardware\" could be relevant, they don\u2019t fit as well. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase\" and respond accordingly.**Clarifying IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket. It specifies a JSON object is required, showing only the category. The valid options are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Based on the details, \"Purchase\" is the right choice. I should ensure it's spelled correctly, match it exactly to the enum values, and return it as a straightforward JSON object, without any extra commentary. So, I\u2019ll respond with {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
