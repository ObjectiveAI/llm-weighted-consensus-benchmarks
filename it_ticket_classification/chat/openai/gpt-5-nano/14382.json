However, \"Administrative rights\" might also apply due to the request for approval related to a discipline lead.**Classifying Access Request**\n\nThe user seems to want to activate forms ID based on the phrase \"active forms id active approve.\" It looks like they're requesting access to forms and possibly admin rights. Given the categories, \"Access\" fits best since it's an access request, though \"Administrative rights\" could apply too if they're asking for elevated privileges. But to keep things straightforward and safe, I\u2019ll categorize it simply as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll respond with the appropriate JSON format: {\"category\": \"Access\"}.**Preparing Final Output**\n\nThe user requested a category object format, so I\u2019ll provide it straightforwardly. I need to ensure there are no extra code blocks, just simple plain text JSON. The category I\u2019ve chosen is \"Access,\" which reflects the user\u2019s access request. Now, I\u2019ll finalize it like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nI\u2019m making sure it\u2019s clean and exactly what the user is looking for!"
