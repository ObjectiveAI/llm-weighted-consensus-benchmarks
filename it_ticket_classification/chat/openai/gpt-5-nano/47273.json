They mentioned problems connecting, but I need to categorize this properly. Among the categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the context of connection issues, it seems like this may fit best under \"Access.\" I\u2019ll go ahead and classify it there to help streamline the resolution process.**Parsing IT ticket issue**\n\nI\u2019m looking through the user's message, which seems to describe issues with application builds and connection timeouts. They mention problems with establishing a connection and suggest there might be access issues. Given these details, it sounds like it best fits the \"Access\" category, as it revolves around connectivity to a server or website. I should classify this ticket under \"Access\" to help address the user's concerns effectively.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm noticing that the user's message references an application job, possibly related to CI build scheduling. Since the primary concern appears to be about connectivity issues, it makes sense to categorize this under \"Access.\" Although \"Internal Project\" could be a contender if it's in-house, the focus on blocked access and connection timeouts leads me to firmly pick \"Access.\" I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object with the category: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}` to respond appropriately.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nThe text highlights keywords like \"application,\" \"build daily,\" \"blocked access,\" and \"connection timed out,\" which suggest it's most relevant to the \"Access\" category. While it could relate to an internal project, the connectivity issues are a clear focus. So, I've decided on the category as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll keep my response straightforward and deliver it in JSON format as requested: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. This should effectively convey the classification!"
