The key phrases indicate a request for access or modifications. \"Administrative rights\" might apply if adding members requires that kind of access, but it seems more about membership updating rather than a specific administrative action. I'd lean toward \"Access\" as the closest category.**Categorizing user request**\n\nThe \"Access\" category seems fitting for user access control or membership changes, especially since the ticket is about adding members to a project management tool. While \"Administrative rights\" might be a subcategory, it's already a top-level option. \"Miscellaneous\" could apply if things aren't clear, but I think \"Access\" is the best choice here. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object, with the category set to \"Access,\" following the requirements.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
