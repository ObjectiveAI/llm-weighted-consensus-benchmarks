The user has specified, \"Categorize this IT Ticket: [long text].\" I\u2019ll read the ticket content carefully to determine which category it fits into, and then I\u2019ll format the output in a JSON-like structure with the selected category. Let's ensure it's accurate and clear!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket I'm examining discusses HR processes related to time tracking, attendance, and reporting for direct reports. It mentions issues with missing time from last week's submissions and requests for action concerning a notification about an error. I see references to established processes for submitting weekly timesheets and addressing any absences, such as maternity leave. Overall, this is closely tied to HR Support. I'll categorize this ticket accordingly based on its content.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the available categories, and HR Support is definitely a fit for this ticket. Administrative rights relate to access, which doesn\u2019t apply here, so I\u2019ll stick with HR Support. I\u2019ll format my output as a JSON object according to the required structure specified in the prompt. The goal is to keep it clear and simple, so I\u2019ll provide only the necessary category information. My final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
