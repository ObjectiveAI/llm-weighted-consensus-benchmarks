I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Storage\"}. This will provide clarity and meet the required specifications.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nThe instructions clearly state to categorize the IT ticket and provide a JSON object with the category value \"Storage.\" I need to ensure that I present just the JSON object without any extra commentary. Given the schema requires a category string, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. While I considered \"Hardware\" due to terms like \"server\" and \"care pack,\" \"Storage\" remains the most appropriate choice. So, let's finalize it as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}."
