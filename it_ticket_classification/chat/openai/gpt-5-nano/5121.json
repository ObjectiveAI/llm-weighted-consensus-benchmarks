I suspect \"SNOW\" refers to ServiceNow. It seems like they're asking for a list of users, likely touching on needing access. Given this context, \"Access\" could be the right category since it relates to user permissions. There\u2019s also \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Access\" seems more direct. I'll choose that!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe content gives clues with terms like \"users\" and \"requested by,\" which indicates it's likely about user access requests. \"Access\" seems appropriate since it pertains to permissions related to user accounts. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit, the ticket doesn\u2019t specifically mention admin rights. If I were unsure, \"Miscellaneous\" might work, but I feel confident in choosing \"Access.\" I'll format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, ensuring I keep it simple and direct."
