I'm leaning towards categorizing this as \"Hardware\" because of the mention of logging the record of cable installation. It's not an internal project and seems too specific for \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll respond with a JSON-like object for the category output.**Clarifying IT ticket categorization**\n\nI see that I have to categorize an IT ticket based on a provided instruction, which is followed by a JSON-like structure. The key element here is to output the category as a JSON object, specifically stating \"category\": \"Hardware.\" However, the format suggests that I should include more details about types and properties, which is confusing. Still, I think I can stick to the simpler approach of just responding with {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} as the main requirement.**Determining the category output**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to output a JSON object based on the provided structure, specifically for the category. This means I should respond with {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any extra commentary. Since the user only asked for categorization, I\u2019ll focus solely on that. So the final response will simply be this JSON object, keeping it concise and free of any unnecessary text. Let's provide just what\u2019s needed!"
