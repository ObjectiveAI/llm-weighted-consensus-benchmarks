                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing IT Tickets**\n\nIt seems like there's a request regarding submission frequency for a process, possibly about \"Administrative rights\" related to approvals. The ticket mentions \"Internal Project,\" which could also fit as it pertains to a project. While \"Access\" relates to permissions, this request clearly focuses on a weekly submission rather than a biweekly one. I need to categorize the ticket best based on its content, producing a JSON object with possible categories, particularly emphasizing the submission format.**Choosing a Category**\n\nI need to decide on the best category for the request. \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" are not applicable, and while \"Access\" doesn't seem right, \"Miscellaneous\" could work. However, I think \"Administrative rights\" fits better since it's about approvals for a weekly submission process. The user's request implies a need for timely approvals, so I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Administrative rights\" or maybe \"Internal Project\" based on the context. The focus is clearly on submission scheduling.**Determining the Best Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering that the request might be best categorized as \"Internal Project,\" since it concerns a weekly submission format for something called \"coordinator north.\" That makes me think it relates to a specific project. It looks like the user wants to change from a biweekly to a weekly submission schedule, which supports the \"Internal Project\" choice. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit if they need approval, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Internal Project.\u201d So, my final JSON object will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
