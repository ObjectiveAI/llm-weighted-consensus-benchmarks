While I was initially considering \"Access,\" the focus on onboarding indicates it's definitely HR-related. I\u2019ll go ahead and categorize it as \"HR Support.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket refers to a \"new starter former employee\" and mentions forms, which suggests it's likely about HR onboarding. While I considered \"Access\" due to needing the form for access rights, the content clearly requests assistance with filling out the starter form. This indicates it mainly relates to HR. I think it's best categorized as \"HR Support.\" Now, I just need to format it as a JSON object specifying the category.**Formatting ticket category**\n\nThe prompt asks me to categorize an IT ticket with specific allowed categories. I realize the final output should be a JSON object with a \"category\" field containing the selected string. It looks like I need to keep it simple and just provide the required category without any extra metadata. Given the context about a \"new starter\" and onboarding, \"HR Support\" seems the appropriate choice. So, I\u2019ll finalize it as: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
