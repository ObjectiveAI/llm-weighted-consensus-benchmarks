The content mentions \"entry change local change hi upgraded sonar,\" which has a lot of mention of \"sonar\" and seems related to maps. Could this be about software like SonarQube or possibly a sonar device? Given that context, I think it might fit under \"Internal Project\" or even \"Miscellaneous.\" Let's see where it best aligns!**Evaluating IT ticket categories**\n\nThe categories I have are a bit limited. The user's message talks about upgrades and maps, mentioning \"lead\" as a sign-off. Since upgrades might require admin rights, could this fit under \"Administrative rights\"? I think we should ask for clarification. Given the mixed content, it might be best categorized as \"Internal Project\" because it's about upgrading sonar and maps, or maybe \"Miscellaneous\" if it remains unclear. There are several phrases to parse for a better fit!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI see that \"sonar\" could refer to hardware, but the mention of \"maps\" might indicate it's about mapping data, perhaps in a GIS system. With the categories available, it makes sense to categorize this as \"Internal Project\" if it's about upgrading sonar and maps. If I'm uncertain, \"Miscellaneous\" could work as a catch-all. Given that the user asks for a standard approach, I\u2019ll propose the category of \"Internal Project\" with a justification. \n\nI'll format this as a JSON object!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI see we need to choose the category for the ticket and respond with that JSON format. So, I'm confirming that \"Internal Project\" fits best, especially since this ticket seems related to upgrades and changes concerning sonar and maps. I considered \"Hardware\" due to the mention of sonar, but it feels safer to go with \"Internal Project,\" as it covers software and hardware updates without making assumptions. Let's stick with the required format and ensure proper capitalization!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI see that there might be some confusion if \"Internal Project\" is the right choice, particularly since it could be seen as a change request due to the \"lead\" sign-off. Given the ambiguity, \"Miscellaneous\" could be another option, but I want to stay focused. The mention of \"upgraded sonar\" suggests a hardware aspect, but considering the overall context, \"Internal Project\" seems reasonable for categorization. Let's stick with that JSON response!"
