The categories to choose from include Purchase, Internal Project, and Access. Given the context, it sounds most appropriate for the Purchase category, but it might also fit under Administrative rights or Internal Project. I'll need to decide.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI'm reviewing the ticket's content and think it likely fits in the \"Purchase\" category since it involves licenses and plans. Alternatively, it could relate to \"Administrative rights\" if the user is seeking access to view or create those plans, but there's no clear request for access rights. Given the focus on \"license key\" and \"latest version usage,\" I believe \"Purchase\" is the best choice. I'll categorize it as that and prepare to output the JSON object with {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to create a JSON object to categorize the IT ticket. The structure is clear, with a requirement to provide just the category value within the object. Since I've decided on \"Purchase\" based on the ticket's content, I will format it like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I want to make sure that there is no extra text in my output \u2014 just the JSON object as instructed. I'll go ahead and provide that now."
