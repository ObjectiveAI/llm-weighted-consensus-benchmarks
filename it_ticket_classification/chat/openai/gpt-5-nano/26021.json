It mentions a time and seems to inquire about an administration officer. This ticket likely pertains to onboarding, so the relevant categories could be \"Access,\" regarding account setups or \"Administrative rights.\" The ambiguity makes it tricky, but it feels like the best fit is either \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" since it involves a new starter requiring access.**Selecting IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket refers to a new starter in Bucharest, which suggests it may require an \"Access\" category for system permissions or \"Administrative rights\" for admin privileges. However, since this is an onboarding request, \"HR Support\" could fit too, though it's not strictly an HR ticket. The phrase regarding the \"administration officer\" could indicate a scheduling issue. Given everything, \"Access\" seems the most relevant, as new starters typically need access permissions from IT.**Assigning ticket category**\n\nGiven that the ticket is about a new starter, the most plausible category is \"Access,\" as this pertains to access rights for systems. The phrase about the \"administration officer\" might suggest a request to set up something, possibly related to scheduling. However, since this is still primarily an IT issue, I\u2019m set on \"Access.\" I\u2019ll respond solely with the valid JSON object for the category as instructed. It\u2019ll look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
