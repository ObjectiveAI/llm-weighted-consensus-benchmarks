Based on this, I\u2019ll categorize the ticket under \"Hardware\" since it emphasizes the need for a video monitor for a specific purpose during meetings.**Categorizing the IT request**\n\nThe user wants a device allocated, which makes it a request related to hardware. I could also think about categorizing it under \"Purchase\" if it\u2019s about acquiring the hardware, but since they specifically requested a video monitor, \"Hardware\" fits better as it deals with provisioning.\n\nI\u2019ll make it clear that the category is \"Hardware.\" I need to respond with just a JSON object, so I\u2019ll format it like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.
