I should apply the provided format, using categories like Access or Administrative rights since it pertains to changing access permissions. I'll output this in a JSON format accordingly.**Categorizing IT requests**\n\nThe user\u2019s request to \"assign myself\" indicates they want to take ownership of the ticket. This suggests categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The phrase \"change of cc\" might refer to changing CC recipients in an email or updating the CC field to include themselves. Since there's no \"Change management\" category listed, the best fit for this ticket seems to be \"Administrative rights,\" focusing on altering access privileges. I'll make sure to categorize accurately!**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nThis ticket is about changing CC recipients and the user assigning the ticket to themselves. It seems to fall into \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access,\" but Access typically relates to security and system grants. Changing CCs is more about notifications. \"Administrative rights\" might involve modifying tickets, but that's not exactly the case here. Given the user\u2019s ambiguous request, \"Miscellaneous\" feels like a safe default, but since they want to assign to themselves, \"Access\" could be plausible as well. I'll focus on the best-fitting category!**Categorizing the ticket request**\n\nI need to categorize the user\u2019s ticket based on their request. The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the user wants to assign the ticket to themselves, it\u2019s more about the assignment than rights. The phrase \u201cchange dear\u201d suggests they want to change CC recipients instead of access rights. Given this ambiguity, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the safest category. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object as follows: `{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}` and suggest they provide more clarification!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
