This doesn\u2019t fit into hardware or storage. Given that it pertains to an internal assessment, I think \"Internal Project\" is the most suitable category. I'll format that as a JSON output.**Determining the IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket, and the user\u2019s text hints at a potential \"Purchase\" option due to the mention of a downloadable self-assessment. However, it's also likely related to an \"Internal Project,\" given it's about developing a self-assessment tool.\n\nThe categories I have include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since this ticket leans towards a project tool and training program, I believe \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. I'll format this as a JSON output.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
