The main issues seem related to login problems and access, specifically mentioning AD credentials and being locked out. Based on the categories available, the most fitting choice appears to be \"Access.\" So, I'll prepare to output a JSON object with {\"category\": \"Access\"}. That makes the most sense given the context!**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI see that the ticket is mentioning ServiceNow, login issues, AD credentials, and being locked out, which makes \"Access\" the right category. Although \"Administrative rights\" could also fit, it feels broader to label it as \"Access.\" I just need to ensure I'm formatting this correctly as a JSON object. It has to be {\"category\":\"Access\"}, and I won't add any extra text since the user specifically asked for the category. Let\u2019s deliver that!"
