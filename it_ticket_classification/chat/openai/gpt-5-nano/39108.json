They've reported a \"project error\" related to a \"project code\" and an \"error code.\" It sounds like it has to do with forecasting issues and errors when adding members. Given these details, it seems fitting to categorize it as \"Internal Project\" because it's project-related. However, I should also consider \"Administrative rights\" if there are access rights involved. It's all about parsing the content effectively!**Clarifying ticket categorization**\n\nI see the ticket mentions an \"added member gives error,\" which could hint at an issue related to access control. The references to \"forecasting\" and \"cells\" suggest it involves Excel-like forecasting. Analyzing the categories available, it seems to primarily deal with project management, indicated by terms like \"project error\" and \"project code.\" \n\nGiven all of this, \"Internal Project\" fits best as the category. I could consider \"Access\" for the adding member error, but the main focus is still on the project error. I should respond with a JSON containing this category!**Delivering ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket as specifically requested, using a JSON format with the \"category\" field. After analyzing the situation, I\u2019m going to produce:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI\u2019ll ensure the capitalization matches exactly as required. While the instruction primarily asks for the category, I wonder if it\u2019s a good idea to briefly justify this choice. Still, I'll stick to the requirement for now and keep my response succinct as instructed. Let's deliver that!"
