The user\u2019s message talks about a change of project manager and requests for assignments, which suggests it\u2019s related to project management. It doesn\u2019t touch on hardware or storage, so I'm considering categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or possibly \"HR Support.\" Ultimately, it seems to fit best within the \"Internal Project\" category since it's focused on project management assignments.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI'm considering whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Administrative rights\" because it involves a request to assign someone as project manager. However, the user didn\u2019t explicitly ask for access rights. The ticket content is quite messy, mentioning changes and assignments. Given all that, \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best since it's focused on the project manager assignment change. I should respond with the proper JSON-like structure for the category as specified.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to output a JSON object that specifies the category. The required format is clear: it should look like {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019m confirming that this matches what\u2019s expected since previous tasks just involved delivering the category name or the JSON itself. I'll follow the schema closely and ensure correct capitalization, with \"Internal Project\" having uppercase \"I\" and \"P.\" So the output will be exactly: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. No added text needed!"
