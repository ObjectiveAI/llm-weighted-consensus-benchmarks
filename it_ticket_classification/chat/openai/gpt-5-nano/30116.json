It seems to focus on infrastructure, including adding servers and testing environments, which could fit into Hardware, Internal Project, or Storage categories. Unfortunately, \u201cInfrastructure\u201d isn\u2019t an option in the provided list, so I\u2019ll have to narrow it down to the closest match.**Deciding on category**\n\nI'm working to decide the best category for this IT ticket. \"Hardware\" fits because it mentions additional servers, while \"Internal Project\" could apply if it's for a project. \"Storage\" might work for the artifacts, but the focus seems to be on server capacity addressing high load and slow performance. Although there are aspects pointing to multiple categories, the instruction specifies one. So, I'm inclined to choose \"Hardware\" as the most fitting category.**Finalizing category choice**\n\nI'm leaning towards selecting \"Hardware\" as the main category since this ticket focuses on infrastructure tasks aimed at supporting high load. While \"Storage\" is a consideration due to the mention of artifact handling, it's not the primary issue. I'm not seeing \"Performance\" as an option in the categories, which complicates things a bit. The mention of a \"senior engineer\" is not relevant for categorization. So, let\u2019s settle on \"Hardware\" and format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
