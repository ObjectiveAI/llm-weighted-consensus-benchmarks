                    "reasoning": "**Analyzing Oracle change request**\n\nIt looks like the change in Oracle might fall under \"Internal Project,\" especially since it involves project tasks within IT. \"Administrative rights\" seem linked to permissions, while \"access\" could refer to access controls. The mention of bench codes and PM change suggests it's about updating those codes for teams, possibly relating to resource management. The urgency indicates a need to adjust these two teams' bench codes until the entire working period is complete. It doesn't deal with hardware, storage, or purchases.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like \"Administrative rights\" isn't the right fit, so \"Internal Project\" seems best. I need to craft a JSON output with the category field as specified. The correct format should include: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. The user specifically asked for this categorization, so I won\u2019t add extra explanation. It's crucial to follow the exact schema required: it needs to be an object type with a string field as one of the enumerated values.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize a ticket, which means I should provide a straightforward category value. While the \"Output Formats\" section outlines a schema, I realize that the final answer needs to be a category object. I\u2019ve considered using \"Access,\" but the mention of \"Oracle change needed\" aligns better with project management. So, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the most appropriate choice. I\u2019ll keep my response clear and concise with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
