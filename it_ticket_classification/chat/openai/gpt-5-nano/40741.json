The user\u2019s message mentions \u201creaching resource limits,\u201d which could fit under Storage or possibly Hardware or Internal Project. The phrase \u201ccannot push\u201d hints at issues related to deploying code or accessing resources, suggesting that the user is asking for an investigation of their resources. I'll need to select the most appropriate category for this ticket.**Analyzing IT ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and more to determine where the IT ticket fits. The phrase \u201cresource limits\u201d might relate to storage quotas, while \u201ccannot push\u201d suggests issues with version control. Since the user is a developer, terms like \u201chello\u201d could refer to a project or command. I see that Internal Project fits issues tied to project work, while Access or Administrative rights could indicate permission-related problems. Overall, there are multiple angles to consider!**Selecting the right IT ticket category**\n\nIt seems the user is hitting resource limits, possibly related to storage quotas on their repo or build system. The phrase \u201cis reaching resource limits\u201d could fit several categories, but I\u2019m leaning toward \"Internal Project\" or \"Storage.\" Since the user mentions an inability to push, which points to a storage issue, \"Storage\" feels like the best fit. I\u2019m going to output a JSON object with the category as \"Storage\" to reflect this issue properly.**Finalizing the JSON output**\n\nI need to ensure that I provide the category exactly as \"Storage\" in the final JSON. The prompt doesn\u2019t ask for any explanations or extra commentary, just the category itself. So, I\u2019m settling on the output that consists solely of the JSON object with the specified \"category\" field. My final response will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"} \n\nThat keeps it neat and to the point!"
