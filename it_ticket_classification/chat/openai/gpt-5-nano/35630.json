The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context, this seems to fall under \"Access\" regarding connection issues. \n\nSo, I'll output a valid JSON object with {\"category\": \"Access\"} to fit the schema properly.**Classifying IT ticket issues**\n\nThe ticket describes certificate errors that external clients are experiencing while trying to join meetings, likely through Google Meet or Microsoft Teams. Since the issues revolve around SSL certificates and secure connections, I\u2019m thinking it fits best in the \"Access\" category due to the connection problems. It could also be considered \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Access\" seems most appropriate since it's focused on authentication and access to the meeting service.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nThe phrase mentioning \"certificate warnings when trying to join meetings\" highlights security issues for \"external clients\" and \"third-party providers.\" Given this context, classifying this ticket under \"Access\" makes sense. According to instructions, I need to output a JSON object that confirms this categorization. The correct format requires strict adherence, with no extra text or comments. Therefore, my final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
