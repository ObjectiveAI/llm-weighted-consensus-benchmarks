The phrasing is a bit jumbled, but it seems to be asking the team, particularly a senior, to ensure those leave requests are updated. I'll need to categorize this correctly, and since it's about leave requests, \"HR Support\" feels like the best fit. It doesn't seem to fall under IT assets or anything else. I have to respond with the right JSON object format for that category, ensuring it's clear!**Outputting the JSON category**\n\nI have the schema that requires me to provide a JSON object specifically for the category: \"HR Support.\" Since the outer type is listed as \"object,\" I can only return the structured object itself. I'll make sure to use the exact casing as required, so that means it will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Additionally, the instructions suggest to keep it simple and without any extra explanation, so I'll ensure there's no extraneous text in my output."
