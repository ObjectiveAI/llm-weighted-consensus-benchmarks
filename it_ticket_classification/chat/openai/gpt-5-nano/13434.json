The user's text mentions access rights and permissions related to Confluence, which makes me think we should lean towards either \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights\". Since it specifically deals with admin privileges and permission changes, \"Administrative Rights\" seems like the more appropriate choice here. I'll format the output as a JSON object accordingly.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe user wants to add content to Confluence and seems to be discussing upload rights and permissions. It feels like a focus on access rights management. I think \"Access\" fits well since it's about granting or revoking access. However, \"Administrative Rights\" specifically relates to admin privileges, which could also apply here given the mention of upload rights. The user's message is a bit jumbled, but \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights\" are the likely categories. I'll need to make a decision soon!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user is focused on managing access and upload rights in Confluence. Given the emphasis on permission changes, \"Access\" seems like the right category instead of \"Administrative Rights.\" I'll format the response as a JSON object to match the specified schema, ensuring \"category\" is correctly set. It should be structured like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll make sure to keep it concise and just deliver that JSON without any extra text, so it's clear and easy to parse."
