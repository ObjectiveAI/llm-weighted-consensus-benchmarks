They mention receiving multiple confirmation messages when logging time and would prefer a single confirmation instead. It seems like this issue might be related to the Oracle HR or time logging system. The user is asking for an investigation into this matter, so I'll need to address it promptly. They seem to be reaching out on behalf of their manager.**Categorizing Ticket for Oracle**\n\nI need to categorize the ticket based on the user\u2019s inquiry about Oracle\u2019s time logging messages. The relevant categories from the list include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the mention of time logging and confirmation messages, \u201cHR Support\u201d seems like the most fitting category since it relates to human resources. Therefore, I should respond with a JSON object indicating \"HR Support\" as the chosen category.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}**Confirming Ticket Category**\n\nI want to double-check the user\u2019s message: they mentioned \"oracle multiple confirmation messages for logged time...\" which indicates a need for investigation and resolution. Given this context, it definitely falls into the \"HR Support\" category. This categorization aligns with the focus on time logging within the human resources system. So, I\u2019m feeling confident that the ticket's classification is correct as \u201cHR Support.\u201d Let's finalize that decision!"
