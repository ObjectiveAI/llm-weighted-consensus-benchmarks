The ticket mentions several elements that hint it's related to automation. It might fit under \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d if it involves creating tasks, or possibly \u201cInternal Project\u201d or \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d The references to \u201clog console session\u201d could suggest it involves authentication, which complicates things. However, it's certainly not about hardware, HR, or access. Let's see where it fits best for routing!**Categorizing a messy ticket**\n\nI have a somewhat confusing text about a new scheduled task that mentions automation for rebooting every Friday. I need to figure out how to categorize this. \"Administrative rights\" seems appropriate since creating a scheduled task typically needs admin privileges, while it could also fall under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" The references to \"monitoring engineer\" and \"log console session\" might suggest it leans more towards needing those administrative rights. It's a bit tricky, but I'm narrowing it down!**Outputting the category**\n\nIt looks like the user wants me to categorize the ticket without much back-and-forth. \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d seems like the most suitable option, but I can also consider using \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d as a safer choice. \n\nI need to construct my response in the correct format, which requires outputting a JSON object. Since the category should be clear and concise, I'll provide:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nAlright, that\u2019s done!"
