The ticket discusses issues related to removing people from a project and mentions specific tasks like selecting and adding a person, which might relate to \"Access\" or \"Internal Project.\" There's a lot of mixed-up information about visibility and background details. Given this context, I think \"Access\" could be the most fitting category, but I'll keep in mind the possibility of \"Miscellaneous\" as well.**Categorizing access issues**\n\nIt looks like the ticket is about access and permissions related to removing people from a project. I\u2019m considering \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" The mentions of \"remove person,\" \"any cell,\" and \"training backgrounds\" suggest a user management problem in a project management tool. \"Access\" seems the most appropriate since it directly relates to adding and removing permissions. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also work since it touches on the rights to make those changes. I think I'll go with \"Access\" overall!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThis situation seems to be about access and permissions related to removing a person from a project within a project management system. The category \"Access\" fits best since it addresses the permission issue, while \"Administrative rights\" speaks more to admin-level tasks. Although \"Internal Project\" is also a contender, it focuses on the project aspect rather than the operation itself. I'll go with \"Access\" as the primary category. Now, I need to format the output in JSON with the category field!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
