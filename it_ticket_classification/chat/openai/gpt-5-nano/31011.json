The user mentions assigning the same permissions, which leads me to think this fits best under \"Access,\" since that category is all about user access. However, if it\u2019s specifically about admin privileges, \"Administrative rights\" might be a better fit. Given the context of a senior developer, it points towards access needs for an internal project. I\u2019ll lean towards \"Access.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe text doesn't mention administrative rights directly, but refers to \"same permissions\" for members, which likely relates to access permissions for a tool or repo. \"Wednesday pm\" might suggest a schedule. While \"Internal Project\" seems plausible, the focus remains on permissions rather than a project itself. Therefore, I think \"Access\" is the best fit. I\u2019ll prepare the output as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, sticking to the required format with no extra text."
