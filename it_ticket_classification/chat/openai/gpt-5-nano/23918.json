They requested an output that clearly states the category as \"Internal Project.\" According to their requirements, the final output should exactly match the expected structure without any extra text. So, I\u2019ll provide the response as:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}  \n\nAlright, that should fit their needs perfectly!"
