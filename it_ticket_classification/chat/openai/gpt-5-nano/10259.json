I'm considering if \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" fits better in the context of their request. However, it's a bit unclear, as it could imply a need for permission elevation. I'll lean towards choosing \"Access\" since that seems most appropriate.**Categorizing IT access requests**\n\nThe user's request is to grant write access, which likely pertains to something referred to as \"Thursday PM.\" It seems to imply needing permissions for a system or folder. Typically, such access requests fall under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but since it\u2019s general write access and not elevation to admin, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" The output will follow the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll make sure to keep it clear and concise without adding any extra text.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
