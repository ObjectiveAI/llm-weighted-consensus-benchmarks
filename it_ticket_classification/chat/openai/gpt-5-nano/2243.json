Terms like \"new starter,\" \"equipment,\" and \"form joining\" suggest it relates to onboarding, which might fit \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"HR Support.\" Since it indicates the need for provisioning system access or admin rights, I think \"Access\" is the best choice as it focuses on account creation for the new starter.
