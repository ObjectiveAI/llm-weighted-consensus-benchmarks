The mention of \"approval task\" suggests it relates to an ITSM platform, typically involving access approvals. Since the user didn't provide much detail, I'll opt for \"Access\" as a safer choice. However, I could propose this category with justification and offer alternatives if they want more clarification.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI believe the user is expecting a JSON-like answer with the appropriate category value. The system has a specific category schema, so I should respond with a JSON object that includes the category field set to one of the defined values. I'll choose \"Access\" and format it as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It seems best to provide just this JSON object with no extra text since the instruction indicates the output may need to be parsed by code. Let's go ahead and output that!"
