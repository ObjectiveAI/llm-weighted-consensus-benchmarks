It's clear this revolves around project access and administrative rights, so I think the best category to pick would be \"Access.\" \n\nI'll ensure we tag it properly to facilitate a quick resolution. Let's prioritize solving this issue for the user!**Categorizing ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned needing \"administrator permissions\" for adding attachments, which relates closely to \"Administrative rights.\" Although \"Access\" could be relevant too, we have a specific category for \"Administrative rights.\" They are seeking admin rights for their training project attachments, so I'll categorize it accordingly. It could also fit under \"Internal Project,\" but since the main issue is about access rights, I\u2019m going to stick with \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nI'll prepare a JSON output with this category.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
