The ticket describes a physical electrical fault on what seems to be the 3rd floor. The user mentions issues with various plugged devices and a possibly malfunctioning socket under a blown fuse. Given that this concerns physical infrastructure, it definitely falls under the \"Hardware\" category. Although there are options like \"Internal Project,\" it\u2019s clearly hardware-related, so I'll go with \"Hardware.\"**Crafting a JSON response**\n\nAlright, I'm getting ready to categorize the ticket as \"Hardware.\" The user specifically asked for this categorization and wants it in a JSON format. According to the instructions, I need to create a JSON object with a \"category\" key that only contains valid strings from the provided list. So, my output will simply be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nThat's it! No extra information needed, just the JSON object as required."
