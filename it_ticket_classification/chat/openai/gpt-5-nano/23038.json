It seems to be about date modifications, which might fit under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It could also be \"Administrative rights\" if access is needed for those changes. I'm not entirely sure, though!**Parsing IT ticket details**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket that mentions \"oracle project code start date change.\" It sounds like they want to change a project's start date, probably to Wednesday PM. There\u2019s a repeated phrase about changing date codes associated with a client or project in Oracle. Looking at the categories available, this ticket most likely falls under \"Internal Project,\" since it's a request related to modifying project codes. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\"**Responding with category**\n\nI'm considering whether to classify the ticket as \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, there's no explicit mention of access rights, so \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit. Now, I need to format my response as a JSON object. The system expects a specific structure, so I'll provide the category in the required format, ensuring no extra text is included. I\u2019ll return: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
