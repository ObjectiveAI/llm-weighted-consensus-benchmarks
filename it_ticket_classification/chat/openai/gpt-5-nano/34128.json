Given the content, it looks like the best fit might be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" due to the nature of the request regarding contract approvals.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"device name,\" \"device location,\" and \"open scanned number images file type,\" which makes me think it could relate to different categories. It could be \"Purchase\" because of the focus on contract approvals, which fits with procurement. While document scanning is mentioned, the primary theme is still contract approvals and adjustments. Since it doesn't relate to hardware, access, or HR, I believe \"Purchase\" is the best fit. I'll respond with the category in the required JSON format.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
