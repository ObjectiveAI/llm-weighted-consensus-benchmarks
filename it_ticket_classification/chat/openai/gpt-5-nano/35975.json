It looks like this issue is related to their HR/payroll system, especially since it involves approvals and managers. The most fitting categories from the allowed list would likely be \"HR Support\" due to the context of time cards and employee management. I also consider \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" but \"HR Support\" seems the best choice here.**Categorizing time card issue**\n\nI'm deciding on how to categorize an IT ticket about missing time cards. The \"HR Support\" category fits well since it relates to HR/Payroll. While I also consider \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" if there are issues with system access, the main focus is the missing time cards and the approval process in Oracle Fusion. Therefore, I'll choose \"HR Support.\" \n\nI need to format my response as a JSON object, so it will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
