I\u2019ll go with the \"Access\" category.**Classifying access requests**\n\nI'm analyzing a request for \"zone awards\" access rights. Since \"zone awards\" seems to refer to a resource that likely requires \"Administrative rights\" for approval, I need to think carefully. However, the phrase \"approval access\" suggests it's mainly about getting access rather than hardware or storage.\n\nSo, I'll categorize this as \"Access,\" since it focuses on obtaining approval. I think the safest option here is to go with \"Access\" rather than \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll output it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
