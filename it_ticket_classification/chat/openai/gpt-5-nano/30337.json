The main IT tasks seem to focus on user access restrictions, which leads me toward categorizing it as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, I'll go with \"Access\" since the focus is primarily on restricting access. \n\nThe required format is a JSON object, so my final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
