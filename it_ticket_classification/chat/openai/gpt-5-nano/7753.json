The provided categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" It seems like this ticket is about a new employee who is not active and needs help with logging in or assignments. Given these details, it might fit best under \"HR Support\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt looks like this ticket is mainly about access or administrative rights for a new employee. The phrase \"assign her\" likely refers to giving access or setting up an account. I\u2019m seeing that \"new employee not active\" might suggest we need to activate their account, which points to the \"Access\" category. \n\nHowever, \"Administrative rights\" could also apply if it involves granting specific permissions. Based on the context, I think \u201cAccess\u201d is the best fit, and I'll format my output as a JSON object for clarity.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
