The system specifies a valid structure for this, with allowed categories being: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I see the user message is messy, but it mentions \"leaver\" and \"permissions migration,\" which suggests it's about personnel changes and access adjustments. I\u2019ll parse this for the appropriate category.**Determining access category**\n\nThis is about access management and permissions for personnel leaving, which makes \"Access\" a likely category. While \"Administrative rights\" is relevant for granting specific admin privileges, \"Access\" fits more broadly.\n\nI should format the output correctly as a JSON object. The schema requires it to look like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThere\u2019s no extra text needed, just delivering the category. I\u2019ll ensure the case is correct and finalize the output as a JSON object with just the category field."
