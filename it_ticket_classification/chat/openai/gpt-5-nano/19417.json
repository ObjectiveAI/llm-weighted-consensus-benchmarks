It makes sense to categorize this under \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll format my final output accordingly!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think this ticket is about an \"Internal Project\" category since it involves a \"testing core\" project. It might also relate to \"Administrative rights\" if access is needed, but the focus seems to be on creating and managing the project. The grammar is unclear, but it looks like a request to create something named \"testing core.\" Given all this, I'll go with \"Internal Project\" and format my final output as a JSON object."
