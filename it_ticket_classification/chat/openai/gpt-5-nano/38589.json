There's mention of \"Hardware\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" and while \"Teams\" hints at software involving telephony, I'm not sure how to interpret it fully. It might be better to categorize the ticket as \"Hardware\" since it involves physical phones. I could also add a note about its connection to telephony/VoIP. Ultimately, I need to follow the JSON schema for outputting the category. \"Hardware\" feels like the best fit here.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm considering which category to assign to this ticket. \"Access\" could make sense if it's about not receiving calls, but since the user seems to be facing issues with physical phones and flickering displays, \"Hardware\" feels more appropriate. I could possibly also use \"Miscellaneous\" if I'm uncertain. Since I'm required to provide a single category, I\u2019ll go with {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} as the output, sticking closely to the required JSON format."
