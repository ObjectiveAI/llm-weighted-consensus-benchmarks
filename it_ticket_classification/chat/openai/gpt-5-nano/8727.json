The ticket seems to focus on TV hardware, specifically costs and pricing associated with purchasing a new TV, and includes discussions on browser capabilities and compatibility. Phrases like \"cost for new tv,\" \"price offer tv,\" and \"recover tv costs\" indicate that it's primarily about acquiring TV hardware. I\u2019ll categorize this ticket under \"Purchase\", as it directly relates to buying a new TV.**Deciding Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket related to TV hardware. It mentions phrases like \"cost,\" \"price offer,\" and \"quote,\" all suggesting it's about buying a new TV, likely for display due to browser compatibility. Considering the available categories, \"Purchase\" fits best, especially since the user seems to be asking about obtaining a price quote. I\u2019ll go ahead and craft the JSON object with the category set to \"Purchase.\"**Generating JSON Output**\n\nThe instruction clearly asks for just the JSON format for the IT ticket categorization. I need to provide only the essential information, which is the \"category\" property. So, I\u2019ll keep it simple and output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nI want to make sure I\u2019m not including any extra words or information. Alright, I think that\u2019s clear and straightforward! Let's finalize this."
