This seems to lean towards HR support since it involves employee leave and hours, but the ticket also references an Oracle system, which complicates classification since none of the categories fit perfectly.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this as \"HR Support\" because it deals with annual leave, hours, and leave management. However, the technical aspect of the Oracle error complicates things. The ticket refers to a software issue with the leave management system, likely HRIS. Since there\u2019s no \"App support\" category, \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" and others don't really fit either. The safest choice looks like \"HR Support,\" especially since it directly relates to leave management.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
