My task is to classify it into one of several categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. I have to format my output as a JSON object with a key for \"category.\" The instructions specify that it should follow a particular structure. So, I\u2019ll identify the right category from the ticket text and create the JSON accordingly.**Categorizing Garbled Ticket**\n\nThe ticket text is really jumbled, mentioning things like password resets and user creation. Despite the confusion, I can pick out key topics: it\u2019s mainly about access, specifically password resets and account creation. I\u2019m deciding between categorizing it as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \"Access\" fits better since it relates to passwords and user creation. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and create the response in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI need to make sure my response has proper, minimal formatting. The task is straightforward: I should prepare a single JSON object that indicates the category as \"Access,\" and there shouldn\u2019t be any extra text. I\u2019ll follow the specified category schema for clarity. \n\nSo the final output will be just: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to double-check that I've got it right before finishing."
