It seems they're trying to view team absences through employees' details but keep encountering errors. Since this is clearly an access issue, I\u2019ll classify it under the \"Access\" category.**Deciding category for IT Ticket**\n\nI'm considering whether this IT ticket could fall under \"Administrative rights,\" given the mention of permissions. However, the main issue is the access error to the report, which clearly aligns with the \"Access\" category. There's a possible subcategory consideration, but they aren't requesting permissions\u2014just access. \n\nI\u2019ll respond with the required JSON object format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It needs to be specified clearly, so I should stick to exactly what the instructions ask.**Formatting the output correctly**\n\nI've checked the expected format for the output, which should be a JSON object. In previous tasks, I've provided {\"category\":\"Access\"}, and it seems that's what I should do again. I want to make sure I'm following the given schema accurately.\n\nThe schema indicates the available options, and my response needs to be strictly in that JSON format without any extra text or punctuation. So, I\u2019m all set to simply output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
