This sounds like it falls under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" since the ticket involves changing user permissions. I wonder which category is the most fitting since both seem relevant. The phrasing indicates a clear action related to access control. I'll lean toward \"Administrative rights,\" as it's directly tied to the user's request.**Categorizing Access Changes**\n\nSince the content focuses on removing admin access, it relates directly to administrative rights and access control. I think \"Administrative rights\" is the most precise category because it clearly involves restricting privileges. I realize I need to respond with a JSON object according to the provided schema. It looks like I just need to output {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} without any extra explanations or commentary. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and prepare that response.**Determining Ticket Categories**\n\nI see that the user\u2019s text highlights two issues: removing admin access from someone named \"Snow\" and changing the priority of his own tickets. The first part clearly falls under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" while the second could relate to \"Internal\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" Since I need to select just one primary category, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d makes the most sense. I\u2019ll prepare the JSON response accordingly to reflect that choice."
