The ticket mentions an urgent issue regarding a survey error where duplicate values are found and users are experiencing errors when trying to submit their responses. This seems messy, but it's clearly related to software functionality, specifically an issue with the survey system. Therefore, I should categorize this ticket under \"IT Support\" since it pertains to a software problem.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI need to choose the right category for this IT ticket. The options include \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Storage.\" Since the issue is related to a survey error and a technical problem with an internal tool, it doesn't fit into hardware, storage, or access rights. \"Miscellaneous\" is the best option since it covers general software issues that don\u2019t quite fit into other categories. However, if it's specific to an internal project, I might consider \"Internal Project.\"**Responding with JSON for IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket references a survey error and mentions users having problems when submitting answers. While I considered categorizing it as \"Purchase\" related to \"provider,\" it doesn't fit. \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the correct choice since it covers general software issues. The prompt requires me to respond with a specific JSON format that includes a category field. Therefore, I\u2019ll prepare the JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} and ensure it meets the required structure. I\u2019ll stick to that!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
