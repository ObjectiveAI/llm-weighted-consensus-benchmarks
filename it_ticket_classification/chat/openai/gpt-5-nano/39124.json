The message is quite messy, but the key points include needing a temporary phone because their current mobile phone only works sometimes. It seems like this issue relates to hardware since we're dealing with mobile devices, but I might also consider \"Purchase\" since they\u2019re requesting a temporary phone. I'll proceed with that interpretation!**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nIt seems the category for this IT ticket should be \"Hardware\" since it's about a phone device. They also mentioned some additional info about a \"vetting officer address street center,\" but I think that doesn't change the category choice. The system requires me to respond in JSON format, so I'll prepare it as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I need to make sure I stick to the format strictly, without any extra text. Alright, I'm ready to deliver!"
