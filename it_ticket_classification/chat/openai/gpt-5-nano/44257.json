The text mentions a \"career development system issue\" where the user mistakenly marked a career discussion as completed and can't edit it anymore. They\u2019re asking for assistance to change the status. Initially, I thought it might relate to administrative rights, but it seems more appropriate to classify it under \"HR Support,\" as it pertains to a career development system issue. \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" might apply, but \"HR Support\" feels right.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe user wants to change the status of a completed career discussion, which falls under an admin function in the HR system. \"HR Support\" seems to be the best category for this. I need to format the output as a JSON-like object, specifically: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to stick to the exact format required without any extra text. Following that, I\u2019ll respond simply with:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
