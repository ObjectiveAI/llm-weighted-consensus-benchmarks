They mention issues related to clients, Macs, and ongoing problems over the last few days. Everyone seems to be trying to reach out regarding these issues. My best guess is that this fits under the \"Miscellaneous\" category since it doesn't clearly align with hardware, software access, or anything specific like purchases or administrative rights. I'll proceed accordingly with a JSON object reflecting this choice.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m trying to pinpoint the right category for this IT ticket. The user mentions issues with Macs and possibly network access, which suggests it could be an access or hardware issue. The phrase \"not working for clients\" indicates it\u2019s impacting client work. While I wonder if it fits under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" the mention of Macs makes \"Hardware\" the best choice. I'll prepare a JSON object with the category field reflecting this decision.**Outputting JSON schema**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the JSON schema, and I need to fit my category into that format. The options include \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" and a few others. Given the user's message, which suggests persistent issues with clients using Macs, it leans toward \"Hardware.\" The mention of everyone trying to contact support indicates the need for help, reinforcing this choice. I\u2019ll prepare to output the JSON object as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to align with the schema requirements.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
