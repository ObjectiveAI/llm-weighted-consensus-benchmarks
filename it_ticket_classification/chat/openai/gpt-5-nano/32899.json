The terms like \"work hours per day\" and \"oracle time\" hint at time tracking. The user seems to want to modify the MR number to assist with a posting sheet. I'm thinking the most fitting category is \"Access,\" but \"Administrative rights\" may be more suitable since it deals with specific permissions needed for adjustments.**Determining category for MR modification**\n\nThis ticket centers around privileges for modifying the MR, so \"Administrative rights\" feels quite appropriate. Alternatively, \"Internal Project\" could apply if it's a task for the \"MR modification sheet,\" but that seems less fitting. I should categorize it as \"Administrative rights.\" The output must be in a specific JSON format consistent with the schema. The final answer will be a clean JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} \u2014 simple and straightforward! Let's go with that!"
