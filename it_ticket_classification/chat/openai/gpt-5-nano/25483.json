The content suggests they're having trouble connecting remotely to a server, which is possibly down after updates, and they\u2019re requesting it to be booted. This could fit under \"Hardware,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" Since they're asking for help to boot the server, it seems like a hardware or access issue. I'll lean towards categorizing it as \"Access.\"**Classifying IT issues**\n\nI see that the category list includes \"Administrative rights,\" but that's not relevant here. \"Access\" fits for remote login problems, but the user is specifically asking to boot a machine. That suggests a hardware issue since the server is down after updates and having remote access problems. So, it generally aligns with \"Hardware.\" However, since they request someone to boot it, that could imply an operational issue. I'll categorize it as \"Hardware\" for the server problem, but consider the implications of admin rights.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
