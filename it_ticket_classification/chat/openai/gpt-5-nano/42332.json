The text mentions an issue with submitting something related to \"Oracle.\" This could fall under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it suggests a problem with user access to the Oracle system. Phrases like \"urgent\" and \"needs close down her for period\" make it unclear, but I believe \"Access\" might be the best fit for this situation.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for this IT ticket. The user mentioned \"cannot submit,\" which makes me think it might be an access or permission issue related to the Oracle system. It could fit under \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or even \"Miscellaneous.\" Since they emphasize urgency, I should clarify that this issue appears to be about access limitations. Ultimately, I should respond with a JSON object indicating the category, like {\"category\":\"Access\"} or alternatively \"Administrative rights.\"**Categorizing Oracle submission issue**\n\nI'm analyzing the phrase \"cannot submit oracle.\" It seems to be an issue with submission, probably tied to access rights rather than administrative privileges. The user's urgency and mention of a \"presence leader\" don't seem crucial to categorizing the ticket. I need to decide between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \"Access\" is more about general login and permission issues, while \"Administrative rights\" refers to specific tasks needing admin privileges. Given the context, \"Access\" feels like the best fit here.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
