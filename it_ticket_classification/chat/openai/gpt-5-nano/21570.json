The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll analyze the string for clues about its content. Given terms like \"new starter,\" it seems to relate to HR support. I\u2019ll likely choose \"HR Support\" for categorization and format my output in a JSON-like structure: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Interpreting ticket text**\n\nI need to make sense of the ticket text, which seems quite jumbled. There are mentions of a \"new starter,\" and \"cornea\" might be a name. It's listing times like \"Friday February pm\" and refers to a \"starter form.\" Since this is likely about onboarding tasks, the pertinent categories appear to be \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context around the \"new starter form,\" I think \"HR Support\" is the best fit. However, I'm unclear about the \"maps exact\" reference.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe best category for this ticket seems to be \"HR Support\" since it\u2019s related to onboarding and a new starter form. However, there\u2019s also reason to consider \"Access,\" as it could refer to system access related to the starter form. The mention of \"ext\" might imply \"extension.\" Perhaps it indicates a person or that they're scheduling a new starter. Given the context, I think \"HR Support\" makes more sense for onboarding, but \"Access\" could fit for provisioning.**Choosing the best category**\n\nIf the ticket is about a new starter needing access, then \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could fit. However, it doesn\u2019t specify which systems, so the general category \"HR Support\" is likely the best choice. The phrase \"new starter\" points to onboarding tasks, and \"re starter form\" indicates they need a form processed. Since the new starter likely relates to HR, I feel confident in categorizing this as \"HR Support,\" so I'll output the JSON as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nThe task is straightforward: I need to output the category in a JSON format. Since we\u2019ve determined \"HR Support\" is the right category, I\u2019ll keep it concise and provide just the necessary JSON structure. I\u2019ll format my response as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. No extra commentary; just the clean output is what's required here. Let\u2019s go ahead and do that!"
