The ticket mentions issues with computers disappearing from Active Directory, which sounds like an \"Access\" problem. I'm considering the categories from the system prompt: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" This ticket definitely relates to user access issues, so it seems fitting to assign it to the \"Access\" category.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe IT ticket discusses issues like unbinding and rebinding domains, recreating computers, and problems with Active Directory (AD) trust. It primarily concerns domain access, so I think the best category is \"Access.\" However, it might also relate to \"Administrative rights\" if there are permission issues or even \"Internal Project\" if it ties to a specific project. Still, based on the content, \"Access\" is definitely the most fitting category. I should output this as a JSON object per the required format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
