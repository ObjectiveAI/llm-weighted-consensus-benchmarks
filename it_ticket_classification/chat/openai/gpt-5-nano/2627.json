It mentions access to \"AM discipline leadership updates\" and seems to involve accepting or declining requests for those updates. Considering the content, it likely falls under the \u201cAccess\u201d category since it's an access request. However, if it's more about requesting privileges related to updates, then maybe \"Administrative rights\" could also be appropriate. Ultimately, it seems best categorized as \"Access.\"**Categorizing IT ticket request**\n\nThe user seems to be asking how to set up an approval process based on their note about accepting or declining requests related to \"AM discipline leadership updates.\" This points to the need for access to information. I believe the best category for this IT ticket is \"Access,\" since it concerns general access rights. If the focus is specifically on system rights, \"Administrative rights\" could also work. I'll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
