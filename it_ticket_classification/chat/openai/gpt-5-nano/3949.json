The mention of \"prod\" and \"service,\" along with \"browser level\" seems to indicate a technical issue related to the production environment. So, I'll lean towards categorizing it under \"Internal Project\" since it looks like it's about implementing or troubleshooting within a production service. Next, I'll structure the output in JSON format with the appropriate category field.**Analyzing Ticket Category**\n\nI need to find the right category for this ticket, considering options like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The text indicates a potential browser-level issue and implementation concerns for a production environment. I don\u2019t think \"Hardware\" or \"HR Support\" fits here. It sounds more in line with \"Internal Project\" since it deals with an implementation task. But there\u2019s also a chance it ties into \"Administrative rights\" due to needing approval for deployment. I'll keep analyzing!**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI'm evaluating the best category for this ticket, and while \"Access\" might fit due to a potential browser-level issue, I think \"Internal Project\" is more appropriate since it discusses implementing a production service. The ticket isn't relevant to \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Purchase.\" Although \"Administrative rights\" could apply if admin permissions were needed, the text doesn\u2019t mention them. So, I'll go with \"Internal Project\" and prepare a JSON object for the response.**Formatting Ticket Category**\n\nI see that the instruction specifies a schema for categorizing, requiring me to output a JSON object with a category key. Since I've determined \"Internal Project\" is the appropriate category for this ticket, I\u2019ll format my response exactly as required. The final output will simply be `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}` without any extra commentary. It's essential to stick to the format and keep it plain text as specified. Let's go ahead with that!"
