The ticket discusses a software license request and procurement, so I\u2019m deciding between Purchase and Access. Since it\u2019s mainly about acquiring a software license, I think it falls under Purchase rather than Access, which is more about login rights. It clearly refers to licenses being procured, so \"Purchase\" seems to be the most appropriate category.**Constructing JSON output**\n\nI need to output a JSON object with a category field based on the allowed list. The correct format requires me to specify the type as \"object\" and include properties. Since we\u2019ve categorized the ticket under \"Purchase,\" I should ensure the output is just this object: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. I want to stick to the required schema without adding any extra text, so I'll go ahead and provide exactly that structure. Let's do this!"
