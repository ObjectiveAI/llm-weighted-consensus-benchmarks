They mention needing a \"new field for\" and \"please add requested by free text stories bugs epics other kind tasks.\" It looks like they\u2019re referring to tasks related to project management in Jira. I could place this ticket under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" depending on the specifics. It seems to be focused on adding a \"requested by\" field in a tool used for internal project management.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis task is about categorizing an internal change in a system, not anything to do with hardware, HR, access, storage, purchase, or administrative rights. It looks like \u201cInternal Project\u201d is the appropriate choice since it involves a feature in Jira related to tracking a \"requested by\" field for various project tasks such as stories and bugs. I think it\u2019s best to go with \"Internal Project.\" So, I'll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe prompt clearly asks me to categorize an IT ticket, and I'm expected to provide a JSON-like object with a \"category\" key. The options available include categories like \u201cHardware,\u201d \u201cHR Support,\u201d and \u201cInternal Project.\u201d It seems like the user is focused on the internal project aspect based on the request. So, even though I could respond plainly with the category string, I believe offering it in a JSON format is the safest approach. I'll go with {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Responding with JSON**\n\nTo be cautious, I'll respond with a straightforward JSON object like {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It feels like the right choice based on the task. Adding a brief explanation could help clarify why I've categorized it that way, but I want to keep it concise. Since they requested categorization, I think sticking to the JSON format is essential. So, my final answer will simply be the JSON object. Let's go ahead and do that!"
