It mentions updating a contract value, a wrong number entered, and issues with the date, specifically Friday PM. It doesn\u2019t seem related to hardware or access. This looks more like a procurement or contract management issue. I\u2019ll consider options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Storage\" for categorization.**Finding ticket category**\n\nI'm looking at the categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" This IT ticket seems to fit best with \"Administrative rights\" or \"Purchase\" due to mentions of \"contract value,\" \"submitted contract,\" and \"approvals.\" There's also \"locked\" and \"fix date,\" which might indicate a need to update the contract or an access issue due to approval workflows. I'm torn between \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" as it could involve permissions too.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket that\u2019s about editing contract values and dates, which suggests a possible need for a permission change. \"Administrative rights\" feels like the best fit here since the user mentioned things like \"locked,\" \"approvals,\" and \"changing contract value,\" indicating it may be a permissions issue. Alternatively, I could consider \"Purchase\" if it's strictly about the procurement side. However, it seems more aligned with \"Administrative rights.\" I'll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
