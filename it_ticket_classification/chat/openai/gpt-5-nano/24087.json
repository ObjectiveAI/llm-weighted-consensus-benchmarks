It\u2019s messy! I\u2019m thinking \u201cdelete instances\u201d refers to cloud instances, which leans towards \"Administrative rights\" since deleting them suggests permission is required. It might also be \"Storage\" due to the resource consumption. \"Internal Project\" could work if it\u2019s about a project aspect, but there\u2019s no hardware issue. Let\u2019s figure it out!**Deciding on a ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking this ticket is about deleting cloud instances since \"delete instances\" suggests a service request for removing compute instances. I need to choose between \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Storage\" since there's no mention of hardware, HR, or purchases. \"Access\" might apply here too, as it involves permissions. The user mentions a \"terminated lead\" and seems to want to schedule deletions. Ultimately, \"Administrative rights\" feels like the best fit because it involves admin-level actions.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s message mentions \"every test every test terminated lead,\" which is quite odd. I\u2019m considering categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" since it seems related to a project environment focused on deleting instances in a test setting. However, it could also link to \"Storage,\" but that feels less fitting. \"Administrative rights\" seems like the best option since deleting instances requires privileges. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like object to specify the category as \"Administrative rights,\" noting the content is ambiguous.**Finalizing the category output**\n\nI\u2019m thinking it could be useful to give a short rationale, but the required format specifies only a category object. The instruction \"Please categorize this IT Ticket\" seems to focus solely on the category itself. Based on the schema, I\u2019ll produce: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. It\u2019s important to make sure the string matches exactly. I\u2019ll deliver that as requested and skip adding extra notes since the format calls for just the object. Let\u2019s proceed!"
