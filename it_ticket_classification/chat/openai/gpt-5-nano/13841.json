The relevant details emphasize \u201caccess cards usage\u201d and \u201ccards,\u201d so I should categorize this under \u201cAccess.\u201d However, it could also fit into \u201cHardware\u201d since access cards are tangible items like RFID badges. My best guess here is to classify it as \u201cAccess\u201d due to the primary focus on usage rather than hardware specifics.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket is about the usage of access cards, specifically asking to assign control of these cards. The phrase \"access cards\" suggests it belongs to the \"Access\" category. Since that's one of the available categories, I need to respond in the required JSON format. The user prompted with \u201cCategorize this IT Ticket,\u201d which makes it clear that I should provide my answer succinctly as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I won\u2019t add any extra commentary; just focus on delivering the correct JSON response.**Finalizing the classification**\n\nIt looks like there\u2019s a mention of \"more than days,\" which could imply a missing number, but I can\u2019t fix that now. The key point is that the classification stays as \"Access.\" So, I'm ready to craft the final response. My final output will be straightforward and focused on just the necessary information. I'll make sure it's clear, concise, and in the correct format as required. It's all about delivering what the user needs!"
