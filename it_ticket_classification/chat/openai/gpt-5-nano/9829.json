The text mentions updating client codes and requests further information for a swift resolution. I see that the relevant categories are listed, and it seems to fit under \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nSo, I'll respond with a JSON object that includes the category field with this value. This will help ensure clarity and organization for the IT ticket.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm looking at this task, which feels administrative. The user is requesting a change to the client name and mentions updating connection codes. This could point toward \"Administrative rights\" since it's about changing names that likely require admin access. It doesn't fit under hardware, HR, or other categories. \n\nWhile \"Internal Project\" could apply if it's for a specific project, it seems more straightforward. I'll categorize this ticket as \"Administrative rights\" to be clear and precise.**Parsing IT Ticket Content**\n\nI\u2019m looking closely at the content provided, which mentions changing and standardizing a client name multiple times. There's a note about updating connection codes, suggesting this is an administrative request for standardization. While \"Administrative rights\" seems to fit since you\u2019d likely need permission to make those changes, it\u2019s not explicitly tied to a project. There isn't mention of an ongoing internal project, so I think \"Administrative rights\" is the most accurate category here.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
