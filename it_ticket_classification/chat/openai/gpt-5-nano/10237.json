It seems to fit better under \"HR Support\" since it's about leave management, not hardware. I\u2019ll prepare the JSON output with the chosen category.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the category list, which includes \"HR Support\" for HR-related issues, \"Administrative Rights\" for permissions, \"Access\" for system access, along with others. Given that this ticket relates to annual leave and public holiday scheduling, it's clear that \"HR Support\" is the right category. Now, I\u2019ll prepare the JSON output: it must be a JSON object with the property \"category.\" So, the output will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
