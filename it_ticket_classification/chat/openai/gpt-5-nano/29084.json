Since there\u2019s no specific \"Software\" or \"Licensing\" category, I think the best fit would be \"Purchase,\" especially for license-related items. \"Access\" could work if it pertains to license keys, but \"Purchase\" seems most plausible.**Categorizing IT ticket text**\n\nThe ticket text is quite minimal and repetitive: \"idea license friday pm idea license hello license idea thank software developer.\" It seems the user wants to categorize this for triage. I think \"Purchase\" fits best because \"license\" suggests a procurement or licensing issue. While \"Access\" could apply if it's about license access, \"Purchase\" focuses on product licensing. I need to output this in the required JSON-like format as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll make sure the structure is clear!**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nThe allowed category values include \"Purchase,\" so I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I need to make sure there\u2019s no extra text accompanying this; just the JSON itself. While the \"idea license friday pm\" portion might imply a time reference, it's not essential for categorizing. I think sticking with \"Purchase\" is the best choice here, so let's finalize that response!"
