This makes me think the issue is related to hardware since it discusses things like enclosures and component failure. We have taxonomy categories available, and it seems appropriate to categorize this ticket under \"Hardware.\" I need to keep that in mind while making the final assignment.**Responding with JSON format**\n\nI\u2019ve determined that the category for this IT ticket should be \"Hardware.\" The user expects a JSON object format, so I need to keep it concise and follow the specified structure. The correct output will be {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll avoid adding unnecessary commentary, as the instruction clearly states to respond with just the category object. Let's make sure the final output is exactly as required: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That should do it!"
