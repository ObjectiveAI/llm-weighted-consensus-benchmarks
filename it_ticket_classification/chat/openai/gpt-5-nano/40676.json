Since this seems to be primarily about email access affecting client responses, the \"Access\" category appears most suitable. I was considering \"Miscellaneous\" as an alternative, but \"Access\" fits best since it directly relates to their email issue.{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Identifying IT issue**\n\nI've got the user's message about a mail error that started a few days ago. It's clear this is causing problems with their ability to respond to clients, especially since they're traveling frequently. Since it\u2019s an IT issue related to email, I\u2019ll categorize this accordingly. It seems important to report this error as it\u2019s impacting work efficiency. I\u2019ll make sure to respond promptly with the necessary categorization."
