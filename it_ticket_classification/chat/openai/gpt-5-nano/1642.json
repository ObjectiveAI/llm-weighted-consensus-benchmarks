The ticket seems tied to an employee offboarding process. It involves access management and rights for accounts and profiles. Given the categories provided, \"Access\" appears to be the most suitable one here, considering it encompasses all the elements mentioned regarding deprovisioning and access revocation for the user.**Creating JSON Output**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to best categorize this IT ticket. While \"Administrative rights\" seems relevant due to AD privileges, the ticket is primarily about leaver processing, which signals \"Access\" as the most appropriate choice. I'm thinking about how to format the final answer as a clean JSON object, ensuring it\u2019s straightforward and follows the required schema without any extra text or heavy formatting. So the final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
