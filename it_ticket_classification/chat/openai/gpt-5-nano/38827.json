The categories I can choose from include things like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. It seems that \"connection\" refers to network issues, but there's no explicit network category listed. I think \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit here, given the lack of a more specific option. I\u2019ll just define the category accordingly.**Determining category**\n\nI think the best fit for this IT ticket is \"Miscellaneous,\" since it seems to be a general IT issue. I briefly considered \"Access,\" but there\u2019s no mention of login, and \"Administrative rights\" doesn't apply. \"Hardware\" might fit if the connection issue is hardware-related, but again, that's not clear. I want to keep it safe with \"Miscellaneous,\" so I'll respond with just that as a JSON object, formatted correctly. Here's what I'll output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
