The ticket concerns keyboard replacement and issues with sticky keys causing crashes. This seems like a clear hardware issue, so I\u2019m deciding on the \"Hardware\" category as the best fit. I\u2019ll structure my response in JSON format with {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Formatting the category response**\n\nI need to ensure the format matches the required JSON-like category object. The schema specifies that it should include \"category\" as a string with certain options. My response will be a JSON object containing \"category\": \"Hardware\" because that's the most appropriate choice. I don\u2019t need to include any extra text or consider other categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" as they're not relevant here. So I'll go with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
