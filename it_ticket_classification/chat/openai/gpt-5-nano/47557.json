The ticket seems to involve support regarding Oracle and mentions tasks, searching for applications, and assignments. This could fall under \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" or even \"Miscellaneous.\" It may also relate to a productivity workflow issue, or possibly \"Administrative rights\" if there are access rights questions regarding the applications.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket requests user assistance with checking applications, noting details under a specific code related to Colombia, searching for tasks, and assigning them. It involves an internal tool for task management. Since it clearly pertains to managing tasks within an internal project, I think the best fit is \"Internal Project.\" The output needs to be in JSON format as specified, so I'll respond with: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI might consider adding a brief note, but I'll stick to the required format for now.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI need to use the exact allowed category, which is \"Internal Project.\" It seems clear that the request is just for categorization and not for further explanation. I'll go ahead and provide the answer in the specified JSON format. There\u2019s no need to include an explanation since the instructions focus on categorizing. So, I'll stick to the format and proceed with just the JSON output!"
