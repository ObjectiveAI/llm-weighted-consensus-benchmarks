The options available are categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" among others. The description mentions a new purchase order for hardware, specifically mice, and includes details about logging allocations and receiving items. Based on this, it seems clear that the most fitting category is \"Purchase.\" So, I'll go ahead and categorize the ticket accordingly.**Categorizing IT Ticket Correctly**\n\nThis ticket is focused on purchasing hardware items like mice, logging allocation, and managing receipts. I\u2019m deciding between \"Purchase\" and \"Hardware\" as the category. It mentions aspects of a procurement process, emphasizing that it\u2019s about purchasing rather than hardware issues. Given this focus, \"Purchase\" fits best. \n\nNow, I'll format my response as a JSON-like object. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} to align with the system's requirements.**Sending the Correct Category**\n\nI\u2019ve determined that the JSON schema indicates how I should present my output. The focus here is to provide just the category value, which should be formatted as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. While the schema does include additional metadata, it's not necessary to include that in my response. \n\nAfter double-checking, \"Purchase\" is the most appropriate category, not \"Miscellaneous.\" So, I\u2019ll keep it concise and deliver the final response: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
