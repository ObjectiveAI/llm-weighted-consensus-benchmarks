They mentioned \"oracle expenses mobile\" and \"host required connect app,\" suggesting it relates to software on mobile. The categories I can choose from include \"Access\" for host requirements, \"Administrative rights\" if admin access is needed, or even \"Miscellaneous\" if it's tough to categorize. I\u2019ll have to consider the keywords carefully to pick the best fitting category.**Considering ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m thinking the user might want to categorize the ticket under \"Access\" because of the phrase \"host required connect app.\" This suggests access rights or the need to connect to a host. \"Administrative rights\" could fit if they need admin access for the app. The mention of \"Oracle expenses mobile\" likely refers to an app for submitting expenses. It seems that \"Access\" is the best choice here given the context, though \"Purchase\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could also be alternatives.**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nI think I've determined that the ticket isn't about hardware. It seems more related to software since \"Oracle expenses mobile\" suggests it's an app. \"Internal Project\" doesn\u2019t fit either, so I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Access.\" I need to prepare a JSON object with the \"category\" field set to \"Access,\" just as specified in the instructions. So, I\u2019ll make sure the response contains just the necessary JSON without any extra text. Here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
