I\u2019m thinking this could fall under categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" or even \"Administrative rights.\" Since they mention RAM, I'm leaning toward categorizing it as \"Hardware\" or possibly \"Purchase,\" considering they might need to buy it.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user mentions \"RAM\" and seems to request help, which points to \"Hardware\" as the best category since it's directly related to hardware. There\u2019s also a slight possibility it could be \"Access\" regarding new members, but I'm sticking with hardware here. We need to respond in a specific format, so I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It\u2019s essential to match the exact casing for categorization, so I\u2019ll ensure it\u2019s properly formatted without any extra text.**Outputting Category Object**\n\nThe user specifically asked to categorize the IT ticket, so I need to follow that instruction closely. Since the allowed format is a category object, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON response. I\u2019ll produce: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This matches the specified format perfectly, so I think I've got it right. It's concise and directly addresses the request. Seems straightforward enough!"
