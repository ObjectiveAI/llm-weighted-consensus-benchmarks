The ticket mentions issues with tickets not closing automatically when approvals are rejected, and it seems like there are at least two cases of this happening. \n\nFrom the given categories, it looks like this ticket might fall under \"Access\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" I should evaluate the specifics in more detail to ensure I categorize it correctly. This is pretty important for effective issue resolution!**Parsing ticket issues**\n\nI see the user message has some typos, which can make it confusing. They state that tickets aren't closing automatically when approvals are rejected, but then mention cases where they are closing automatically. So, the issue seems to be about inconsistent behavior during the approval process.\n\nAs for categorizing, it looks like it relates to ticket workflow rather than hardware or access. It might fit under \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" or perhaps \"Miscellaneous.\" I need to confirm!**Analyzing ticket category**\n\nThe ticket describes an issue with the ticketing system not closing properly upon approval rejection. It seems related to IT workflow or processes, so I\u2019m considering categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" \n\nFor the rest: \n\n- Hardware, HR Support, Storage, and Purchase clearly don't apply.\n- \"Access\" could fit, but it\u2019s not about user access rights.\n- \"Miscellaneous\" feels too generic. \n\nThe situation might align best with \"Internal Project\" or potentially link to a bug under \"Administrative Rights.\" I should clarify that!**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the user's IT ticket and thinking about typical ticketing workflows. Issues with system behavior usually fall under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the user specifically asked to categorize, I should respond with a JSON object specifying one of the allowed categories. \n\nThe ticket is about tickets not closing automatically when approvals are rejected, which relates to the ticketing system. I would lean toward \"Internal Project\" as the best fit because it encompasses those kinds of internal processes. So, I\u2019ll probably go with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Finalizing ticket response**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to choose \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" for the ticket categorization. \"Internal Project\" specifically addresses development or project-related issues, which fits well since this seems part of the IT department's workflow. \n\nWhile \"Access\" could apply if approvals were about user rights, that's not the case here. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project.\" The user expects a simple response, and the system requires a JSON format, so my final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
