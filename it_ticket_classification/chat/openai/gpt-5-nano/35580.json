It mentions \"notification for meeting certificate errors for external clients resolved,\" which gives me the impression of an access-related issue. The potential categories to consider are \"Access\" or maybe \"Miscellaneous\". Since it's primarily about resolving external client meeting certificate errors, I think I\u2019ll lean towards \"Access.\" It feels like the most appropriate choice here!**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing a ticket related to \"certificate errors for external clients\" and considering how to categorize it. I\u2019m thinking it might fit into \"Access\" since this involves security or SSL certificate issues affecting client meetings. Although \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, \"Access\" seems the most relevant as it relates to login and authentication. I\u2019ll choose \"Access\" for the categorization. Now, I\u2019ll prepare to respond with a JSON-like format for clarity!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
