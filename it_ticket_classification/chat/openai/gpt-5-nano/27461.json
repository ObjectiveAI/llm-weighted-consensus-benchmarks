Their string mentions elements like \"new purchase,\" \"adapter,\" \"cable,\" \"purchase order,\" and \"receipt,\" indicating it relates to buying hardware. It sounds like it's about purchasing adapter cables and involves logging installation, but \"Administrative rights\" don\u2019t really apply here. The best fit for this ticket is \"Purchase.\" I should confirm that and format the response as JSON.**Formatting Category Response**\n\nI need to format the response as a JSON object based on the user's request. They want a category related to the IT ticket and have provided a schema for it. I know the category options, and since this ticket is about a purchase, I'll select \"Purchase.\" To keep it straightforward, I should respond with just the JSON object, avoiding any extra text. So, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} without any additional formatting."
