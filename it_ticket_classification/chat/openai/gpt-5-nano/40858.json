The ticket's content indicates it's primarily a hardware issue, but since the user is also asking about purchasing, it fits both \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase\" categories. Choosing the most appropriate category seems essential here. It might be best to go with \"Purchase\" since they're specifically inquiring about acquiring a new phone.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nThe user is looking to purchase a replacement phone quickly, so I need to categorize their IT ticket. I think \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category since they are seeking information on procurement. While \"Hardware\" also makes sense due to the broken device, I'm choosing \"Purchase\" as the primary category. I\u2019ll format the response as a short JSON object with just the category field, so it becomes:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nThat feels clear and direct!"
