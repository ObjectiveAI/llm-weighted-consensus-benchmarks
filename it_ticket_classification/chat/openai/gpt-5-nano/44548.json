It seems to touch on HR aspects as well, since it involves booking hours and annual leave. I will lean towards categorizing it as \"Access\" or possibly \"HR Support.\"**Assessing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI see references like \"operational role cannot book hours\" and \"booking against operations code,\" which leads me to consider categories like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" This ticket is centered around permissions to book hours, probably within an application related to booking codes and roles. It may also touch on \"HR Support\" since it pertains to time off and annual leave. Given the user's request to adjust settings for booking, I believe \"Access\" is the most fitting category.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe user wants to book hours under an operations code like their colleagues, which indicates a permissions issue with the time tracking system. Their request involves needing access to certain booking codes, possibly related to an \"Oracle\" system. Given that they're asking for permission to proceed, I think the best category is \"Access,\" possibly with a subcategory for \"Permissions.\" This helps clarify the user's need for permission to book hours as required.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
