The structured output should be a JSON object, like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I can keep it clear and straightforward!**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe user just wants the category, not additional questions. I need to keep it simple with a one-liner, like \"Category: Access,\" while ensuring it aligns with the specified format. The required schema is clear; I should only deliver a JSON object with the category. \n\nSo, the final response should simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra text, just focusing on crafting that specific object for clarity! This keeps everything neat and fulfills the request efficiently."
