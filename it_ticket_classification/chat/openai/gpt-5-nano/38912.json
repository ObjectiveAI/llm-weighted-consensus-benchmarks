There are several categories to choose from, like \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", and others. The issue seems related to data export and a missing field in a data export dashboard. I think it doesn't fit neatly into \"Storage\" or \"Internal Project\". \"Miscellaneous\" is a possibility, but maybe \"Administrative rights\" could work too. It's tough to pin down!**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize an IT ticket related to an internal data export/dashboard from a data analyst. It's not about rights, so \"Administrative rights\" doesn't fit. The categories provided are specific, and there's no \"Data\" category. \"Internal Project\" seems fitting since it\u2019s about an internal dashboard, but \"Miscellaneous\" is also a possibility for non-classifiable items. Ultimately, since it\u2019s focused on the internal project, I think I'll go with \"Internal Project\" for this ticket.**Outputting JSON Category**\n\nI need to output a JSON format with a category field since the instructions specify responding with a category object. The user requested a categorization for an IT ticket and provided relevant text. According to the allowed categories, I\u2019ll keep it simple and concise. I\u2019m going to format it like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nAlright, that seems clear and direct\u2014no extra commentary needed!"
