The text mentions a second monitor setup and checking with a colleague where the cable worked fine. It seems the core issue revolves around a damaged cable, suggesting a hardware problem. While \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could also fit, \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate category. I'll prepare a JSON output with the category clearly defined.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nThe prompt is asking me to categorize an IT ticket, and I'm expected to provide a JSON object that includes a category string. The schema clarifies that my response should contain just the category field with one of the specified strings. I'll output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI need to make sure it's just that without any extra commentary. So, I'll focus on delivering exactly what\u2019s asked without any additional text or context."
