I\u2019m considering categories like \"Internal Project\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nSince it seems related to project management, \"Internal Project\" appears to be the most fitting category. However, \"Administrative rights\" might also apply if granting access is involved. Overall, I think \"Internal Project\" will be the best fit here.**Clarifying ticket categories**\n\nThe ticket includes \"approve holiday requests,\" which is HR-related but is categorized under IT. I see that \"HR Support\" is indeed among the allowed categories. The ticket's content mentions assigning team members to a project, which aligns with \"Internal Project,\" while the holiday requests could fit under \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights\" if access is needed. Given the primary action is about assigning members to a project, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit overall.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
