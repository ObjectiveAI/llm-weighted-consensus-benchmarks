While \"Access\" might relate to user groups and authentication, this ticket focuses on the physical setup. I\u2019m also considering \"Hardware\" due to the equipment involved, but it feels broader to choose \"Internal Project.\" Typical IT ticket categorizations often need clarity, so I\u2019m weighing my options carefully.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nIf I'm asked to categorize, I'd go with \"Internal Project\" because it best reflects that this is a project requiring planning. I need to create a concise response in JSON format for the category. The prompt involves categorizing an IT ticket and needs to return a category object. I'll ensure the casing matches exactly: \"Internal Project\" with the correct spacing. The output should be strictly:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nNo extra text; just the category. Let\u2019s proceed with that!"
