The repeated mention of \"unable to access\" and the context of needing to fix things hints that it's related to access, particularly remote access. Given the circumstances, I think the appropriate category would be \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the category field value.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket and respond with a JSON object formatted correctly. The category options include \"Access,\" which fits well since the user mentions \"unable to access\" and \"working remotely next week.\" While I briefly considered \"Administrative rights,\" it seems more about general access. So, I'll stick with \"Access\" for my final response. I\u2019ll output the JSON object directly as required, keeping it clear and straightforward. Here\u2019s the response: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
