It seems to describe a new purchase order and issues related to receipts and video links. There\u2019s mention of log allocation after receiving the ordered item, indicating it\u2019s about procurement. The available categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Purchase,\" among others. Since it clearly focuses on procurement and receipts, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Purchase\" and format the response as a JSON object.**Formatting JSON for IT ticket**\n\nI see that I need to respond with a JSON object while categorizing the IT ticket. The schema indicates that the category must be one of the predefined enum values, such as \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. Since the ticket is about procurement with clear terms like \"purchase order,\" it fits into the \"Purchase\" category. I\u2019ll ensure the output is strictly formatted as valid JSON: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}` with proper double quotes. No extra commentary needed here!"
