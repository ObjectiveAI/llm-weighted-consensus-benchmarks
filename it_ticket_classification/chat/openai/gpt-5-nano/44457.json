Alternatively, it could be \"Administrative rights\" if they're specifically referring to admin access. So, I think I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" for now.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nSince the user wants to remove someone, it seems related to access management. The message, \"please remove from our systems did join but receiving about him,\" is poorly constructed, but it suggests they want to de-provision a user. \n\nI\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" \n\nNow, responding with the required format, I will provide a JSON object that simply states: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to make sure there\u2019s no extra text, just the JSON. Let\u2019s do that!"
