The text seems to request help with a \"new starter\" form, making it likely relevant to HR Support. It mentions something about \"filling out a starter form,\" which suggests it's tied directly to onboarding a new employee. The other categories I can choose from include Hardware, Access, Storage, and more, but this feels clearly HR-related.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user is asking to categorize an IT ticket. Considering the attached message mentions \"new starter\" and a request for help with onboarding, it likely falls under \"HR Support.\" However, there's also a mention of permissions and access, which leads me to wonder if \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" might apply too. The categories provided include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and a few others. I need to carefully choose the most fitting category for this ticket.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket refers to \"new starter\" and requests help filling out a starter form, which suggests onboarding a new employee. It contains legal language typical in emails, but the focus seems to be on getting assistance with the form itself. Given that this is primarily related to onboarding, I believe it fits best under the \"HR Support\" category rather than something like Access or IT hardware. It\u2019s clearly about administrative tasks involving new starters.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions helping with a \"starter form,\" which makes it unclear if it fits better in \"Access\" or another category. It seems like a request for assistance with onboarding\u2014usually under \"HR Support.\" While onboarding often involves access provisioning too, this ticket specifically addresses the starter form. So even though it\u2019s in an IT context, the \"HR Support\" category feels like the most appropriate choice. Now, I\u2019ll respond with a clear structure to finalize it!**Producing JSON output**\n\nThe task is to categorize the IT ticket using a specific JSON format, and I've decided \"HR Support\" is the best fit. The requirements ask for a JSON object format like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll avoid any extraneous text, focusing solely on delivering the object with the category value. So, I\u2019m ready to respond by producing: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Let's keep it clear and to the point!"
