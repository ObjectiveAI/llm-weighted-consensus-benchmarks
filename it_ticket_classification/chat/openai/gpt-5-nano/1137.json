The message is a bit garbled with mentions of cables and video, but it seems to revolve around hardware issues. Keeping the provided categories in mind, my best guess is to classify this under \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll output that in JSON format correctly with the category field specified. Let's go with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Categorizing Equipment Issues**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether the problem is with hardware or collaboration tools, especially since the message mentions screen sharing and connected cables. It seems likely to fall under the \"Hardware\" category since it's about equipment status. However, if it's an access issue preventing screen sharing, it might also fit under \"Access.\" But the focus on equipment status leads me to conclude it's a hardware issue. I\u2019ll format my output as JSON: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
