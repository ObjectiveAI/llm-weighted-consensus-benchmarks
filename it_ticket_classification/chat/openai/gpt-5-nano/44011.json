It mentions issues with not receiving approvals, rejected requests, and a need for help with finding another entrance for approvals. This sounds like it pertains to access controls and permissions. I could classify it under \"Access,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll have to weigh these options carefully to choose the right category.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket focuses on access approvals and mentions details like \"notification tool\" and needing \"another entrance for approvals.\" This suggests it falls under the \"Access\" category due to its nature of dealing with access requests and potential security concerns. While \"Administrative Rights\" is also a possibility, \"Access\" seems to fit best. I think I'll output the JSON object with \"category\": \"Access,\" keeping it concise. Adding justification might not be necessary here, so I'll just follow the format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
