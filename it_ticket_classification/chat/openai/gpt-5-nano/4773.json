There are also mentions of a board, email digests, and privileged information. Given the mix of requests and topics, it\u2019s tricky to pin down a specific category for this IT ticket. I need to extract the key themes from this text to accurately determine how to classify and address the issues mentioned!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis request is about a \"password reset for external clients,\" which fits under the \"Access\" category. It may also touch on \"Administrative rights\" if it's about requesting accounts, but primarily it focuses on password resets and account credentials for users on a board. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and format the response as a JSON object to meet the requirement. The expected output will simply be {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text. Let's make sure it\u2019s precise!"
