The text mentions a \"new purchase order,\" \"patch cord,\" and \"drive,\" among other terms. It seems like it involves logging an installation and discussing mandatory receipts related to the order. Given the key terms, I think the best category would be \"Purchase\" since the user is discussing new items they're ordering and the associated logistics.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI think I should categorize the IT ticket as \"Purchase\" since it focuses on a new purchase order, receipts, and related items. While \"Hardware\" could apply because it mentions patch cords, the main task seems to emphasize processing the order and installation logging. So, I'll go with \"Purchase,\" which reflects the essence of the request. I'll format my response as a JSON object, including just the necessary category field, like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
