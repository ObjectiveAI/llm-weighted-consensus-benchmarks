The text mentions \"updated start dates\" and \"Colombia starters,\" which makes me think it's about onboarding employees. I'm considering whether it fits best under HR Support, Administrative rights, or even Access, but HR Support seems the most appropriate since it's clearly about employee start dates. It's important I pick the best-fitting category to ensure proper handling!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe content suggests they want to update start dates for employees in Colombia, as they started on a different date than initially stated. It looks like an Administrative task related to HR onboarding. The best fitting category here seems to be \"HR Support.\" Since it's one of the allowed categories, I can respond with a JSON object indicating this. So, I'll format my output as:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"} \n\nThat should do the trick!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
