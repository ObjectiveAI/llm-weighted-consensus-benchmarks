The ticket mentions \"kudos alerts are generated twice,\" indicating a potential software notification issue rather than anything hardware or access-related. It doesn't fit storage, purchase, or HR categories. I think it could fall under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project,\" with \"Miscellaneous\" being a more general option.**Classifying the ticket**\n\nWhen classifying this ticket, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to fit best, especially since it addresses a bug where kudos are generated twice. It could also be categorized as \"Internal Project\" if it's related to an internal system, but it appears more general. The ticket isn't related to administrative rights, HR support, access, storage, purchase, or hardware. Since the issue is about the kudos alerts system, \"Miscellaneous\" is likely the most appropriate choice.**Deciding on ticket classification**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out how to categorize this IT ticket describing duplicate kudos alerts. It could fit \"Internal Project\" since it pertains to a software feature within the internal system. However, \"Miscellaneous\" is a safer choice if I\u2019m unsure. The user is asking for a classification, and the categories are fixed. The issue doesn\u2019t relate to hardware or storage, so if I need to be precise, I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" to address the bug in the system.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
