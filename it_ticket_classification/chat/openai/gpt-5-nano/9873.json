I\u2019ll format my output as a JSON object with the chosen category.**Deciding on the ticket category**\n\nI'm weighing the options for categorizing the IT ticket. The categories include \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Internal Project,\" which may fit since it concerns Slack integration and pull request notifications. \"Miscellaneous\" could also be a safe option if it's too generic. The list seems specifically for IT requests, and since it's not exactly about hardware, HR, storage, or purchase, I'll lean toward making a straightforward choice, possibly classifying it as \"Miscellaneous\" unless I see a stronger fit.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"pull request notifications on Slack\" suggests there's a CI/CD integration, pointing toward an \"Internal Project\" category since it relates to internal tools. I\u2019m considering between \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" The user's message is a bit cryptic, but they seem to want Slack notifications for pull requests and possibly to assign them through Slack. Given the context, \"Internal Project\" feels more appropriate since it's linked to DevOps and internal project management. I\u2019ll prepare a JSON output with that category.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI believe \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category for the Slack notification integration related to pull requests. I\u2019ll go ahead and use that choice. My response will be a JSON object like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nIt seems the format really just needs the category, and there's no necessity for additional notes or explanations since the task is to categorize. So, I\u2019ll keep it concise and stick to just providing the JSON object!"
