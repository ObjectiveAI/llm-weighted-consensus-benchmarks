It's a bit unclear, but it strongly implies it relates to hardware, likely a USB or power adaptor. Since the ticket states, \"adaptor needed today,\" the best category appears to be Hardware. It could also fit under Purchase if it involves buying one. I'll focus on placing it in the Hardware category.**Classifying IT Requests**\n\nThe content of the ticket clearly indicates urgency with phrases like \"adaptor needed today\" and requests for help. It suggests they need an adaptor urgently, possibly looking to borrow or expedite a purchase. I\u2019m leaning towards classifying it as \"Hardware\" since it's about a physical device, but \"Purchase\" could also work if they aim to buy it. Since \"adaptor\" is mentioned, labeling it as \"Hardware\" makes sense for routing to the appropriate IT team.**Categorizing IT Requests**\n\nThe wording \"Adaptor needed today\" indicates it's a hardware request, which makes me think it fits best under the \"Hardware\" category. I need to produce it in the specified format, which means returning a JSON object with the \"category\" field. It's crucial that I stick to the instructions and only present the necessary information, without any extra text. So, the final response will simply be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
