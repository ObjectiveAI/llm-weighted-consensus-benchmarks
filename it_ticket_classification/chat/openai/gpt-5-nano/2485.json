The message isn't well-formed, but I need to categorize it into one of eight IT-specific categories. Since it's about onboarding a new starter in Bucharest, it likely fits under \"HR Support.\" However, it could also be \"Access\" if it's related to providing systems access by date. I might suggest asking for clarification too. Ultimately, it seems best to categorize it as \"HR Support.\"**Assigning the right category**\n\nI'm considering whether to categorize the request as \"Administrative rights\" since that could apply if they needed admin access. However, the text doesn\u2019t mention anything about admin rights. Given that it relates to onboarding, I\u2019ve decided to categorize it under \"HR Support.\" Now, I'll format our response in JSON, as required. The output will look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It feels nice to have a concise answer ready!"
