Each category has specific meanings, so I\u2019ll make sure to consider the specifics of the ticket to choose the most appropriate classification. Let's get this right!**Analyzing User Input**\n\nThe user provided a long string of words that mentions several key topics: graduates, ad accounts, joiners, new starters, credentials, referees, and feedback. It seems like they might be discussing onboarding new graduates, possibly related to administrative tasks and account management. I'll need to break down this input more clearly to identify its purpose and determine if any specific actions or responses are required based on this information. It's important to clarify the key points!**Categorizing Account Requests**\n\nThis seems to be related to ad accounts and user account provisioning for new starters. I need to decide whether this falls under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context of \"new starter accounts,\" \"ad accounts processed,\" \"credentials,\" and \"joiners,\" it definitely fits in the \"Access\" category. Administrative rights pertain to elevated permissions, which don't apply here. I'll format my final output as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"} with no additional commentary to keep it clear."
