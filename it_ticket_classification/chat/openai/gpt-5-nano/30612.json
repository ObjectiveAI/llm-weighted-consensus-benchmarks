It mentions something about a \u201cnew starter access card\u201d and enabling access for Friday PM. It also talks about a starter form and induction, which makes me lean towards \u201cAccess\u201d as the appropriate category. However, if it involves administrative rights provisioning, I might consider \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d as well. It seems clear that access is the main focus here.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm looking at this IT ticket detail which mentions a \"new starter access card,\" \"induction,\" and \"starter form.\" It appears to be focused on provisioning access for a new starter, so I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category since it's all about the access card. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if there were specifics about admin rights, that's not clear here. So I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" and return a JSON object formatted like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
