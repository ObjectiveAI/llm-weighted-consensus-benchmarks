The user mentions a \"ServiceNow report query,\" along with a Tuesday PM reporting issue and confusion about an empty metric bar graph. This sounds related to a report problem. I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" because it doesn\u2019t neatly fit in other categories like \"Hardware\" or \"Access.\" It seems more about understanding or troubleshooting a report, rather than being an access issue.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think this ticket could fit into \u201cInternal Project\u201d if it's part of a project. While \u201cSoftware\u201d isn't listed as a category, I considered \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d if they need permissions. The mention of an empty metric bar graph in the report implies it's not related to storage or purchase either. Given that it\u2019s primarily a reporting issue, I\u2019m inclined to categorize it as \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d since it seems non-specific and doesn\u2019t fit into any other categories clearly.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m ready to finalize my decision to categorize this ticket as \"Miscellaneous.\" The justification is straightforward: it involves a ServiceNow report issue where the bar graph metrics show empty, and they\u2019re seeking help to understand the report. Now, per the user's request, I need to output this in a specific JSON format. I'll create the JSON object with the category value like so: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Just keep it simple and stick to the format!"
