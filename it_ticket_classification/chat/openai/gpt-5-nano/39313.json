The message references forward emails and attachments, likely related to an email blocking or anti-spam list. It mentions adding individuals to a block list and seems a bit incoherent overall. I\u2019m considering that the closest categories might be Administrative rights or Access, but it could also fall under Miscellaneous. It\u2019s tricky!**Classifying Block List Request**\n\nI\u2019m considering how block lists relate to access and security, particularly in email spam filtering. I have categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Administrative rights, and more. The user\u2019s request to \"add co to block list\" seems focused on access control, blocking a domain or email, so it could fit under Access. While Administrative rights typically deal with elevating privileges, this is more about restricting access. Still, \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option if the message is too unclear. I think Access is the best choice!**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI need to produce a JSON object with a category property, following the required format. The user\u2019s request involves categorizing an IT ticket, and I need to return a specific category value from the provided options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and so on. \n\nSince \"Access\" is one of the valid options, I\u2019ll output simply as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The format is clear, so I\u2019ll stick to just presenting the JSON without any extra commentary. That keeps it clean!"
