It\u2019s a bit jumbled, but I can clearly see that it relates to a dashboard update focused on complaints, so I should categorize it accordingly.**Deciding the category**\n\nI'm evaluating the best category for this IT ticket. The options are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Administrative rights, Internal Project, Storage, Purchase, and Miscellaneous. Given that it's discussing an update to a dashboard widget, it could fit as either \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It seems like a part of an internal process, so I'll go with \"Internal Project.\" \n\nNow I need to format this as a JSON object, which should include the chosen category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
