The ticket text is a mix of emails mentioning \"codes,\" \"forms,\" \"latest version template,\" and \"cost recovery.\" It sounds like a common internal project-related task, but I'm thinking it might fit better under Internal Project since it seems to focus on creating forms and templates rather than administrative rights.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket and considering which category it fits in. \"Internal Project\" seems most suitable since it involves tasks related to a new project, like forms, codes, and cost recovery. \"Administrative rights\" isn't relevant here, and \"Miscellaneous\" is for unclear tasks, which doesn't apply. \"Purchase\" could work if it involved costs for hardware, but it doesn\u2019t. Based on all this, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and prepare a JSON object for output.**Preparing the JSON output**\n\nIt looks like I need to output a JSON object for categorizing the IT ticket. The correct format seems to be to include specific keys and properties as outlined in the schema. To be safe, I\u2019ll prepare the response as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} since that directly matches the category identified. I want to keep it simple and concise, ensuring that I\u2019m following the guidelines without including any unnecessary text or personal data."
