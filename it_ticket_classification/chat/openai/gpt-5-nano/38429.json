I\u2019m considering categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" or maybe \"Miscellaneous.\" There\u2019s also \"Access,\" but I think this might fit better under \"Internal Project.\"**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI believe \"Internal Project\" is the best fit here since it seems like a ticket related to building or adjusting Oracle reports for holiday task entries, particularly with design lead approval. However, \"Miscellaneous\" might be apt for unclear tickets. Maybe I should consider asking the user for more details? The prompt requires me to respond in JSON format with the exact category name. So, I\u2019ll go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nThis way, I'm sticking to the required format!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
