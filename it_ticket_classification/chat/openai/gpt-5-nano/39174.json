It mentions problems like duplicate responses and notifications for incidents. None of the provided categories are a perfect fit, but I think \"Miscellaneous\" could work since it's about survey invite duplication. Alternatively, if it relates to our internal survey system, \"Internal Project\" might be more appropriate. Ultimately, I\u2019ll choose between those two based on the context.**Formulating a JSON response**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to create a JSON object with a category field. The options I have are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the ticket details relate to surveys and invites but don\u2019t perfectly fit \"Internal Project,\" I think \"Miscellaneous\" is a safer choice. I\u2019ll format the response correctly as a JSON object:\n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}}. \n\nMy final output will be:\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Clarifying JSON output**\n\nI need to focus on outputting just the actual object and not the schema wrapper this time. The instructions specify that the response should be the JSON object, which in this case is {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. The schema indicates that the outer object includes details about the type and properties, but for my response, I only need to provide the actual data. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll deliver: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Concise and to the point!"
