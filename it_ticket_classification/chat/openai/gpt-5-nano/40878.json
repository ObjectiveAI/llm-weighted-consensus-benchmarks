The message discusses network connection issues that are affecting a small number of users, particularly on both laptops and mobile phones. Since this relates to connectivity, it seems most fitting to categorize it under \"Access.\" I\u2019ll ensure that the choice reflects the context of the problem the user is experiencing. Let's go with \"Access\" for the ticket!**Parsing network issue**\n\nI\u2019m parsing the message about network connection issues. It mentions problems with laptops and mobile phones being connected, and there's a note about \"outputs might be useful,\" which is a bit unclear. The issue affects only a small number of users but suggests that most employees use cables, implying potential hardware involvement. However, since it primarily concerns network access, I think it best fits the \"Access\" category. Yes, that\u2019s the right choice!**Categorizing network access issue**\n\nIt seems right to categorize this as a network access issue. The user mentions \"issues while connected\" and that \"most employees use cables,\u201d which hints at wired connections. Therefore, I\u2019ll classify this as \"Access.\" I need to ensure my response follows the required JSON format. The system expects an object with a category field, and I believe I'll output:  \n{\"category\":\"Access\"}. I should make sure it fits completely with the expected schema!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
