It mentions phrases related to job postings, templates, and resources, along with a request for help from a recruiter. Given the context, it could fit in the Access category due to possible login issues, or it might be related to an Internal Project, especially since it includes a reference to \"Be More Temples.\" Let\u2019s finalize the appropriate category!**Interpreting user request**\n\nIt seems like \"be more temples\" might actually refer to \"Be More Templates.\" The user is mentioning problems with accessing this area to create job postings. They seem to be trying to make job postings and are asking for help entering something related to this project or resource area. The phrase \"templates resources area\" suggests they are looking for access to templates for job ads. They definitely seem in need of support!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI believe the ticket should be categorized as \"Access\" because the user is having issues logging in to the job posting system or template resources area. There\u2019s also the mention of needing \"Administrative rights\" for access to admin features, but since the focus seems to be on entering the system, \"Access\" fits best. They mention an \u201cext\u201d for contacting via phone, indicating they are looking for assistance. Let's finalize this with the \"Access\" category in JSON format!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
