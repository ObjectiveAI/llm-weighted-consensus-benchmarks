The ticket mentions a \"faulty keyboard,\" which clearly indicates it's a hardware issue. So, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" Since the user specifically asked for this categorization, I'll respond with a JSON-like object containing the category field as \"Hardware.\" Including a brief reasoning could be helpful too, so I'll think about adding that for clarity. This seems straightforward!**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI need to ensure the category for the IT ticket is one of the specified values. Since this is a \"faulty keyboard\" issue, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll format my output as a JSON object: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. It's important to follow the formatting exactly since the output will be parsed by code. I won't add any extra text, just that exact JSON output. Double-checking everything, I feel confident with this response!"
