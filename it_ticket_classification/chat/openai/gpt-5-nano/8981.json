The ticket refers to a \"new starter\" in Bogota, Colombia, and mentions things like \"completed form,\" which likely relates to onboarding.\n\nI think this situation mainly relates to \"HR Support\" for onboarding processes, or possibly \"Access\" due to references about seating and compliance. I'll finalize that this ticket is likely best categorized under HR Support.**Choosing a Category for IT Ticket**\n\nI'm considering the best category for this IT ticket. It could fit under \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project.\" The ticket mentions \"new starter,\" \"completed form,\" and \"seated,\" which suggest HR onboarding tasks, including forms and seating arrangements.\n\nI think \"HR Support\" is the most suitable choice for onboarding tasks. However, I need to provide the category in JSON format. So, my output will be: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. This matches the schema requirement!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
