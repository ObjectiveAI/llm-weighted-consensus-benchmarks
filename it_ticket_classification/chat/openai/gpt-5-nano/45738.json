It mentions a monitor going down randomly for weeks, which impacts customer interactions in Frankfurt Main. Given the potential categories available, I see \"Hardware\" is the most fitting since it's about the monitor. However, I should also consider whether it could fit into \"Internal Project\" or \"Purchase,\" though it looks primarily hardware-related.**Finalizing Category Response**\n\nAlright, I\u2019m confirming that the issue is indeed a hardware problem related to a malfunctioning screen. The appropriate category for this ticket is \"Hardware.\" I need to respond in JSON format as outlined in the schema provided. Thus, the response will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI should avoid any additional context or extraneous text since the user specifically asked me to categorize the IT ticket. Let\u2019s ensure it\u2019s clear and straightforward!"
