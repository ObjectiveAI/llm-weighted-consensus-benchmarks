I\u2019m thinking that maybe it\u2019s more about scheduling or resource management, though it doesn\u2019t strongly match any specific category. I could categorize it as \"Miscellaneous,\" given that it seems to touch on various aspects. The instruction specifies that I need to output a JSON object with just the category field, so I'll keep it simple and just go with:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}**Outputting category classification**\n\nThe task asks for a JSON object with a \"category\" property, likely just that. The instruction is to \"categorize this IT ticket,\" so I need to respond appropriately. Even though \"Internal Project\" feels safe, the content mainly revolves around meeting rooms, which doesn't fit that. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Hardware\" don't apply, and \"Access\" isn't quite right either. I think \"Miscellaneous\" is a fitting choice, so I'll provide the required JSON structure with no extra information:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
