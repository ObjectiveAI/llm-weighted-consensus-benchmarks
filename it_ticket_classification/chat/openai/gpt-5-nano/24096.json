There\u2019s a mention of \"double deleted,\" which might indicate accessing deleted information. However, it might also relate to \"Administrative rights\" if they\u2019re requesting admin access. I\u2019ll need to prepare a JSON with the appropriate category field for this.**Deciding the category for IT ticket**\n\nI need to output a JSON object with a \"category\" string restricted to specific categories. The user's mention of \"oracle user help\" likely points to \"Access,\" which covers issues related to user access to Oracle accounts. Alternatively, it could be \"Administrative rights\" if they're asking for elevated privileges to restore the user. However, it feels more accurate to go with \"Access\" since they mainly need help with access rather than explicitly requesting rights. \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option if things are unclear, but \"Access\" is definitely the best choice here.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
