It seems they\u2019re saying they can scroll to view other dates but not one, and there's an issue they\u2019re trying to fix. I need to make sense of this to categorize it properly.**Interpreting IT ticket issue**\n\nI\u2019m dealing with a problem where Oracle time card details aren\u2019t visible in Safari on macOS. The message says that while the card details can be viewed, there\u2019s one specific day where they\u2019re not showing. It mentions scrolling through other days without issue. This gives me a clear idea that this is likely a software compatibility issue with the Oracle time card application when using Safari. I\u2019ll categorize it as a software issue related to web compatibility.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m trying to decide how to categorize this ticket. It could fit into \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project.\" It definitely isn\u2019t related to hardware or purchasing. \"Access\" seems like it could work since the issue involves viewing details, but it's more of a UI problem in Safari. Since there's no \"Software\" category, I'll likely go with \"Miscellaneous.\" The ticket appears to be about a bug in the Oracle time card app, rather than an internal project.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
