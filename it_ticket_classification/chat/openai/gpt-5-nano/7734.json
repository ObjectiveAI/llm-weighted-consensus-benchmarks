I need to categorize this ticket accurately. \"Internal Project\" seems like the most appropriate choice since it relates to a project staging. I also considered \"Access\" for any access permissions, but the ticket doesn't explicitly ask for that. So, I'll go with \"Internal Project\" and respond with the appropriate JSON format.**Finalizing the IT Ticket Response**\n\nI might want to add a brief note, but the format specifically requires just the category object. The instructions clearly say, \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" so I need to stick to outputting only the JSON. I'll provide {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} since it fits the schema requirements. It looks valid since it\u2019s an enum value. I should keep it straightforward and avoid extra commentary. I\u2019ll finalize my output as a JSON-like object, so here it is: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
