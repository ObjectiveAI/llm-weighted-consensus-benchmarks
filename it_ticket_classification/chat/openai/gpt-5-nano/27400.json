It seems like the user is having trouble with their TV remote and device settings, with a stuck mode/source button causing problems each morning. This definitely relates to physical equipment. While I could consider it \"Miscellaneous,\" it really fits better under \"Hardware\" since it pertains to a physical device. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as Hardware!**Categorizing IT Ticket Content**\n\nI\u2019m parsing a message about a TV reception issue that mentions problems with the mode/source button being pressed every morning. The user seems to need help fixing this hardware issue related to the TV. Although it might fit into \"Facilities,\" that's not an option. Given the categories provided, \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate choice. I\u2019ll respond with the category in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} and ensure there\u2019s no extra text since the user specifically asked to categorize the ticket.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
