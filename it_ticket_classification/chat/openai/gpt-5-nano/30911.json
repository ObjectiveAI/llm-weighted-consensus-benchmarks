We have several categories: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights.\" Although the user message is a bit unclear, it seems like they are asking to configure a user to access something. I'll note the urgency and ensure that we properly classify the request regarding the setup to avoid confusion later.**Interpreting user request**\n\nThe core request seems to be about configuring user access for \"Hello Order.\" It might be interpreted as needing access to all existing orders. Phrases like \"avoid creating starter procedure\" and \"valid option\" suggest urgency in addressing this matter, possibly relating to access rights. This likely falls under either the \"Access\" category or \"Administrative rights\" if they need admin-level permissions. Overall, it's about enabling a user to view and access all existing Hello Orders.**Choosing the right category**\n\nIt looks like the user request is targeted towards configuring access, which fits well under the \"Access\" category. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if we're granting higher-level permissions, \"Access\" seems more appropriate since it focuses on enabling a user to view existing orders. It's essential to categorize accurately, and I might consider a brief justification later. The final output should be a JSON object containing the category key with the selected category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
