It\u2019s a bit unclear, but since it mentions backups, \"Storage\" seems like a safe choice. However, it could also relate to \"Hardware\" because of the controllers. Lastly, if there's a need for admin access, \"Administrative Rights\" might fit, although there\u2019s no explicit request for that.**Deciding on category**\n\nI believe the best fit for the IT ticket is \"Storage\" since it relates to data storage and backups. \"Server backup\" also pertains to the backup of servers, making it clear that storage encompasses backup and storage devices. The response format requires a JSON object with the category field included. Therefore, I\u2019ll simply output: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} without any extra text, as that's what the user requested. So, let's go with that."
