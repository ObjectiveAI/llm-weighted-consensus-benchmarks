It looks like the ticket is related to onboarding, which points towards \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Access.\" Since it\u2019s definitely about onboarding, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit. I could also consider \"Administrative rights\" if it involves permissions to fill out the starter form, but I think HR Support is more accurate here.**Parsing IT Ticket Request**\n\nI\u2019m parsing the message, and it seems the user is asking for help with an onboarding task related to a \u201cnew starter\u201d and filling out a starter form. There are a few typos, like \"hale,\" which might be a name, and \"ext,\" likely referring to an extension. However, access isn\u2019t explicitly mentioned, so \"HR Support\" feels like the right category. I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format, simply showing the category. \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
