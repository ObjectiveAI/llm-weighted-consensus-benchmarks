The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. It seems like each category serves a specific purpose, so I\u2019ll have to figure out which one fits best for the ticket in question. This should help ensure that tickets are handled by the right team members, making the process more efficient!**Interpreting the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket involves a request for a custom artifact to be added to the local Maven on a specific machine. Due to licensing reasons, the database drivers can\u2019t be accessed through public Maven, so they need to be added manually. The custom artifact is crucial for running jobs related to wallets. Additionally, I\u2019ll need to ensure that the necessary jar file is renamed correctly. It's important to process this promptly for the user's needs!**Categorizing the software request**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the request about artifact management. The options include \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or possibly \"Administrative Rights.\u201d It seems most relevant to go with \"Internal Project\" since it\u2019s a request for adding a custom artifact to the local Maven, which relates to project dependencies. However, if the user needs specific permissions to install the artifacts, it might warrant \"Administrative Rights.\" I may also need to prepare a JSON structure for the category.**Formatting the IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m interpreting the prompt, which specifies that I need to categorize the IT ticket in a JSON-like format. The category field requires a string from specified options. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Internal Project\" since it relates to managing a custom artifact on local Maven, which focuses on software deployment. However, \"Access\" could fit too, as the request deals with manually adding to the Maven repository, possibly needing access rights. But I should choose the most relevant option!**Finalizing the category response**\n\nThe content indicates a need for a custom artifact on the local Maven of a machine, which is clearly a software artifact management request. \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit for categorization since it addresses a project-specific tooling need. I need to respond in the specified JSON format, and the instruction is straightforward, focusing solely on the category. So, I should just output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. No need for additional notes!"
