It seems like the ticket fits into the categories of \"Access,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" or \"Purchase.\" They mention needing a license, likely for software. The mention of installation leans towards access entitlement, so I think \"Access\" is the best fit. However, there's room for \"Administrative Rights\" if it relates more to admin access. Let's go with \"Access\" for now!**Selecting IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking through categorizing the IT ticket, trying to determine if \"Access\" fits best. While \"Purchase\" could work if it requests a license key, it feels more about procurement. If it's for a project, then perhaps \"Internal Project,\" but that\u2019s unclear. The mention of \"Mobile Developer Blvd\" may relate to assets, but I shouldn't focus solely on location. The best choice appears to be \"Access,\" so I\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like category output: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
