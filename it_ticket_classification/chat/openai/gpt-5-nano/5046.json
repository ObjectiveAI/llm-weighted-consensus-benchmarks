The phrase suggests they may want hardware. Given the options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Purchase,\" I think \"Hardware\" is likely the best fit because they're specifically mentioning hardware devices. However, it could also be \"Purchase\" if they mean they're requesting new hardware. I want to ensure I pick the most appropriate category!**Choosing the right IT ticket category**\n\nThe phrase \"request\" suggests the user is asking for monitors and keyboards, indicating a need for hardware procurement. The term \"Internal Project\" doesn\u2019t seem relevant here. The mixed language part, \"si si la client va developer,\" might imply something about the client being a developer, but it\u2019s unclear. Overall, the main focus is the request for hardware, so I think \"Hardware\" is the best category. Alternatively, \"Purchase\" could work, but I believe \"Hardware\" is most appropriate.**Finalizing the IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that \"Hardware\" is the best category for this IT ticket because it clearly relates to the request for monitors and keyboards. While \"Purchase\" could also fit if it were about cost approval, the ticket specifically calls for hardware. Now, I need to respond with the category in the expected JSON format. The expected output is likely: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to deliver it concisely without any extra content."
