They\u2019re dealing with an emergency issue regarding guest connection. It seems that the main focus here is about access to the network for guests. So, I think the right category to choose would be \"Access.\" I\u2019ll send the appropriate classification in a JSON format as per the user's instructions.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nThe system is expecting a specific JSON format for the category response. I need to provide a JSON object with the category field that indicates \"Access,\" as it's the chosen category. The structure must match the expected schema, which has the \"category\" property defined in an object. So my final response will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll keep it clear and concise, avoiding any additional text to prevent any confusion."
