It might involve \"Administrative rights\" if permission is needed, but that\u2019s not clear. \n\nSince this seems to request reporting capabilities, it fits into \"Miscellaneous\" well. The text includes phrases like \"existing schedule basic report\" and \"wants reports exported,\" indicating it relates to the reports feature in the system. However, the best fit appears to be \"Miscellaneous\" for this general request.**Evaluating ticket lines**\n\nI\u2019m checking through the lines provided. It looks like there's a request for \"custom reports only for new services\" and possibly a schedule for Thursday PM. There\u2019s also some confusion with phrases like \"subscribe which wants reports exported.\" I think I could classify this under \"Miscellaneous\" since it doesn\u2019t relate directly to hardware or storage.\n\nIf it's more about a project to generate reports, \"Internal Project\" might fit, but it could also be \"Administrative rights\" if generating reports requires specific permissions.**Classifying ticket submissions**\n\nThe text doesn't specify access credentials, which makes things a bit tricky. Phrases like \"requests incidents reported solved\" and \"total closed tickets\" suggest a focus on reporting. However, since \"Requests\" isn\u2019t a category, I think \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it\u2019s about exporting permissions. \n\nBut my best choice may be to go with \"Miscellaneous\" as a catch-all. I also see that \"Access\" fits if the ticket is about accessing resources, while \"Internal Project\" could work if it's tied to implementing custom reports for new services.**Categorizing IT request**\n\nIt looks like the text includes \"Requests,\" but it's not very clear or helpful on its own. To play it safe, I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s best to categorize this as \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\nI just need to provide the required format, which is a JSON object stating the category. The output should simply be {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I\u2019ll stick to that format since it\u2019s what\u2019s expected and ensures clarity!"
