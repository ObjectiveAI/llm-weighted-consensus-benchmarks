They mentioned issues like \"cannot connect with exchange server\" and reference their laptop restart along with some error screenshots. It seems the main concern is server connection and access. While it could relate to \"Hardware\" due to the laptop mention, the core issue is clearly about access to the server. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\"**Outputting JSON Category**\n\nI need to follow the spec for the category schema and provide a JSON object. The appropriate category based on the user's IT ticket is \"Access.\" Since the instructions indicate I should just respond with the category object, I'll create it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. According to the enum, this is valid, so I'll output it without any extra text or explanation. Keeping it concise is key, so here\u2019s the final output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
