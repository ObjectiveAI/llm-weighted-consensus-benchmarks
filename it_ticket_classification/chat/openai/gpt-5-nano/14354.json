It mentions something about a \"new project,\" some kind of template, and \"highlighted yellow code.\" \n\nSo, I need to figure out which category fits best from a list that includes Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I guess I'll focus on terms like \"project\" and \"template\" to guide my choice.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket is really unclear, but it mentions terms like \"new project code,\" \"template,\" \"attributes,\" and \"entity.\" I'm thinking it might relate to an \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Administrative rights.\" Since they talk about a \"data model change,\" that suggests it could require admin access. The phrase \"via hi teams\" indicates communication through Teams, which adds another layer. I need to decide which category fits best based on these clues!**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nIt seems the ticket is about creating a new project code and setting template attributes, which points to the \"Internal Project\" category. If the user was asking about permissions to create attributes, it could mean \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, it doesn\u2019t clearly request access. The user seems to want help categorizing the ticket instead of fixing it. Given that, I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" since it aligns best with the terms mentioned like \"new project code\" and \"template.\"**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON-formatted category based on the required schema. The prompt asks for a category, and the system instruction outlines a JSON-like schema for it.\n\nSo, I will create a JSON object with the \"category\" field set to \"Internal Project.\" The format will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI think it\u2019s best to stick to just this JSON object since it seems that\u2019s what the app will parse. I\u2019m ready to provide that!"
