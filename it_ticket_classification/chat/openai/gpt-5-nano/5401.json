The category I think fits best is \"Administrative rights\" since it involves disabling scheduled reports and might relate to modifying access settings. However, there are mentions of \"weekly registration reports\" which could lead to confusion. Since the request is about report scheduling in an application, I'll stick with \"Administrative rights.\" I'll create the appropriate JSON structure to return this category.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nThe instruction asks me to categorize the IT ticket. I need to provide the output in a specific JSON format as outlined in the schema. Based on previous tasks, I know I should respond with: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. It's important that I maintain the exact capitalization and spacing as required in the enumeration for this category. So, I'll make sure to output it exactly as: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} without any extra text."
