The user gave a messy text about feedback surveys tied to ticketing, mentioning that surveys are triggered too frequently and asking for further investigation. Since the content is about IT systems, it doesn't fit into categories like hardware. I\u2019ll need to classify it appropriately and output a JSON format.**Deciding on the Category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking this IT ticket likely falls under \"Miscellaneous,\" as it doesn\u2019t neatly fit into the other categories provided. I considered \"Internal Project\" and \"Administrative Rights,\" but they don\u2019t apply here either. The text includes mentions of survey triggers related to logged tickets, and since there's no specific category for \"Surveys\" or \"Feedback,\" \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the best fit. I'll respond with the JSON format specifying the category. \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
