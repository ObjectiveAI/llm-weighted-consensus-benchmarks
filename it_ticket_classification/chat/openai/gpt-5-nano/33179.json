The terms \"rights member default code\" and \"lead\" also contribute to this interpretation. It might fit into either the \"Access\" category or \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll output a JSON object to classify it accordingly.**Categorizing IT ticket details**\n\nI see mentions of \"rights\" and \"default code,\" which may refer to a default password or code. This could imply a request for administrative rights regarding a project's space. Both \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" are viable categories. The text is short, but \"project space access\" seems to lean towards \"Access\" as a general category. Since it includes \u201cdefault code,\u201d it could hint at credentials. I'll go with \"Access\" as the most fitting category and output the corresponding JSON.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nI need to format my response as a JSON object with the key \"category\" and the value representing the selected category. In this case, it will be \"Access.\" I\u2019ll ensure I deliver just the necessary JSON snippet without any extra text, following the platform's format expectations. So, I\u2019ll respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
