The options available include categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The message indicates it's related to a lost device and security processes, but \"Security\" isn\u2019t an option. \"Hardware\" seems most appropriate for the phone itself, while \"Administrative rights\" could relate to device policies.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nIt looks like \"Internal Project\" isn\u2019t relevant, and \"Access\" might not fit since the user wants to wipe a device. Since this involves a lost phone, \"Hardware\" seems to be the closest category for a hardware asset. \"Administrative rights\" could apply if wiping the device requires special permissions, but ultimately, I'll classify it under \"Hardware\" since that aligns best with the lost phone scenario. I'll format my output as a JSON object with \"category\": \"Hardware\".{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
