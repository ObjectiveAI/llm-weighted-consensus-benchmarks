I need to figure out which best matches the task. If the request is about enabling or modifying access, it might fall under Access, but \u201cenable automatic shutdown\u201d suggests it\u2019s a capability rather than directly related to access. The user, being a solution architect, may mean to lean towards Administrative rights. Yet, if it's about a specific internal project like \u201ccaps pilot,\u201d then Internal Project could be the best fit. We need to decide based on policy.**Deciding on category classification**\n\nThe mention of \"every shutdown configured\" implies some ongoing maintenance, but I don't see any clear connections to \"Storage\" or \"Hardware.\" It seems \"Administrative rights\" isn't quite right; it feels more related to permissions. Considering the mention of \"caps pilot\" and \"caps int\" projects, \"Internal Project\" looks like the best fit. The task also indicates a need for a JSON object response, so I\u2019ll structure it correctly as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} without additional explanation."
