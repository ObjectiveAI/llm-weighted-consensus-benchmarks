The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It seems the ticket is about an urgent requisition process, referencing an approval flow. Since \"requisition\" is related to purchasing, I think this ticket fits under the \"Purchase\" category. \n\nI\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the chosen category.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m refining the category for the IT ticket and narrowing it down to either \"Purchase,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" Since the ticket involves a requisition and approval flow, \"Purchase\" seems like the best fit since requisition typically indicates a purchasing request. It\u2019s not about hardware or other irrelevant categories. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object detailing that the category is \"Purchase.\" \n\nSo my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Finalizing Category Decision**\n\nI'm considering the IT ticket and its focus on the procurement process and a possible workflow change. The ticket does mention an \"approval flow for urgent requisition,\" which makes me lean towards \"Purchase.\" While \"Internal Project\" might relate to development tasks, it doesn't fit well here. Given the context of requisition, I\u2019ll finalize the category as \"Purchase.\" \n\nTo keep it simple and accurate, I\u2019ll output the JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
