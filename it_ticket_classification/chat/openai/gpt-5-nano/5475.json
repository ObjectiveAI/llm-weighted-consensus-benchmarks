It seems to involve HR onboarding for contractors, along with requests related to joining and equipment required at a client site. Therefore, I think this ticket likely falls under \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Administrative rights.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user's mention of \"joined tomorrow,\" \"two contractors,\" and \"equipment required\" suggests this ticket relates to onboarding or provisioning hardware. The categories available include \"HR Support\" for onboarding, \"Access\" for user rights, and \"Administrative rights\" for login elevation. \n\nWhile \"Hardware\" could refer to the equipment, the lack of explicit requests for access makes me lean towards \"HR Support\" since it's focused on contractor onboarding paperwork. The phrase about \"two attached starter forms\" confirms it\u2019s HR-related, not IT.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIn the IT ticket taxonomy, the \"HR Support\" category fits best since it handles onboarding forms. The user asked for categorization, and it seems clear this ticket is about \"starter forms\" for contractors and mentions \"equipment required,\" indicating they expect equipment. \n\nEven though \"Administrative rights\" might seem relevant, there are no specific mentions of access rights. While \"Internal Project\" was a thought, it's not applicable here. So, I\u2019ll respond with JSON format: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}` to categorize it appropriately.**Responding with Category**\n\nI need to keep things concise. The instruction specifies responding with the category only. The valid channels indicate that I should output a JSON object with a category field. \n\nSo the correct response is: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`. \n\nI'll definitely make sure to deliver that! Let's proceed with this clear and straightforward answer."
