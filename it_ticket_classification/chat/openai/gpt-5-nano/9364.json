The categories I have to choose from include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the content, it seems best suited for \"HR Support.\" However, there's a possibility of it also aligning with \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" due to the context.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThis ticket is primarily HR-related, so even though I'm considering \"Administrative Rights\" for forms, it seems that \"HR Support\" is the best fit. It's about leave forms and administration, so categorizing it as \"HR Support\" makes the most sense. \"Access\" might apply if it discussed contract management, but it's not really about IT access. However, \"Administrative Rights\" is more about access control, which isn\u2019t relevant here. So, I'll return a JSON object with \"category\": \"HR Support.\"{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
