The text mentions a monitor upgrade request because the current monitor can\u2019t be adjusted. Looking at the predefined categories, it fits best under \"Hardware\" since it specifically discusses a hardware upgrade. While \u201cPurchase\u201d is also an option, it\u2019s more aligned with buying equipment, and this request seems focused on upgrading what they already have. So, \"Hardware\" makes the most sense for this situation.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket, which is about monitor issues. The best fit here is \"Hardware,\" although \u201cPurchase\u201d could apply if it involves acquiring new monitors. The instruction clearly asks for a categorized response in JSON format. The required structure includes a category property, so I\u2019ll declare it like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This seems straightforward, and I'm making sure to follow the exact format needed for clarity and precision."
