The message hints at issues with recovery hardware and data sources. I think \"Hardware\" is a suitable category since it directly mentions the computer and recovery hardware issues. However, \"Storage\" could also be considered due to the mention of recovery points, which relate to backup recovery. Still, the available category is \"Storage,\" not \"Backup.\"**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI think this ticket should be categorized as \"Hardware\" since it relates to a hardware or computer issue. The message talks about data sources and mentions recovery hardware. It seems like a critical alert for a hardware failure, so my final output will be a JSON object specifying the category. The required format is a simple JSON structure without any additional text. I\u2019ll go ahead and provide it as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
