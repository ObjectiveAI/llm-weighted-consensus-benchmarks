The ticket discusses issues related to shared mailboxes, including creating them, adding members, and permissions. I\u2019d say the best fits are \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" due to the focus on permissions and access. I\u2019ll output a JSON format to categorize it accordingly!**Classifying shared mailbox tasks**\n\nI have phrases that clearly revolve around Exchange Admin tasks such as \"create shared mailbox,\" \"add shared mailbox,\" and \"permissions.\" It seems like the best category here would be \"Administrative rights,\" given that these are administrative actions. I see mentions of permissions and managing mailboxes, which reinforces this choice. While \"Access\" could fit for user issues, \"Administrative rights\" feels more aligned. I'll categorize it and prepare to output a JSON-like structure!**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to follow the required output format, which specifies a JSON object with the \"category\" field. Based on the previous analysis, I'll set that value to \"Administrative rights,\" ensuring it\u2019s exactly one of the enumerated strings. The output will look like this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. While I could consider adding a brief justification, the instructions only ask for the JSON object. So, I\u2019ll proceed with just that!"
