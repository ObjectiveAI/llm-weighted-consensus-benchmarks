The user mentions their password is expired and requests help resetting it, along with steps for how to do so. There's some confusion around the phrase \"steps how own.\" It seems like a standard email footer about confidentiality is included too. Overall, my main focus is the user\u2019s request for a password reset and guidance on the steps needed to reset it.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this ticket about a password reset. Since it's an access issue, I\u2019ll classify it under the \"Access\" category. The output should be a JSON object with \"category\": \"Access.\" The prompt provided asks for this format, so I\u2019ll ensure it conforms to the schema given. I\u2019ll respond with {\"category\":\"Access\"} while keeping sensitive information secure and avoiding any unnecessary details.**Finalizing IT Ticket Response**\n\nThe ticket includes a lot of legal boilerplate, but it's not harmful, so I can proceed. My response should simply be the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"} because \"Access\" is indeed one of the allowed categories from the provided list.\n\nSince the instructions mention avoiding extra text, I\u2019ll make sure not to include any unnecessary commentary. The user is looking for a straightforward classification, so I\u2019ll respond directly with the category they requested."
