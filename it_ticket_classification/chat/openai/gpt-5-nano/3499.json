The user mentioned \u201cnew starter\u201d and \u201cinduction,\u201d which makes me think it could relate to HR Support or possibly Administrative rights. It\u2019s a bit garbled, so it's unclear, but the mention of a \u201cstarter form\u201d is a good clue. I\u2019ll lean towards HR Support since that seems the most relevant here.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm processing this IT ticket, and it seems related to HR onboarding. The phrases like \"new starter\" and \"induction\" make me lean towards \"HR Support\" or maybe \"Access\" because it could involve identity access provisioning. The user\u2019s mention of an \"attached empty part\" suggests there's a document they need help completing. While \"Administrative rights\" might fit, HR Support aligns best with onboarding tasks. So, I think I'll categorize this ticket as HR Support, given its focus on induction for a new starter.**Outputting category as JSON**\n\nI realize there's no mention of access or account-related tasks in the text; it focuses on \"starter form induction.\" While it could hint at \"Administrative rights\" for the new user, that isn't clear. Therefore, I'll go with \"HR Support\" instead. The response format requires a JSON object specifying the category. So, I need to keep it concise and provide just this: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`. Let's output that directly!"
