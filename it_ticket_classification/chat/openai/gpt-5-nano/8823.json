Since it's focused on backup storage and hardware failure, both categories could apply, but I'll likely lean toward \"Storage\" given the context. I need to ensure the JSON object reflects this categorization.**Categorizing storage issues**\n\nThe user reports a backup storage error, mentioning a hard drive and the need to run tests on its status. This suggests a hardware failure affecting the backup storage. I need to decide between \"Hardware\" and \"Storage\" categories. Since the issue concerns a disk with bad sectors specifically related to backup storage, \"Storage\" is the most fitting choice. I'll categorize the ticket as \"Storage\" and prepare to output the information in a JSON format with the category field.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
