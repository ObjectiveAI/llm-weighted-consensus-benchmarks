However, it could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" if it's specifically about granting access. Ultimately, I think the best match is \"Access,\" so I'll prepare to output a JSON object with that category.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the phrase \"access required attached,\" which could suggest they want access to an attached file, but it isn\u2019t totally clear. The category options are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" If it's related to accessing systems or resources, then \"Access\" fits best. Since they mention \"stated locations,\" it sounds like they want general access, not privileges, so I'll go with \"Access.\" I\u2019ll prepare a JSON output like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s important to format this correctly!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
