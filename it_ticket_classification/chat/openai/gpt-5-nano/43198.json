This seems to indicate a software issue, possibly related to viewing details in the system. I\u2019m considering the categories: \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project.\" With the content focusing on a blank field, it seems to fit better in \"Miscellaneous\" since it isn't strictly hardware or access-related. Now I just need to finalize that choice!**Choosing ticket category**\n\nThe user mentioned logging another ticket related to a location field displaying blank in the ticketing system. This seems to be a bug since adding a location filter also shows blank. It\u2019s clear this is more of an application issue than a hardware problem. I think the best fit for categorization is \"Miscellaneous\" since it doesn't neatly fall into other categories like \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" So, \"Miscellaneous\" it is!**Formulating JSON response**\n\nI need to provide a JSON object specifying the category as \"Miscellaneous.\" The system expects this output format, so I\u2019ll keep it simple. The instruction indicates that the output must be a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. While I could add a note about it being a software issue related to the ticketing system, the guidelines say to return only the JSON. So, I\u2019ll simply respond with: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
