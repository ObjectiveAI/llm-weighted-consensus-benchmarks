It's a bit garbled, but it seems to reference \u201cAMP high CPU usage.\u201d I'm wondering if \"AMP\" is software. The user mentions experiencing problems after updates, particularly with high CPU usage when installing node packages. They also mention their laptop freezing and refer to an attached picture. It sounds like they want advice on how to prevent this recurring issue.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm given a list of categories to use, including Hardware, HR Support, and Access, among others. The user's ticket concerns performance issues due to software (AMP) and Node.js dependencies. There's no specific \u201cSoftware\u201d category, which complicates things. \"Miscellaneous\" seems fitting because it's not a clear fit elsewhere. I wonder if \"Internal Project\" applies since it mentions a senior developer, but that feels ambiguous. Ultimately, I need to categorize the ticket appropriately for triage purposes.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI need to provide a JSON object that categorizes the issue from the user's ticket. The best choice seems to be \"Miscellaneous,\" as the problem relates to software rather than hardware. Although \"Internal Project\" could apply since it mentions a dev environment and potentially \"AMP,\" the focus is on CPU usage from software. This suggests it isn't a hardware issue. So, I'll stick with \"Miscellaneous\" and output the object as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} without adding any extraneous text."
