The ticket mentions issues with a mobile phone battery, which suggests it belongs in the \"Hardware\" category since it concerns device issues. While there\u2019s an indication about ordering, it directly relates to the hardware problem rather than procurement or administrative tasks. So, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll ensure to respond with the category in the required JSON format for clarity!**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the \"category\" key, following the provided schema. The correct response should look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} with an exact string \"Hardware\" and a capital \"H.\" \n\nWhile the user mentioned ordering options, the primary issue is the mobile phone battery itself. So I'll classify this as \"Hardware\" since it directly relates to the device issue. Multi-label assignments could add \"Purchase,\" but since the request is to categorize the ticket, I'll stick with the main category of \"Hardware.\"**Delivering JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with just the JSON object to indicate the category. The instruction is clear: I should only output the relevant information without any extra text. So, my response will simply be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} with no additional formatting or explanation. It's essential to keep it straightforward and exactly as specified. Let's ensure that it's clean and concise!"
