The text mentions a new starter in Bogota, forms, a senior engineer joining, and a compliance officer. Given the onboarding context with \"completed form\" and \"HR support,\" it seems clear this is an HR-related ticket. So, I\u2019m leaning towards classifying this ticket under the \"HR Support\" category for accuracy. It just fits the situation best!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\" The user\u2019s text mentions \"form completed,\" \"compliance officer,\" and a \"new starter,\" which suggests it's part of an HR onboarding process. It seems that \"HR Support\" fits best here. I need to respond using the correct format, outputting a JSON-like object with \"category\": \"HR Support.\" Let's stick to this clear structure with no extra text! Here\u2019s how it looks: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm weighing whether to categorize the ticket as \"Access,\" which relates to granting system access. However, the text doesn't explicitly mention access. It seems more about forms for a new starter and details about compliance and a senior engineer joining. Given that, I think \"HR Support\" is the better fit. So, I\u2019ll prepare the final response in the required format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Keeping it straightforward with no extra commentary!"
