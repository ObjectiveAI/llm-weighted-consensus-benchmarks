I want to make sure that I assess it based on the issue type, urgency, and any specific details provided. It's important to accurately classify it so that it gets routed to the right team for resolution. I should also consider if there's a priority level that needs to be established. This will help ensure a smooth and timely response for the user.**Classifying Garbled Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the user\u2019s text that seems really garbled\u2014lots of mentions about expiration, forms, and ticket submission. It\u2019s a bit confusing, but I know I need to categorize this ticket based on predefined types like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. I\u2019ll have to carefully analyze the content to figure out which category fits best. The main goal is to ensure it's properly classified so that it can be handled efficiently.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm examining the content that mentions \"applications manager,\" forms that should have expired but weren't, and details about creation and due dates. It sounds like the ticket might relate to \"Access,\" since it's about forms still filled out. However, it could also fit \"Administrative rights\" if it's about permission expiration. There\u2019s also a chance it relates to \"Storage.\" I really need to parse these details carefully to pinpoint the right category for effective handling!**Understanding the Ticket Request**\n\nIt sounds like the ticket is about forms that should have expired but are still filled out. The user is asking to log a ticket regarding these forms. They mention specifics like creation and due dates, suggesting there's a need to investigate why these forms remain available even after the expiration. It's important to clarify the context here so I can categorize and address the issue accurately for the user!**Categorizing Access Issue**\n\nI'm determining how to categorize the issue at hand, which seems to revolve around expiration handling or access control. The user mentioned forms that should have expired but were still available, suggesting an access issue. I'm leaning towards categorizing this as \"Access\" rather than \"Administrative rights\" since it's more about the availability of forms post-expiration. The ticket\u2019s content is a bit messy, but \"Access\" feels like the best fit. I'll respond with the JSON format as required."
