I think the best fit would be either \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" I'll format my response as a JSON object, focusing on the appropriate category.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m pondering how to categorize this ticket. It could be \"Administrative rights\" because of the modification request for notifications, but I think it leans more toward a configuration change in ServiceNow. The text is pretty garbled, mentioning \"ServiceNow notifications,\" but it doesn\u2019t relate to hardware, storage, or purchases. \"Internal Project\" might fit since it involves an internal IT task. Overall, I think I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" as this feels somewhat ambiguous, yet it\u2019s the best fit for now.**Choosing a category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the appropriate category for this request. \"Administrative rights\" relates to privilege requests, but that's not relevant here. \"Access\" pertains to login or access control, so it seems off too. \"Miscellaneous\" feels like a safe, generic option, but I might also contemplate \"Internal Project\" if it ties into one. Since the user asked me to categorize, I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous\" and prepare to respond in the required JSON format."
