The options include things like Hardware, HR Support, and Access, but \u201cInternal Project\u201d feels most suitable given that it\u2019s about configuring DNS across zones. So, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON response: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Delivering JSON response**\n\nI should stick to just providing the JSON without any additional text. The system specifically says to respond with the category for the IT ticket, which means the final answer should simply be a JSON object revealing that the category is \"Internal Project.\" Keeping it straightforward is the goal here, so I'll deliver just that. Here goes: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
