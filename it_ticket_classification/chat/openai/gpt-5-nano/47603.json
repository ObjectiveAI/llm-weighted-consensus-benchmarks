The main issue involves hardware, specifically a computer crashing with a docking station, which usually fits under \"Hardware.\" There's also a mention of purchasing a monitor and replenishing stock, hinting at procurement tasks. I think I should categorize it primarily as \"Hardware,\" with a note about \"Purchase\" for the hardware procurement aspect. But I need to format the output as a JSON-like category object, too.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI see that the system requires a JSON object output for the category, specifically one of the enumerated strings. I believe the best fit is \"Hardware,\" primarily due to the core issue of the hardware crash. While \"Purchase\" is a consideration because of the stock replenishment, the main focus is on hardware. The instruction emphasizes that only one category is allowed, so I'll stick with \"Hardware\" and provide the required JSON output: {\"category\":\"Hardware.\"}**Finalizing category response**\n\nThe ticket primarily concerns a hardware issue with the docking station causing crashes, while the monitor purchase aspect relates more to procurement. Given that the main focus is on hardware, I\u2019m confident that categorizing it as \"Hardware\" is the right choice. I\u2019ll respond with just the required JSON object and skip any additional commentary, as that's what the user needs. Here\u2019s the output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
