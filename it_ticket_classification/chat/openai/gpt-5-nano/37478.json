It involves a workflow issue with an Oracle tool, including steps like clicking cells, filling fields, and dealing with a delete button. This sounds like it could be a bug, so I could label it as \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s specific to the team\u2019s workflow. If it seems more general, \"Miscellaneous\" might fit better. I should carefully review the details to decide.**Deciding on the category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to determine the best category for this IT ticket. It\u2019s definitely not hardware, HR support, or access. It seems to be about a tool where you interact with fields and buttons, possibly indicating a bug. \"Internal Project\" feels appropriate since it\u2019s specific to a workflow issue. There might be a case for \"Administrative rights\" if delete rights are relevant, but since that\u2019s not clearly stated, I\u2019ll stick with \"Internal Project.\" The output format should be a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
