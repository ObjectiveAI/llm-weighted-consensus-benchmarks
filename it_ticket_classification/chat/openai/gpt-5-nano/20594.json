The ticket mentions a license request, which points to it falling under \"Purchase\" since it's about acquiring a software license. I briefly considered \"Access\" and \"Internal Project,\" but \"Purchase\" seems to be the most fitting choice here. So, I'll go with that!**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to create a concise response in JSON format as specified. The format requires a category object with a property called \"category,\" which must be a string. The appropriate value for this situation is \"Purchase.\" I'll be sure to follow the exact format and deliver only the JSON object, just like the requirement states. So, my final output will simply be:  \n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}**Clarifying JSON Output**\n\nI see that the instruction specifies a \"category\" object, but it seems there's confusion about format. In similar situations, I've just used:  \n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}  \nHowever, it appears there's a required structure for the format that includes type and properties. The prompt says to categorize the IT ticket clearly. I want to stick closely to what's needed, so I'll confidently provide:  \n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}  \nNo extra text, just the valid JSON."
