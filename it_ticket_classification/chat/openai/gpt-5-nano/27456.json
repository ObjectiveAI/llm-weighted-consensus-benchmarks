The user's request mentions restoring an Exchange account and that an Active Directory account is disabled. This clearly relates to access management and user account restoration. Based on these details, the most relevant category here is \"Access.\" I\u2019m also considering if \"Administrative rights\" could apply, but it seems primarily about access. I'll need to respond in the required format, ensuring it\u2019s structured correctly.**Formatting the output**\n\nI need to deliver the output as a JSON object based on the specified structure. The key aspect is categorizing the IT ticket, and I\u2019ve determined that the category is \"Access.\" The required format should keep it simple, so I\u2019ll produce the output with just {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nEven though there's a more complex schema provided, the primary goal is to fulfill the request accurately without adding unnecessary details. I\u2019ll make sure to avoid any extra text and stick to the essential JSON format."
