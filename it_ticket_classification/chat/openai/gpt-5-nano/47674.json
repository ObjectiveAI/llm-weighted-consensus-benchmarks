This could relate to \u201cAccess\u201d if it\u2019s about rights or \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d if they need admin privileges to change the approval routing. I'm pondering whether \"HR Support\" or \"Miscellaneous\" might fit, but I'm less sure about those.**Assessing Approvals for IT Ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s message indicates they sent an approval on Monday, but it's still showing the line manager as the approver, and they want that amended. This seems to involve adjusting permissions related to approval routing, possibly fitting under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket likely relates to system configuration or workflow. I\u2019m leaning toward \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d since it changes settings on the workflow, but it could also go under \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d if nothing fits perfectly.**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nGiven the options, I\u2019d select \"Administrative rights\" because the user is involved in the approval process, indicating a need to amend the default approver, who is currently the line manager. This change seems to require modifying workflow settings, which likely involves admin permissions. Although the user doesn't explicitly state they're having access issues, the need to change the approver hints at permission levels. So, \"Administrative rights\" fits best for this scenario as it addresses who can approve changes.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
