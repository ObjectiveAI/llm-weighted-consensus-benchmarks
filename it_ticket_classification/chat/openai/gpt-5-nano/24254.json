However, \"change PM code\" might refer to changing the project manager code. If access changes are needed, it could also fall under \"Access.\" It's important to clarify what each category means in this context!**Analyzing IT ticket details**\n\nI\u2019m breaking down the contents of this IT ticket. It mentions something like \"pm change on project code,\" which sounds garbled, but it's clearly about changing the project manager code. There's also a request for assistance with \u201clogging tickets\u201d and a reminder about an annual survey. It looks like this is an IT ticket aimed at changing the \"pm code,\" which might fit under \"Administrative rights,\" assuming it's about access rights. It's a bit muddled, though!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket since it involves a project code. \"Internal Project\" seems most fitting because it relates to internal tooling. However, if it involves changing the code itself, it could fit under \"Access,\" but it's not about passwords or permissions\u2014just a \"project code.\" Typical IT ticket categories include Access, Hardware, Software, and Network, but here, \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" seems suitable. Since it\u2019s about a change by the old PM, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best choice. I'll prepare a JSON output!**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that has the field \"category\" and matches one of the specified values. It seems appropriate to use {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} since it fits the context of a project code. However, I considered \"Administrative rights\" since it could relate to access changes, but the ticket refers to the \"old PM\" and assistance, which leans me back to \"Internal Project.\" To keep it simple and clear, I'll stick to the required format with no extra text. Here goes! \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
