The details mention CPU cores, operating systems, and storage requirements. Since it's clearly about technical infrastructure, I need to categorize it effectively. It involves purchasing hardware and considerations around server specifications. I think it could fit under Hardware for the server aspect, but it might also belong in Purchase since it\u2019s about acquiring new equipment. Storage is touched upon too.**Categorizing IT request**\n\nFor this ticket, I see that it likely fits into either the Hardware or Purchase category, as it's about requesting a new production server. Storage is mentioned too, but it seems that the core focus is the server's hardware specs. Since it's primarily about acquiring new hardware, I'd categorize it as Hardware. Although it could also relate to Internal Project, the ticket clearly points towards a hardware request. I need to present this in the required JSON format.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to provide a brief justification alongside the category for this IT ticket. The guidelines instruct me to respond with the necessary JSON format. So, I will structure my response to clearly state the category as \"Hardware.\" \n\nI want to ensure the JSON is correctly formatted, presenting just the object without any extra content. I\u2019ll finalize my response in the correct channel, making sure it looks clean and meets the requirements."
