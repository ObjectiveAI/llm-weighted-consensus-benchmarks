The ticket talks about access for systems and mentions adding someone to the Oracle team, along with a shared mailbox. Since it's primarily about granting system access, I could map it to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I'll lean towards the \u201cAccess\u201d category since it seems most relevant to what the user is asking for. Let's finalize that choice!**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nThe content of the ticket seems to request access for adding someone to a team, mentioning a shared mailbox. I think \"Access\" is an apt category since it's about systems access, while \"Administrative rights\" relates more to permissions. The reference to the shared mailbox suggests provisioning is involved. I should respond with a JSON object just stating the category as \"Access,\" so it'll look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Keeping it simple and straightforward!**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI think it's a good idea to consider \"Administrative rights\" since it relates to adding someone to a team and sharing a mailbox. However, the phrase \"access for systems\" feels more general. I still prefer \"Access\" because it focuses on the core need for system access, which the ticket highlights. While some might lean towards \"Administrative rights,\" I'll stick with \"Access\" as it's safer and more direct. I'll respond with {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
