This might fall under HR Support since it mentions payroll issues about hourly versus salary employment. There's also a possible link to Administrative rights regarding permissions related to the Oracle HR module. Given the content, it seems most appropriate to categorize it as HR Support, as it relates to HR matters.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nIt seems the ticket fits into the \"HR Support\" category since it discusses hourly versus salary employment, which relates to HR data. The phrase \"administration officer\" indicates the person involved. I initially considered \"Administrative rights\" due to the Oracle system reference for changing working hours. However, the primary concern is modifying HR/payroll data in that system. So, I lean towards categorizing this as \"HR Support,\" but I will keep \"Administrative rights\" in mind if permissions are needed.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
