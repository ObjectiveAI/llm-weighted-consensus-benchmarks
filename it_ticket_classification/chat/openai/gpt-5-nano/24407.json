This clearly relates to hardware, so \"Hardware\" seems fitting. However, since they're asking about an adapter and potentially making a purchase, \"Purchase\" could also apply. It feels a bit ambiguous!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket clearly needs to be categorized as \"Hardware\" since it involves hardware configuration. It mentions terms like \"adapter,\" \"monitor sizes,\" and \"video card suggestions,\" which fit under the hardware category. I should respond using the required JSON format. The output must be a JSON object with the property \"category\" set to \"Hardware.\" So, the correct response will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI'll make sure there are no extra texts and that everything is formatted correctly!"
