So, I think the most appropriate category is \"Access.\"**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding that the most appropriate category for this ticket is \"Access,\" since it focuses on access issues with a site or application. It could potentially fall under \"Administrative rights\" if there's a password prompt, but access is the main issue here. I need to provide this in the required JSON format. \n\nThe output should look like this: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}},\"category\":\"Access\"}.
