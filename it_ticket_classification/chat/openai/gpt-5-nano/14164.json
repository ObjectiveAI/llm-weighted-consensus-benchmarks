The text seems confusing, but it likely relates to access, given their provided categories. The categories include \"Access\" among others like \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support.\" I think this ticket is about requesting access to something related to \"PM,\" which might mean project management. There\u2019s a request to \"make out link by default.\u201d I'll format my response as JSON, including the \"Access\" category.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI need to classify the ticket, which could fall into \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" depending on the request. The phrase \"access to pm\" makes \"Access\" a strong candidate, as does the request for \"link by default after,\" which might refer to sharing a link. Since the ticket starts with \"access to,\" it seems best to categorize it as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll prepare the output as a JSON object, noting that the \"category\" key will be \"Access.\""
