Based on the ticket content, it's a purchase order request for items like patch cords, cable organizers, and nylon ties. It seems clear that this falls under the Purchase category since it's requesting specific products. I'll ensure it gets logged appropriately for processing.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}**Confirming category for IT ticket**\n\nI need to confirm that there's no need to escalate this request. The user simply asked me to categorize the IT ticket they provided. Based on the content, which mentions a new purchase order and related items, it seems appropriate to classify it as \"Purchase.\" So, I\u2019ll proceed to respond with that category. Everything checks out, and I\u2019m ready to return the answer!"
