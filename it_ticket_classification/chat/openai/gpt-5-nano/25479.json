Given the options provided, I think the most fitting category would be \"HR Support,\" since it clearly relates to HR processes. However, if changing the approver requires access modifications, \"Administrative rights\" could also apply. I\u2019ll categorize it accordingly.**Categorizing IT ticket type**\n\nThe ticket is about changing an annual leave approver, which feels more like an HR or admin workflow. I\u2019m considering if \"Access\" fits since it could relate to the leave approval system, or \"Administrative rights\" if there are permission changes needed. However, since the user's request focuses on the HR process, I think categorizing it as \"HR Support\" makes the most sense. I\u2019ll respond with the category in the required JSON format.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
