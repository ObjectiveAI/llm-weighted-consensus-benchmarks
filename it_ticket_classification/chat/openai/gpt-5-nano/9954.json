It sounds like it relates to some kind of internal process, so I\u2019m considering \"Internal Project\". However, if it involves access rights or template updates, it might also fit under \"Administrative rights\" or even \"Miscellaneous\". So, I'm leaning towards labeling it as an \"Internal Project\".**Deciding on ticket categories**\n\nOkay, let's break down the possible categories for this IT ticket. \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" aren't relevant here. \"Access\" might apply if it concerns access credentials, but the user primarily focuses on creating forms. There\u2019s potential for it to fit under \"Internal Project\" since they want to update templates and create forms, which leans toward project-related tasks. Overall, I think \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category for this ticket.**Creating the JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m ready to craft the answer as a JSON object with the category field. Based on the schema provided, I see that I need to categorize the ticket. The user is looking for a specific category, so I plan to respond with just that label. I think \"Internal Project\" is the most appropriate fit, even though \"Miscellaneous\" could be considered if things were unclear. So, my final JSON response will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, no extra text needed!"
