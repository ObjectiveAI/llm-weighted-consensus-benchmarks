The content suggests it relates to an offboarding process for interns, indicating either HR Support or Hardware categories. It\u2019s focused on retrieving hardware, but since it also discusses leaver interns, it leans more toward HR Support. I should probably select the HR Support category for this ticket given its emphasis on the offboarding tasks.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket revolves around \"hardware retrieval\" for \"leaver interns,\" which seems to point towards an offboarding task. While I could categorize it as \"Hardware\" due to the hardware retrieval aspect, \"HR Support\" also fits because of the bulk leaver form mentioned. Still, the absence of an explicit \"Offboarding\" category means that \"Hardware\" is likely the best choice. I'll format the response as a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That keeps it clear and concise!**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to follow the format requirements for the response, which instructs me to use a JSON object with a category field. The schema specifies that it should be structured as { \"category\": \"Hardware\" }. So, I'll create the output in that format without adding any extra commentary. Just keeping it straightforward! Here it goes: { \"category\": \"Hardware\" }."
