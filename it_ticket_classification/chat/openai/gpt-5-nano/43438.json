The options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket mentions issues with Cacti graphs, specifically empty graphs and unclear links. It doesn\u2019t mention access rights, HR, or hardware issues. It seems more fitting for \"Internal Project\" since it\u2019s about a monitoring/reporting system. However, \"Miscellaneous\" could work too, given the general nature of the issue. I\u2019ll analyze these options.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nIt looks like this issue is primarily related to Cacti configuration. Based on the categories provided, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the most fitting. I'll prepare the final response as a JSON object with the specified format: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nThe instruction specifies a category field, so that\u2019s all I\u2019ll include. I could add a justification for clarity, but the focus is on the categorization, so I\u2019ll stick to just the JSON for now."
