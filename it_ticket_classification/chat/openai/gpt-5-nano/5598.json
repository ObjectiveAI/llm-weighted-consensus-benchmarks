Considering the categories available like Administrative rights, Internal Project, or Access, I think it might fit in either Administrative rights or Internal Project since it's about project management. The phrase \"change owner\" hints towards needing permission changes, making Administrative rights a strong candidate. However, it could also relate to Internal Project because it involves a specific project.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding how to categorize an IT ticket. The content suggests it's related to an access or ownership change, possibly involving an Internal Project. However, it's clear that it's not about hardware, HR, storage, purchase, or miscellaneous issues. Since \"change pm for project\" indicates changing the project manager, it aligns well with the \"Administrative rights\" category in ticketing taxonomy. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. It might be useful to ask for clarification later, but the user seems to just want the category for now.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
