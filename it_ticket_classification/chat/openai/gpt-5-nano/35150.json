The message is quite messy, mentioning trouble with submitting a timecard for the week and possibly removing entries. Given the mention of \"advertising,\" it seems related to HR matters. The categories I have are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the nature of the issue, I think \"HR Support\" fits best.**Parsing ticket for category**\n\nI\u2019m parsing a ticket from a user who\u2019s having trouble submitting their timecard. They mention \"advertising,\" which might indicate a department, but the primary concern seems to be the submission issue and potentially needing to remove entries. Since timecard matters relate to payroll, the appropriate category is likely \"HR Support.\" There\u2019s also a potential for \"Administrative rights\" if they need permissions to modify, but \"HR Support\" fits best. I\u2019ll return this as a JSON object.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
