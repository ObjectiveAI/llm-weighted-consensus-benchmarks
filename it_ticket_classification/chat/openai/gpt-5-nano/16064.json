It could also possibly relate to \"Administrative rights\" if access is needed, but there\u2019s no explicit mention of that in the content provided. Given that the user is looking for a category, I\u2019ll select \"Internal Project.\" It's fitting based on the details given, and I\u2019ll remember to format it as a JSON object with the category field as required.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a straightforward classification task. The instruction is to respond solely with the category in JSON format, specifically for an IT ticket. I'll classify it under \"Internal Project.\" \n\nSo, while the schema includes additional structure, I need to focus on delivering just the classification in the required format. The user is asking for the category only, meaning I should produce: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That's clear and aligns perfectly with what the user needs. So, let's go ahead and output that!**Finalizing the Category Selection**\n\nI need to make sure I use the exact spelling for the category: \"Internal Project\" with a capital \"I\" and \"P.\" It's crucial to be precise here. I have to deliver this without any extra explanation or reasoning, as the user specifically asked for categorization only. \n\nSo, I'll provide just the category in the required format, ensuring it's exactly as specified. Let\u2019s get this right and keep it straightforward!"
