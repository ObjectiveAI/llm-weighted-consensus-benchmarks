The ticket text is quite messy, but it seems to center around the leaver process, user access removal, AD rights, and mailbox issues. Considering all that, it could fit well into the \"Access\" category since it relates to deprovisioning. However, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d is listed separately, so that might be worth considering too.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nIf the ticket focuses on removing access rights when someone is leaving, it could be classified as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" depending on whether they want to change admin rights. The ticket mentions \"AD rights,\" which indicates a need to remove those. However, since the content mostly revolves around deprovisioning tasks like \"roaming profile\" and \"personal mailbox,\" \"Access\" seems like the best fit. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object categorizing it as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
