I'll make sure to properly format it in JSON with the category field included.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize this IT ticket and provide the output in a JSON object format. The appropriate category seems to be \"Access,\" based on the schema provided. Since the output should be just the JSON without any additional text, I'll make sure to format it correctly. It will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI need to ensure there's no extra punctuation or wording. Let's deliver this straightforwardly!"
