The problems seem related to the software build process, which suggests it could fall under either \"Admin rights\" or \"Access.\" However, the specifics about password input and the failed task sequence point more towards operating system installation or deployment issues rather than purely access.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe user's message talks about \"builds\" and issues with a \"loaded image,\" which could point to a failed system or deployment image. There aren't any hardware mentions, but the restarts might hint at hardware or software problems. Given the context, it seems best to categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it relates to development rather than hardware or access concerns. Although \"Access\" could fit if the password input is causing an error, \"Internal Project\" feels more accurate for this situation.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nThe user's message includes a phrase about a password input leading to a failed task sequence and restarts, which seems more about issues in the build environment rather than pure \"Access\" problems. I believe \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category here. I need to respond with a JSON object that matches the format specified. The correct output is: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI should make sure to keep the capitalization and spacing exact, as it aligns with the expected schema."
