The closest options are \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access.\" Since it's not directly about access rights or hardware, \"Miscellaneous\" could fit for general IT issues. The user seems to have connectivity problems related to conference joining, so while \"Access\" might apply, it really doesn\u2019t involve login issues. Without a specific \"Networking\" or \"Telecom\" category, I'll go with \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll respond with the appropriate JSON object format now.**Clarifying JSON Output**\n\nI'm reflecting on how to handle the category schema for this response. The instruction specifies that I should output just the category in standard JSON format, without any additional wrappers. Following the schema, I\u2019ll output a JSON object with a key \"category\" and assign it the value \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the instruction emphasizes minimal verbosity, I'll keep the response concise and focused solely on the category itself. Now, I\u2019m ready to respond with the correct format!"
