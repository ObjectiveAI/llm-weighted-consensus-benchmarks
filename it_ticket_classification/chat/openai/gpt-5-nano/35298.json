Given that the text mentions password issues and urgency, I think \"Access\" is the best category. However, if admin rights are needed to reset the password, \"Administrative rights\" could also work. But generally, a password reset falls under \"Access.\" So, I'll prepare a JSON object with the appropriate category and respond accordingly.**Structuring IT ticket response**\n\nThe system prompts me to categorize an IT ticket and respond with a JSON format. I\u2019ll structure my response neatly as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's important to ensure there\u2019s no extra text, just the JSON as specified. I also need to make sure the quoting is accurate, which is crucial for proper formatting. I'll keep it straightforward and respond precisely as instructed."
