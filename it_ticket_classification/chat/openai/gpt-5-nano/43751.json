This ticket seems to fit into the \"Access\" category, as it\u2019s related to blocking and gaining access. \"Administrative rights\" could also work, but \"Access\" feels like the most accurate choice. I'll classify it in JSON format as instructed.**Producing JSON output for ticket category**\n\nI need to create a JSON object for categorizing the IT ticket. The expected output should be structured like this: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. The user\u2019s request mentions blocking a lost access card and asking about getting a replacement, which aligns perfectly with the \"Access\" category. I just want to confirm that the content indicates a clear need to block and replace the card. I\u2019ll output the JSON object as required."
