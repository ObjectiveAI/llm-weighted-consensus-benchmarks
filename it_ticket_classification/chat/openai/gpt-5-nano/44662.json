The user's description signals an access issue, as they mention being unable to log in with credentials that work for colleagues. Since this is definitely an account login problem, placing this ticket in the \"Access\" category seems to be the best option. I wonder if I should respond with a JSON object according to the category schema?**Crafting JSON output**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket according to the provided schema. The instructions clearly state I should output a JSON object, setting the \"category\" property to \"Access.\" It seems that the system requires the format to be precise, adhering to the casing specified in the enum. I\u2019ll address this carefully. My final output will be a straightforward statement: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}` with no extra text. Alright, let's finalize this!"
