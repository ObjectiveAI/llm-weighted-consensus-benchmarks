They reported it not working and included details like image flickering and checking connections. The relevant categories provided are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given that the issue is related to the extended display and monitor functionality, I will categorize this ticket under \"Hardware.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user's message about the extended display issue is a bit jumbled, but it's clearly focused on a hardware problem with an external monitor. They mention image flickering and residual images, suggesting the monitor likely needs replacement. Therefore, I should categorize this ticket as \"Hardware.\" While \"Purchase\" could apply if a new monitor is needed, the primary concern is the hardware problem itself, so \"Hardware\" is the best fit for this ticket.**Formatting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to consider the subcategory format for this IT ticket. The expected output is a JSON-like object with \"category\" as a string from specified enumerated values. Since the issue is related to the external monitor with flickering images, \"Hardware\" is the right choice. I\u2019ll deliver this in the required format: a JSON object with the \"category\" field. So the response will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text, just the JSON as instructed.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
