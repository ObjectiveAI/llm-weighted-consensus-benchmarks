It seems to mention a \"new starter\" and \"filled form attached,\" hinting it\u2019s about HR onboarding for someone named Tudor. Given that, it\u2019s likely related to HR support. The request for forms to be filled also supports this idea. While \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could be possibilities, I think \"HR Support\" fits best considering the onboarding context.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm looking at the categories: \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" and \"Access.\" The content of the ticket mentions \"new starter\" and \"form attached,\" which suggests it's related to onboarding. This leans toward \"HR Support\" since it seems to be about helping a new employee. While \"Administrative Rights\" could apply if there's a request for access, there's no clear mention of that. So, my best guess is \"HR Support\" for this ticket\u2019s category.**Confirming Ticket Category**\n\nI've decided to choose \"HR Support\" as the appropriate category for the IT ticket, since it's about onboarding and forms for a new starter. The category structure indicates that \"HR Support\" is a valid option. I need to respond with a JSON-like object containing the category field. Following the required format, I\u2019ll ensure that the output looks like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This matches the schema, confirming I'm on the right track!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
