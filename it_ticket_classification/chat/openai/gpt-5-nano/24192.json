I might consider different categories like software issues, hardware problems, or network concerns. I guess it's important to get it right to ensure the right team addresses it. I'll think about the nature of the issue and possibly how urgent it is. I want to help streamline the process and make it easier for the team to resolve the ticket!**Classifying IT tickets**\n\nThe user provided a long and messy text that seems to involve resetting a password and various requests for help. I need to categorize this IT ticket properly. The options I have are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the context of the text, it seems like Access might be the right category since it deals with login issues. I want to make sure I get this right for efficient handling!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe text mentions several phrases related to password resets and account access, like \"reset password\" and \"expire days.\" It seems mainly focused on logging in and changing passwords. The appropriate categories would likely be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since the context indicates a need to reset login credentials. \"Access\" seems broader and more suitable here. The mention of \"confluence\" suggests this is about a service that may require password management. I'll classify it accordingly and prepare the output as a JSON object.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
