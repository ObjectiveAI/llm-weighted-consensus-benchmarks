The ticket deals with reviewing annual leave requests and managing leave balances, clearly indicating it's related to HR processes. There seems to be some technical guidance mentioned, but the ticket mainly revolves around HR leave management. I should also note that \"HR Support\" isn't in the categories list.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I see that \"HR Support\" is indeed in the list, which is the best fit for this IT ticket about annual leave requests and balances. There could be a case for \"Access\" if it involves system approval, but HR Support is the primary category. I need to output this as a JSON object, so my response should simply be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
