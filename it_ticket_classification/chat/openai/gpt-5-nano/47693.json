This sounds more aligned with \"Internal Project\" but could also fall under \"Administrative rights.\" I need to decide which fits best.**Choosing IT ticket categories**\n\nI'm trying to decide whether to categorize the IT ticket as \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The content is a feature request focused on access permissions and ticket system enhancements. It could fit under \"Internal Project\" if it relates to system improvements, or \"Administrative rights\" if it involves owner access restrictions. Since the ticket discusses features like checking status, commenting on owned tickets, and becoming a watcher, I\u2019ll likely go with \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" based on the details.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions features like \"become watcher\" and \"subscribe,\" but the user wants me to categorize it, so I need to provide that in the specified format. I\u2019m leaning towards selecting \"Internal Project,\" as it relates to an improvement suggestion for the ticketing system. While it discusses access rights, it's not explicitly asking for user account changes. \"Administrative rights\" might fit too, but that seems to focus more on permission changes. Overall, I feel \"Internal Project\" is the best choice. \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}**Preparing the category output**\n\nI\u2019m finalizing the category object for submission. Based on the provided schema, the category must be correctly spelled, and \"Internal Project\" fits perfectly. The available options are clearly outlined, and I\u2019ve confirmed that \"Internal Project\" matches the exact string required. \n\nNow, according to the instructions, I should return only the JSON object without any additional notes or text. So my final output will just be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
