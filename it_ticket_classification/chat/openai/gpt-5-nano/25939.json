The user wants me to choose from categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Since this relates to training and certifications, it likely fits under \"HR Support\" or even \"Purchase\" because of the mention of course fees and enrollment details. However, given its focus on employee training, \"HR Support\" is probably the best fit.**Categorizing an IT Ticket**\n\nI see that the ticket mentions details about training, course fees, and scheduling related to a Yellow Belt certification program. Since this involves employee development, \"HR Support\" sounds like a fitting category. While there are also purchasing aspects like course fees mentioned, the main focus is on training, so \"HR Support\" takes precedence. I\u2019ll need to format my response in a JSON-like structure as required for the categorization.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
