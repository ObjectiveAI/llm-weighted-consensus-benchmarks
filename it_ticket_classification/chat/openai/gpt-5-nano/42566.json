They mention trying to access a location for a server image, and they're asking for alternatives. So I\u2019m considering whether to classify this under \"Storage\" since it specifically talks about storage, or if \"Access\" fits better because the problem involves accessing that storage. Both are valid, but I must decide which is more precise.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket clearly states \"storage not accessible,\" which indicates a storage issue. Therefore, categorizing it as \"Storage\" seems appropriate. They also ask for \"any other alternative\" regarding accessing the server, but the primary issue is still with storage access. I need to format my answer correctly in JSON, as specified: a JSON object with \"category\": \"Storage\". It makes sense to respond directly with this categorized output since the user expects that clarity.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
