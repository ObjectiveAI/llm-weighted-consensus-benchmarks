The categories include options like \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights,\" but there isn't a specific \"HR\" or \"Leave management.\" Since the content primarily relates to absenteeism and approval flows, I'll definitely go with \"HR Support\" because it best captures the essence of their requests. The other option doesn\u2019t really fit.**Outputting JSON for IT ticket**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to provide this in a specific JSON format. The required schema indicates that I should include a category field. Given the context, I'll set the category to \"HR Support.\" It seems clear that I should respond with just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. No additional explanations or text are needed to keep it clean and straightforward."
