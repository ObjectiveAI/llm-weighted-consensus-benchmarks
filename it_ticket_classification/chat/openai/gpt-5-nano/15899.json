The ticket mentions a request for \"additional mousses Thursday PM,\" which might be a typo for \"mouses\" or refer to \"mice\" in a hardware context. They want two mice for colleagues during a visit. Given that it's requesting hardware, the best category for this ticket would be \"Hardware.\" Now I just have to confirm!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nIt seems like the category should be \"Hardware,\" since the request is for hardware devices (mice). It's definitely not about access or storage, and it doesn't seem to qualify as a purchase either. They want to assign two mice for colleagues during a visit. I'll structure my response in the required JSON format, specifying \u201cHardware\u201d as the category. The final output will look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It's crucial to match the allowed enumeration exactly!**Responding with Category**\n\nI need to respond by categorizing the IT ticket correctly. While I could add a note like \"Hardware - mouse devices,\" the required response is simply a JSON object. Since the instruction clearly asks to categorize the IT ticket, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward. My final output will just be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text included, just the essential information!"
