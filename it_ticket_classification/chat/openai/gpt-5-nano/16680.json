Since it\u2019s likely an onboarding task, I'd think of it as \"HR Support.\" But because it's about creating user accounts, it could also be classified under \"Access.\" Given the phrasing around the starter form, I'll go with \"Access\" for provisioning that new starter's accounts.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m re-evaluating the ticket's category since the phrase \"starter form\" suggests it might be for setting up accounts. I\u2019m debating between \"HR Support\" and \"Access.\" The ticket is likely intended for HR regarding onboarding. However, since it\u2019s an IT service desk ticket, new starter tasks typically fall under \"Access\" to create user accounts. Given that \"Access\" is indeed an allowed category, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" because it involves provisioning for a new hire. The urgency noted means I need to respond in the correct format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
