The request seems to be about creating code based on some attached information. Given this context, I\u2019ll consider it an \"Internal Project\" since that best fits the unclear details.**Categorizing IT ticket request**\n\nIt looks like the user is asking for help with a new project, which makes me think the \"Internal Project\" category might fit best. They mention creating code, so that aligns with coding for an internal initiative. However, there's some ambiguity\u2014if they're asking for access, \"Administrative rights\" could apply, but it\u2019s not very clear. I\u2019ll prioritize \"Internal Project\" as my main choice, with \"Miscellaneous\" as a backup in case that's needed.**Confirming category output**\n\nIt seems like the user is requesting to create code based on some attached information for a new project. I think \"Internal Project\" fits this context perfectly. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object with the category field. The specific structure should be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI\u2019ll ensure that \u201cInternal Project\u201d is exactly as required, without any extra text. Let's get that delivered!"
