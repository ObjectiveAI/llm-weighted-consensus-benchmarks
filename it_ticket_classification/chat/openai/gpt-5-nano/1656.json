This clearly relates to HR processes, so HR Support seems to be the best fit out of the categories provided. Although access could be a consideration, since it's more about managing leave requests, it\u2019s primarily an HR-related administrative task. So, I'll categorize this ticket as HR Support!**Categorizing ticket as JSON**\n\nI\u2019m categorizing an IT ticket that pertains to adding annual leave requests, which is clearly an HR process. HR Support seems to be the right category, but I\u2019m also considering whether it could fall under either Internal Project or Administrative rights. Since the request is HR-related, I\u2019ll go with HR Support. I need to format this as a JSON object, so the output will be: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. This follows the required schema!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
