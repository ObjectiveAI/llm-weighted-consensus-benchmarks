The ticket mentions a secure shared drive for internal file storage, discussing permissions, custom access levels, and management details. It\u2019s primarily about access control, so categories like Access or Administrative rights seem fitting. It also includes requests for write permissions without deletion, which reinforces that it\u2019s about Access and Administrative rights.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI need to choose a single category for this IT ticket, and \"Access\" seems to be the best option since it focuses on permissions related to file access. While \"Storage\" also fits because it concerns storage locations, the primary focus is definitely on who can write and delete. The user wants to create specific locations with certain permissions, reinforcing that \"Access\" is the most fitting choice. Now I\u2019ll output the required JSON object correctly matching the schema.**Providing category output**\n\nI see that the instructions indicate I need to return the category for the IT ticket. The typical response format shows that I should output a JSON object like {\"category\": \"Access\"}, reflecting the category clearly. While the schema is provided, it doesn't require the full schema return; rather, I need to focus on the actual output. So, I\u2019ll stick to the standard response format and return just {\"category\": \"Access\"} as expected."
