The ticket content is messy, mentioning people who left, requesting to open a ticket to close eateries, and discussing access rights for employees who are no longer with the company. It seems primarily about revoking access, so I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate category, as it pertains to access rights and terminations. \"Administrative rights\" could also work, but it feels narrower.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket text seems to ask for closing access related to employees who have left the company, with phrases like \"close eateries\" potentially referring to closing accounts. Although it's a bit unclear, it's definitely about access revocation for terminations. So, I think the best category is \"Access,\" but it might also fit under \"HR Support.\" I need to respond with a JSON object structured correctly, ensuring it contains the necessary properties, confirming the category is \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
