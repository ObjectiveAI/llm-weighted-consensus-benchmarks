We have various categories available: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I need to find one category that best fits this request. It seems like the user might be looking for either HR support or something more administrative given the context, but I need to decide definitely.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user provided a text to categorize an IT ticket. It includes references to ServiceNow templates, automated ticket cards, meeting notes, reports, and processes surrounding maternity leave and scheduled tasks. Given there are mentions of access, administration rights, and forbidden software, it seems to fit two categories: \u201cAccess\u201d for notifications and user assistance, or \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d since it involves managing tasks and permissions. However, it might also lean towards \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d or \u201cInternal Project\u201d since those categories are broader. I need to decide!**Deciding on the category**\n\nIt seems like \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since the ticket focuses on building a ServiceNow template and automation. There are mentions of scheduled tasks and permissions, which could align with \"Administrative rights,\" but it's not primarily about access rights. While \"Miscellaneous\" is available for items that don't fit neatly, I think \"Internal Project\" captures the essence of this request for process improvement. Other categories like \"Storage,\" \"Hardware,\" and \"HR Support\" don\u2019t match, so I\u2019ll stick with \"Internal Project.\"**Finalizing the category decision**\n\nThe ticket mentions creating scheduled tasks, suggesting an administrative operation, but it\u2019s more focused on automation and templates rather than granting rights. While \"Miscellaneous\" is a fallback, it seems best to select one category. I think \"Internal Project\" fits this ticket well, given that it\u2019s about creating a ServiceNow template and automating ticketing. I need to format the response as a JSON object, so I'll produce:  \n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}  \nI'll make sure it follows the required format without any extra text."
