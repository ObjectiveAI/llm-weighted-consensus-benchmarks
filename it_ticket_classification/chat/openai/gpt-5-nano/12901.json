The message mentions \"ServiceNow,\" missing fields in the service requests view, and issues with personalization after changes were made over the weekend. I\u2019m considering the categories we have: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. It seems this ticket is focused on access issues with the service requests view, so I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate category for it.**Categorizing service request issue**\n\nI'm looking at the user's issue regarding the service requests view with missing columns and system behavior after a weekend change. While \"Access\" could relate to permissions, this situation seems more about the application interface and UI issues rather than access rights. The predefined categories are a bit limited. \"Miscellaneous\" might work for broader IT concerns. After considering everything, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit since it captures the essence of the problem without the need for strict categorization.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned \"Personalize columns possible back view important reports,\" indicating this is about product features. I\u2019ve considered our categories, but none perfectly fits. \"Storage\" and \"Purchase\" don\u2019t apply, and \"Internal Project\" isn\u2019t relevant either. \"Administrative rights\" could relate to permissions, but it feels off. So, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the safest catch-all. I\u2019ll respond with the required format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. This should cover the essence of the user's issue while allowing for any clarifying questions later on.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
