They mentioned various terms like \"RAM,\" \"memory upgrade,\" and \"purchase order.\" This suggests it's primarily about a hardware upgrade related to RAM. Given the content, the categories could be Hardware or Purchase. However, the best fit is likely Hardware, as it indicates a direct request for a RAM upgrade. I have to keep in mind that I can only choose one category.**Categorizing IT ticket again**\n\nIf I have to pick one category, \"Hardware\" seems to be the most suitable since it's focused on upgrading RAM components. There are mentions of logging allocations and covering basic needs, which point to a hardware request. Although \"Purchase\" could also fit because of the ordering aspect, the core request is the hardware upgrade. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as Hardware and respond with only the JSON object. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
