The text suggests the user needs a temporary device, which relates to IT support. Looking at the categories available, it could fit under \"Hardware\" because it discusses a device. There's also a chance it aligns with \"Access\" if there are account access problems due to the phone being lost. If resetting authentication is needed, it might belong in \"Administrative rights\" as well.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a typical IT ticket where the user has lost their phone and needs a temporary device for accessing corporate resources. I think \"Hardware\" fits best for this request since it\u2019s about replacing the device. \"Storage\" doesn\u2019t apply, and maybe \"Purchase\" could work if they were buying a new phone, but it's really about hardware replacement here. \n\nI need to ensure I respond with the category in the correct JSON format as required by the system.**Confirming category output**\n\nThe system requires a specific JSON object with a \"category\" property. I\u2019ll go with {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to align with the schema correctly. It seems clear from the context: the user needs a temporary device because their phone is lost or stolen, which definitely relates to hardware replacement. I should only respond with this minimal JSON object without any additional text or explanation. Let\u2019s keep it straightforward!"
