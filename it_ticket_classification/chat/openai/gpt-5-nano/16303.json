So, I\u2019ll output a JSON that accurately reflects that categorization!**Structuring JSON output**\n\nI need to follow a specific JSON structure to categorize the IT ticket correctly. The schema indicates that the category should be an object with a \"category\" field, which is constrained to options like \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", etc. My goal is to produce that correct output. It seems I should provide: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, based on the requirement. I'm thinking about adhering to the format, ensuring it aligns with what\u2019s asked!**Delivering concise JSON**\n\nThe top-level object indicates that the entire response should be structured as an object with a \"category\" field. Therefore, the correct output is simply: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I need to make sure I keep it concise, without adding any unnecessary text. Let's just focus on delivering that clean JSON format!"
