Given the context, I think \"Internal Project\" fits best. Now, since the prompt asks to respond in a structured JSON format, I'll make sure to format it accordingly!**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI'm looking at the instruction that presents a JSON-like schema which specifies a \"category\" field. It seems I need to provide a JSON object with that field specifically marked as \"Internal Project.\" Yes, the instruction is clear: categorize the IT ticket, so my output will be succinct and just that JSON object. I'll write it as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} without any added commentary to follow the format requirements properly. Let's get that done!"
