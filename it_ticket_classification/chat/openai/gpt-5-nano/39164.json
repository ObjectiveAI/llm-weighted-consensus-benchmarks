The user talks about their microphone not working and mentions a headset microphone that does work. It's clear this is a hardware problem.\n\nSo, looking at the categories provided: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights,\" the best fit is \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll need to present that in a JSON format, including the category field.**Finalizing the JSON Response**\n\nI see the system's \"category\" tool shows that I need to output a JSON format with a specific category. The requirement indicates that we should focus on the category value, so I understand that I need to respond solely with that. The rubric asks us to categorize the IT ticket, which I've determined falls under \"Hardware.\" \n\nSo, the final response should simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nNo extra text is needed\u2014just the clean JSON object!"
