This suggests it's primarily about access rights, so I'll classify it under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" based on context. Let's structure that in a JSON-like format for clarity.**Defining category for IT ticket**\n\nIn categorizing the IT ticket, \"Access\" covers issues related to access control, while \"Administrative rights\" refers specifically to permissions. The user's request for \"permission to delete personal filters\" indicates this is primarily about granting admin rights. While \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" don't fit, \"Administrative rights\" is the best choice. The request includes \"delete option greyed out,\" confirming the need for admin permissions. Thus, I'll categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" and format it in JSON as required.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nThe instruction specifies that the output needs to be plain and without special formatting, likely for easier parsing by code or display in an app. So, I\u2019ll ensure my response is straightforward and concise. I need to provide just the JSON string itself, which is: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. This ensures compatibility and clarity for whatever application handles it. Okay, let's proceed with this clean format."
