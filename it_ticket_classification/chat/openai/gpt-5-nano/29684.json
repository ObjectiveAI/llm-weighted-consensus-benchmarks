                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the user\u2019s message about installations and asset allocation. The text mentions several important aspects like \"installation Wednesday pm,\" and \"assign tickets order allocate assets.\" It seems to focus heavily on installation and assets, which tends to fit the \"Hardware\" category. I don't think it aligns with \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" so my best guess is it's definitely \"Hardware.\" Let's go with that!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s request involves creating separate tickets for multiple installations, which could tie into procedural tasks. The categories are limited, and I\u2019m considering \"Internal Project\" since it pertains to managing installations. However, it leans more toward hardware since it involves installations and cables. There's no mention of HR, Access, Storage, or Purchase. I think \u201cInternal Project\u201d is the best fit because it emphasizes managing installations and asset allocation while still acknowledging hardware aspects.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nWhen categorizing this IT ticket, I recognize that installation tasks often fall under \"Hardware.\" Still, the term \"Internal Project\" could apply since it involves ongoing installations and asset distribution. The instruction to \"please create separate tickets\" hints at a procedural aspect. I could also consider \"Administrative rights\" since it's about ticket creation, but there's no explicit request for rights. Given all this, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" and prepare a JSON-like object for the output.**Deciding on category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Internal Project\" or \"Hardware.\" I\u2019m leaning toward \"Internal Project\" because it revolves around multiple installations and project-level asset allocation. The details about scheduling, creating separate tickets, and assigning assets strongly imply it's project management. Although the term \"project\" isn't explicitly mentioned, it fits the context. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and categorize it as \"Internal Project\" with the output in the required JSON format: \n\n{\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to follow the system's instruction that \u201cBullet lists are acceptable\u201d but for this case, we only really need the \"category\" field. So, I'll output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI want to ensure I keep the formatting correct, making it a proper JSON-like response. The system is looking for plain text without any extra commentary. Thus, my response will be straightforward, just as required."
