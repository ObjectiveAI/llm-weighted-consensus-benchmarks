This clearly relates to mailbox storage. So, I think the category \"Storage\" fits best. It's definitely not about hardware, HR, access, or anything else. I'll prepare to output JSON with the category labeled as \"Storage.\"**Outputting JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nThe instruction is to categorize an IT ticket, which means I need to respond with a JSON object that includes a category field. The schema specifies that I should structure it accordingly. \n\nSince the ticket is about mailbox storage, the best fit is \"Storage.\" I have to adhere strictly to the format from the instruction, so I'll produce the JSON object as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there's no extra text in my response, just the JSON object.**Finalizing Category for Ticket**\n\nI've noted the ticket mentions \"mailbox almost full,\" requesting an \"increase in mailbox size,\" and references to \"delete items\" and \"empty deleted items.\" While it could seem related to \"Administrative rights\" for managing quotas, the core issue points to storage. Therefore, I confidently conclude that the category is indeed \"Storage.\" \n\nI\u2019m ready to produce the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. This keeps it clear and aligned with the requirements!"
