From the provided sets, I\u2019m considering either \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase\" since they\u2019re essentially requesting equipment. The request for a cable and converter suggests that \u201cPurchase\u201d might fit best since it implies obtaining new hardware. However, \u201cHardware\u201d also seems valid. I\u2019ll go with \"Purchase\" for clarity.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm assessing whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" Since it\u2019s all about cables and connectors, \"Hardware\" seems more fitting. The phrase \"please provide cable converter to connect secondary monitor\" suggests it's a request for specific equipment, which leans toward \"Purchase.\" However, given the context of hardware issues, categorizing it purely as \"Hardware\" feels right. So, I'll go with the category of \"Hardware\" and format my response as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Finalizing category output**\n\nIt looks like I only need to provide the category in a specific JSON format. The instruction says to avoid any extra text, so my response will be straightforward. Since the ticket references a need for additional cables and mentions a secondary monitor, this clearly falls under \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll present it simply as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} and submit that without any additional explanation. Let's deliver that cleanly!"
