The ticket seems to focus on access issues, mentioning \"password reset\" and \"access control.\" Therefore, I'm considering the category could either be \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" It seems best to categorize it as \"Access.\" So, I'll respond with a JSON object representing the category: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to make sure I keep it straightforward.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the prompt provided. The output should be in the format of a JSON object representing the category. While there is a possibility of classifying it under \"Administrative rights\" due to the password reset context, the mention of \"password reset for Friday PM\" seems more typical, indicating it falls under \"Access.\" So, I\u2019ll go with that and finalize my response as {\"category\":\"Access\"}.
