The ticket mentions a Windows upgrade with insufficient space on the partition, which suggests issues related to Storage. I have a list of categories to choose from, and while Hardware may also seem relevant since it concerns a Windows upgrade, the most fitting category appears to be Storage due to the specific mention of disk space issues. There are also some extraneous details in the user's message.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user asks to categorize an IT ticket, so I should output JSON with an appropriate category key. The provided text suggests that \"Storage\" is the correct category since it mentions insufficient partition space. I need to respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. Even though elements like \u201cupgrade started\u201d are in the text, the central issue is clearly about storage. I don\u2019t think I need to parse extraneous phrases, so \u201cStorage\u201d fits perfectly.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
