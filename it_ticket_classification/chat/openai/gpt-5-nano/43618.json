The options for category are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context, it seems related to security or access. However, there's no \"Security\" category available. \"Administrative rights\" might apply since it involves permission to modify the blocklist, while \"Miscellaneous\" could also be a catch-all option.**Determining Category for Ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s content is about adding domains to a blocklist, which seems to relate to blocking inbound email or network access for security purposes. Unfortunately, there's no \"Security\" category available. The closest might be \"Administrative rights,\" since it involves permission to modify the blocklist. Alternatively, I could consider \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Access\" could fit if it relates to access control, but I think \"Administrative rights\" would be the most accurate choice.**Classifying Ticket Request**\n\nThe user is asking to add specific domains to an anti-block list, which requires classification for ticket routing. However, the category \"Security,\" which could fit, isn't available. \"Miscellaneous\" is a possibility, though \"Internal Project\" doesn't quite apply here. I might consider \"Access\" since it relates to controlling inbound access for security, but \"Administrative rights\" seems most appropriate for requests that need admin privileges to change configurations. This request is essentially an action that IT might typically route to Network or Security teams.**Analyzing Domain Blocking Request**\n\nI see that blocking a domain involves a settings change, which may require admin rights. Analyzing the text, the key points are:  \n- The user is requesting an action to \"add domains to block list.\"  \n- They describe these domains as similar to legitimate ones used in phishing attempts.  \n- The text is a bit jumbled, but it emphasizes that legitimate domains should not be blocked. The goal is to categorize this IT ticket. I\u2019ll prepare the JSON output in the required format: `{\"category\":\"...\"}` with one of the specified categories.**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nI need to select the appropriate category for this IT ticket. \"Security\" isn't an option, but \"Administrative rights\" seems like the best fit since the request involves changing block lists, which may require admin privileges. It's essentially asking to modify security controls. However, if there's uncertainty, \"Miscellaneous\" could work too, but I prefer \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nI should respond in the specified JSON format, so I'll provide: `{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}` with no extra text. It needs to be a valid JSON object with only the specified category field."
