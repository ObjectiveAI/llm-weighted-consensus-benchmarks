It looks like the user is asking for something to be done regarding AD membership management. Considering the available categories, the most relevant ones seem to be \"Access\" for user access or \"Administrative rights\" for privileged access. Since it's about adding or removing membership, \"Access\" might be the best fit.**Formatting category in JSON**\n\nI need to output a JSON-like category object based on the user's request. The format should be a JSON object with a \"category\" key, and it's limited to specific values. The user's message points to something about adding a member to Active Directory. This indicates they want to grant access, making \"Access\" the appropriate category. Although \"Administrative rights\" could be considered, the user's text only mentions membership, so \"Access\" seems like the best option for our JSON response.**Outputting category as JSON**\n\nThe user's message seems ambiguous but clearly revolves around AD membership management. Since they didn't specify a group type, I'll choose \"Access\" as the appropriate category. I need to ensure that I provide just the JSON object without any extra commentary. Following the instructions, my response will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nAlright, I\u2019m ready to answer with that format!"
