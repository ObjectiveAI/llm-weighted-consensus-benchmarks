It looks like this: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. Now I\u2019m ready to produce the final response.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket and present it in a JSON format. Previously, I've used something like {\"category\":\"Access\"} for similar tasks. The format requires just the category object, not the entire schema. So, it seems I can simply answer with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It feels good to clarify this before finalizing my response! Let's go ahead and present it that way."
