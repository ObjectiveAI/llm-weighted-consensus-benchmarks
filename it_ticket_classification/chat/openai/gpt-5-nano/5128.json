The categories I have are Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. Since this is related to onboarding, it seems like HR Support is the best fit. However, there's also a mention of access, which could tie into account setup. Overall, it points towards HR Support for the new starter contractor. I just need to pick the best option.**Determining the right category**\n\nI\u2019m mulling over which category fits best for this ticket. \"Access\" seems appropriate since it relates to user account provisioning. \"Administrative rights\" might not be the best since it deals with privileges. \"Internal Project\" isn\u2019t relevant, and \"Miscellaneous\" could work if things are unclear. But because it\u2019s onboarding, \"HR Support\" may not fit either. Ultimately, I think \"Access\" is the right choice since it involves access provisioning for a new contractor. I\u2019ll also note this in a JSON format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
