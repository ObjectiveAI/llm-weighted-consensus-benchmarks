The user's description involves issues with search results showing wrong scores related to a risk management app, mentioning elements like database and scores. This leans towards a software application issue, not hardware or HR. It feels like it could fit under \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous\". I need to decide carefully!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing this ticket as \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous\" since the issue relates to an internal software application, not hardware or user access. With it being about a risk management app, \"Internal Project\" seems fitting for in-house apps, while \"Miscellaneous\" covers anything that doesn\u2019t quite fit. Given that it mentions engineers and bugs in the app, I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" and respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Delivering final category**\n\nI need to output my final answer in the required JSON format. Since the ticket involves issues with \"search results showing wrong scores\" related to risk scoring scales and concerns internal software, \"Internal Project\" is definitely the best fit. So, my response will be straightforward and clear: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That's it! Just keep it simple and to the point."
