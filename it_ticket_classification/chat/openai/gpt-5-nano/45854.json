The message seems garbled, but it likely relates to a connection issue where they're having trouble connecting via something like VPN, RDP, or SSH. Based on this context, the most fitting category appears to be \"Access,\" as the problem is related to connectivity. However, it could also fall under \"Administrative rights\" or even \"Miscellaneous.\" Ultimately, I'll choose the category that best captures the user's issue.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm categorizing this ticket as \"Access\" since it involves a connection issue likely related to user access. Following the provided schema, I need to respond with a JSON-like object for the category. The format requires that I only include the category in the specified structure. So, my final output will simply be the JSON object with \"Access\" set as the category, ensuring that the casing matches exactly as specified. I won\u2019t add any extra explanation. Here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
