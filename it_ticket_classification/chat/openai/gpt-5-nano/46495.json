The content is really jumbled but seems to revolve around issues with timesheets, missed time, and approvals for direct reports. It mentions Oracle, claims, and processes for submitting reports. Given these points, it looks like the best fit for this ticket would be \"HR Support\" since it deals with employee time and reporting issues.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at an IT ticket that mainly deals with HR-related issues like timekeeping, payroll, and missing timesheets. The most suitable category seems to be \"HR Support\" since it revolves around direct reports and HR processes. There could be debates about it being \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" if it touches on Oracle system access, but it focuses primarily on HR governance. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and respond with the category JSON: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
