The content suggests it\u2019s hardware-related, mentioning that the monitor worked until yesterday and has been moved due to an assigned tower. So, this case likely falls under the \"Hardware\" category due to the monitor malfunction. The user could also fall back on \"Miscellaneous\" if there's uncertainty. I want to ensure the categorization is helpful and accurate!**Outputting JSON category**\n\nIt seems clear that the ticket is hardware-related, specifically concerning a monitor. I should respond with a JSON object as per the instructions stating the category. The format looks like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. While I think about adding a justification, the instructions seem to emphasize that I should stick strictly to the category. So I'll keep it simple and direct with no extra text. I'll go ahead and output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Providing JSON output**\n\nThe instructions clearly indicate that I should respond solely with the JSON object. Since the category is determined to be hardware-related, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward. The final answer will be the JSON formatted like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. There's no need for any extra text or justification here. I\u2019m just focused on giving the clean, precise output as requested! So, I\u2019ll go ahead and finalize it as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
