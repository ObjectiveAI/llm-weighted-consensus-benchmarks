The ticket mentions removing local admin rights for some team members, highlighting changes made via policy and a pilot phase to assess impact. This touches on access control and admin rights, so I\u2019m deciding between \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access.\" Both categories are valid in the enum provided. However, it seems to align more with \"Administrative rights,\" so I\u2019ll go with that one in my output!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis ticket is clearly about removing local admin rights, which directly relates to administrative rights and access control. The category set includes \"Administrative rights,\" making it the appropriate choice. I need to output a JSON-like object, specifically: {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}. The instructions are clear, just the category without extra notes. I\u2019ll double-check the capitalization to ensure it exactly matches what\u2019s provided. So, I\u2019ll return: {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}."
