The mention of a \"senior developer\" and \"client\" suggests this likely falls under the \"Access\" category for remote systems.**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nIt looks like I should categorize this ticket as \"Access,\" since it involves connecting and possibly remote access or credentials. Although \"Internal Project\" could be a consideration if they\u2019re working on a project, the phrase \"steps connect\" really points to needing assistance with remote access. Therefore, \"Access\" seems like the right choice. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object and ensure it meets the requirements. The final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
