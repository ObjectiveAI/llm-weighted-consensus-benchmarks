Key phrases include \"TV not able to connect,\" references to \"guest wireless,\" and a request to \"look into issue.\" Given the context, it seems this issue falls under \"Access,\" as it relates to network connectivity for the TV.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm identifying this as a network connectivity issue with a TV, likely falling under \"Access.\" While \"Hardware\" could be relevant, it's mainly about Wi-Fi network access, which aligns with \"Access.\" The user referenced \"guest wireless,\" but that doesn\u2019t change the core issue. According to the instructions, I need to respond with a JSON object format. So, the final answer will be structured as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That seems clear and precise!"
