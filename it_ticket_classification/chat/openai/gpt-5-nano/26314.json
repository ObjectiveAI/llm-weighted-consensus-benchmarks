They mentioned records for the same person and seem to be discussing active accounts and the desire to delete duplicates. This suggests it relates to HR Support or Access. It could also fit under Administrative rights since they\u2019re talking about managing records and canceling work relationships. Overall, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as either \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" based on the context provided.**Categorizing IT ticket data**\n\nIt looks like we're dealing with data quality and identity management issues in the context of IT. The \"HR Support\" category would handle employee records, while \"Access\" deals with user accounts, and \"Administrative rights\" relates to permissions. The user\u2019s mention of deleting duplicates and canceling work relationships suggests they might want to manage HR records. Given that situation, \"HR Support\" seems to be the most appropriate category for this ticket about Oracle records and employee management.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering that the category for this ticket could also be \"Administrative rights,\" especially if it's about deleting accounts or disabling access. However, since the user is focused on records\u2014particularly duplicates\u2014it seems to fit under \"HR Support.\" The mention of \"Oracle November PM records\" hints at a system for managing HR data. The user wants to merge duplicates and manage records effectively, confirming that \"HR Support\" is the best category. Now, I need to format this as a JSON object to present clearly.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
