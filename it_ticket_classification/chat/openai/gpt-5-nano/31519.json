This could fit under \"Internal Project\" since it mentions new projects and Oracle. However, it might also relate to \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" if permissions are involved. Let's clarify!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on this user's request: it seems to relate to creating new projects in Oracle by Tuesday PM. The best fit appears to be \"Internal Project\" given the focus on managing these projects. However, if there\u2019s a need for permissions, it could also be \"Administrative rights.\" The message is a bit vague, so there\u2019s also a chance it fits under \"Miscellaneous,\" but I will go with \"Internal Project\" as the primary category for clarity.**Generating category JSON**\n\nThe task is to produce a JSON object that sets the category based on the earlier analysis. I need to ensure I adhere to the correct format. The category should be \"Internal Project,\" matching the exact casing and spacing from the defined enumeration. So, my response will be straightforward and look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I want to confirm everything is correct and formatted as required with no extra text. Let's go ahead and do that!"
