Given the context in the ticket, it seems most fitting to categorize it as \"HR Support\" since it deals with onboarding a new contractor. I'll set up the output accordingly!**Evaluating ticket category**\n\nIt looks like the user is requesting help with administrative onboarding tasks, specifically regarding HR forms and access provisioning. The ticket mentions a \"starter form\" for a contractor and requests assistance for completion. Given the context, the \"HR Support\" category seems most fitting since it deals with onboarding documentation. There isn\u2019t any explicit request for IT access provisioning, so I\u2019ll categorize it under \"HR Support.\" The \"Administrative rights\" category isn't applicable here.**Determining appropriate category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket and considering whether it might need an \"Access\" category, as it mentions a contractor joining. However, there\u2019s no clear mention of systems access, just references to a \"starter form\" and a new contractor. \"Administrative rights\" might fit if they want specific rights, but that's not clearly stated either. Given the multiple mentions of onboarding tasks, it seems best to categorize this as \"HR Support,\" reflecting the nature of the request.**Formatting response**\n\nI need to format my response as a JSON object with a \"category\" field because the prompt specifically asks for it. The category should be \"HR Support,\" exactly as required. I want to make sure that my output follows the expected structure without any extra text. It should just be the JSON object that clearly states the category. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} without anything else."
