It could be \u201cInternal Project\u201d for an internal dialing feature or \u201cAccess\u201d for dialing permissions. The user mentions displaying the calling number name instead of just the number, which suggests something about linking order or internal dialing systems. I see \u201cplease assign,\u201d which shows it needs to be routed properly. So, maybe I should lean towards \u201cAccess\u201d in this case.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nThis ticket might relate to a phone system (PBX). There\u2019s an \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d category, but that doesn\u2019t fit here. \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d could work if the details are unclear, but I think \u201cInternal Project\u201d is the best choice since it focuses on internal dialing configuration. \u201cAccess\u201d could pertain to permissions, but it\u2019s not obvious. The user needs this ticket categorized, so I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object format like: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I should check how to handle the case sensitivity.**Finalizing the JSON response**\n\nI see that the enum includes \"Internal Project\" as the exact term with capital letters and a space, so I\u2019ll use that. While \"Access\" might fit, the ticket clearly mentions \"internal dialing\" and \"display calling number name,\" suggesting the \"Display caller ID\" feature. Therefore, \"Internal Project\" feels right since it relates to configuring internal dialing. The instructions only say to produce the category, so I'll respond with just: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Simple and clear!"
