The user is experiencing an error when trying to submit for past weeks and asks for clarification on that error. \n\nLooking at the provided categories, I\u2019m considering whether to classify this under \u201cAccess\u201d due to the submission system potential access issue or perhaps \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d if it doesn\u2019t fit neatly anywhere else. It seems mainly like an IT-related submission issue.**Analyzing Error Explanation**\n\nThe user is seeking an explanation for an error related to submissions, and something about \u201cconsultant mobile en\u201d could imply they\u2019re referencing mobile support in English. The question involves categorization, so I need to determine which category fits best.\n\nHardware doesn\u2019t seem relevant, and while HR Support could apply if it's about time submission, I think it\u2019s more of an IT ticket. Access makes sense if it\u2019s related to permissions. Otherwise, it might lean towards Administrative rights if elevated access is required for past submissions.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m not entirely certain, but it looks like the user is referring to a submission issue from past weeks. The mention of \u201cintuitive error\u201d might suggest they\u2019re experiencing some kind of error message, but there isn\u2019t a specific error included in their text. \n\nFor categorizing this IT ticket, I\u2019m leaning towards \u201cAccess,\u201d since it seems to involve permissions related to submitting those past weeks. \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d might be too specific. The response should be a JSON object that includes the category string.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
