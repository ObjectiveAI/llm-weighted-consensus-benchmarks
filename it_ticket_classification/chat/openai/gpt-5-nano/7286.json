It seems to involve user access or permissions regarding notifications. Given the context, \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" might be good fits, but I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" since it deals with user permissions.**Categorizing ServiceNow ticket**\n\nThis ticket focuses on recipient lists and notifications in ServiceNow, addressing topics like logging, statuses, and initial configuration. I wonder if it fits under \"Administrative rights\" since amending the recipient list might require permissions. However, there isn\u2019t a clear request for those rights; it\u2019s mainly about notifications.\n\n\u201cInternal Project\u201d could also apply, as it relates to internal configurations within a project. Given its focus on system configuration, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Administrative rights.\" But I\u2019m still deciding which category fits best!{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
