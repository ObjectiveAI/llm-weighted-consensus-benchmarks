Given the context, \"HR Support\" seems like the most appropriate category since it relates directly to maternity leave and managing access during that time.**Categorizing IT ticket request**\n\nThe ticket discusses a user\u2019s request related to \"maternity leaver access card.\" Key phrases like \"please make remains active after\" and \"return devices\" suggest that the user wants to keep their access active during maternity leave and perhaps re-activate it afterward. Considering the categories available\u2014like Hardware, HR Support, Access, etc.\u2014it seems that \"Access\" is the most fitting category since it directly relates to managing access card status during leave.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
