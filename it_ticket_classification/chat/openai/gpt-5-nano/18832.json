The appropriate category here seems to be \"Access\" since they're requesting permission to attend those meetings. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object like this: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. I want to make sure I adhere to the schema provided for clarity and accuracy. It looks straightforward!**Determining access categories**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether this request is about access rights to a file or governance meetings. The phrase \"write file\" seems to hint at a request for write permissions. Overall, it looks like they're asking for access to governance meetings and some file writing permissions, which is about access control and authorization. Given the categories available, I\u2019d categorize this as \"Access.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could fit if they need elevated privileges, \"Access\" seems most appropriate here.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI'm deciding on the right category for the IT ticket, and it seems \"Access\" is the best fit. The \"Internal Project\" category isn't relevant here, so I'll go with \"Access.\" I need to format my final response as a JSON object, which should look like this: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. The instruction is clear that only the \"category\" field is required, so I won\u2019t include any extra text. Let's produce that output!"
