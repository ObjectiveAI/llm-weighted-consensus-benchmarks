It likely refers to needing approval for requisitions. The best categories to consider are \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Purchase.\" Since this seems related to purchasing requisitions, I think \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nThe phrase \"approve requisitions\" suggests the user may need an approver role to manage purchase requisitions, which could fall under \"Access.\" The word \"duplicate\" might imply they want to duplicate a previous request, and \"shared\" could indicate a shared drive. Since the text is a bit ambiguous, I need to categorize it correctly. Given that the ticket relates to requisition approvals, \"Purchase\" seems like the best fit for the category.**Choosing category for IT ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"approve requisitions\" might suggest a need for \"Administrative rights,\" but it doesn\u2019t explicitly mention rights. Approving requisitions typically falls under administrative functions. However, since the user asks for \"duplicate\" and includes \"same thanks shared,\" it complicates things a bit. Given the context, a request to approve requisitions fits best under \"Purchase,\" which relates to the purchasing process. I\u2019ll need to respond with the category as a JSON object indicating just the category value.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
