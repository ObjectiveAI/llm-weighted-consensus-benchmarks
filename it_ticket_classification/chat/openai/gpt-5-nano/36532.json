The string includes phrases like \"constantly receiving updates\" and \"have rights; appears to be installed properly.\" Based on the provided categories, the ticket fits best under \"Administrative rights\" since it's specifically about needing admin rights for updates. However, \"Access\" could also apply. I\u2019ll lean toward \"Administrative rights\" for this ticket classification.**Outputting category object**\n\nThe task is about admin rights and permissions, so I\u2019m categorizing this as \"Administrative rights.\" I need to deliver a JSON-like object with that category string. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. There\u2019s specific formatting to follow, but the requirement here is just to provide the category object without any additional commentary. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and deliver that."
