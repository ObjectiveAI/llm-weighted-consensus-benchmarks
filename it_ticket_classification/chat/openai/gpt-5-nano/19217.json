The limited categories include things like Hardware, HR Support, and more. The ticket mentions capacity tracking and automated ticket updates, which makes it seem like an internal initiative. Although \"Administrative rights\" could apply if access were requested, it seems more about tracking. So, the category for this should be {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nThe user provided a category schema that requires the assistant to respond with a JSON object. I need to ensure that I output just the necessary JSON structure with the key \"category\" and the value as one of the enumerated strings. In this case, it should be {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.\n\nI should avoid any extra text and stick to just delivering the JSON object. Given the context, \"Internal Project\" aligns perfectly with the task details regarding capacity tracking and automation. So, I'll finalize this response."
