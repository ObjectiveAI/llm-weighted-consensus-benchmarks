I\u2019m thinking \"Purchase\" is likely the correct category given the context. I'll focus on picking the most fitting option from categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and more based on the keywords present.**Outputting category as JSON**\n\nI need to finalize the categorization of the IT ticket. I'm leaning towards \"Purchase\" since other categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Storage\" don't fit. I\u2019ll create a JSON-like object that only includes the \"category.\" The required format calls for this specific structure. So I\u2019ll output it as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} and make sure it's valid JSON. It seems clear that the task is to provide this object directly with the necessary value!**Delivering final JSON output**\n\nI need to finalize the categorization for the IT ticket. The content seems a bit unclear, but \"Purchase\" makes the most sense as a best guess. Although I could consider multiple options, the required format only allows for a single category. The instructions indicate not to include justifications or extra text, so I\u2019ll stick to the essentials. Therefore, my final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} without any additional explanation."
