However, it also discusses procurement and software licenses, which could lean towards \"Purchase.\" I ultimately need to choose just one category.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI need to select the appropriate category for the IT ticket. Given the explicit mention of \"access request\" and \"authentication failed,\" I believe \"Access\" is the best fit. The system provides a JSON schema for the category, and since \"Access\" is listed as a valid option in the enum, I'll format my response accordingly. I\u2019ll output just the necessary JSON object without any extra text. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll provide:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
