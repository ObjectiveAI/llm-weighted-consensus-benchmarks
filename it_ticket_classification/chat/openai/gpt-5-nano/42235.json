They want me to pick from several categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights.\n\nThe content reveals that an employee can't submit time cards for approval, indicating an issue related to HR processes. So, it seems like this should fall under the \"HR Support\" category since it directly deals with time card submission issues.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe issue at hand is that someone can't submit time cards, which usually involves HR or payroll, not hardware. I\u2019m considering various categories like HR Support, Administrative Rights, or Access. Since it's primarily about time card submission, \"HR Support\" seems to be the best fit. There is a potential permission aspect, but overall this looks like an HR issue. I'll respond with JSON formatted data, categorizing it as \"HR Support\" in the correct structure.**Finalizing category response**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize the IT ticket, so I\u2019ll respond with: \n\n{\"category\": \"HR Support\"}\n\nI need to keep the response concise and straightforward since they specifically asked for the category without extra explanations unless requested. I\u2019ll make sure the string matches exactly with the enum, which includes \"HR Support\" with a space. Now, I\u2019m ready to provide the final output."
