The important phrases are \u201caccess card\u201d and \u201cstarter form,\u201d indicating that this relates to access credentials for a new employee. I should choose \"Access\" as the best category since it directly involves enabling an access card. However, I\u2019m also considering \"HR Support\" due to the new starter paperwork mentioned.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI see that \"HR Support\" is indeed a requested category in the list. However, this ticket mainly revolves around enabling an access card and provisioning, which fits better under \"Access.\" Based on the text, it mentions phrases like \"new starter access card\" and \"starter form.\" While there's a possibility it could relate to \"Administrative rights,\" it seems primarily about access provisioning. So, I\u2019ll determine the category as \"Access\" and format it as a JSON object with the required structure.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
