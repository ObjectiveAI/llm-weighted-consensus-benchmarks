It seems they\u2019re asking to increase the total memory. The likely categories are \"Hardware,\" as this relates to a memory upgrade, or \"Purchase,\" since they are requesting more RAM. Since it\u2019s an upgrade, \u201cHardware\u201d seems like the best fit for this IT ticket.**Clarifying IT ticket categories**\n\nThe ticket categories don\u2019t explicitly include \"Procurement,\" but \"Purchase\" seems fitting. I\u2019m considering \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s for a specific project, while \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" aren\u2019t relevant here. \"Storage\" seems off unless we're viewing memory as storage. It\u2019s clearly a request for a hardware upgrade, so \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase\" makes sense. The user's request to \"increase total memory\" implies a need for procurement, making \"Purchase\" the more accurate category for this situation.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on the user's request to \"categorize this IT Ticket.\" The allowed categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Looking at the request about increasing RAM for a production server, this clearly indicates a hardware upgrade. I should classify it as \"Hardware\" since it better fits the context of the ticket rather than \"Purchase.\" Now, I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object to meet the instructions.**Formatting the output**\n\nThe required output format is straightforward: it needs to be a JSON object with only the category included. Given that it should read {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, I understand there shouldn\u2019t be any extra text, as the system needs to process it cleanly. I\u2019ll make sure to stick to this format and not add anything unnecessary. So, the final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That's the clean and clear response needed!"
