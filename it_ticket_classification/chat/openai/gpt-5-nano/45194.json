The categories to choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the content that discusses approval tasks and requisition errors, \u201cPurchase\u201d seems to be the best fit. Although Access might be considered due to approval control, I\u2019ll stick with Purchase as it aligns more closely. I should respond with a JSON object in the specified schema.**Formatting JSON for Category**\n\nI need to respond using the specified JSON format. The instruction shows that I should create an object with a \"category\" field, and since the ticket's category is \"Purchase,\" I'll structure it like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. \n\nThere's no need for extra commentary beyond delivering the JSON object. While I briefly considered if there might be a more precise subcategory, it feels right to settle on \"Purchase.\" Now, I\u2019ll proceed to provide just the JSON as required."
