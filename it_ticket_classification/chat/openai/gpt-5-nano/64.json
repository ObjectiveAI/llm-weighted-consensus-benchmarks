The user's text is messy, but it seems to relate to access for reviewing contract setups and reports about creators and updates. Given the content, \"Access\" is likely the primary category. \"Administrative rights\" might also apply since they're mentioning permissions related to contract setups. I'll make sure to clarify this categorization!**Categorizing IT ticket access**\n\nThe user is looking for \"assign\" and \"access for review,\" indicating that this IT ticket likely falls under high-level IT support categories. The ticket primarily concerns \"Access\" for reviewing contract setups, and \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant. The content emphasizes creating report columns and background on contract setups. Given the strong mention of access for review, I believe the most fitting category would be \"Access,\" with \"Administrative rights\" as a secondary option.
