The terms like \"documentation\" and \"assigned senior consultant\" suggest this could be about an internal project focusing on permissions or administrative rights related to these extensions. I'm curious if it connects to employee access or specific technical details regarding implementation. There\u2019s definitely a lot to consider here!**Categorizing project details**\n\nI need to sort this project into one of eight categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative Rights. The content mentions terms like \"extensions,\" \"documentation,\" and \"assigned senior consultant,\" which makes it a bit unclear. However, \"Access\" could relate to user extensions and control rights. Still, it seems to fit better under \"Internal Project\" due to the focus on implementing automated synchronization and the mention of an assigned consultant. \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback, but let's go with \"Internal Project.\"**Deciding on project categorization**\n\nThe user's request seems to be about categorizing into a single word. I\u2019m comparing \"Access\" and \"Internal Project.\" The text mentions \"implement automatic synchronization\" and \"employees extensions,\" which indicates it relates to a process likely connected to an internal project. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" I need to format the response in a JSON object following the provided schema, ensuring the \"category\" field is correctly nested within it. I\u2019ll get that ready!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
