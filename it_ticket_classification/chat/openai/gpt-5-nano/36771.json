They provided a list of categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and more. I\u2019ll look closely at the ticket content, which has quite a few typos: it's about issues with adding project tasks and delegations. The user is asking for help with this, so I must determine the best category that fits their request based on the information provided. This will help them get the support they need!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis ticket highlights issues with delegations and adding tasks to a project management system. The user mentions the need for help with project types, rights, and task details. It might fit under \"Administrative rights\" due to the permission issues, or \"Access\" because of the access rights mentioned. It could also fall under \"Internal Project\" since they discuss project tasks. My goal is to categorize it accurately using the provided list. I need to choose the most fitting option!**Choosing a ticket category**\n\nThe ticket indicates the user is \"unable to add project tasks\" and mentions issues with delegations and rights. This could fall under either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" as it relates to permissions. However, since the main issue revolves around project management tasks, I think \"Internal Project\" is also a strong contender. The goal here is to select the most accurate category that properly routes the request to the right team while considering the specifics of the application issue.**Selecting the best category**\n\nI need to choose the best category for this IT ticket. The user\u2019s mention of \"Administrative rights\" aligns closely with permissions issues, while \"Internal Project\" also seems relevant for project management. The ticket discusses configuring a \"tab type for codes,\" suggesting it's a feature within the project management tool. However, since the user faces issues with delegations and rights, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Administrative rights.\" Now, I\u2019ll prepare the response in JSON format as requested!**Preparing the JSON response**\n\nThe system indicates that my response should be a JSON object with a category property. The user has asked me to categorize the IT ticket, and the instruction specifies using a \"category\" JSON schema. I decided the category should be \"Administrative rights\" since it relates directly to permissions. \n\nI think it\u2019s best to present that in the required format: \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nThat should meet the user's needs perfectly! Let's go ahead and deliver it."
