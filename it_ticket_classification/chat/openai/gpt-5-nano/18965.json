It's essential to get this right so the issue can be addressed effectively, considering the context and urgency. I should evaluate the ticket's content against these categories carefully for the best fit!**Interpreting procurement details**\n\nThe ticket text is a bit chaotic, filled with procurement terms. It looks like a purchase order listing various hardware items, like transceiver modules, stacking cables, mounting brackets, racks, patch cords, antennas, licenses, and adapters. I'll need to sort through this jumble to ensure I capture all the necessary details for processing the order effectively. It\u2019s a lot to take in, but I want to make sure I don\u2019t miss anything important!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI need to decide if this ticket should be categorized as \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" Given that it involves procurement of hardware and software licenses, plus mentions of installation and mandatory receipts, it seems appropriate to classify it as \"Purchase.\" The category does include new orders, so I'll stick with that. I just need to provide the output in the specified JSON format without adding any extra commentary. Alright, here it is: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
