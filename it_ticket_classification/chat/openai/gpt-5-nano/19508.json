It seems to relate to onboarding and might fit under \"HR Support\" since it involves assisting with completion. However, I\u2019m also considering \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access\" since those could apply too. Given the context, it looks like it aligns best with \"HR Support.\" Let's finalize it based on this interpretation.**Categorizing IT ticket for onboarding**\n\nThis IT ticket is about onboarding a new starter with notes for Wednesday in March. It might fit under \"Administrative rights\" if we're discussing access setup, but there aren't clear mentions of access credentials or accounts. The request for \"new starter notes\" and \"starter form\" indicates it's more HR-related. However, \"Access\" is a candidate since it involves setting up a user account for a new employee. Ultimately, I think \"HR Support\" might be the best choice here.**Evaluating ticket categorization**\n\nThe ticket doesn't mention specific \"accounts\" or \"logins,\" but it could still relate to \"Access\" since onboarding typically requires system access. The mention of \"new starter notes\" and \"starter forms\" seems to align with onboarding instructions. However, it\u2019s a bit tricky because \"HR Support\" typically isn't an IT function. Meanwhile, tickets often fall under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" Since there's a focus on setting up access, I think \"HR Support\" might just fit better for this context.**Assessing IT ticket categories**\n\nIn this IT triage, \"new starter notes\" and \"starter form\" suggest it's about onboarding tasks. The closest category could be \"Access\" because it typically involves creating user accounts, although there's no clear mention of accounts here. Alternatively, \"Administrative rights\" seems less fitting since it relates to permissions, which doesn't quite match.\n\nWhile \"Internal Project\" could relate to onboarding, it\u2019s not ideal. I think \"Miscellaneous\" could work if I'm unsure. However, \"Access\" remains the best fit for system onboarding, especially with the request for assistance on completion. So, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
