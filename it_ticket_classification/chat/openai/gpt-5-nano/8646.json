The ticket text mentions a new starter in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, who seems to need help with completing forms and information related to their work location. So, it looks like it could fit under \u201cHR Support\u201d for onboarding or possibly \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative Rights\u201d since it involves permissions within systems. I'll consider which category best fits.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve got a list of categories to work with: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The message talks about a \"new starter\" needing to complete forms, which aligns with onboarding. Since this involves HR processes, I think \"HR Support\" is the best fit. Although it might touch on \u201cAccess,\u201d the focus doesn\u2019t seem to be on that at all. I\u2019ll respond with a simple JSON object containing the category.
