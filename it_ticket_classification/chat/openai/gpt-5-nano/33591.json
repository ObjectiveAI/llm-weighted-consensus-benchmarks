The system has specific categories, and the user\u2019s text contains phrases like \u201cpurchase request,\u201d \u201capproved,\u201d and \u201cfinal owner.\u201d It seems the main theme is clearly about a purchase, so \u201cPurchase\u201d is the best category. However, I\u2019ll keep in mind terms like \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d or \u201cAccess,\u201d even if they\u2019re less relevant. My final output will be a JSON object reflecting the chosen category.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nI need to format a JSON response to categorize the IT ticket according to the provided schema. The instruction specifies that I should return a JSON object with a \"category\" field. The best categorization here is \"Purchase,\" and the correct format should be something like {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}.\n\nHowever, it appears that I might need to follow the schema strictly. There's mention of wrapping it in an \"object\" type structure. Still, since the main instruction is to categorize, I\u2019m leaning toward simply returning {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
