The allowed categories include \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights\". The ticket mentions enabling access for a reverse proxy on a server, which suggests the \"Access\" category is the most appropriate. However, it might also relate to \"Internal Project\" if it's for a pilot environment. Given the details, \"Access\" seems to be the best fit.**Confirming Category Format**\n\nI think \"Access\" is indeed the best category for this IT ticket. I need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category, like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. However, the system hints that the expected format is a bit different, requiring me to show the category within an object structure. The provided schema indicates I should note properties of the category. Yet, my response should focus on outputting the actual value of the category, which is \"Access.\"**Finalizing JSON Output**\n\nThe past tasks indicate I need to provide a JSON object with just the category string. The instruction seems a bit ambiguous, but to be safe, I\u2019ll keep it simple and use this format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Since \"Access\" is a valid selection from the given schema of categories, I\u2019m all set to confidently output exactly that without any extra text. I want to make sure the response is clear and straightforward, so let's proceed!"
