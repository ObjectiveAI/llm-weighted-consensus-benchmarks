The ticket text is a bit garbled but seems to focus on licenses for wireless controllers, likely Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers. The user is asking about additional licenses for renewal and mentions future growth and environment print, which suggests it should fit in the \"Access\" or \"Purchase\" category. Let's place it in \"Access\" for now.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe terms in the ticket suggest it's about licenses, renewal, and future growth related to wireless controllers. I think it could be categorized as \"Purchase,\" especially since it deals with buying additional licenses. Although it might also be linked to an \"Internal Project,\" the focus seems to be on license management and planning. Given the context, \"Purchase\" is the best fit. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object with the category specified.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
