They\u2019ve provided a block of text that seems to relate to a purchase order for a wired keyboard, emphasizing the need to log installation and keep mandatory receipts. From my interpretation, this falls under the \"Hardware\" category since it is about a new hardware purchase. I'll format the response as a JSON-like object with the appropriate fields.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI need to determine the right category for the IT ticket, considering it could fit under \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" The user mentions a \"new purchase po wired keyboard\" and requests to log installation. Since this is primarily about procuring a new item, \"Purchase\" seems to be the best fit. The mention of installation could hint at a related task, but the focus is clearly on purchasing. So, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Purchase\" in the required format.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
