There are repeated mentions of issues related to expense report approvals and problems finding reports in Oracle. It sounds like the user needs urgent approval before year-end closing. Given this context, I think it could map to categories like Access (for permissions) or Administrative rights. Let's clarify this further to ensure it fits properly!**Categorizing IT Access Issues**\n\nThe user's mention of a manager not being able to find the report suggests an access problem with the Oracle system regarding expense reports. I think we can categorize this ticket as Access since it involves accessing expense reports. Alternatively, if it relates to permission issues, it might fit into Administrative rights. Considering the context around accounts payable and approvals, I need to choose the most relevant category for clarity. Outputting a JSON format will help streamline the process.**Determining Access Issues**\n\nTo resolve this, I need to consider permissions or navigation problems. The mentions about the expense report point to the urgency around year-end closing and approving reports in the Oracle system. The root issue seems to be access to the report itself, so \"Access\" is likely the most fitting category. While \"Administrative rights\" is related to more significant permissions, the core concern here is about the manager's inability to locate the report, solidifying \"Access\" as the better choice.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
