Given the context, \"Internal Project\" feels right due to mentions of \"new project code\" and \"creating code.\" However, there's also a hint of \"Access,\" especially if they're asking for permissions. I'll need to decide carefully!**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nThe text doesn\u2019t explicitly mention access or permissions, but \"new project code\" clearly suggests starting something new. The best category here seems to be \"Internal Project.\" I need to respond with a JSON-like object, formatted as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Following the instructions, my output should align with the schema provided. I'm double-checking my reasoning: could \"Access\" be needed for creating code? But the focus is more on starting a new project, so I feel confident about my choice!**Finalizing category response**\n\nFor this IT Ticket, it\u2019s clear we need to choose one category, and \"Internal Project\" makes the most sense. I just need to follow the instructions by supplying a JSON-like object formatted correctly. The final output should simply be {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} without any extra commentary or formatting. Since the user is asking for a categorization, I\u2019ll keep it succinct and provide exactly what\u2019s required. Let's get it right and keep it clean!"
