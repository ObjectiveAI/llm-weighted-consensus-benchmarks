This ticket focuses on mailbox access, including topics like leaver mailbox and forwarding. \n\nIt seems most relevant to \"Access,\" which deals with permissions. While \"HR Support\" could fit because of onboarding/offboarding, this is mainly about IT mailbox access for interns and leavers. So, I think \"Access\" is the best category to use!**Outputting JSON for Access**\n\nIt looks like \"Access\" is indeed the right choice for the category. I need to format my response as JSON with the correct structure based on the schema. The schema indicates I should provide an object with a property named \"category\" that has a string value restricted to certain options.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll format it as:\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThat seems right, and I don't need to add any extra explanation. I\u2019ll go ahead and produce that final output!"
