It seems this could pertain to permissions for viewing or editing reports. However, since both \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" are listed separately, I think the user is likely referring to \"Access\" for general reporting access. The request mentions \"changes needed\" and \"highlighted reports,\" hinting at modifying access rather than admin rights. I'll finalize the response as a JSON object:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI think the app probably just needs the category. So, I'll go ahead and provide the JSON object as requested. It seems like the instructions say to avoid heavy formatting, which means a simple response with no extra text is the best approach. Therefore, my output will be clear and straightforward. I'll finalize it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
