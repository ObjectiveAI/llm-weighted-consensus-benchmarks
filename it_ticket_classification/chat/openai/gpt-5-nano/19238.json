Looking at the provided categories, it seems to fit best under \"Hardware\" since it\u2019s about devices. \"Storage\" could also be a consideration due to the mention of \"abandoned,\" but primarily, it relates to hardware. Other categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Purchase\" don\u2019t seem relevant, so I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as Hardware.**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nI\u2019m looking to categorize the IT ticket according to the prompt instructions. The required format is a JSON object with a \"category\" field. Based on the provided enum list, the best fit seems to be \"Hardware,\" but I\u2019m also considering \"Storage\" since the ticket mentions \"abandoned devices.\" \n\nDespite the potential for it to lean towards asset disposal, my final choice will remain \"Hardware.\" Therefore, the response will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.
