The categories provided include \"HR Support,\" and that seems the best fit since the ticket relates to a leave request. Other categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" just don\u2019t apply. So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like object indicating \"HR Support.\"**Formatting the Response**\n\nI need to ensure I format the output as a JSON object with a \"category\" field. The user wants this category to align with the provided options, which confirms that \"HR Support\" is the right fit. The expected format requires a straightforward JSON object\u2014{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\u2014without any extra text or explanations. Although the schema indicates additional structure, we only need the single category field for the response. So, I\u2019ll keep it concise and clear. Let's go with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
