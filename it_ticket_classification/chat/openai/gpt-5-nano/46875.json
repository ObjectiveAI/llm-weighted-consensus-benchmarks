The ticket mentions a \"view install issue\" with software crashes, small icons, and urgent status since reports are needed for executives next week. It could fit best under \"Miscellaneous,\" but maybe \"Administrative Rights\" if admin privileges are needed. Since it involves urgent installation issues, \u201cAccess\u201d might also be relevant. I\u2019ll decide based on how it aligns with these categories.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions a \"view complete reports for exec next week,\" which might suggest a software issue rather than strict access problems since there's no category for that. \"Internal Project\" is also not a fit, and given the GUI-related issues, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the best option. I'll categorize the IT ticket as \"Miscellaneous\" and present it in JSON format: {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}. There's no need for extra text or formatting\u2014just the category."
