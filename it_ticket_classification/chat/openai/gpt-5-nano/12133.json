The content is quite messy, but it hints at a \"new purchase order\" for some audio equipment, specifically \"audio port tiles\" and \"audio extension compact.\" There are repeated phrases that suggest it's primarily about purchasing. Since it revolves around acquiring items, I'll categorize it under \"Purchase.\" It seems straightforward, even though the wording is a bit jumbled.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket details further. It seems like \"audio port tiles\" might refer to some hardware, but since the focus is on a new purchase order, the appropriate category aligns more with \"Purchase.\" I don't think \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" really apply here. Since the ticket revolves around acquiring equipment and mentions allocation, I\u2019ll categorize it strictly as \"Purchase.\" \n\nNow, I need to format it into a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I should respond with just that.**Finalizing response format**\n\nI\u2019m ready to return the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I need to make sure it\u2019s clean, without any accents or extra commentary. The initial string contains multiple phrases, but now I just want to keep it straightforward and focused. So, I\u2019ll finalize this without any additional information or errors. It\u2019s important that the response is clear and correctly formatted!"
