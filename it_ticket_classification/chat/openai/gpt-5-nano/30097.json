The options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The text seems to focus on an extension cable, so the most fitting category would be \"Hardware.\" However, it could also relate to \"Purchase\" if it's about acquiring an extension cable. I'm deciding that \"Hardware\" is the best choice for this one, as it refers to peripherals and cables.**Producing the JSON Object**\n\nI need to classify the IT ticket as \"Hardware,\" considering that's the most appropriate category based on the user's description. The required output format is a JSON object, so I'll structure it precisely. The schema specifies it must include a \"category\" field with one of the listed options. Therefore, my final output will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI think it's a good idea to keep it concise and straightforward, as the instructions suggest, just categorizing it succinctly."
