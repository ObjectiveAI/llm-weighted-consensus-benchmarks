The phrases point toward software development, which makes me think it likely fits under \"Internal Project.\" The content doesn\u2019t align with hardware, HR support, access issues, or purchases, and doesn\u2019t really touch on administrative rights or storage either. I\u2019m leaning toward classifying this ticket as an \"Internal Project\" since it\u2019s focused on apps and automation.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m categorizing this IT ticket as \"Internal Project.\" I considered other options, like \"Administrative rights,\" since they might need access to create pipelines, but there\u2019s no explicit request for access. The mention of a schedule suggests it\u2019s a project management task. \n\nNow, I need to respond in JSON format according to the provided instructions. It looks like the output should be: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"} to meet the requirements for the model's output.**Delivering JSON output**\n\nI\u2019m crafting the response as {\"category\": \"Internal Project.\"} I need to make sure the formatting stays as plain text, following the instruction to avoid heavy formatting. Bullet lists are fine, but since this request is specifically for JSON, I\u2019ll keep it as a single line to meet the requirements. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll go ahead and deliver it as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} to keep it neat and precise."
