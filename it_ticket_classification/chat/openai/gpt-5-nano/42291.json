I want to make sure I cover everything accurately to help the user effectively!**Analyzing ticket content**\n\nI'm looking at the ticket content, which is quite a messy text about feedback submission difficulties. It mentions issues like \"errors occurred access denied\" and problems saving the feedback draft. It also requests help with accessing a link for drafts related to the final technical interview report and evaluation for an applications analyst position. Given this information, it seems clear that this ticket is related to access problems. So, categorizing it under \"Access\" seems appropriate.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis IT ticket is about access issues related to feedback submission. It brings up problems like submitting feedback and saving drafts, so the category could be \"Access\" or possibly \"Administrative rights.\" Given that there's an \"access denied\" error, \"Access\" seems most appropriate. While it might relate to \"Internal Project\" because of its context, I'll stick with \"Access\" for clarity. Now, I need to format this in the correct JSON structure with the category property. Let's craft that final output!**Providing category in JSON format**\n\nI see that the provided schema indicates the \"category\" property must be part of a structured JSON object. It specifies a type of object with an enumerated string for the category, which includes \"Access.\" The actual response needs to be a simple JSON object with that category string value.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll produce the output as {\"category\":\"Access\"} and make sure it\u2019s clear and concise, ending with a newline, just as the instructions specify."
