The categories available include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The mention of \"new starter tower\" suggests it's related to hardware. Additionally, requesting to \"create his credentials\" points towards either Access or Administrative rights. It seems like the most fitting category is Access, given the focus on credentials for a new starter. I'll respond with a JSON object for that.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket, which mentions \"new starter tower,\" indicating hardware provisioning for a new computer. The combination of hardware and access suggests I need to categorize it based on the tasks requested. The text requests to \"create his credentials per attached form,\" which clearly relates to access credentials. Although \"Hardware\" could also apply, the main focus is on credential creation. Therefore, the most fitting category is \"Access.\" I\u2019ll finalize the output in the required JSON format with that category."
