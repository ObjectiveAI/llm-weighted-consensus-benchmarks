The mention of wanting to attach code suggests it falls under \"Internal Project.\" Other categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" might fit, but \"Internal Project\" seems the most appropriate.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nIt could be \"Access\" if the user is requesting permission for Oracle Fusion, but since they mentioned \"attached code,\" I don't think that's the case. Given the context of \"new project code oracle fusion code,\" it seems they're categorizing this ticket for triage. I believe \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since it pertains to project management. I need to respond with the category in JSON format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, as the instructions specify formatting requirements.**Outputting category**\n\nI need to respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I'll make sure to keep it simple and not include any extra commentary since the tool likely just requires the JSON format. Being clear and following instructions here is crucial, so I'll focus solely on providing that response!"
