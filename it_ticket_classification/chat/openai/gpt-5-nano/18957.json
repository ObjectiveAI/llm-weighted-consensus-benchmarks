This seems to fall under administrative tasks, likely needing \"Administrative rights\" to cancel bookings. \"HR Support\" could be a possibility since it's about employee lifecycle, but it\u2019s more of an IT ticket. The action is definitely off-boarding, and since there's no specific 'Facilities' category, it might fit into \"Miscellaneous\" for broader coverage.**Classifying the ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how IT ticket systems categorize cancellation requests. While \"Administrative rights\" might fit if it were about access removal, it\u2019s not about access here\u2014it's about booking cancellations. \"Access\" seems more relevant to user permissions than booking systems. So, using \"Administrative rights\" feels inaccurate for this case. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, \"Miscellaneous\" might be the safest choice. I\u2019ll respond using the required format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I'll keep it concise and straightforward!"
