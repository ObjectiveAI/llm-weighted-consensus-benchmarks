They mention a \"new starter\" needing \"credentials\" and reference a \"monitoring analyst.\" It seems this fits best in the \"Access\" category since it's primarily about creating login credentials. While \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights\" might apply, the focus is on account creation for access. I should likely respond with a JSON object to confirm this categorization.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and the format requires me to present a category as a JSON-like object. It seems the most fitting category is \"Access,\" especially since the ticket involves creating credentials for a new starter. While \"HR Support\" might come up because of the onboarding aspect, it's mainly an IT action, so \"Access\" is definitely the right choice here. I\u2019ll just output this cleanly as {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
