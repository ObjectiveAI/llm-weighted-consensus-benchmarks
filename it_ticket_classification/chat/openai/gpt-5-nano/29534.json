While it could also be related to a Purchase request, it's primarily focused on hardware installation. So, I'll categorize it as Hardware. I'll provide a JSON-like output with that category field.**Formulating JSON output**\n\nI need to create a JSON-like object with a \"category\" property based on the user's instructions. The main category is Hardware, which is appropriate since the ticket mentions installing memory. Although there's a mention of \"administrator phone,\" it doesn't strongly indicate Administrative rights. My response will be a simple JSON format: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}` without any extra commentary, as clarity and adherence to the required format is essential."
