The user probably wants me to automate the category selection, though!**Proposing IT ticket category**\n\nI should propose a likely category for the IT ticket based on the content. The phrase \"newly hired\" suggests it's related to onboarding, so the \"Access\" category would fit for granting systems access to a new employee. If it involves elevated permissions, \"Administrative rights\" could work too. \n\nThe phrase \"add to march pm front\" seems like it may mean adding someone to a \"Project Management Front\" or possibly the front desk. Overall, I\u2019d lean towards categorizing this as \"Access\" since it\u2019s likely about providing access for the new hire.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the appropriate category for the IT ticket. While \"HR Support\" could apply for HR-related issues, onboarding usually falls under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" in IT ticketing. Given the text discusses onboarding a newly hired employee, I think \"Access\" is the best fit, since it involves granting system access.\n\nThe ticket mentions \"please help getting newly hired responsible currently copied,\" suggesting they need access to something specific. It might be helpful to propose a category of \"Access,\" along with subcategory notes like \"Request to add newly hired to March PM front.\" Also, I could format the response in JSON for clarity.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe system specifies that the output should be a JSON object with a \"category\" field. Since the user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, my response should be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI considered \"Administrative rights\" if the request involves granting additional permissions, but without more details, \"Access\" seems appropriate as a broad choice. I could optionally ask for clarifications or suggest recommended fields. However, since the instructions are clear\u2014just categorize the ticket\u2014I\u2019ll go ahead with the straightforward response:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThat's the necessary delivery!"
