Clearly, this falls under the Hardware category since a monitor is hardware, but it could also be a Purchase request. So, do I categorize it as Hardware for technical support or Purchase for the procurement side? The mention of a team request makes it a little tricky, but both categories could be appropriate.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to choose the best category for an IT ticket. I believe \"Hardware\" is the most fitting option, especially since the ticket mentions an \"additional monitor\" for a statistics board. While there\u2019s also a \"Purchase\" category for requests, this seems to lean more towards a hardware support issue rather than a procurement process. I\u2019ll format the response correctly in JSON, outputting just the \"category\" field as instructed. Here's what I'll provide: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to make sure I follow the formatting guidelines since the app might parse the JSON. The directive clearly says to respond with JSON, so I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.\n\nWhile I could consider \"Miscellaneous\" or even \"Purchase,\" it's clear this falls under hardware since they\u2019re requesting an additional monitor. The internal ticket system seems to use \"Hardware\" for those kinds of requests, so this should be straightforward. I\u2019ll stick with the safest choice: \"Hardware.\" Time to deliver that response!"
