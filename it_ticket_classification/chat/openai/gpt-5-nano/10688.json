The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. After the user asks to categorize an IT ticket, I\u2019ll need to evaluate the provided text and determine which category aligns best. Once I decide, I\u2019ll output a JSON object with the appropriate category field included. This should streamline the process efficiently!**Parsing nomination request**\n\nI\u2019m working on parsing the ticket content regarding a nomination approval. The user has submitted a long message that essentially requests approval for a nomination related to a zone award. It looks like they\u2019re highlighting the nominee\u2019s adaptable communication skills and contributions. My main goal is to extract that this message is indeed a request to approve the zone award nomination. I\u2019ll need to summarize and categorize it accurately!**Categorizing nomination request**\n\nI\u2019m breaking down the ticket content, which includes terms like \u201capprove vacation,\u201d \u201czone award,\u201d and \u201cnominee review.\u201d It looks like it revolves around nominating someone for an award and possibly involves workflow approvals. I\u2019m considering which category it might fit best. It could be \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d but also possibly \u201cInternal Project\u201d or \u201cHR Support.\u201d Unfortunately, the category options are a bit limited. The main focus is definitely about approving a nomination for a zone award.**Determining category for approvals**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating whether this ticket is best categorized as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" due to the mention of approving a Friday PM zone award nomination. It discusses internal workflow with terms like \u201czone tab\u201d and \u201cmailbox.\u201d However, it feels more aligned with \"Internal Project,\" since it\u2019s about a nomination process. There\u2019s no specific request for access rights involved. If it doesn\u2019t quite fit any category, I might consider \"Miscellaneous.\" Ultimately, it centers around the approval process for a nomination.**Categorizing nomination ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions a \"zone link\" and discusses a process within an internal system. It seems to center around approving a nomination on behalf of the Friday PM zone award committee. This makes me think the best fits may be \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous\" since it\u2019s about a nomination workflow. While \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" came to mind, there\u2019s no explicit request for those. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
