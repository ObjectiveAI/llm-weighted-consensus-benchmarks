Given the various aspects, I\u2019m torn between \"Internal Project\" or \"Storage.\" I think \"Internal Project\" might fit best since it covers the deployment and system imaging context.**Selecting ticket category**\n\nI'm thinking about where to categorize this ticket related to a Windows fresh install, client installations, and backups. \"Internal Project\" might fit since it involves deployment, but it's a bit generic. Then there's \"Storage,\" which is relevant because it mentions portable drives and secure storage. I could also consider \"Administrative Rights\" if it involves pushing client installations. Ultimately, I need to choose the category that best represents the primary focus of the ticket, which seems largely deployment-related.**Deciding on categorization**\n\nI think \"Storage\" fits for elements related to backup and partition, but the main focus here is the fresh install and client push, which fall under deployment. Therefore, I\u2019m settling on \"Internal Project\" because it accurately reflects the deployment and implementation tasks involved. I\u2019ll craft a concise response in the required JSON format for clarity. It should simply state: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. Let's go ahead and deliver that without any extra commentary."
