The ticket text is a bit jumbled, but it seems to focus on Oracle's Open/Close periods. The user, an accountant, originally had access but notices that some buttons are no longer visible. They\u2019ve attached a print screen and are seeking help. It likely falls under \"Access.\"**Categorizing Access Issue**\n\nThis IT ticket pertains to access issues in the Oracle system, specifically related to missing UI buttons due to changes in access rights. I\u2019m considering categorizing it under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" as both seem relevant. The user mentions problems with buttons not being visible after access changes, indicating it's an access rights issue. They\u2019re asking for help with closing/opening periods, so I think \"Access\" is the best category but \"Administrative rights\" is also a possibility.**Categorizing Permission Issue**\n\nThe term \"administrative rights\" usually refers to needing elevated permissions, but in this case, the user specifically mentions \"access rights changes\" and that two buttons are not visible, along with an attached print screen. The main concern appears to be access to certain functionalities due to permission issues. I think it's more fitting to categorize this under \"Access\" rather than \"Administrative rights,\" as they didn't explicitly request admin rights. It seems like a permissions bug, so \"Access\" is the better choice.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
