The user submitted a detailed text about Oracle statistics, with mentions of dashboards, access issues, and internal projects. It seems like it revolves around access and internal project themes. Given that, I think the best fit for this ticket is the \"Access\" category, which covers user access and permissions.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing this ticket, which involves keywords like \u201cConfluence,\u201d \u201cAD user,\u201d \u201cdashboard,\u201d and references to permissions and ownership. It seems to be related to an internal project concerning statistics dashboards and access control. The two potential categories are \u201cAccess\u201d and \u201cInternal Project.\u201d Given the focus on project sponsorship and progress, I think \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category. There are definitely elements of access involved, but the primary focus is on the project's details and stakeholder communication.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nThe ticket discusses access rights in Confluence, mentioning things like \"default owner required\" and \"authorized AD user dashboard.\" It could potentially fit under \"Access,\" but it also describes an internal project focused on statistics dashboards, progress, and stakeholder communication. Since it aligns more with the internal project theme, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best category choice. I'll output a JSON object stating this, adhering to the required schema format for clarity.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to output a JSON object that specifies the category of the IT ticket. The accepted structure indicates it should simply be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I realize the main focus here is on providing just the category value in the correct format. The instructions specify that my response should be parsed by code, so I\u2019ll ensure it\u2019s succinct and clear. Therefore, I\u2019ll provide the JSON object with only the necessary details."
