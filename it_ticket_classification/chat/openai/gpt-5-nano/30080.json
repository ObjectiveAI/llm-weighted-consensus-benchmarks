However, if it\u2019s more about general resource access, \u201cAccess\u201d could work too. Given that it mentions administrators, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d seems more accurate. I\u2019ll prepare the response as a JSON-like object with the category set accordingly.**Finalizing the response format**\n\nThe instructions don\u2019t explicitly ask for an explanation, so I think it\u2019s best to keep it simple. While a brief note might be helpful, the safest approach is to return just the category object according to the required format. I\u2019ll proceed with outputting the JSON response without any extra text. The final response will be: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. Keeping it clear and straightforward is the way to go!"
