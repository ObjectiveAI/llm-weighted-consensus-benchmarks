The available categories include \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" and others. Since the content specifically deals with password reset information, it most likely falls under \"Access\" because it's related to access rights. While \"Administrative rights\" could be considered, it seems more appropriate to classify it simply as \"Access.\" So, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\"**Responding with JSON format**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket and provide the category in JSON format as required. The correct format is {\"category\":\"value\"}. I need to ensure that my response includes only the JSON object and no extraneous text. The ticket mentions password resets, which falls under \"Access.\" However, there's also mention of administration, which might suggest \"Administrative rights.\" Still, it's safer to categorize it simply as \"Access\" based on the provided criteria. So, the output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
