It sounds like the main concern is access to these resources, which makes \"Access\" the most fitting category. I\u2019ll wrap this up into a JSON-like object to align with the prompt and include the proper \"category\" field to reflect this classification. It feels good to ensure users get the right support!**Structuring the JSON output**\n\nI need to format my output correctly as a JSON object, specifically with a \"category\" field. The category should reflect the user's issues accessing Yammer and training materials, which clearly fall under \"Access\". So, I\u2019m preparing to return the specified JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll make sure to stick to the prescribed structure since clarity is key in providing this response. Delivering the right format feels satisfying!"
