This clearly relates to storage issues. The ticket shouldn't fall under access or administrative rights since it's mainly about mailbox storage. I think the correct category to assign here is \"Storage.\" Now, I just need to respond with a JSON object that specifies this category. I'll make sure the formatting aligns with the required schema.**Ensuring JSON Format**\n\nI need to make sure the output is valid by providing the category as \"Storage.\" The required format is a JSON object with a property for \"category.\" Even though the instruction just asks for a category string sometimes, the specified schema does require that I wrap it in an object.\n\nI'm clear that the expected JSON is simply {\"category\":\"Storage\"}, even though the schema suggests more. So, I'll stick to the straightforward response: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Delivering JSON Output**\n\nI want to keep it concise, so there's no need for extra explanation. The final output should focus on giving just the JSON without any heavy formatting. It\u2019s clear that the correct response is simply {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I\u2019ll make sure that\u2019s exactly what I deliver \u2014 straightforward and to the point! So, here it goes: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}."
