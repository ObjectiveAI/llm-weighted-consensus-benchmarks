The text mentions a \"new starter\" in Belgrade, which sounds like an onboarding situation that might relate to HR support or administrative rights for the new employee. Given that onboarding is typically classified under HR Support, that's a potential fit. The message seems cryptic and could also link to access needs, but administrative rights seem less likely since it leans toward HR.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI think the phrase \"new starter in Belgrade\" suggests a new employee starting on Wednesday. The mention of \"enclosed starter\" could refer to a starter pack. I\u2019m considering categories like HR Support or Administrative rights. Since there's no clear mention of setting up user access, HR Support feels more fitting for onboarding. I know the system might consider categories like \"Internal Project,\" but HR Support seems the best choice based on the provided details. I\u2019ll respond with that in a JSON format.**Determining the category format**\n\nI see that there\u2019s a \"category\" schema requiring a JSON object, which should look like `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`. While \"Access\" could be relevant if we're setting up entry for a new starter, the ambiguous language makes \"HR Support\" a safer choice. Some guidelines suggest asking clarifying questions, but this seems straightforward. I\u2019ll stick with \"HR Support\" as the best fit and format my response as instructed, with just the JSON object."
