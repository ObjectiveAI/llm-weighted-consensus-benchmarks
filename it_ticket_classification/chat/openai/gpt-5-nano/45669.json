The ticket talks about an alarm changing from yellow to red, specifically monitoring CPU usage of a virtual machine. This could fit under several categories, like \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" However, it seems more like a monitoring issue. If it\u2019s more general, \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d could work, but if it\u2019s tied to a specific project, then \u201cInternal Project\u201d might be better.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket to find the best category. \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d and \u201cAccess\u201d don't fit. \u201cHardware\u201d could work if it's about VM hardware, but that\u2019s not clear. \u201cStorage,\u201d \u201cPurchase,\u201d and \u201cHR Support\u201d don\u2019t apply either. \u201cInternal Project\u201d is a generic category, but I think \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d fits better since the content revolves around alert status changes and CPU usage of a VM. I'll respond with a JSON object indicating its category as \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI see the instruction asks me to respond with a specific category in a format that can be parsed by code. The expected output schema indicates it should be a JSON object with a \"category\" field. Given my analysis, I\u2019ve determined that \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is the most appropriate category for this ticket. So, I\u2019ll prepare a clean final response in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I need to leave out any extra commentary and just deliver that object."
