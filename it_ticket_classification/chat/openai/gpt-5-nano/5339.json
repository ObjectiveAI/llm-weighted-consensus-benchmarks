Given the context of onboarding interns and completion of forms, \"HR Support\" feels most fitting, while \"Administrative rights\" seems less necessary. \"Access\" could apply if they need system access, but overall, I'm leaning toward categorizing this ticket as \"HR Support.\"**Finalizing category assignment**\n\nI realize that onboarding an intern clearly falls under the HR process. Therefore, I should categorize this ticket as \"HR Support.\" The mention of a \"starter form\" suggests it relates to the onboarding process for new interns. Since I'm required to respond in a JSON format, I'll prepare the output as a JSON object with the category specified. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll simply respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It's straightforward, with no extra text needed!**Confirming category choice**\n\nI need to consider the nuances in the ticket. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if access is needed for interns, the text clearly indicates onboarding interns and completing a starter form. This makes \"HR Support\" the most appropriate category. So, I'm set to return the response strictly as a JSON string. I\u2019ll keep it simple, responding with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Let's move forward with that!"
