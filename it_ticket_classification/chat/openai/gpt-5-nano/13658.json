The phrases like \"address to be added\" and \"please ensure added starter form\" suggest it could relate to adding access or visibility. I\u2019m thinking it might fall under \"Access\" since adding an address seems like it could involve user accounts. However, it might also fit \"Administrative rights\" if it\u2019s about granting access rights. I\u2019ll need to analyze this further.**Identifying ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket. The phrase \"address to be added\" hints that it could relate to adding address details to an account. It might also involve \"Administrative rights\" if it\u2019s about granting access. The term \"starter form\" could point towards onboarding, suggesting it ties into HR support. However, since we don\u2019t have a specific category for onboarding, \"HR Support\" could be the closest match. Ultimately, I need to choose the best fit from the available categories.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned \"please ensure added starter form blvd sector,\" which suggests it might be related to onboarding. Given the lack of context, the safest choice might be \"Access,\" since it's about adding an address and visibility. Alternatively, \"Administrative rights\" could apply if requesting admin rights. The ticket text is somewhat unclear, with phrases like \"added visible\" possibly meaning \"visibility added.\" Ultimately, since the user asked me to categorize this ticket, I think I should create a JSON-like object for the category selection.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
