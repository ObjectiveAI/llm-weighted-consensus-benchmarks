There's also mention of Outlook and difficulties in receiving client requests, which reinforces the idea that this is primarily about access. So, I believe the appropriate categorization is \"Access.\" I'll output the final answer in a JSON-like format, ensuring that \"Access\" is capitalized correctly. Let\u2019s finalize that!**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI need to focus on delivering just the JSON object since the user requested a clear categorization. Bullet lists are acceptable but not required here, so I'll keep it straightforward. The category to output is \"Access,\" ensuring that it\u2019s formatted correctly. My final delivery will strictly be the JSON without any extra text to keep it valid. Let\u2019s get this done! Here\u2019s the output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
