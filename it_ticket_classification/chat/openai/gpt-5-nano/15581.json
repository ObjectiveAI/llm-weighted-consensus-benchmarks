It touches on confidentiality and storing information. While it could be under \"Storage\" due to organizing files, it also discusses access rights. Since \"Access\" is explicitly mentioned, that may be the right fit.**Categorizing information preparation**\n\nThis ticket seems focused on preparing interim information and organizing files. The user mentions creating folders, storing, and uploading information, along with confidentiality concerns. While I see categories for \"Admin rights\" and \"Access,\" there's no explicit mention of admin rights\u2014just coordination around file management. I think \"Storage\" is the best category since it's about organizing and uploading information. \"Internal Project\" could also fit but is less clear. Ultimately, I\u2019ll classify it under \"Storage\" and respond with a JSON object for the category schema.**Crafting JSON response**\n\nThe required format for the response is clear: it needs to be a JSON object with a specific structure. The instruction is to categorize the IT ticket, so I should respond with a JSON object containing the \"category\" field. Based on the schema, I\u2019ll output something like {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. While \"Internal Project\" might fit, \"Storage\" is more precise here. I'll keep it simple and just output the JSON object without any extra text to ensure it\u2019s valid."
