It seems a bit jumbled, mentioning things like \"mobile licenses\" and \"inactivated licenses.\" I should map it to one of the defined categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. It likely falls under Access or Purchase since it involves software license management. Maybe Administrative rights too, if it's about access and payment! Let's clarify.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm thinking \"Access\" might be the best category since this ticket revolves around access to software licenses. It could also be \"Purchase\" if they're requesting new licenses, but it seems like they might want to deactivate existing ones based on the text. The phrase about inactivating licenses clearly points to access issues related to license management, but not administrative rights. Therefore, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" and prepare the final answer in the required JSON format!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
