The user is trying to select the most recent version from a list but can't, possibly because two older versions are appearing instead. This issue makes it tough to choose the \"most recent one.\" Now, I'm tasked with categorizing this IT ticket into one of the predefined categories like Access or Administrative rights. I need to think about what fits best.**Classifying the software bug**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize a software bug in a management tool. The categories available are somewhat limited, such as \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Access.\" Since this bug relates to accessing the most recent version, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit, especially since it pertains to an internal tool. I think I\u2019ll proceed with \"Internal Project\" as my category and respond with a JSON object that includes the category key.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
