It could fit into categories like Hardware, Purchase, or Administrative rights. But since the primary focus seems to be on installing the second monitor, the best fit is likely Hardware. However, the mention of receipts could lean towards Purchase, but the core issue revolves around the monitor installation. So, Hardware it is!**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nIn IT ticket taxonomy, issues related to hardware installation are categorized as Hardware. I need to respond in a JSON-like format. The instructions clearly ask for a simple structure that includes a \"category\" field with an enumerated type. So, I\u2019ll format my response as follows: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It\u2019s important to keep it concise and without extra commentary to stick to the expected output! Let's finalize this as a clean JSON object."
