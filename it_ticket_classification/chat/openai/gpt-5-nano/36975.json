I want to ensure that I\u2019m picking the best category that aligns with the user's needs, so I\u2019ll carefully consider what the ticket is about before making a decision.**Understanding the ticket issue**\n\nThe content is quite messy, but it appears to be about external clients facing issues with the Poseidon service. They need assistance with a review and update on these problems. Key phrases include \"remote server authentication required,\" \"delivery failed,\" and \"permission issues.\" It looks like messages are being rejected or restricted, which might be preventing proper delivery. I\u2019ll need to investigate these issues and gather more details to assist effectively.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI suspect there might be issues related to email delivery or access control regarding Poseidon, which seems to be an application or platform. Key terms like \"server,\" \"transport,\" and \"encryption\" come up, pointing to access problems for external clients. Considering the categories I have\u2014Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights\u2014it seems that \"Access\" would be the most fitting category. I should classify the ticket as such and prepare to output the relevant JSON.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
