So it\u2019ll look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Interpreting ticket request**\n\nI need to interpret this ticket, which appears to be about creating a \"testing discipline\" in Confluence. It mentions a \"called testing discipline\" and possibly includes templates or key points. The text references \"people managers\" and a \"senior test engineer,\" which might suggest it's for an Internal Project, given it's about project documentation.\n\nI should categorize it under \"Internal Project,\" as it seems to be focused on creating a Confluence page, but it could also align with \"Administrative rights\" if access is implied, although that's not explicitly stated.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
