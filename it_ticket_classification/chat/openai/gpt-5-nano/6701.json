The relevant categories are \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", and others. Since they mention \"backpack order\" and it's clearly a request for a physical item, this seems to fit best in either the \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware\" category. However, \"Administrative rights\" doesn't apply here, and while \"HR Support\" relates to internships, it\u2019s an IT ticket. I\u2019ll choose the most suitable category.**Classifying IT ticket request**\n\nIn the IT ticket system, I need to classify a request involving backpacks. The phrase \"backpack request\" indicates this is likely for interns. I'm considering whether this should go under \"Purchase,\" \"Hardware,\" or even \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it\u2019s about backpacks, which are physical items, \"Hardware\" makes sense, but \"Purchase\" feels more relevant for procurement. I think the safest choice here is to classify it as \"Purchase.\" I should prepare to respond with the category in JSON format.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI see that I need to categorize an IT ticket using a specific format. The instruction is clear: I should output a JSON object with the category field set to \"Purchase.\" It looks like the required format is just the category, but I might be able to include a brief justification. However, the main focus is delivering the category accurately in the specified schema. I\u2019ll respond with exactly: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Keeping it minimal seems best for the application."
