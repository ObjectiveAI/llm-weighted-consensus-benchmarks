The options are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The user\u2019s message includes terms like \"new starter access card\" and \"access provisioning,\" which aligns with the Access category. It might also fit under Admin rights since it involves enabling access. However, Access seems to be the most suitable category for this request.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering whether the ticket should be categorized as \"Hardware\" since the access card is hardware. However, the main focus is access provisioning for a new starter, with mentions of the starter form and assistance requests. The primary theme revolves around getting access enabled for the new starter. Therefore, \"Access\" is indeed the most appropriate category. I\u2019ll provide the output in a JSON-like format: {\"category\": \"Access\"}."
