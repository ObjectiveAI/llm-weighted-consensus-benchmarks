The text is a bit garbled, but it mentions visibility, Oracle, and urgent approval, which gives me clues. \"Is not visible oracle by me\" suggests it might relate to the Oracle database's visibility. The urgent approval aspect hints at an issue with access or administrative rights. So, I\u2019m considering the possible categories of Access, Administrative rights, or Miscellaneous. This ticket mainly seems to revolve around access control and visibility for the Oracle database.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe text from the ticket is pretty hard to parse, but it includes phrases about visibility and urgent approval regarding Oracle. This leads me to believe it relates primarily to access issues for the Oracle system. So, I think categorizing it as \"Access\" makes sense since it deals with visibility and approval. I\u2019ll outline a concise response indicating that the category is \u201cAccess\u201d, which fits within the existing schema. The output should be a JSON object formatted as {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
