The category options are limited to specific strings: [\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", \"Administrative rights\"]. Given the request for help and setup instructions, I'm leaning toward either \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Internal Project,\" but I\u2019m still not entirely sure about the best fit. It\u2019s a little tricky to decide!**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket. The user\u2019s message hints at setup instructions, and given the allowed categories\u2014like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, and others\u2014I\u2019m thinking it could fit as \"Miscellaneous\" since it\u2019s vague. However, part of me wonders if \"Access\" might be appropriate, especially if it involves login issues. The user seems to struggle with something not working properly, so I\u2019ll lean towards \"Miscellaneous\" for general IT support. It's a bit tricky, but that's my best guess!**Choosing default category**\n\nGiven the lack of specific information, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best default category for this IT ticket. However, if they need instructions for something requiring admin rights, \"Administrative rights\" might also be relevant. I need to keep it simple and respond with just the JSON output, formatted like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. The instructions suggest no extra text, so I\u2019ll make sure to stick to that and provide the clean JSON object without additional comments."
