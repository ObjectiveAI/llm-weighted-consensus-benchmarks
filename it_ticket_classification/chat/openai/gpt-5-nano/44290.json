It mentions changing contact information, \"ext hub,\" and notifying about changes with colleagues in Belgrade. Given these points, I\u2019m pondering whether this fits better under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The phrase \"contact info changed\" could imply a security or account access issue. I need to choose the most appropriate category from my list to ensure it gets addressed correctly.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering what category fits this ticket best since it involves changing contact information. It could relate to \"Access\" because that indicates system access, or \"Administrative rights\" for admin privileges. The mention of \"Ext hub\" might refer to something specific, like \"Exchange Hub,\" while \"Belgrade\" could be a location linked to an internal communication. Since it's about contact info changes, I think \"Access\" is most fitting, but I'm also pondering whether it leans more towards \"HR\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm looking at the ticket categories and see \"HR Support,\" but this isn't quite an HR issue since the user is just informing about a change in contact info. It might need an update in the directory, but \"Administrative rights\" relates more to who can access and change that info. \"Internal Project\" doesn't fit here, and \"Miscellaneous\" feels vague. I think \"Access\" fits best because the change hints at a potential security concern regarding identity and access changes. So, I\u2019d categorize it as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
