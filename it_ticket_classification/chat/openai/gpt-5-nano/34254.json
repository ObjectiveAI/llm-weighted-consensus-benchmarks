This clearly falls under hardware issues. So, I would categorize it primarily as a hardware problem related to the laptop, with \"Purchase\" being relevant too since a new device would be needed.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI have categories to choose from: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket reports hardware failure on a laptop and mentions that a replacement is needed. While it could fall under \"Purchase\" for procurement, it primarily deals with a hardware issue. So, I will categorize it as \"Hardware.\" I should also note this, and prepare to respond with a category object in JSON format as the instructions specify.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nThe user wants the category to be presented in JSON format. I\u2019ll format the output simply as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I need to keep it concise since no explanation is requested. I should double-check for any additional constraints, but I see the \"Image input capabilities: Enabled\" is not relevant here. So, I\u2019ll make sure to present just the JSON output, ensuring that I stick with the user's request."
