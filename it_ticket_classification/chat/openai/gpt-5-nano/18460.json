This looks like an IT ticket for an internal project, but the term \"Internal Project\" is a bit vague. Given the context, it seems that \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit, as it involves enabling features and potentially changing permissions. I think I'll respond with a JSON object indicating \"Administrative rights\" for the category.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe content revolves around library versioning and activating features like \"history\" and \"keeping minor versions.\" It seems like \"Access\" could be suitable, especially if restrictions prevent activating certain documents. However, since activating history and versioning seems more about permissions, I'd lean towards \"Administrative rights.\" This category captures the need for modifying library settings. Given the repeated references to activating features, I\u2019ll choose \"Administrative rights\" for the JSON response as requested.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nThe system instructs me to return a JSON object with the category. I need to make sure the formatting is precise and doesn't include extra content. So, I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I want to ensure that it matches the expected schema, which requires the category property as a string. This seems straightforward, so I\u2019ll go ahead and deliver the output exactly as required."
