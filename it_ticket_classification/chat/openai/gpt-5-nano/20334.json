It seems to relate to HR topics like attendance, time reporting, and maternity leave updates. Given the content, \"HR Support\" looks like the most fitting category. There\u2019s also a mention of \"change control,\" which might suggest some relationship to processes, but \"HR Support\" is still the best choice here. \"Administrative rights\" doesn't seem relevant based on what the user provided.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe content of the ticket is about timesheets and leave requests, which suggests it should be categorized as \"HR Support.\" Since the user is asking to categorize this IT ticket, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object indicating the category. The format will be straightforward: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`. \n\nAlthough the instruction doesn\u2019t require an explanation, I think it might be nice to add a brief note if needed. However, the primary focus will simply be on providing that JSON response.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
