They mention administrative rights too, which makes me think the \"Access\" category is likely the most fitting for this ticket. It\u2019s a bit jumbled, but I think I\u2019ve got the gist!**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI see that the ticket could fall under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" depending on the privileges involved. It's all about access to resources outside the offices, and the user has mentioned past issues. Since the focus is specifically on access, the \"Access\" category fits best. Now, I need to format the response as a JSON object, as specified. I'll provide the category value in the required format without any extra text.**Finalizing the category**\n\nI need to double-check the nuances for this IT ticket. While \"Internal Project\" could be an option since it\u2019s about facilitating access, it's more of a general support request. The categories include \"Administrative rights,\" which could apply if elevated privileges are needed, but the user hasn\u2019t explicitly mentioned that. Instead, they are primarily asking for help with accessing resources outside the offices. Given this focus, I feel confident that \"Access\" is the correct category: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let\u2019s deliver!"
