Since it could fit a couple of categories, I'll choose the one that best aligns with the user's request. So, it seems \"HR Support\" is the most fitting choice.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket appears to involve a new starter and form completion, hinting at \"Access\" for user provisioning. However, there's no clear mention of access or passwords. The phrase \"help by filling out starter form\" indicates it\u2019s likely about onboarding. Between \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights,\" I should lean towards \"Access\" because it fits the context better. It looks like I can categorize this ticket as \"Access,\" and I need to format my response as a JSON object with a \"category\" key.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket regarding a \"new starter\" and filling out a form. I need to follow the format of a JSON object with the \"category\" key. It could be \"Access\" since it suggests onboarding and might involve provisioning user accounts. Alternatively, \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights\" also seem fitting, but \"Access\" aligns better with tasks related to systems access. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" for my final JSON response.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
