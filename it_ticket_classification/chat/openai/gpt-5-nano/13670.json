The ticket mentions \"leavers,\" which typically refers to employees leaving an organization, along with access revocation and offboarding. Given the context, this ticket could fit into either \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" Since it involves personnel updates and offboarding schedules, it seems appropriate to categorize it under \"HR Support\" for handling these inquiries effectively.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe content highlights \"leavers\" and \"leaving announcements,\" suggesting offboarding tasks like disabling access. I need to choose between \"Access\" and \"HR Support\" as the appropriate IT ticket category. Since the focus is mainly on access revocation for leavers, \"Access\" seems the most fitting. Although \"HR Support\" is a valid option, \"Access\" better captures the essence of managing access for leavers. However, I can't forget about \"Administrative rights\" as a subcategory under access. I'm still weighing my options here!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ve concluded that the best category for this IT ticket is \"Access,\" as it deals with updates about leavers and revoking access. To respond correctly, I need to format my answer as a JSON object with the category specified. According to the provided format, it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I should stick to this structure without adding any extra commentary. However, I\u2019m still thinking about how \u201cHR Support\u201d could also apply since it involves HR processes.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nIn this IT ticket classification, the topic of leavers relates to tasks like offboarding and disabling accounts. Since the user is asking for categorization, the most appropriate category is \"Access.\" I need to ensure we keep things simple and follow instructions to avoid heavy formatting. I\u2019ll provide just the JSON object for clarity. So, let\u2019s finalize the response by delivering: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This keeps everything straightforward!"
