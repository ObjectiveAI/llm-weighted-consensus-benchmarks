The ticket seems to describe an issue with ServiceNow where the user can\u2019t move to the next page when running reports. They can access other pages, but the button to proceed doesn\u2019t work, regardless of the browser used. Considering the provided categories, it sounds like this falls under \"Miscellaneous\" since it's more of a general issue rather than specific hardware or access problems.**Categorizing ServiceNow Issue**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a strange issue with ServiceNow where the user can\u2019t go to the next page while running reports. They see that other pages exist, but clicking the button doesn't work, regardless of the browser. It's definitely a software-related issue involving pagination. I\u2019m considering categorizing it under \"Access,\" since it relates to UI access, but it\u2019s not about permissions or login. So, \"Miscellaneous\" might actually be the better fit in this case.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how to categorize the user's IT ticket. It seems the best fit is \"Miscellaneous\" since it involves a ServiceNow bug that doesn't match other specific categories. While \"Internal Project\" could apply to internal tool issues, this doesn't quite fit that description. I\u2019ll structure my output as a JSON object with \"category\" set to \"Miscellaneous.\" This follows the required format nicely, ensuring I've met the instruction to categorize this ticket properly. I'll finalize that now!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
