The user says they can\u2019t log into Workday and also wants to create a template and an incidents table. It seems like this is most related to an HR Support issue, as Workday is an HR/payroll system. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll output the category as a JSON object, specifying \"HR Support\" based on this interpretation.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions needing a template for Tuesday and highlights an access issue with Workday, which is clearly related to logging in. This directs me toward the \"Access\" category, but there\u2019s also the potential for it to fit under \"HR Support\" since Workday deals with HR tasks. \n\nHowever, \"Access\" wins out as the more general and fitting category for the login issue. Now, I\u2019ll respond with the appropriate JSON object reflecting the \"Access\" category.**Confirming ticket category**\n\nI need to double-check that the ticket mentions a \"template for Tuesday\" and also creating an \"incidents table\" and \"assignment default.\" Those could imply templates, which might suggest categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" But since the primary issue is the inability to log into Workday, I conclude that \"Access\" is still the best fit. \n\nSo, I'll finalize the response as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Now, I\u2019m ready to respond with that!"
