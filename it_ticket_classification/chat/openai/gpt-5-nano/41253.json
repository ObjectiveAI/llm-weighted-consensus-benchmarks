The ticket mentions a timekeeping server being down, with the user unable to access one of the servers. They seem to be working with timekeeping code and have two servers available. Since it revolves around access to a server, it likely fits best under the \"Access\" category.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m debating how to categorize this IT ticket. The issue involves a server being down, which might suggest \"Hardware,\" but the user specifically mentions they're unable to access one of the servers. So, I think \"Access\" is the better fit. While there could be some questions about whether it relates to infrastructure or even internal projects, the core issue really revolves around access rights. Thus, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" since that addresses their specific problem.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
