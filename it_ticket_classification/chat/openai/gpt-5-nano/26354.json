It seems they're asking about their ability to install software themselves, which suggests it could fall under \"Administrative rights.\" It could also relate to \"Access\" due to installation permissions, and perhaps \"Miscellaneous.\" If the mention of \"prototypes\" connects to an internal project, then \"Internal Project\" might fit as well. I'll prepare a JSON-like category object accordingly.**Determining category output**\n\nThe required output format is clear: it needs to be a JSON object with a category property. The user's request was to categorize an IT ticket, and based on the context, \"Administrative rights\" seems like a fitting choice. I should ensure the category value is specified correctly. Despite some confusion about whether to include the top-level type in the JSON, I think it\u2019s sufficient to just note the category within the object structure: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.**Providing a category response**\n\nI need to respond concisely with the category for the IT ticket. Based on phrases like \"install application\" and \"by myself procedure follow,\" it seems clear they\u2019re asking about permissions. While \"Access\" could also fit, the mention of installation strongly points to needing \"Administrative rights.\" Therefore, I\u2019ll keep my output simple and confirm this choice.\n\nHere\u2019s the response: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
