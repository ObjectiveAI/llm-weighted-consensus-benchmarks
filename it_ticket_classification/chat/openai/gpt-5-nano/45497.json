It's quite jumbled but points towards access issues related to the timesheet and possibly password changes. I think it fits best under \"Access.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket mostly seems to involve access issues, especially with phrases like \"can log into changed password recently might be connected.\" The mention of a timesheet and Oracle issue hints at possible system problems, but I think it's best categorized under \"Access\" due to the password change and login context. Despite the repeated lines about \"contractor senior developer engineer,\" which might just be noise, the main actionable items relate to access. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and prepare to output the category in a JSON-like format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
