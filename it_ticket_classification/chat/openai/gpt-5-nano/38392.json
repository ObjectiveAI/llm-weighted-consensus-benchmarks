The user can't access Quality Center through Internet Explorer or the dedicated application, which they installed recently. They mention getting an error, but it\u2019s unclear what it is. I\u2019m thinking this primarily falls under the \"Access\" category. However, it could also be \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are necessary, but there\u2019s no specific mention of that. So, I think \"Access\" is the best fit for this ticket.**Finalizing JSON Output**\n\nI realize this issue is mainly software-related, not hardware, so \"HR Support\" isn\u2019t relevant. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if admin access is needed, this is more about general access to a tool. Therefore, I need to categorize it as \"Access.\" \n\nThe system requires me to format this in JSON structure, specifically as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll ensure to match the required structure exactly, responding with the final JSON object containing \"category\": \"Access.\" Let's go ahead with that!"
