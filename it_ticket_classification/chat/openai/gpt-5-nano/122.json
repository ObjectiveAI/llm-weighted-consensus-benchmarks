It seems the main themes focus on onboarding, which typically falls under \"HR Support\" or might even touch on \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it\u2019s about a new employee starting, I think \"HR Support\" is likely, but \"Access\" could fit too, as they would require system access. I\u2019ll aim for the best match!**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe text mentions \"forms attached,\" which suggests the ticket is related to onboarding, making \"HR Support\" a valid choice. However, since we're focused on an IT context, \"Access\" could be more suitable, especially if it's about system access for a new starter. I need to categorize this accurately in JSON format, ensuring it conforms to the allowed categories. The phrase \"new starter\" typically aligns with onboarding, but the forms might indicate IT access needs as well. Balancing these considerations is key!**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket related to onboarding. Given that it mentions \"forms attached,\" it typically points to \"HR Support\" for onboarding. However, since this is within the IT context, \"Access\" might be a better fit for provisioning. Still, the string doesn\u2019t clearly mention access or permissions, so I feel like \"HR Support\" is valid here. Ultimately, I think \"Access\" is the best compromise, but provided in a valid JSON format to meet the user\u2019s request.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket is likely in the IT system, especially since it involves setting up a new starter. The mention of \"forms attached\" suggests that these forms are to be processed by the IT team. Since the user asked for a category, the simplest and most appropriate match would indeed be \"HR Support\" because of the \"new starter\" context. I'll go ahead and output it in JSON format as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} and deliver it!"
