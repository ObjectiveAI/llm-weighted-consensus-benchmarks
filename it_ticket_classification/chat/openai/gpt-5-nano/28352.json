The mentioned items like \"cooler stand\" and \"purchase order\" seem relevant to either \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" Since the ticket involves hardware allocation, I think it best fits the \"Hardware\" category. However, there seems to be some overlap with procurement elements. I'll go ahead and categorize it as an IT ticket, focusing on the hardware aspect.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe text mentions a \"cooler stand,\" suggesting it's a hardware item. It talks about creating an allocation and includes terms like \"receipts\" and \"purchase order,\" which could imply procurement details. Based on the main focus on the cooler stand and the allocation involved, I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit. I need to structure my output in JSON format and simply provide that. I'll prepare the response as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
