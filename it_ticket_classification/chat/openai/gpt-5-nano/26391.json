The options for categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.\n\nI need to determine which category aligns best with the ticket contents, which seems to focus on backup and disaster recovery efforts. It looks like \"Storage\" might be the most fitting choice given the context. Then, I'll generate the corresponding JSON output with that category.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a text that focuses on disaster recovery testing and backup processes. It mentions things like restoring backups, template documentation, and expected outputs. I\u2019m considering whether it fits best under \u201cStorage\u201d or \u201cInternal Project.\u201d \n\nGiven that the content revolves around backup processes and disaster recovery efforts, \u201cStorage\u201d seems to fit nicely as it addresses backup storage. However, it could also be an \u201cInternal Project\u201d focused on disaster recovery planning. I\u2019ll lean towards \u201cStorage\u201d for this categorization.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT Ticket that deals with disaster recovery testing. I\u2019m considering \"Internal Project,\" but it might be better to go with \"Storage\" since that seems to align more closely with the backup and restore focus of the content. The ticket mentions \"annual service recovery test,\" indicating it's a technical exercise, yet without a \u201cDisaster Recovery\u201d category, \u201cStorage\u201d is the most fitting choice. \n\nI'll create a JSON object indicating the category as \"Storage.\"{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
