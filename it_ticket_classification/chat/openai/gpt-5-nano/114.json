They mention things like \"new service configuration,\" \"periscope support,\" and \"infrastructure monitoring.\" \n\nIt seems like the most appropriate categories could be \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it's focused on configuring a new service and setting up infrastructure, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best fit here. The emphasis on service configuration suggests it's a project rather than just about access rights or admin settings.**Categorizing IT ticket response**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the available categories and deciding to go with \"Internal Project.\" This fits well since the ticket is about internal IT tasks, Periscope service configuration, and infrastructure monitoring.\n\nI think \"Miscellaneous\" could work too, but \"Internal Project\" feels more accurate. I need to craft a concise response in the required JSON format. The output should be straightforward: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI\u2019ll stick to just the JSON since the instructions focus on providing the category. Let's deliver that!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
