The message mentions a full mailbox and a request to extend the space, indicating this is a storage issue. It also mentions deleting items, which suggests it's about maintaining space. The relevant category here is definitely Storage since it\u2019s focused on increasing mailbox capacity, not Administrative rights. I\u2019ll format the response in JSON as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. That seems right to me!**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket as instructed. The response must be in JSON format, so I\u2019ll ensure it matches the required structure. Based on the input, the appropriate category is definitely \"Storage.\" I\u2019ll format the output as {\"category\":\"Storage\"} to meet the tool's expectations. It's important to be concise here, so I'll deliver it succinctly while complying with the standards set by the system. That feels like the right approach!"
