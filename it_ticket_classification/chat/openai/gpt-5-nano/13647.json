It seems they want to pass Sonar access to someone, likely a design lead, and they're referencing a timeframe of Tuesday PM. I'll classify this ticket under \"Access\" since it primarily involves granting access to Sonar, which might be a tool related to SonarQube. There\u2019s a lot to unpack, but \"Access\" seems to be the best fit!**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket is really about the \"Access\" category, possibly \"Administrative rights\" since it involves managing access to a tool. The user is basically directing someone to grant Sonar access by Tuesday PM, which points to access rights management. While \"Internal Project\" could fit if it's project-related, the focus is definitely on granting access, making \"Access\" the more precise category. I think I'll go with \"Access\" for this ticket!**Choosing the right category**\n\nI'm considering whether to categorize this ticket as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" While \"Administrative rights\" implies a request for admin privileges, the ticket focuses on passing access, which leans towards \"Access.\" The mention of a \"design lead\" suggests a specific user role, but it\u2019s not entirely clear if they need admin rights for Sonar. To keep it straightforward, I'll go with \"Access\" as the category for the JSON response since it aligns best with the request.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
