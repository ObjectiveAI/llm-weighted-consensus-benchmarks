Based on the description, it seems to fit best under the \"Access\" category, though it could also relate to \"Administrative rights\" if it involves permissions. However, I think \"Access\" is more appropriate since it's specifically about deactivating a card. I\u2019ll respond in the specified JSON format while making sure everything\u2019s clear and correct!**Producing JSON schema**\n\nThe required schema indicates that I need to create a JSON object with a \"category\" field. Based on the schema provided, I\u2019ll output a JSON response that clearly states the category for the IT ticket. Given the contents reference various terms related to deactivating a visitor card, it's clear that the category is \"Access.\" \n\nI\u2019ll ensure the formatting is correct and that there\u2019s no extra text in my response. Here it goes: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
