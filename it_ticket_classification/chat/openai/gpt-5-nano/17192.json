The user mentions an \"internal AM project\" and related terms like \"git,\" \"repository,\" and \"induction tool.\" It feels like this ticket is mainly about an internal project, but there\u2019s also a sense of access since they reference a repository and source files. I'll focus on the key elements like \"internal,\" \"project,\" and \"induction tool,\" which seem to point towards an \"Internal Project\" category.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe user is looking for a requested induction tool, which might relate to an induction tool repository. I lean towards categorizing this as \"Internal Project,\" given the mention of an \"internal AM project.\" However, since there are references to access, like the \"git repository,\" it could also fall under \"Access.\" The text includes details about git and the induction tool, and this suggests a focus on provisioning an application related to the internal project. So overall, \"Internal Project\" seems most fitting.**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nThe \"Internal Project\" category feels appropriate for tasks related to internal projects. While there\u2019s also the \"Administrative rights\" category, there aren't any explicit rights mentioned in the ticket. The user's content includes keywords like \"internal,\" \"project,\" and \"induction tool,\" so \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best match. I\u2019ll go ahead and format my response as a JSON object with the category field set to \"Internal Project\": {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. However, I wonder if \"Access\" might also be relevant; I\u2019ll stick with \"Internal Project\" for now.**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket has phrases like \"host git\" and \"requested induction tool,\" which hint at needing access to a git host, but there\u2019s no clear request for access or creating a new repository. It feels more like a request for the induction tool name and related repository. Given this context, tagging it as \"Internal Project\" feels appropriate. I'll craft the final answer as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This should meet the format requirements perfectly."
