The text mentions changing the owner of a users list and something about Active Directory. It seems like this request fits into either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" given that it's focused on ownership and rights modifications. I need to pinpoint the best category, and \"Administrative rights\" feels like the right choice because it typically deals with granting or modifying admin privileges.**Categorizing Access Rights**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a request involving the phrase \"owner,\" which suggests a desire to manage ownership of a user list related to Active Directory (or AD). This seems like it\u2019s about altering permissions, making it fit under either \"Access\" (for general access rights) or \"Administrative rights\" (for more specific requests). Given it\u2019s about ownership transfer, I think \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit. I\u2019ll need to output this in the specified JSON format. So, it should look like: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
