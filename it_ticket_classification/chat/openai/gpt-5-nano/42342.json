It sounds like there's a report that sends incident logs, but even after deleting certain users, the report is still being sent. The phrase \"deleted people are still the sent Wednesday incidents\" suggests the report might not be functioning as expected. I should clarify if the report includes incidents related to past occurrences after users were deleted.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user is asking to disable a report titled \"incidents logged for previous.\" It sounds like this report automatically sends an Excel file to multiple users, but even after some users were deleted, the report continues to be sent. I need to categorize this ticket based on its content, which includes reporting, automation, incidents, and access. It seems like it may involve an operational issue, but I\u2019m unsure whether it fits best under Administrative rights or another category.**Deciding Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this ticket. The user seems to be dealing with access issues related to a report that still sends even after some users have deleted it. Given the overlapping aspects, \"Access\" seems most relevant since it's about report access and subscriptions. There's also a possibility of it falling under \"Administrative rights\" if modifying the report requires admin privileges. But overall, it feels more like a reporting/automation issue focused on management, making \"Access\" the best fit.**Delivering Category Response**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the ticket as \"Access.\" Now, I need to provide the result in the requested format, which looks like a JSON object. The prompt specifically asks for a category field, so I\u2019ll structure my response accordingly without extra explanations. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This aligns perfectly with the allowed categories in the user's request. Now, let\u2019s deliver that cleanly."
