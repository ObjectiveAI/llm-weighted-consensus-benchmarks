The available categories are: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the mention of meeting invites, it seems related to access issues or something more general. It might fit \"Access\" for calendar access or \"Miscellaneous\" if I'm unsure. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object accordingly.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket, which might relate to an internal project or administrative rights since it involves sending meeting invites. The mentions of \"how make possible,\" \"addresses,\" and \"announcements\" suggest it\u2019s about setting up a mailing list or distribution group. \"Access\" seems appropriate since it\u2019s likely about calendar access and permissions. Alternatively, if they're asking for permission to manage invites for everyone, it could also fit \"Administrative rights.\"**Choosing ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s message about sending meeting invites suggests they need help with accessing invitations for announcements. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Access\" seems best since it relates to permissions needed to send invites. It could also be an \"Internal Project\" if it's project-specific, but I'll stick with \"Access.\" I\u2019ll prepare to output the JSON object with the category value as \"Access\" in the specified format."
