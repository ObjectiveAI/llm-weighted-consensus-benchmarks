They mentioned it worked last week, but now it doesn't load on startup, although the program opens when clicked. It seems like a startup issue\u2014possibly software related since the program launches. I should choose between Hardware and Software, but Miscellaneous could fit if it\u2019s more complicated. I'll think through the best category carefully!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI see that there\u2019s no explicit \u201cSoftware\u201d category for this IT ticket. The issue seems tied to the laptop not loading at startup, which could fit under \u201cHardware.\u201d Still, since the program works once clicked, it seems a bit complex. \"Miscellaneous\" might work for unclear issues, but typically, I'd classify it under \"Hardware\" if it\u2019s a boot issue. However, I must consider \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d only if related to login or permissions. It\u2019s a tricky call!**Classifying the IT issue**\n\nIt seems like the user is dealing with a startup issue where the laptop fails to load properly, but the program opens when initiated manually. This points towards possible Windows startup problems, which could lean towards \"Software\" issues, yet there\u2019s no specific software category. I might classify it under \"Hardware\" since it involves boot issues, but it\u2019s still ambiguous enough that \"Miscellaneous\" could fit better. I'll follow the schema and create a JSON object with the selected category.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
