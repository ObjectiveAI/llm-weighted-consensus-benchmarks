It seems like they\u2019re asking for assistance with removing a shared mailbox from Outlook and want to know how to delete it. Given the ticket content, I could categorize this as either \"Access\" due to issues with mailbox access or \"Administrative rights\" if they require permission to remove it. Let's map it accordingly!**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt looks like the ticket is about removing a shared mailbox in Outlook, which makes me think it's an \"Access\" issue rather than a hardware one. If the user doesn't have the rights to remove it, then \"Administrative rights\" could also fit. However, they seem to want to delete something, so I'll choose \"Access\" as the most relevant category since it's focused on modifying access. I need to respond with a JSON object that reflects this choice in the required format!**Responding with JSON category**\n\nI need to respond to the ticket by providing the category in a specific JSON format. Based on the request regarding assistance with removing a shared mailbox from Outlook, \"Access\" makes the most sense. Even though there\u2019s a schema mentioned, I\u2019ll simply need to respond with {\"category\":\"Access\"} to meet the requirements. I\u2019ll keep it concise and ensure that there\u2019s no extra commentary. Let's finalize this response now!"
