This seems related to BitLocker encryption. I\u2019m considering options like \"Access,\" since they can\u2019t get into the system, or \"Administrative rights,\" but that might not fit. I\u2019ll weigh my options carefully to choose the best category.**Categorizing ticket format**\n\nI'm thinking this is likely a \"Recovery key\" prompt related to security. The \"Access\" category makes the most sense here since it's about gaining access to the machine, while \"Storage\" might relate to storage devices but doesn't fit as well. The categories are limited, so I need to respond with a JSON object formatted according to the system\u2019s requirements, including the category value. I\u2019ll present the JSON object neatly for clarity!**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI need to provide the output as a JSON object with the \"category\" field. Based on the information I gathered, \"Access\" is the appropriate category since the user can't boot the system and is encountering a recovery key prompt. While \"Hardware\" could be an option due to the production machine, the issue more directly relates to access instead. I\u2019ll finalize the output without any extra text, presenting just: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
