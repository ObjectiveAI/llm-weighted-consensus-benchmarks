Given the phrases like \"mandatory receipts section\" and \"order receive item,\" it seems related to a new purchase order. The appropriate categories could be \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware,\" but it might also touch on \"Administrative rights.\" Overall, it looks like it's primarily about the procurement and installation of hardware.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe category of \"Hardware\" fits here since it's about a keyboard. However, \"Purchase\" seems more appropriate because the user mentions a purchase order and receipts. I should really pick the category that best fits the ticket. Although \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" don't apply here, \"Miscellaneous\" feels too vague. The best option is \"Purchase\" since it aligns with the details provided. I\u2019ll output it in a JSON format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}, making sure it follows the exact structure needed.**Finalizing ticket response**\n\nI see that providing a brief justification could be helpful, but the instruction only asks for the category. It specifically says, \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" and lists the categories. Typically, I should just respond with the category value. Since they've defined a JSON schema, I\u2019ll follow that format. The expected output is a category object, so I'll present it as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Now, let's deliver this response!"
