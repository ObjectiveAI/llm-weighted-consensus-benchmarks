The ticket mentions issues with files, folders, and procedures related to backup server policies. The provided categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" Since \"Disaster Recovery\" isn't an option, I\u2019m thinking \u201cStorage\u201d or \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d would fit best. I'll go with \"Storage\" for categorization.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis ticket is about missing backup files and a disaster recovery test, so I'm considering categorizing it as \"Storage,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Given the focus on backup files and server policies, \"Storage\" seems the most fitting choice. I\u2019ll craft the answer in JSON format as required, which should look like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. Since the output should only include the JSON object, I'll format it for clarity and validity, making sure it meets the instructions."
