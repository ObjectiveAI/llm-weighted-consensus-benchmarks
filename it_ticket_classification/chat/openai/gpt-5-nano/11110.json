It looks like they're referring to a \"new purchase,\" purchase orders, and receipts. Based on the categories I have\u2014like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Purchase\"\u2014the \"Purchase\" category seems to fit best because it actively mentions purchasing and related terms. While \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" were considered, they don\u2019t seem to align as closely with the user's intent.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI'm deciding to categorize the ticket as \"Purchase.\" Based on the instructions, I need to respond with a JSON-like object that includes the \"category\" field. The required format is clear, and it looks like I should only include the JSON object without any extra commentary. So my final answer will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll stick strictly to presenting this JSON object. There\u2019s no need for additional text, just the category as requested!"
