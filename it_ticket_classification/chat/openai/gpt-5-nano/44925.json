It seems to mention issues like \"won't load for me to approve\" and \"load screen blank.\" They\u2019ve tried different browsers but are still facing the same issue. The message contains requests for assistance and implies some internal confidentiality. There are several phrases repeated like \"please approve,\" and I should focus on those key points to categorize the ticket accurately.**Categorizing Ticket Issue**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket into one of several categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative Rights. It looks like this ticket is about an approval screen that isn\u2019t loading, which brings up questions of access. I wonder if it fits best under \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights,\" as it seems related to an approval flow. The mention of legal disclaimers is just additional context. I\u2019ll decide on the most fitting category before outputting it in JSON format.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nThere's no mention of passwords or access rights in this ticket, just a blank screen. It might fit into the \"Miscellaneous\" category since it\u2019s a general IT issue, but ideally, I\u2019m leaning toward \"Access\" due to the approval context. The blank screen suggests it\u2019s an application issue, though \"Administrative Rights\" could fit if elevated permissions are required. Ultimately, I\u2019m weighing between \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights,\" but since the user wants approval, I think \"Access\" might be the best choice.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
