The system defines specific categories like \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", and others. I'm thinking that the most fitting category for this ticket is \"Access\" since it involves project access and library management settings. However, it could also potentially fall under \"Administrative rights\" because of the request for access permissions. I'll format the result as a JSON object with the selected category.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket states \"project access request\" several times, which makes it a bit unclear. I see the focus is on the \"access request\" related to the library. The categories to choose from are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\". Since it looks like they're asking for general access, I think \"Access\" fits best. The mention of \"library manage setting\" suggests they may want to manage links or settings, but I\u2019ll stick with \"Access\". I'll return the response in the required JSON format."
