The ticket is about an Oracle expense report submission error with duplicate submissions and a VAT form attachment. It seems related to finance, but there\u2019s no finance category. So, I\u2019m deciding between \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Purchase.\" Given it deals with a submission issue, I think \"Miscellaneous\" fits best.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating how to categorize this IT ticket. It doesn\u2019t fit into hardware, HR, or Access categories. It could be \"Miscellaneous\" for general IT issues or \"Internal Project\" if it relates to a specific project, but that's not clear. Since it's about software (Oracle) and there's no specific \"Software\" category, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the best option. I'll respond with a JSON object in the required format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Let\u2019s keep it straightforward!"
