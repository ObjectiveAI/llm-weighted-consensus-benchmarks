It likely falls under the Hardware category due to the mention of the adapter and installation. So, I\u2019ll prepare to output a JSON object with \"category\" marked as \"Hardware.\"**Formulating JSON output**\n\nThe ticket appears to involve the installation of an adapter for a mobile device and mentions a courier delay, so classifying it as Hardware seems fitting. The key terms here are \"adaptor,\" \"SD arrived,\" and \"installation.\" \n\nI need to ensure the output is in the correct JSON format, as specified by the schema. Thus, the final output should be:\n\n{\"category\": \"Hardware\"}\n\nI'll make sure to provide just this JSON object without any additional text."
