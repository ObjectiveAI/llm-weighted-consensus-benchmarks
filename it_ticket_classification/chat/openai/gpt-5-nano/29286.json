The message seems garbled but mentions \"project manager change for systems\" which could relate to role or access changes. \"PM change\" likely refers to the project manager, and \"admin rights\" or \"Access\" could be relevant here. \"Administrative rights\" seems fitting if it\u2019s about requesting access changes. There's also a mention of annual leave in November and December, suggesting scheduling. So, I might go with \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket. It might fit under \"Internal Project\" since it relates to changes in project management. The user doesn\u2019t mention HR Support directly but brings up \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access,\" which could apply. The content is a bit unclear, mentioning \"project manager change for systems\" but doesn't provide much clarity. Given everything, I think \"Internal Project\" is the most suitable category to select. I\u2019ll output it in a JSON-like format.**Formatting response**\n\nI\u2019m ready to format the response as a JSON object. Based on the clues in the ticket, it seems \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category, as it relates to updating the project manager assigned to the systems. While there was some ambiguity in phrases like \"add except code\" and talk about scheduling, it doesn't strongly indicate HR involvement. Therefore, I'll confirm that the category is \"Internal Project.\" The final output will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
