Their repeated mention of access issues clearly indicates it's an access problem. So, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" I should probably format my response as a JSON-like structure since that's what the prompt requires.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe system requires me to respond with a JSON object that includes a category field. Since the ticket clearly relates to access issues, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" I'll also follow the guidelines by ensuring that my response contains only the relevant information. \n\nSo, I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and ensure there\u2019s no extra text. Just the JSON object, keeping it clear and concise as requested!"
