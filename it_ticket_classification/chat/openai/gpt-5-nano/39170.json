The user provided a ticket about an \"oracle issue\" related to annual leave requests, asking for help with a high importance issue. \n\nSince this directly relates to employee leave requests, it fits under HR Support. I have to ensure the output format follows the JSON structure specified, like: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. That aligns perfectly with the category options!**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket focuses on an Oracle issue regarding annual leave requests stuck in \"awaiting approval.\" Since it involves HR-related systems, I first consider whether to categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" However, given the nature of the request, \"HR Support\" is likely the most appropriate category. The user\u2019s message indicates they need help with manager approvals, confirming this classification fits well within the HR context, and yes, \"HR Support\" is indeed included in the enumerations!**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m determining whether to classify this ticket under \"Access\" since it could involve enabling manager approvals. However, since the user isn't requesting access but rather has issues with approvals, it\u2019s clear this is more of an HR system issue. So, the best fit is \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll respond with just the required JSON format, ensuring it follows the correct structure. The output will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. No extra text, just the essential information!"
