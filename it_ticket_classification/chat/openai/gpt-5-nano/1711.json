The categories I can choose from are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket mentions things like a new starter, days off, and some details about a user profile and phone number. I'll need to determine the most suitable category based on the content's context.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s message is a jumble of phrases: \u201cnew starter,\u201d \u201cprofile,\u201d \u201cuser out today,\u201d \u201cdays off February,\u201d and \u201cphone number.\u201d It's difficult to make sense of it all! I\u2019m considering if it fits into any categories like \"Access\" (for user profile access), \"HR Support\" (for days off), or even \"Administrative rights\" (for granting access). It seems \"Access\" is the best fit due to the mention of profile access, but \"Administrative rights\" could also apply.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this ticket as \"Access,\" especially with the mention of a \"new starter\" and user profile issues. It seems like they might be trying to create a new starter ad or looking into new starter access. The phrase \u201cprofile user out today\u201d hints at a user account being disabled. While \u201cupcoming days off February\u201d isn\u2019t about access, the overall context suggests that \"Access\" is the best category, potentially with some clarification needed. It feels like onboarding for a new user!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
