The message isn\u2019t well-structured and doesn\u2019t mention specific software issues. Since the provided categories include \"Access,\" I'll choose that one, as it seems to best fit the situation of having trouble signing in or accessing the system.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like the user's issue is related to signing into Oracle, which suggests that the best category is \"Access\" since they're facing a sign-in error. The mention of \"joiners graduates\" might indicate account provisions for new users, but the core problem is access-related. Given the provided categories, \"Access\" fits perfectly. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object, specifically: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, to align with the specified format.**Finalizing category output**\n\nThe instructions specify that I should output a JSON object following a certain structure. The appropriate category here is \"Access,\" so I\u2019ll craft the final output as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. While I could add a brief note, the important part is ensuring the proper format for the response. Since the task clearly defines that I need to deliver a JSON object with the category, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and just deliver it."
