Given that it specifically talks about lost access, I believe it fits into the \"Access\" category since it relates to access issues. There's a chance it could also be categorized as \"Administrative rights\" or possibly \"Hardware,\" but the mention of the lost access card points strongly toward \"Access.\" So, I\u2019ll go with that and prepare a structured response!**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on providing the correct JSON structure for the IT ticket categorization. The instructions are clear: I need to set the category to \"Access.\" The format is strictly a JSON object, and it should be structured as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. \n\nWhile there's a possibility of considering \"Hardware\" due to the card being a physical item, \"Access\" is more accurate based on the ticket's content. I\u2019ll stick with the precise instruction and deliver only the required JSON without any extra text."
