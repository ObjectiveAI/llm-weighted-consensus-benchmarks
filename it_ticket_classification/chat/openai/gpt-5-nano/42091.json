They\u2019re seeking advice on functionality changes, and it seems to fit in \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" since it could be related to user permissions or a feature change affecting their ability to add reports.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nIf the user can't add reports to the dashboard, it suggests an issue with permissions, which likely falls under \"Administrative rights.\" However, if that's unclear, we might consider \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it's about admin access related to dashboard functionality, \"Administrative rights\" seems most appropriate. \n\nI'll categorize the ticket as Administrative rights, mentioning the reason. It looks like I should respond with a JSON object for clarity, so I'll format it like this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
