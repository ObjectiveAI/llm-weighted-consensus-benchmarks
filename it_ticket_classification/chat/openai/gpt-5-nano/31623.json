The ticket asks for assistance with completion, which relates to HR processes but also suggests access management. Given these points, it seems the best fit is \"HR Support,\" as it primarily involves HR-related forms and assistance. I'll ensure to structure the response in the required JSON-like format for clarity.**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nI'm tasked with categorizing an IT ticket, which mentions an \"access card\" and a \"maternity leaver form.\" Since this relates to access management, the best fit for the category is \"Access.\" Although \"HR Support\" might also apply due to the leaver form, this ticket focuses on IT aspects. The user's request for assistance with the attached form reinforces that it\u2019s about access card provisioning or deactivation. I\u2019ll ensure to create a proper JSON-like output with the \"category\" field set to \"Access.\"**Formatting Output**\n\nI need to format my output according to the required JSON structure, which specifies I should provide an object with a \"category\" property. The category options are restricted to specific types like \"Access.\" For this ticket, I\u2019m going to use \"Access\" since it fits well. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. \n\nThat aligns with the schema perfectly. Including a short explanation isn't necessary because the instruction simply tells me to categorize. So, just sticking to the output is the best approach!"
