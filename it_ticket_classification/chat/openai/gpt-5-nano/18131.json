The user\u2019s message mentions a monitor raiser, which is likely a device for adjusting monitor height. They refer to \"Friday March,\" but it\u2019s not clear what that means. The user indicates some issues with monitor position and expresses thanks to a developer named \"nil.\" Given the categories available\u2014like \"Hardware\" and \"Internal Project\"\u2014I think this should be classified under \"Hardware,\" as it's about a hardware accessory.**Determining category for ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve decided the category for this IT ticket is \"Hardware.\" The user references items like \"monitor raiser,\" \"old monitor,\" and issues with \"height\" affecting \"position.\" They also mention a developer but that's unclear. To meet the user's needs, I\u2019ll provide the response in the required JSON format, ensuring clarity. So I'll deliver the category as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, ensuring there\u2019s no extra content. It's straightforward and to the point!"
