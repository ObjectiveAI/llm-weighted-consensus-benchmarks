The terms in the ticket suggest it pertains to \"mobile phone\" allocation. This indicates it's about hardware, which aligns with the \"Hardware\" category, or it could fall under \"Purchase\" if they intend to buy a new device. Given that they're asking for the allocation to a director, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Purchase\" since it likely involves acquiring equipment.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe user's request is to \"allocate a mobile phone,\" which sounds like a provisioning task. Categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" and \"Internal Project\" don't fit here, while \"Miscellaneous\" could be a stretch. The best choice would be \"Hardware,\" since it involves a hardware device, or possibly \"Purchase\" if they're buying a new one. Given the request may involve provisioning or obtaining a device, I'll lean towards \"Hardware\" for a safer classification. I'll format my response as a JSON object now.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
