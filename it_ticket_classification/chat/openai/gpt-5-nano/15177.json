It doesn't seem to fit \u201cInternal Project\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d nor does it fit most other categories. However, it could be both a systems admin task and somewhat miscellaneous. Given everything, I think \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d might be the best fit for this ticket.**Categorizing IT Operations Ticket**\n\nThis looks more like an IT operations ticket rather than HR or hardware-related issues. There\u2019s no specific category for \"IT Operations\" or \"Software,\" so I need to figure out the best fit. The closest options are \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it discusses updates and deployment, \"Internal Project\" seems to cover the task of managing updates across devices. Therefore, I\u2019m going to categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and present it in the required JSON format."
