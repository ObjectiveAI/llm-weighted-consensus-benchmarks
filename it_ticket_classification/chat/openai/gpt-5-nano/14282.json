It's clear that the issue revolves around managing folder access related to confidential client information. I see mentions of \"restrict folder\" and \"prompt administrator,\" which leads me to think the most fitting categories are \"Storage,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" In this case, \"Storage\" seems to be the best choice given the focus on folder management.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI need to classify this IT ticket that discusses restricting access to a folder, which falls under permissions and administrative rights. The user requests help to secure confidential information regarding client visits, so it definitely relates to access control. While the category \"Access\" seems appropriate, \"Administrative rights\" is also relevant since it involves admin permissions. Given that the user specifically mentions \"restricted storage management,\" I think \"Storage\" might ultimately be the best fit for classification.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI believe the \"Access\" category fits best for this ticket focused on access restrictions. Though \"Administrative rights\" is relevant, the user's mention of needing help from an administrator makes me think permissions are necessary as well. The user's message is a bit garbled, but the emphasis seems to be on restricting access to a folder with confidential information. So, I'll go with \"Access\" as the category and format it as required in JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
