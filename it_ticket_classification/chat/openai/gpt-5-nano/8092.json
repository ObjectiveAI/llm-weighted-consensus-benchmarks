The intention isn't clear, making it tricky to categorize. I think \"Miscellaneous\" fits best since it's ambiguous, but it could also relate to an \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s linked to an ad instruction.**Categorizing a ticket**\n\nI'm considering a user's request that includes the phrases \"today starter ad\" and \"hello today starter.\" It could be related to a \"hello world starter ad.\" They might not want a direct response but are asking for a category suggestion. The best options could be \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The words in the request suggest it\u2019s about making a change, likely linked to an advertisement. Given the uncertainty, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the safest choice for classification. I\u2019ll format the response accordingly.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to create a JSON object for the chosen category, which should follow the required format: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}. I\u2019ll output the object with \"category\" containing the value \"Miscellaneous,\" as it seems to fit best. \n\nSo, my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Just sticking to the format\u2014no extra text!"
