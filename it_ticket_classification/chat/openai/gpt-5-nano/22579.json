The repeated mentions of \"new purchase\" and \"purchase order\" align closely with the \"Purchase\" category, while the installation aspect leans towards \"Hardware.\"**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket and I think the safest choice is \"Purchase\" since it's centered on a new purchase order. While \"Administrative rights\" doesn't fit and \"Internal Project\" isn\u2019t specified, the request to \"log installation\" suggests some action related to hardware but still emphasizes purchase. Given that the request explicitly involves a purchase order, it makes sense to go with \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll format it neatly like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Confirming Category Format**\n\nI need to be careful not to mis-specify, especially with the user's request mentioning a new purchase order for the \"Galaxy Armour Hybrid Protective.\" However, I don't need to delve into product specifics. My response should simply be a JSON-like object stating the category as \"Purchase.\" I need to keep the capitalization consistent \u2014 the enum specifies \"Purchase\" with a capital P. So, I\u2019ll respond succinctly with: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Let's proceed!"
