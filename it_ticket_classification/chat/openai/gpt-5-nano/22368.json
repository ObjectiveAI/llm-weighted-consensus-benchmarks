However, since the text mentions \"delete please add blacklist,\" it suggests modifying a contact list, pointing towards \"Administrative rights\" as it involves system configuration changes. It's also worth considering \"Internal Project\" for updating addresses, but ultimately, since it's about mail handling, \"Administrative rights\" feels like the most accurate choice.**Formatting the response**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize this as \"Administrative rights\" since it involves modifying security settings and managing addresses, particularly the blacklist. Now, I need to format the final answer in the required JSON format. \n\nIt should look like this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. Since the user only asked for the category, I should stick to providing just that in the JSON object, ensuring it\u2019s formatted correctly and succinctly without extra commentary.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
