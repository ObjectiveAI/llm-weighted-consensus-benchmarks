It talks about a \"new error when uploading files\" and mentions urgency, specifically how documents move to a different folder automatically. This could fit under several categories like \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given it involves uploading and document management, \"Storage\" seems fitting, but it also references urgent access and administration issues, which makes \"Access\" a contender too.**Categorizing IT Issue**\n\nThe user wants to open a case and fix an issue with a \"new error when uploading files,\" where files automatically move to a specific folder. This seems more related to storage and document management rather than access control. So, I\u2019m choosing \"Storage\" as the category. I need to respond with a JSON-like object containing this category in the required format. In the final response, it should look like this: {\"category\": \"Storage\"}.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
