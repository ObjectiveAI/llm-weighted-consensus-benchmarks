It might be best to categorize this as \"Miscellaneous,\" since it covers general IT issues that don't fit other specific categories.

I initially considered \"Administrative rights\" since rebuilding might need admin access, but that's not certain. It seems \"Miscellaneous\" fits better as a default for software issues. \"Internal Project\" doesn\u2019t apply here either. I need to provide my answer in the required JSON format, confirming it aligns with the schema provided. So, the response will simply be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
