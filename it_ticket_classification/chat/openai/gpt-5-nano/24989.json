The text is quite garbled but seems to involve application engineering and content sharing related to careers. It gives a sense of urgency for production by tomorrow. I\u2019ll need to select the most suitable category from options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative Rights. Let's find the best fit!**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe content seems related to a graduates programme landing page, focusing on content creation, publishing, and layout. It looks like this is an internal project tied to a website. When I examine the available categories: Hardware isn\u2019t relevant, and HR Support could apply, but it\u2019s more about webpage content. Access, Storage, Purchase, and Administrative Rights don\u2019t fit either. So \"Internal Project\" is the best choice. I\u2019ll output this as a JSON-like object with the category specified.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
