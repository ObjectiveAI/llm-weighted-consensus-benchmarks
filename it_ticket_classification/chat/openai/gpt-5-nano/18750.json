The options for categories include \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and possibly \"Internal Project.\" Given that it's about disabling a service, it leans more toward \"Access,\" but it could also fit \"Administrative rights\" since that involves permissions. Let's settle on \"Access.\"**Determining ticket categorization**\n\nThe phrase \"disable Jabber\" likely indicates a request to turn off the Jabber app. The mention of \"senior developer\" suggests a specific role requesting this. While \"Access\" seems fitting since it deals with enabling or disabling a service, it could also be categorized as \"Administrative rights\" if it pertains to permissions. \"Internal Project\" might fit if this is part of a larger initiative to limit Jabber's usage. Overall, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" for clarity.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nFor ticket categorization, \"Disable Jabber\" falls under \"Access\" since it's about access to the Jabber service. If the task involved managing admin rights, it would lean toward \"Administrative rights.\" The mention of \"senior developer\" might suggest the role of the requester, but that doesn't impact the category. While the date and time aren't needed for categorization, I'll ultimately respond with a JSON object indicating the category. So, I\u2019ll format it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
