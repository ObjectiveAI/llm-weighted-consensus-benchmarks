I'm leaning towards \"Access\" since it focuses on granting permissions, but \"Administrative rights\" could apply if elevated access is mentioned. However, given the context about standard access issues and invitations, \"Access\" seems the safest choice. I\u2019ll present this as a JSON object with the category set to \"Access.\"**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nThe prompt provides a specific schema for the response, which I need to follow carefully. The user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I should respond with just the category in the required JSON format. Given the details I have, the appropriate category here is \"Access.\" \n\nTo match the schema, my final answer should simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll ensure it\u2019s properly formatted with no extra text. Let's go ahead and present that!"
