I\u2019ll prepare a concise JSON object to reflect this categorization. I'll ensure the output aligns with the required schema format. So, the final response will be:  \n{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Outputting JSON for access category**\n\nTypically, I would provide a simple JSON object like {\"category\":\"Access\"}. To follow the schema properly, I need to ensure it includes just the \"category\" field without any extra text. Since they specified the category enum, I feel confident proceeding with this. So, I'll confirm that the response will be concise and directly formatted as required. My final output will be:  \n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
