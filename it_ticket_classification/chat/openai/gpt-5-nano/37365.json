I should choose between \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" for this ticket.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm thinking through how to categorize this ticket. Since it seems to be a connectivity issue, \"Access\" fits best because it relates to network or login access. \"Hardware\" and \"Storage\" are not relevant. \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it involves permissions. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too vague. Based on the user reporting a connectivity problem that previously worked, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" \n\nI should respond with just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That matches the required format!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
