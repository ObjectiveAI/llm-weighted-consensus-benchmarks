It seems related to HR, specifically around timecard approvals and workflow, which leads me to think it fits under \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" But since it's clearly about HR processes, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like this is an HR software issue, where the user needs help with multiple approvals for a single time card. That's definitely aligning with \"HR Support.\" I considered \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights,\" but those didn't fit as well. \n\nSo, I\u2019ve decided that \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category. I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Keeping it concise is key here!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
