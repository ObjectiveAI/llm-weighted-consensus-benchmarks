The ticket discusses a monitor issue, flickering, and mentions solutions involving hardware like a monitor with DisplayPort or changing an old laptop. Since it's about hardware and possibly procurement for a replacement or upgrade, I'd say it could fit into either Hardware or Purchase.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nThe content of this ticket is mainly about hardware issues and potential replacements, which fits into the options of Hardware and Purchase. The user talks about a flickering monitor, suggesting solutions like using a DP cable or getting a new monitor, indicating a hardware troubleshooting situation. While the mention of purchasing a new monitor or laptop leans toward the Purchase category, the primary focus is on hardware. So, I'd categorize it as \"Hardware,\" since that captures the main concern.**Formatting IT ticket category**\n\nI need to output the category in a specific JSON format. The ticket is clearly about hardware troubleshooting, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" The format required by the system is precise, so it looks like I need to respond with just the category in the schema provided. Therefore, it must be formatted like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll ensure everything is proper, with quotes and no extra text. Here it goes: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
