The categories I\u2019m considering are \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d \"Access\" might fit well as it covers permissions, while \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it's specifically about privileges to modify or access. I'll lean towards \"Access\" since it seems more general.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket is requesting access to a folder, so \"Access\" seems like the best category. \"Storage\" might apply if it were about storage solutions, but it doesn\u2019t quite fit here. If there\u2019s any confusion, \"Miscellaneous\" could work as a fallback, but I think \"Access\" is clear.\n\nI need to format my response as a JSON object according to the specified schema. So, I\u2019ll just output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra commentary is necessary since the user only asked for the category."
