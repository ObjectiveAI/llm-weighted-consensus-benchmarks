The user mentions maintenance, an additional keyboard, and problems with the current keyboard not working properly sometimes. This leans toward a hardware issue, so I think the \"Hardware\" category fits best. There is also a potential request for additional equipment, which hints at \"Purchase,\" but since the primary concern is about the keyboard malfunction, \"Hardware\" is likely the right choice.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize an IT ticket that primarily addresses a keyboard issue, which isn't working properly sometimes. Although the user mentions wanting an \"additional keyboard,\" the main concern is the hardware problem. I'll categorize it as \"Hardware\" because that best reflects the core issue. The other categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access\" don\u2019t apply here. I should definitely use the expected JSON format for clarity. Let's go ahead and structure it as specified!**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI'm focusing on outputting the correct JSON format for the categorized ticket. Since \"Hardware\" is the right category for a keyboard issue, I need to ensure the response follows the schema exactly as specified. I understand that I should wrap the category in the appropriate JSON object. So, the output will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nThis keeps it concise and adheres to the required format. I'll make sure everything is valid JSON without any extra text. Let's finalize it!"
