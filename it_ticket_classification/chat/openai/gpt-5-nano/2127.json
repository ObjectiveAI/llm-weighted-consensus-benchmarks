It could relate to access permissions, possibly aiming to add these member addresses for a unit. The most fitting category might be \"Access,\" since it usually covers permissions related to adding members. However, it could also fit \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" if it\u2019s broader. Overall, it leans towards being about access permissions.**Categorizing IT ticket as JSON**\n\nThe repeated word \"addresses\" could imply it's referring to network addresses or address lists, but the user's request to \"add members addresses\" for a unit suggests they might want to update a directory. It doesn't indicate a need for administrative rights, so I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" \n\nFollowing the instructions, I\u2019ll provide the response in the required JSON format without extra details.
