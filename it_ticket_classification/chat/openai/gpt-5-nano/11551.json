It seems like they're asking for a keyboard, possibly for July. The available categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since this is clearly a hardware request, the best fit is \"Hardware.\" I did consider \"Purchase,\" but because it's a specific hardware request, I'll go with \"Hardware.\"**Evaluating keyboard request category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the content: \"keyboard request july pm keyboard hi possible provide keyboard thank help developer.\" This seems to be a request for a keyboard, qualifying it as a hardware acquisition. Typically, these requests can fall under \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase,\" depending on the classification. \"Provide keyboard\" suggests a procurement request, making \"Purchase\" sound fitting. However, \"Hardware\" is more general. Since I need to choose one category for clarity, I need to decide which fits best.**Categorizing IT ticket for keyboard**\n\nThe phrases \"keyboard request\" and \"possible provide keyboard\" clearly indicate a keyboard request. While it could fit under \"Purchase\" since it's about procurement, there are no specifics on price or vendor. Typically, such requests are classified as \"Hardware.\" The content does suggest a potential schedule with \"July pm,\" but that's not crucial for classification. I believe \"Hardware\" is the safest choice, and I\u2019ll present the category in JSON format as requested.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
