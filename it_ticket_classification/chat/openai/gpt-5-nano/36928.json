The user mentions the phone isn't working properly and requests a repair or replacement, indicating a hardware issue. While it might seem like it could relate to \"Internal Project\" or \"Maintenance,\" it clearly falls under the \"Hardware\" category. I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object with the key \"category\" set to \"Hardware\" for a clear response.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nThe prompt instructs me to categorize an IT ticket and produce a JSON object specifically. The category we're assigning for this ticket is \"Hardware.\" I need to ensure my response is strictly in the required JSON format without any extra text. So, I\u2019ll present it as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} and nothing more. This keeps it clean and follows the guidance. I'll proceed with that as my final output!"
