So I need to pick the category that best fits this description, which looks like it would be \"Internal Project.\"**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe user's ticket heavily mentions \"hardware,\" \"deploy,\" \"handset gear choices,\" and \"hardware planning.\" It seems appropriate to categorize this as an \"Internal Project\" since it relates to implementing a deployment guide for an internal rollout. \n\nOther categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"HR Support\" don't fit, and \"Miscellaneous\" could work only if nothing else seems right. Since it's focused on hardware deployment, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" Lastly, I need to format this as a JSON object with the category as specified.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
