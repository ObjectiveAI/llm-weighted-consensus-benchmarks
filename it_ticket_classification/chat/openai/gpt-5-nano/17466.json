It mentions a starter form and asks someone to fill it out. The possible categories include \"Access\", \"HR Support\", and \"Onboarding\". Given the content, \"HR Support\" is the most fitting choice since it relates to onboarding forms. Other categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Access\" might also be applicable, but it clearly aligns with \"HR Support\".**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's message about a \"new starter\" and a form seems to be a request related to HR. Since it's an IT ticket for filling out an onboarding form, the most fitting category is \"HR Support.\" Other categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" don\u2019t seem relevant, and \"Access\" doesn\u2019t apply because access isn't mentioned. I\u2019ll craft a simple response with a JSON object that correctly identifies the category as \"HR Support.\" The output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}**Outputting category object**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to format my response as a category object. So, I'll respond with just the JSON object itself. I'll ensure the category value is exactly \"HR Support,\" paying close attention to capitalization. It\u2019s crucial to get this right, so I\u2019ll present it straightforwardly.\n\nHere\u2019s the response I\u2019ll provide:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
