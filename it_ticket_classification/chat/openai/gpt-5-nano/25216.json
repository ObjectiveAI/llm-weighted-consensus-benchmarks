The phrase \"hello ext\" is a bit ambiguous; it could refer to an extension or just serve as a greeting. Given the context, the best fit seems to be \"HR Support,\" especially since it's about a new starter form for onboarding. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"HR Support.\"**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object setting the category field to \"HR Support.\" The instructions specify that the output should follow this format. So, I'll produce the required output as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It might help to add a brief justification since it appears that the user is expecting a JSON response. Still, I think providing the category alone is enough for clarity. I'll finalize this now."
