They mention a problem that's been detected and resolved, which hints at a hardware issue. \n\nI think I'll prepare a JSON object with the appropriate category field. The category schema offers options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. Given that the focus is on a connection problem, \"Hardware\" seems like the right choice for this ticket.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe user mentions a \"problem with cable connection,\" which suggests there was a hardware issue that has been addressed. They also mention having wireless for now but still needing the cable. \n\nGiven that it\u2019s a physical cable connection concern, I lean towards categorizing this as \"Hardware.\" While \"Internal Project\" and \"Access\" are possibilities, this ticket fundamentally deals with the hardware aspect. So, I\u2019ll create a JSON object and assign it to the \"Hardware\" category.**Finalizing JSON Output**\n\nThe correct format for the output is a JSON object with the category. The prompt clearly states, \"Please categorize this IT Ticket,\" and the required output is just the category content.\n\nIn similar tasks, I've presented it like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll finalize it as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Although I could provide a brief justification, the instructions only require the category itself, so I\u2019ll stick with just that for now."
