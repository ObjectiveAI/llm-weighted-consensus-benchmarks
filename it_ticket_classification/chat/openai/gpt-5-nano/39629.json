There are several categories to consider: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It's important to classify the ticket correctly so that it gets directed to the right team for handling. I'll review the ticket details closely to ensure accurate classification. Let's make sure everything is in order!**Interpreting IT ticket issues**\n\nThe user\u2019s IT ticket is quite chaotic and mentions multiple aspects about site documents and policies. They\u2019re experiencing errors when trying to upload documents that include special symbols, specifically with a maternity policy. They\u2019ve also noted that they previously had write access but received error messages now when trying to add or replace documents. It's high importance, and it seems something has changed regarding their access. I need to clarify their requests and assist them accordingly.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this ticket, and it seems to fit into \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" The user is mentioning issues related to write access for folders, adding or replacing documents, and error messages, which suggests a permissions problem with a site repository. Since they specifically requested \"write access,\" I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"Access.\" However, if they were asking for admin privileges to replace documents, \"Administrative Rights\" might fit too. I should prioritize \"Access\" based on their request.**Finalizing category output**\n\nThe \"Administrative Rights\" category seems to be for issues needing admin privileges, but this ticket specifically requests \"write access to folders\" and mentions errors in uploading documents. Given these details, categorizing it as \"Access\" makes sense. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object formatted correctly to reflect this choice. I need to keep it simple and just provide the category: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. It looks like that's all that\u2019s required, so I\u2019ll stick to that."
