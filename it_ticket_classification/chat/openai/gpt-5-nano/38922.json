They mentioned a \"license issue\" where they can only have view mode. This clearly relates to access control and software licensing problems. So, I\u2019m considering the categories provided: \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Access\" seems like the best fit since it's about license restrictions causing a read-only situation. \"Administrative rights\" could work too, but it focuses more on permissions.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI think it\u2019s best to categorize the ticket as \"Access\" since it deals with access rights, permissions, or licensing issues that impact the user's ability to edit. It could also be \"Administrative rights\" if they lack the privileges to activate their license. However, since the instruction is to categorize the IT ticket, I\u2019ll need to respond with structured JSON format. The correct output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra text is needed!**Choosing the category**\n\nI'm considering whether \"Administrative rights\" might be more accurate since this license issue appears to restrict user rights. However, typically, a license issue falls under \"Access,\" as it deals with the limitations leading to a read-only mode. Since the user mentioned that the license isn\u2019t working anymore and they can only view, it seems clear this is an access problem. So, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" and provide only the JSON response. Let's go with that!"
