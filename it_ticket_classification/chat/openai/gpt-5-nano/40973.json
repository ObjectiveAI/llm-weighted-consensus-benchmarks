Since there's no category for \"Software/ServiceNow\" or \"Incident management,\" I think the closest fit is \"Miscellaneous.\" Alternatively, \"Internal Project\" could work if it aligns with ServiceNow, but \"Miscellaneous\" seems to cover it best.**Responding with JSON category**\n\nIn certain ITSM taxonomies, if an \"Incident\" doesn't fit into specific categories, it might go under \"Miscellaneous.\" I need to respond with the required JSON category object. The guidelines indicate that I should provide a JSON object with the \"category\" specified. Since this issue is related to ServiceNow and isn't \"Hardware\" or \"Access,\" I'll choose \"Miscellaneous.\" The output should strictly follow the format, so here it is:  \n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
