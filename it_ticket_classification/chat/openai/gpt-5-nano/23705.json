The user\u2019s ticket talks about a maternity leave form, which sounds like it fits into \"HR Support\" since it involves HR processes. I considered \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d too, because of the mention of forms, but it seems more appropriate to label it as \"HR Support\" since that's the core focus of the request.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nI see that the categories dictionary includes \"HR Support,\" so I need to output it in JSON format as requested. The format requires a JSON object where the key is \"category\" and the value is one of the allowed strings. Since the ticket is HR-related, I'll respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI just have to ensure the formatting is correct without adding any extra commentary. Let's keep it clean and simple. I'll go ahead and provide that JSON object now."
