It sounds like it's primarily about access issues, especially with unblocking a sender and dealing with blocked senders. The mention of calendar invites hints at possible Administrative rights concerns as well. \"Com\" might refer to a company or .com domain, suggesting this could relate to email access. To summarize, it looks like \u201cAccess\u201d is the most fitting category, but \"Administrative rights\" seems plausible too.**Categorizing Access Issues**\n\nI think I should categorize this ticket as \"Access\" since it deals with unblocking senders and permissions. However, there's a case for \"Administrative rights\" too, especially if it requires admin privileges to make those changes. Unblocking senders typically fits as an access issue in email systems. The user\u2019s message suggests they're trying to unblock \"com\" from blocked senders and mentioning calendar invites, so it feels like \"Access\" is the most appropriate choice overall.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned they have a meeting Friday morning, and the phrase \"vendor form calendar invites\" suggests they want those invites to come through. They've tried multiple times and are asking for the ability to allow this delivery, so it's clearly about email and calendar access. \"Access\" seems like the best category for this ticket. I need to format my response as a JSON object, resulting in: {\"category\": \"Access\"}, adhering to the required structure."
