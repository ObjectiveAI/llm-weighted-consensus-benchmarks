The user mentions \"new starter in Bucharest,\" several references to \"administration officer,\" and \"advise date,\" along with some text in Romanian. It seems to be about scheduling two dates related to a new starter. I\u2019m considering which category this fits best: it could be HR Support due to the reference to a new starter and administrative tasks, but it might also involve Administrative rights. I'll analyze further.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe text mentions a \"new starter,\" which signals an HR onboarding task and leans towards the \"HR Support\" category. However, it also repeatedly references \"administration officer\" and requests help scheduling two dates. While it could relate to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" there's no specific indication of needing access. The emphasis on scheduling suggests it\u2019s primarily about onboarding in Bucharest. So, I\u2019ll categorize it likely under \"HR Support\" given its focus on the new starter's onboarding process.**Parsing IT ticket**\n\nLet\u2019s break down the ticket: it mentions \"new starter\" which points to onboarding, and \"administration officer\" appears multiple times. Phrases like \"please advise date\" and \"which two dates\" suggest some scheduling is involved, potentially for the new employee. Given this context, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"HR Support.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could make sense if access were indicated, it seems more safe to go with HR Support for now. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like object as required.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
