Since it's linked to a new project, it might fit into the \"Internal Project\" category. Also, \"Access\" could be relevant due to potential system access needs.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user mentioned a ticket that reads, \"new project code pas February pm setup code...\" This suggests it's related to an internal project task. The \"pm\" might refer to \"project manager,\" and \"pas\" could be shorthand for \"password.\" Given the mention of \"new project code\" and \"setup,\" it seems best to categorize this as \"Internal Project.\" I'll return the category in a JSON object format, as that appears to be the required output.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nThe prompt asks to categorize an IT ticket using a specified schema that includes categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Internal Project.\" Based on the ticket details, I've decided to use \"Internal Project\" as the category. So, I will return a JSON object with the format required. It\u2019ll be structured simply as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} without any extra text to ensure everything is clear and correctly formatted."
