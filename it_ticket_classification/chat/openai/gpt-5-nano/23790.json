The message seems garbled but mentions \"additional rights\" and \"assign desks.\" This suggests the user might be requesting access rights. Since they\u2019re asking for \"additional rights,\" the most fitting categories would either be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I think \"Access\" may be the best choice here!**Categorizing an IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m recognizing that the request is for additional rights and assigning desks. This could fit as either \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but I believe \"Access\" is the strongest category since it's about requesting additional rights. Although \"Administrative rights\" might also apply if it's specifically about admin privileges, I'm leaning towards \"Access\" because the rights requested seem generic. Based on the prompt, we need to output a JSON-like object, so I should format it correctly as {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
