Given its content, I'd lean toward classifying it as \"Administrative rights\" since it's more directly related.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m reflecting on the task of adding members to a mailing list, which feels like an access control issue. It could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" since it involves updating permissions for a distribution list. However, the category schema includes both \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" as separate options. Ultimately, I think \"Access\" is more appropriate, as it focuses on granting access to the mailing list, aligning well with the task description.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
