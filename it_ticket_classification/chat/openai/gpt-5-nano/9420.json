The message is quite messy, but it seems to involve a user wanting to change their email address. I'm wondering if this relates to HR Support, Access, or Administrative rights due to the mention of \u201cconsultant mobile\u201d and \u201cinterns.\u201d It\u2019s unclear, but I think it leans toward an email address change.**Classifying IT ticket messages**\n\nIt seems I'm looking at a chain of messages that mention a \"mail address change.\" The user might be asking me to categorize this ticket for IT triage. It seems the main IT issue here revolves around an account modification for that email address. This isn\u2019t necessarily administrative rights, but it could fall under Access or possibly even Administrative Rights. Given the context, I think I should classify it as Access, since it's about changing access credentials.**Determining the category for IT ticket**\n\nThe \"mail address change\" appears to be a request to update a contact email, which is an administrative task related to the user profile. However, there are additional unclear terms like \"interns,\" \"consultant,\" and \"mobile.\" Since changing an email address doesn\u2019t grant elevated permissions, it doesn't qualify as an Administrative right. I think I'll categorize this as Access instead. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll prepare the final JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and ensure it follows the required schema correctly for submission.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
