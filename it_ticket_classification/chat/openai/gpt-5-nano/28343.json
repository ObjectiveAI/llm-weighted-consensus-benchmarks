The note mentions \"visitor cards,\" which suggests this is related to access control, so \"Access\" seems to fit best. There's also a mention of \"administrative rights,\" but the focus is on changing a location. Based on the context, I'll categorize this ticket under \"Access,\" as it involves visitor cards and potentially access permissions.**Finalizing category response**\n\nThe category \"Access\" seems to be the best fit for this IT ticket, particularly since it's about visitor cards. There\u2019s some ambiguity in the phrase \"hi thanks help visitors cards stay under location,\" but I think it aligns more with access than administrative rights. I need to format the response as a JSON object indicating the category. So, I will respond simply with: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and no extra text."
