Since there\u2019s no specific \"Software\" category, I\u2019m debating between \"Miscellaneous\" and \"Administrative rights,\" though the latter might not fit since there's no mention of requiring admin rights. \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the best option.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket.

Unfortunately, there's no \"Software\" category available, which means \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a solid fallback option.
