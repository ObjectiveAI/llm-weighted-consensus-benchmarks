The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given that it relates to approvals and potentially access rights, I'm thinking \"Access\" could be the best fit. However, it might also align with \"Administrative rights,\" \"HR Support,\" or even \"Internal Project.\" I'll need to finalize this classification.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the limited categories for this IT ticket. \"Access\" seems fitting because the issue involves approvals and notifications that may affect access rights. However, \"Administrative rights\" could work too since the user mentioned changing managers in Oracle, which might relate to approval routing. They've specifically referred to wanting help with correcting manager assignments. Given that context, I think \"Access\" is the best choice, but \"Administrative rights\" remains a strong contender as well.**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nI believe the most suitable category for this ticket is \"Access\" since it relates to approvals and notifications that affect access to resources. The mention of \"manager change issues\" also supports this choice, as it indicates role assignments. While \"Internal Project\" could be a possibility if there's a project context, it doesn't seem as relevant. Given that, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and prepare to respond with the required JSON format."
