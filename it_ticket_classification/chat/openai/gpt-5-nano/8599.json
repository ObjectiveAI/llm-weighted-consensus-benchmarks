I wonder if this could be classified under \"Access\" or \"Internal Project.\" I'll format the output in JSON with the appropriate category.**Mapping IT ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m assessing how to categorize an IT ticket based on several defined categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. The ticket text includes phrases related to \"christmas party codes\" and deadlines, suggesting it deals with generating or managing codes for events. Given the details about entities and codes, this seems to fit better under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" rather than Hardware or Access. I\u2019ll go with one of those categories when I format my response.**Categorizing IT ticket correctly**\n\nThe ticket seems to involve \"codes\" for tracking party codes, which might relate to an \"Internal Project\" or a \"Miscellaneous\" request. Given the limitations in categories, \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since it's a task for setting up codes across various entities and locations. With mentions of deadlines and approvals, it\u2019s clear this is part of a broader system. I\u2019ll structure my response as a JSON object. It will look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let's proceed!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
