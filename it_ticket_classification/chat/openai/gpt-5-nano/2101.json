The ticket mentions wanting to disable something related to Active Directory (AD) addresses and also references decommissioning. Given the categories available, I'll categorize this ticket appropriately. \"Disable from ad re addresses\" could indicate they want to disable something, but it might be a typo too. I\u2019ll focus on relating it to one of the system\u2019s provided categories for clarity.**Categorizing IT Ticket Further**\n\nThe user's request indicates they want to handle \"everybody decommissioned.\" It seems they might be looking to decommission or delete some accounts in Active Directory (AD). For categorization, I think \"Access\" fits well, as it relates to user management. It could also be \"Administrative rights\" if they focus on permissions. But since it\u2019s mainly about managing access, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and respond accordingly with the category object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. A brief justification might help clarify things!**Formatting Category Response**\n\nIt looks like I need to respond with a JSON-like object for the category based on the user's ticket. The guidance specifies using a format for the category, which is clear: I should output {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nThis ties back perfectly to the user's request about decommissioning and managing access in Active Directory. Since it is indeed related to user access management, \"Access\" is the right classification. I\u2019ll make sure to provide just that JSON object!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
