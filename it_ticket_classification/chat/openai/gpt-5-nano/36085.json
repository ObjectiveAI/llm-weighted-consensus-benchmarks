The user's text mentions \"approval,\" \"notification,\" and \"attached,\" which makes me think it could be about access or approvals for someone. It might fit under \"Access\" since approvals are often related to access. Alternatively, if it's about granting permissions specifically, \"Administrative rights\" could be more appropriate. There's also a chance it relates to \"Internal Project\" if it's project-specific. I'll select the best-fitting category.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s message suggests they are trying to submit a ticket related to approvals. They mention needing approval for the same person over a specific period, and the phrase \"please find them attached\" hints that the attachments contain relevant approvals. The appropriate category might be \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it seems to involve approvals related to access rights, I think I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access.\u201d Now, I need to prepare a JSON object with the \"category\" key.**Providing Category Format**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to provide the category in the specified format. The right response should be a JSON-like object that looks like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI just have to ensure that there\u2019s no extra text included. The required output should be straightforward, focusing solely on presenting the category without any fluff. So, I\u2019ll stick with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nThat should meet the requirements perfectly!"
