The user's pasted content is a bit messy but mentions things like \"new starter access card\" and issues with delivering hardware. It seems to relate mostly to Access and Hardware, so I\u2019ll aim to classify it under one of those, even if it has multiple aspects.**Classifying IT Ticket Content**\n\nI'm analyzing the content of the IT ticket, which includes phrases like \"where floor table number found,\" indicating a location, and mentions of \"trouble delivering hardware,\" linking to hardware issues. There are also references to onboarding new starters and processing forms. The best single category that fits is \"Access,\" especially since it refers to items like a \"new starter access card\" and enabling access. While \"Hardware\" is relevant, it seems \"Access\" captures the essence of the request more accurately.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket content mentions a \"new starter access card\" and issues with \"delivering hardware.\" I need to determine the most fitting category, weighing \"Hardware\" against \"Access.\" Given that the ticket focuses on onboarding and access rights, \"Access\" feels most appropriate since it directly relates to the access card and enabling access. I will respond in the required JSON format with the chosen category, which is: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Yes, that\u2019s the final answer!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
