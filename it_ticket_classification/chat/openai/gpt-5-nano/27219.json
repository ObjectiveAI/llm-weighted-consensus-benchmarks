The user mentioned different changes and confidentiality, so I need to categorize it appropriately. The options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the content relates to HR processes and access, it likely fits under \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket discusses configuring systems related to absence requests, including restricting who can receive or approve them. It seems to involve adjustments to access rights on an HR portal. The most suitable category might be \"Access,\" since it focuses on enabling or disabling access for absence requests. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also fit if it's specifically about adjusting permissions. Although \"HR Support\" pertains to absence approvals, the task is ultimately about IT modifying the system. I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the best choice.**Categorizing access controls**\n\nThe text indicates it's about restricting access to receiving absence requests, so I need to categorize this as \"Access.\" Since the output format requires a JSON object, I\u2019ll format it appropriately. The system message defines the structure, indicating that I should only provide the JSON object without additional text. Therefore, I'll respond simply with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThat's the clear and straightforward way to communicate this categorization!"
