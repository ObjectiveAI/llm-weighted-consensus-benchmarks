It\u2019s a bit messy, mentioning terms like \"wrist platform\" and \"recommended different stand.\" It seems to be asking for some kind of hardware or purchase for wrist support. The categories available are \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase,\" which both might fit. However, I find the content unclear, so I should focus on what best aligns with the user's needs.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI think I should classify this ticket as \"Hardware,\" since it involves equipment and assistive devices. It could also be \"Purchase\" if the user is requesting new equipment. The request mentions needing different stands and seems to focus on equipment for wrist support due to a broken arm. However, since I have to choose one category from the taxonomy, \"Hardware\" seems to be the best fit given the context of the request.**Finalizing category**\n\nI believe \"Hardware\" is the correct classification for this ticket. It could also fit \"Purchase\" if there's a request to buy something, but the user is asking for recommendations, not making a direct purchase request. Since it involves equipment, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" So, I'll format my final response as a JSON object with the required field \"category.\" That will look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
