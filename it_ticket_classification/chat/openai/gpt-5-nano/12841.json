The text mentions terms like \"PO,\" \"cost split,\" and \"contractual agreement,\" which suggests it's related to purchasing or procurement. This makes me think it fits best under \"Purchase.\" So, I'll create a JSON object indicating the category. It's a bit confusing due to the garbled text, but by inferring the key phrases, I've categorized it accordingly!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking this IT ticket likely fits the \u201cPurchase\u201d category since it mentions \"purchase order\" and \"cost split.\" While \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" might come to mind, they don't really apply here. The best choice is definitely \"Purchase.\" I'll need to respond with a JSON object showing this category, specifically: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. It\u2019s important to stick to the format required, so I\u2019ll just include the category without any extra fluff.**Following the instruction**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to focus on providing only the category. Although it doesn't explicitly restrict additional details, the required format specifically states to output a JSON object with the category. So, I\u2019ll stick to that and ensure I format it correctly. Going forward, my response will concentrate solely on delivering the requested JSON object, keeping it simple and straightforward! Let's proceed as instructed."
