The options are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It seems this is focused on enhancing the benefits report, fitting best under \"Internal Project.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it were about permissions, there's no clear access issue or HR component here. So \"Internal Project\" it is!**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI'm looking at a ticket related to a \"benefits report,\" which suggests it's in the HR domain, but it\u2019s more of a technical task than HR support. Given the classification options for IT ticket routing, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit for routing to developers. I'll create a JSON object with the category field set to \"Internal Project\" as per the instructions. So, I'll output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
