The categories we have are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\"\n\nThe content is quite unstructured but seems to focus on \"budget forms,\" specifically access and approval. It could fit under \"Access\" if it's purely about gaining entry, \"Administrative rights\" if it requests special permissions, \"Internal Project\" if it's related to internal processes, or \"Miscellaneous\" if it's unclear.**Parsing ticket requirements**\n\nLet's break this down. The first part indicates a request for accessing budget forms, specifically on Friday PM. The second part seems to ask for approval of those forms on Friday PM. The overall theme revolves around budget forms without mentioning hardware, HR, storage, or purchases.\n\nThe \"Access\" category seems most fitting since it\u2019s about gaining entry to budget forms. However, if permissions are needed, \"Administrative rights\" could apply, even though \"Access\" is broader. It might be helpful to ask clarifying questions since the user wants a category classification for their IT ticket.**Responding with ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking we should categorize the ticket under \"Access.\" It clearly revolves around accessing budget forms and approvals, and there's no mention of hardware.\n\nI'll prepare to output this in the required format, which looks like a JSON-like object with a \"category\" field. From what I see, the output should also include the \"## category\" header. So, it will look like:\n\n## category  \n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThat keeps it simple and focused! If there's any confusion about needing multiple categories, I might consider clarifying that as well.## category  \n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
