It sounds like the user is having an issue with the \"Select Minds\" referral option not being displayed. I'm thinking it might fit into the \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" categories since the problem relates to a feature that should be available. If \"Select Minds\" is actually an employee referral program, then it could also relate to \"HR Support.\" I need to decide on the best category now!**Deciding on Category**\n\nI'm considering the most appropriate category for the IT ticket. If the referral option not displaying is linked to HR, \"HR Support\" could fit. However, \"Select Minds\" seems like it could be a referral platform. Since the user is asking for assistance with something not being displayed, it could indicate an access issue. The message suggests a UI problem with \"referral option available for cannot displayed,\" pointing towards \"Access\" being the best choice. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and respond in the required JSON format!**Preparing Output**\n\nI need to output the category for the IT ticket in the specified format. Based on my assessment, I\u2019m going with \u201cAccess.\u201d The instructions clearly state I should provide a category object, so my response will be exactly that JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. \n\nI wonder if I should add a brief note, but really, the instruction emphasizes providing only the category, so I\u2019ll stick to just the JSON to keep it clear and concise. Let's go with that!"
