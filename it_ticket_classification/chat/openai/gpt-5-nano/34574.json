The text they provided is jumbled but seems to relate to a flow issue with a form submission, mentioning reminders and an employee leaving, which suggests it could be HR-related. They mention terms like \"leaver full name\" and \"date leaving February,\" which reinforce this idea. So, I think it fits best under the \"HR Support\" category. Let's classify it accordingly!**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI see that the ticket mentions \"mailbox does receive incoming,\" which may indicate it needs attention. Terms like \"manager,\" \"respond reminders,\" and \"submitted order replace leaver\" suggest it's likely related to HR processes, specifically off-boarding and form submission. \"HR Support\" is indeed one of the available categories, so I\u2019ll classify it under that. The ticket clearly involves HR workflow around confirming submitted forms and leaver details, so my response will include a JSON object stating that category.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to produce the JSON response for the IT ticket classification as follows: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`. I want to make sure I'm following the required format exactly, using just the category property without any additional content or extra whitespace. It\u2019s important to be precise for clarity. I think I've got it right now, so let\u2019s deliver that clean JSON object!"
