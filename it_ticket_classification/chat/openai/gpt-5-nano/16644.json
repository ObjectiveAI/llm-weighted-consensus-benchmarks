It seems like there are inquiries about access, the location of resources, and possibly remote connections since they reference \"working members\" and resources in New Jersey. I think the most fitting category for this ticket would be \"Access,\" as it directly relates to their connection and resource inquiries.**Determining category for ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the phrase \"where located based resources,\" which could refer to the data center location or resources in New Jersey. Since they mention \"nj colombia,\" it suggests they might be asking about accessing US resources from Colombia or collaborating with members in NJ/Colombia. The mention of \"connection\" indicates network access, making \"Access\" the most suitable category. I need to provide this as a JSON object, qualifying it as follows:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
