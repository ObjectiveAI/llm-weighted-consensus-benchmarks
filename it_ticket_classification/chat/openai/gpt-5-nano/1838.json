The user's request is to log an order for a bigger laptop bag. I suppose it fits in the \"Purchase\" category since it's about ordering a replacement. But then again, a laptop bag is a hardware accessory, which makes me consider \"Hardware.\" I think categorizing it as \"Purchase\" is more accurate for procurement.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user mentioned they want to log an order for a bigger bag. Given that they're a Senior Engineer, this request is likely for supportability. In IT service categories, \u201cPurchase\u201d is used for requests like new equipment or accessories. So, categorizing it as \"Purchase\" seems right.\n\nI\u2019ll output the proper JSON structure they need, which is simply: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I've made sure to format that correctly without any extra text, as that\u2019s what they want!"
