The ticket text is a bit jumbled but seems to reference issues with \"write access\" to reports and mentions working with teams and reviewing forms. It suggests a focus on \"access,\" specifically concerning the need for \"write access to reports.\" I think Access is likely the best category for this ticket.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI need to determine whether to categorize this ticket as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \"Access\" is for general access issues, while \"Administrative rights\" involves elevated permissions, specifically for writing to reports. Since the request is about getting write access to a reports folder or system, it seems like an accessibility control issue. However, elevated privileges could also apply. I think I'll lean toward \"Access\" for safety, but \"Administrative rights\" is specific to this situation. It\u2019s a bit unclear!**Crafting category JSON**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize this as \"Access\" because it relates to access permissions. I'll format the response as a JSON object according to the schema provided: it should have the type as \"object\" and the properties including \"category.\" This is straightforward; I\u2019ll keep it brief and just give the JSON without any extra text. So, here\u2019s the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
