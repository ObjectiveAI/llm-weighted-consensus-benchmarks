From this, it looks like there are tasks like logging the installation, performing an order number by a tutorial, and potentially contacting the administrator by phone. Since it revolves around a purchase order, I think categorizing it under \"Purchase\" makes sense. I\u2019ll format the answer accordingly in a JSON object.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe prompt requests to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" and there's a defined category list in a JSON schema. I see that I need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category. I\u2019ll go with {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} since it fits best. \n\nI should stick strictly to the required format and provide only the JSON object. It makes the response straightforward without any extra explanations or text. Alright, I'll deliver just that."
