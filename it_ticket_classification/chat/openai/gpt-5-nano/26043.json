The text is primarily about annual leave requests, which seems a bit misplaced for an IT issue. I\u2019m considering options like \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" However, \"HR Support\" feels like the best fit since it relates directly to human resources. The user has asked me to classify this, so I\u2019ll prepare to output the category object accordingly!**Producing JSON response**\n\nI need to create a JSON-like response including the category for the ticket about annual leave requests. The required format is clear, as it should fit a defined schema with the category being one of the enumerated strings. Given that annual leave requests are HR-related, \"HR Support\" feels most appropriate. \n\nSo, the final output should simply be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I need to remember to avoid adding any extra text\u2014just the JSON response!**Delivering JSON response**\n\nThe text clearly discusses \"annual leave requests\" and involves HR-related tasks like \"please perform change\" and \"provide annual leave requests.\" So, it seems appropriate to categorize this as an HR Support issue rather than an IT one. I need to be careful to deliver the response without any extra formatting or text. The answer should be strictly the required JSON format. So, I\u2019ll respond accordingly. Here\u2019s the JSON I\u2019ll provide."
