It seems related to process compliance and possibly missing submissions. The main category could be \"Administrative rights,\" but it feels more about compliance. Maybe \"Miscellaneous\" fits better since the task isn\u2019t clearly defined. It might be part of an internal project, but \"Administrative rights\" seems more about requesting access than compliance. I\u2019m leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" as the most appropriate option since the task isn\u2019t clear.**Categorizing time submission issues**\n\nI'm evaluating how to categorize an issue regarding time submissions. It looks like there's a process for submitting weekly timesheets by Friday, but some may not have followed it for past weeks. I considered \"Administrative rights,\" thinking it might relate to enforcing these processes, but now it seems more about compliance. I wonder if \"Miscellaneous\" might fit better since the message isn\u2019t entirely clear. So, I'm torn between \"Administrative rights\" and \"Miscellaneous\" as the best categories.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing an incident regarding missing time entries. The content is vague, but it might fall under \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s connected to resolving timesheet issues. Since the categories are fixed, \"Miscellaneous\" is the safest choice for a generic ticket. However, the user\u2019s mention of weekly timesheets and training materials hints at an internal process improvement. So, I'm contemplating whether \"Internal Project\" fits better here. Each option has merits, but I\u2019m leaning toward \"Internal Project.\"{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
