It seems to mention time cards, submitting timesheets, and maternity leave along with processes and training materials. \n\nGiven this context, the category should likely fall under \"HR Support\" since it deals with employee time management and policies. It could also relate to \"Administrative rights,\" but \"HR Support\" appears to be the best fit based on the details.**Classifying IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions submitting time cards and weekly compliance, which points towards HR Support. It mentions training materials, logging, and processes but doesn\u2019t refer to access issues, so \"Administrative rights\" seems less relevant. I think the best categorization here is \"HR Support.\" \n\nI\u2019ll format my response as a JSON-like object with the category specified as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to stick to the required format since it's crucial for processing!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
