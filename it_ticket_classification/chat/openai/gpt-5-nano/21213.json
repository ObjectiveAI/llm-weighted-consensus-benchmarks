It seems to connect to Oracle database errors and updates concerning HR data, such as maternity leaves and suspended contracts. According to the user, these issues affect reports and involve Excel file attachments. Since it relates to contracts and leaves, I've decided to categorize it as \"HR Support.\" I need to output a JSON object with the category specified.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nThe instruction specifies that I should output a JSON object with the category. Based on the prompt, I\u2019ll categorize the ticket as \"HR Support.\" While I could provide brief reasoning, the required format seems to focus solely on the category field. Previously, I've only included the category in the JSON response. So, I\u2019ll stick to the format and output just: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}, ensuring the exact string is correct and there\u2019s no extra text. Let\u2019s finalize that!"
