They mention needing codes and changes done by tonight to avoid impacting work. It could relate to \"Internal Project\" since it involves projects, or \"Administrative rights\" if it's about permissions. The \"Access\" category also fits if it's about granting access. The request is a bit unclear, but it definitely revolves around project assignments and urgent needs.**Mapping Category for IT Ticket**\n\nIt seems the request might fit into \"Administrative rights\" if they want to change codes or access controls. However, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best fit since they mention \u201cassigned to projects.\u201d Alternatively, \"Access\" could apply if they need access to project codes. Considering the context, I think \"Internal Project\" aligns most closely. I'll respond with a JSON object formatted like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} to provide the clear response required."
