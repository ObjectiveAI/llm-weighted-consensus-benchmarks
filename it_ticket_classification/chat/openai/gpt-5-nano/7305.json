The user mentions having problems accessing links and includes phrases like \"add user\" and \"code.\" It seems to focus on access issues, which leads me to think it fits best under the \"Access\" category. While \"Internal Project\" was a consideration given the project context, \"Access\" feels like the most appropriate choice since it directly addresses the user's concerns.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Internal Project\" because it relates to a project. However, the user\u2019s message isn't very clear, as they mention accessing links and adding users. The most telling part indicates access issues, so I think \"Access\" is the right choice. To respond correctly, I should generate a JSON category object: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}` without adding extra text. That\u2019s the clean way to handle it!"
