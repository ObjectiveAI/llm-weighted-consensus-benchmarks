I think the best fit here is the \"Hardware\" category, as it pertains to mobile phones and the associated problems being reported. This decision seems to align well with the content of the ticket.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the IT Ticket about \"mobile phone replacement tickets,\" which suggests it\u2019s related to hardware asset management. There's also a mention of a drive running out, pointing towards storage issues, but since it's primarily about phone replacements, I'd categorize it as \"Hardware.\" \n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that outputs the selected category correctly.
