The user mentions a \"new starter\" in Denmark who needs hardware approved urgently and that there's an attachment with a completed form. Given the emphasis on \"approved hardware\" and the role of \"mobility officer,\" it\u2019s clear that this request is about equipment for a new employee. I think the best categories for this would be Hardware or Purchase. Access might not fit as well.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing a request that indicates a need for hardware for a new starter. The terms \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"approved hardware\" suggest this is specifically about supplying equipment. Since it mentions Denmark, I'm considering whether it fits into the \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase\" categories\u2014hardware provisioning usually falls under \"Hardware.\" There's no reference to account access, so \"Access\" might not be relevant. Based on the information, categorizing this ticket as \"Hardware\" seems like the best choice.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
