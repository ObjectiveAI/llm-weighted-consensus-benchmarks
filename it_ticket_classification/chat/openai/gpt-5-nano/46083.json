Given the mention of Oracle and time notifications for someone leaving, it seems best to classify it as \"HR Support.\"**Finalizing the Category**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the categories for the IT ticket. HR Support is clearly for HR issues, while Internal Project relates to internal tasks and Administrative rights addresses permissions. The phrase \"Oracle leaver missing time notification issue\" indicates a problem with the HR module, especially regarding notifications for someone leaving. So, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"HR Support.\" \n\nNow, I\u2019ll format my final response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That should work perfectly!**Determining the Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether this ticket could fall under \"Access\" due to the mention of updating a record. However, the phrase \"leaver missing time notification issue sent re update record\" suggests it revolves around a terminated employee's time record not being updated. This indicates it's more HR or payroll related. My conclusion is that \"HR Support\" is the best fit here. Now, I just need to produce the final response!"
