I'm identifying relevant categories like \"Access\" for dashboard access or \"Administrative rights\" for granting privileges. \"Miscellaneous\" could also apply. Since the ticket likely involves monitoring rights, \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" seem the best choices. If the ticket is about user access to the dashboard, I\u2019ll choose between those two categories.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm working on outputting the category in a JSON-like format, like {\"category\":\"Access\"} or {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. The ticket mentions removing someone from dashboard access, which makes it relevant to both categories. Since it's focused on access control, I might lean towards \"Administrative rights,\" which is more specific for granting or removing access. The text implies a need to adjust dashboard access, confirming the administrative aspect. I need to finalize the choice between these categories.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
