The text suggests a request for adding security access for \"the PM\" due to an event tomorrow evening, along with some details about revocation and regular access. I need to choose a category from \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It seems like the best fit would be \"Access.\"**Categorizing security access request**\n\nThe content is clearly about security access to premises for an event tomorrow evening. It looks like there\u2019s a request to add this access, and it may be temporary. The term \"Administrative rights\" seems misaligned since this is related to physical access, not system admin rights. Therefore, I conclude that the best category is \"Access.\" I\u2019ll produce the required JSON object accordingly without extra commentary. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll submit: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
