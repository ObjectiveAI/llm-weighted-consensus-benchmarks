It looks like the request is related to a \"design lead requisition change.\" The user seems to be asking for help changing a unit or position on a requisition. I'm noticing phrases indicating a mistake was made about the position chosen. It'll probably fit into an internal IT category, like HR Support or Administrative rights. Let's clarify that purpose a bit more before routing it.**Categorizing ticket options**\n\nI need to categorize this request into one of the predefined categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. It seems to involve changes regarding requisitions and positions, specifically the difference between a \"design lead\" and a \"unit.\" Given the context, it looks like an HR or Administrative task. I believe \"HR Support\" is the best fit since it's about job requisitions, and \"Purchasing\" doesn't quite apply here.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe user mentioned \"design lead,\" which seems to indicate a role, while \"unit order position\" could refer to a team. The phrase \"select minds location\" hints at something related to HR requisition processes. I think it makes sense to categorize this request as \"HR Support.\" Now, I need to craft a final answer in the specified JSON format. The response should include a JSON object like: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}\u2014keeping it plain and straightforward to match the schema provided.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
