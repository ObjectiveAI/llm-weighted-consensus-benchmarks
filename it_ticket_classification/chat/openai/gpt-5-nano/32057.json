The recurring word \"license\" suggests it's related to licenses, likely falling into \"Purchase\" since it seems about buying licenses. However, \"Access\" might fit if it relates to access licensing. The mention of \"puma\" maybe shows a product reference, but I'm not certain about that part.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm trying to figure out if \"Puma\" refers to a project or something related. The user mentions \"design lead,\" which might imply they're asking for a license associated with that role. However, considering the context, it seems more likely to be about license procurement, particularly for software. Given the minimal content, I'm categorizing this as \"Purchase.\" I'll provide the response in a JSON format, so it'll be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nThis follows the exact values required in the category list!"
