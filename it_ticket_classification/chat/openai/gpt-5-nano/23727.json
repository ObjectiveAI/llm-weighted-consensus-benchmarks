It discusses things such as \"certificate authority,\" \"authentication,\" and \"failover.\" Given the context, this could fall under \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" I'll determine which category fits best based on the content.**Classifying ticket categories**\n\nI need to categorize this ticket into one of the options like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project.\" It appears to be an internal project management ticket focused on network maintenance and planned outages. The content mentions authentication, access control, and certificate authority, which relate to security. While \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" might fit, it seems like \"Internal Project\" is the best choice because it involves implementing planned maintenance and managing user communication through the process.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI realize that \"Administrative rights\" isn't the right fit for this ticket. \"Access\" could work because of the mention of authentication and users during changes. However, since the user asked to categorize the IT ticket, they expect only one category. I think \"Internal Project\" is the best choice since it focuses on maintenance and change management. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format required, including the category. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
