The user provided information about a move in Frankfurt, mentioning updates and assistance requests multiple times. This suggests it's related to a location update or an office move. \n\nThe available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I\u2019m leaning towards Internal Project or maybe Administrative tasks, but I\u2019m not entirely sure. This could be tricky!**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this ticket. The user\u2019s description suggests that the move could be an \"Internal Project\" since it involves a location change. \"Administrative rights\" seems less fitting unless it's also about updating access permissions. The ticket mentions \"frankfurt\" and \"fusion,\" which might refer to a specific system or location. It also includes terms like \"loc linked\" and \"ext,\" hinting it might involve phone extensions. Overall, labeling it as an \"Internal Project\" seems to make the most sense, so I\u2019ll propose that category in a JSON format.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
