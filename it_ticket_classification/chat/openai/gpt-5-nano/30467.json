The ticket mentions changes to a meeting room booking system and includes phrases like \"important high,\" \"informed,\" and \"changes.\" It seems focused on booking system adjustments, room access, and storage availability. Given this context, I think the best fits would be \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access.\" It\u2019s really about understanding how these changes affect meeting room access or possibly an internal project around the booking system.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket using the provided categories. The ticket discusses changes to a meeting room booking system, mentioning reserved areas and secured storage. It seems the user is requesting updates to the booking system, which could relate to either an internal IT project or an administrative task. I think \"Internal Project\" fits best given its focus on system updates, but \"Access\" might also apply since it addresses who can book the rooms. It's a bit unclear, but I'll figure it out!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at how to best categorize the IT ticket. It mentions \"changes\" and \"booking system,\" which makes me think it's about updating the system rather than just admin rights. The terms \"Internal Project\" and \"Access\" come to mind based on what\u2019s mentioned. Since it focuses on the request to modify the booking system, \"Internal Project\" seems most fitting. I should respond with a JSON object reflecting this category as per the system's instructions.**Delivering the category**\n\nI need to format the output correctly as a JSON object with the category specified as one of the enumerated values. So, I\u2019ll go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure the capitalization is right since it includes a space. I think it\u2019s best to keep it straightforward and avoid any unnecessary details. I'll send this in the final channel. It\u2019s time to deliver!"
