The \"Internal Project\" category might work since it\u2019s about a repository called \"careers.\" However, there\u2019s a focus on rights management with mentions of adding members and rights investigations, which leads me to think \"Administrative rights\" fits best. So, I\u2019ll prepare my response as a JSON object with the category set to \"Administrative rights.\" Here\u2019s the final output: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
