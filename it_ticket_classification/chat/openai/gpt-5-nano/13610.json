The ticket includes elements like modifying calendar bookings and meeting room cancellations. It could fit under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" since it's about modifying those bookings. Although it relates to a leaver, it's primarily an IT ticket rather than HR support, so I should lean towards \"Administrative rights\" for this categorization.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the provided options. The categories include \"Administrative rights,\" which is for adjusting permissions or deleting resources, or \"Miscellaneous\" if nothing fits perfectly. Analyzing the ticket, it seems to lean towards IT administration tasks rather than HR support. While \"Access\" could work since it relates to calendar access, there\u2019s a clear distinction in the options, so \"Administrative rights\" seems most appropriate for this case.**Determining category for ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket about deleting calendar bookings for a departing employee, which suggests a task related to access deprovisioning. The options are limited, with \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Internal Project\" not applying. \"Administrative rights\" could somewhat fit, but it\u2019s more about admin access or privileged tasks. Since deleting bookings is about removing user access and resources, I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category for this situation.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
