The ticket mentions a blocked screen requiring a numeric code, suggesting it's about access or possibly storage. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Access,\" since it involves login and recovery key scenarios. However, it might also fit under \"Storage\" if it's more about encryption recovery, like with BitLocker. I need to make sure I categorize it accurately!**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nThe available categories don't list \"Security,\" but I think \"Access\" fits best for this situation since it involves login and recovery keys for the laptop. I'll categorize it as Access. Then, I need to format the output as a JSON object, specifically {\"category\":\"Access\"} which matches the schema's expectations. It's important that I stick to this format without any extra text. I\u2019ll finalize it so it\u2019s clear and precise!"
