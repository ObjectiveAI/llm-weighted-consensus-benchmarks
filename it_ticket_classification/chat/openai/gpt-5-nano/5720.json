Phrases like \"currently assigned unfortunately has left\" suggest they can\u2019t make changes themselves, perhaps indicating a request for administrative rights. Overall, it looks like the most fitting categorization for this ticket is HR Support.**Categorizing organizational change ticket**\n\nThis IT ticket is regarding organizational changes and needs appropriate categorization. I see options for \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The user is asking for help with changing their line manager and mentions \"cannot change,\" which suggests it\u2019s an HR process. The strongest candidate is \"HR Support,\" but since it involves access to resources related to the manager change, \"Access\" might also fit. Overall, I think \"HR Support\" is the best category due to its focus on HR processes.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s message mentions a \"change line manager\" and that their current manager has left, making it clear they need help with this transition. It seems they found a guide and want to initiate a change. The most fitting categories are \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" Since the request revolves around changing a line manager, it\u2019s best categorized as \"HR Support,\" as it pertains to employee relations and organizational changes rather than IT access. I\u2019ll propose \"HR Support\" for the ticket.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
