While it could fit \"HR Support,\" I'm also considering \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" because of the specific nature of the tasks mentioned. I need to find the best fit!**Selecting category for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that the best fit for this IT ticket is \"HR Support\" because it involves timecards and contracts. However, \"Internal Project\" might work if it relates to project management tasks. The ticket mentions things like \"timecards moved,\" which strongly ties to HR processes. \n\nI should respond with a JSON format that includes the category. I\u2019m settling on: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It feels right, but maybe I should also consider asking the user clarifying questions to ensure I\u2019m on the right track.**Outputting JSON for category**\n\nI need to make sure I output exactly the JSON object for the category. The chosen category must be a valid string from the enumerated list. So, I\u2019ll present it as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. \n\nNo extra text should accompany this, just the plain JSON format. This helps keep things clear and straightforward for the user. I've got it ready to go!"
