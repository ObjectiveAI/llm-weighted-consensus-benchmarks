This could fall under \"Internal Project\" or potentially \"Administrative rights\" for access issues, though it doesn't relate to hardware, storage, or purchases.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like I need to categorize an IT ticket, and the most fitting option seems to be \"Internal Project\" since it's about project setup. The format requires outputting a JSON object with the field \"category\" assigned the value \"Internal Project.\" The user specifically asked for categorization, so I won't add extra commentary or justification. I\u2019ll just deliver the result in the required format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
