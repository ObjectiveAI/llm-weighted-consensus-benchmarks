It suggests that external communication will be unavailable, which is significant. I think this fits best under \"Internal Project,\" though \"Administrative rights\" could be a consideration too.**Categorizing maintenance notifications**\n\nI\u2019m trying to determine which category fits best for the \u201cMaintenance notification.\u201d The options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. This notification is about planned maintenance for migration, so \"Internal Project\" seems reasonable. There's also mention of external communication being unavailable, which could relate to \"Access,\" but it's more about downtime rather than requesting access. I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit, even though \"Miscellaneous\" could work too. Ultimately, I'll classify this as JSON with the selected category.**Providing JSON category response**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since it relates to the planned maintenance for migration. I need to format the response as a JSON object according to the schema provided. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I want to keep it concise and ensure it's valid JSON with no extra explanations. So I'll return just the JSON object as specified."
