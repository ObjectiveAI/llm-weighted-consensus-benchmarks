The user reported an error when trying to add documents. It could relate to file storage or document management. \"Storage\" seems relevant since it concerns document storage, but I can also consider \"Access\" if it\u2019s about permission issues. Since the message is unclear, I might classify it as \"Miscellaneous,\" though \"Storage\" could also fit well.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nIn IT ticket taxonomy, an error related to adding documents usually falls under content management or storage. There's also a category for \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are needed. The user mentions \"manager,\" which could imply some hierarchal context, but they mainly seek help with the error. Without more info, I think the best categories might be \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Access.\" I should choose one, perhaps leaning toward \"Access\" since it suggests a potential permissions issue.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nIn many IT workflows, issues that aren't clearly assigned usually fall under \"Miscellaneous.\" However, there's a risk if the reviewer expects \"Storage\" for document-related problems. The term \"adding documents\" might imply uploading to a repository, making \"Storage\" a plausible choice. The directive indicates I should select one category. Given the minimal content, I\u2019ll choose \"Miscellaneous\" as a safe fallback. So, I'll format the final response as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
