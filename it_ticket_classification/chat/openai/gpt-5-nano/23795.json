The ticket seems to mention a \"PC,\" \"installation,\" and possibly refers to a purchase order. Based on the keywords, \"hardware\" feels like the most suitable category since it\u2019s discussing a PC and installation. So, hardware it is!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering the ticket categorization options. While \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" don\u2019t fit, \"Purchase\" could relate to \"po\" as in purchase order. However, since the ticket focuses on the installation of a PC, \"Hardware\" seems like the best fit. The user wants me to categorize this IT ticket, so I'll create an output like:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI double-checked the content, and with mentions of \"PC\" and \"installation,\" it confirms that \"Hardware\" is the right choice!**Formatting the Output**\n\nI need to ensure that my output aligns perfectly with the required format. The schema indicates that I should respond with a JSON object that includes a \"category\" that reflects the appropriate options. So, I\u2019ll format it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI want to keep it straightforward and avoid any extra text, just the clean JSON response as needed. All set to deliver this!"
