I'll make sure to assign it to the most appropriate category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe content revolves around the leaver process, mentioning things like leaver forms, access rights, and deprovisioning. I see references to items like roaming profiles, mailboxes, and AD rights. Given these details, it\u2019s clear that this ticket relates to access removal. The best fit for a category here seems to be \"Access,\" although \"Administrative rights\" could also apply if focusing solely on AD aspects.
