The ticket mentions things like \"new purchase\" and \"log installation,\" which hints at installation details. Since it primarily revolves around the purchase of equipment, I think the best fit for the category would be \"Purchase.\" It definitely emphasizes a new acquisition, so this choice seems appropriate!**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm determining the right category for the IT ticket based on the details provided. It repeatedly mentions \"new purchase,\" which strongly indicates the \"Purchase\" category. I initially considered \"Administrative rights,\" but it doesn\u2019t fit. It also notes some hardware components, but it's primarily about logging the installation for a new order. The safest and most appropriate category is definitely \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object like this: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
