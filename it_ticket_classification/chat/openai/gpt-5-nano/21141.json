From the category list like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others, I'm looking to choose the one that fits best. Given the nature of the request, it seems to revolve around account management, so \"Access\" might be the most suitable option for this situation.**Evaluating ticket categorization**\n\nThe ticket content centers around configuring notifications, security issues related to accounts, and user roles, which clearly points toward Access or Administrative rights. The mention of \"default watcher\" and \"issue security\" suggests it's related to project settings, specifically access and permissions. I\u2019m thinking that \"Access\" is likely the most fitting category since the request emphasizes setting up notifications and managing security, which aligns with access and permissions management within a project.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
