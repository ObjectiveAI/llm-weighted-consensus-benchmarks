The user mentions various aspects related to timecards, like requesting information and where to submit them. It seems this could fall under \"HR Support\" since it deals with payroll. But since it's an IT ticket, it might also relate to access issues with the timecard system. The categories I have to consider include \"Access,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Administrative rights.\"**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI need to clarify the user's request about codes, timecard locations, and managing timecards. It appears to relate to the HR/payroll system, so \"HR Support\" seems most fitting. While some might think of \"Access\" since there are mentions of codes, the focus is really on timecard system usage. Given the context, the final decision is to go with \"HR Support.\" Now, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the required category."
