It mentions the storage team, storage drive increases, and issues with available free space affecting a viewer application that stops processing reports. Based on the context, this seems to relate to storage capacity, so I'll go with the category \"Storage.\" I won't consider \"Software\" since it's not listed, and \"Miscellaneous\" isn't the best fit. I'll format my response as a JSON category object.**Responding with the correct format**\n\nI need to respond with a category object that has a property called \"category\" with a string from allowed values. Based on the ticket information, that should be \"Storage.\" The instruction says I need to present the output in a way that can be parsed by code or displayed in an app, which means I should avoid special formatting.\n\nI can simply respond with `{\"category\":\"Storage\"}` since the \"type\" specification isn't necessary for the output. The focus remains on delivering the correct category.**Confirming the category response**\n\nI need to provide a category string, and based on the instructions, I'll respond with a JSON object. I think I'll go with `{\"category\":\"Storage\"}` since the content strongly indicates that the issue revolves around storage capacity. \n\nI\u2019ve double-checked; the request seems to relate to increasing the storage drive capacity or free space. The user mentions that the viewer application occasionally stops processing reports due to space issues, which reinforces that this is indeed a storage matter. So, \"Storage\" is definitely the right choice!**Providing a clear JSON response**\n\nI want to keep things simple and straightforward here. The task is to answer with just a JSON object for the category. I\u2019ll avoid any extra text that may complicate things. So, I\u2019ll respond directly with: \n\n`{\"category\":\"Storage\"}` \n\nThis maintains clarity and meets the user's request without any confusion or additional information. Keeping it concise helps ensure that it\u2019s easily understandable for whoever reads it!"
