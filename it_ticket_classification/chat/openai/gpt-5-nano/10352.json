However, since the content repeatedly mentions patch cords and they're clearly hardware items, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as Hardware and output it in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering that the ticket could also fit under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" However, categorizing it as \"Hardware\" makes the most sense since it's clearly about patch cords. So, I'll ensure to output the response in the required format, keeping it concise: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. No extra text needed here; just sticking to the essentials!"
