Since the issue at hand is clearly related to hardware \u2014 specifically a display problem \u2014 I should place this ticket under the \"Hardware\" category. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like structure to keep it minimal and straightforward, giving them exactly what they asked for.I see that I need to provide a straightforward output in JSON format without any special formatting since it may be parsed by code or shown in an app that can't handle that. So, I'll keep it simple and clear. The category for the IT ticket we identified is \"Hardware.\" My response will be just the JSON object, ensuring it meets the specified requirements. Here\u2019s what I'll deliver: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
