However, there could be aspects of Purchase since they refer to requests for monitors. The content is a bit messy, but it seems like it primarily fits into Hardware procurement since it's about requesting a monitor. I'll go with Hardware for clarity.**Determining the Category for IT Ticket**\n\nThe user's mention of \"monitor request\" indicates that there are multiple requests for monitors, which clearly relates to hardware. The safest classification here is Hardware, since it's about hardware devices. Although there\u2019s a Purchase category, the user didn\u2019t mention purchasing or ordering, just requesting. So, I\u2019ll classify it as Hardware. \n\nI should respond with a simple JSON object: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. No extra text is needed since the user specifically asked for a categorization.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
