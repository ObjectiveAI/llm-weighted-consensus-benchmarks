The options I have include categories like HR Support or Access, as this seems related to onboarding. The ticket content suggests help with the starter form, so it might fit under either HR Support or Access. I'll decide which one it aligns with best based on the specifics mentioned.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nTypically, a \"new starter\" involves setting up accounts or access, but here, the focus is on filling out a \"starter form.\" The user's request indicates they need help with that form, which seems related to onboarding. \"HR Support\" is a plausible category since it relates to onboarding processes, while \"Access\" might apply to account setups. However, since the ask specifically involves filling out the form, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"HR Support.\" I'll respond with a JSON object specifying this.**Crafting Response**\n\nI need to make sure I'm providing a clear response based on the instructions. Since it specifies that I should return a category object, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward. My response will simply be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It seems simple enough, but I want to ensure I\u2019m following the guidelines correctly. So, I'll respond with just that JSON object and be done with it!"
