It mentions a \"purchase order requisition\" and requests to \"log installation,\" which points towards a category related to purchases. It seems best to categorize this under \"Purchase\" since it primarily involves purchase orders, rather than \u201cInternal Project\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights,\" which aren't as relevant here. Overall, I'll go with \"Purchase\" as the most fitting category for this ticket.**Constructing Response Format**\n\nI need to consider the specific instruction to \"Categorize this IT Ticket.\" It looks like the user expects me to respond with a JSON object that includes a category key, following the provided schema. So, my response should simply be in the format of a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. I must ensure that I don't add any extra text and that the response matches the required schema precisely. Time to finalize that!"
