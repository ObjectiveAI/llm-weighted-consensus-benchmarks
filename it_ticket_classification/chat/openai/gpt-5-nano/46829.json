Since it directly relates to the hardware and drivers, \"Hardware\" seems like the best fit. \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous\" are possibilities too, but they don\u2019t quite match. So I'll go ahead with \"Hardware\" as the final choice!**Creating a JSON response**\n\nThe prompt specifies a JSON schema with a required category. I need to create a JSON object with \"category\": \"Hardware.\" Since the user asked to categorize an IT ticket, this seems appropriate. I should keep it valid and straightforward, ensuring no extra text is included since the output may need to be parsed by code or displayed in an app. I\u2019ll just provide the JSON object as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} and make sure the string matches the enum precisely!"
