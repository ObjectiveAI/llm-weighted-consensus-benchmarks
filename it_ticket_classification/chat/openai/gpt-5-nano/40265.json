The user mentioned they can't join a meeting that was sent on a specific date with high importance. Considering the categories available, it seems like the \"Access\" category fits best since the issue is clearly about access to a meeting platform. \"Administrative rights\" might apply if that's what's blocking them, but \"Access\" feels more straightforward right now. I'll respond accordingly!**Outputting category for IT ticket**\n\nI have to categorize an IT ticket, and my response should follow a specific JSON format. The user wants just the category based on the ticket details. Since the ticket mentions an inability to join a meeting, the appropriate category is \"Access.\" I\u2019ll ensure my output is just the JSON object: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}` with no additional commentary. Double-checking that \"Access\" is the correct term here, it seems straightforward. I'll respond accordingly!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
