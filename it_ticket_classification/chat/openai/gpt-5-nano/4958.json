The ticket involves scheduling tests, liaising with engineers, and dealing with bandwidth, but I don\u2019t think \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous\" are suitable. It really comes down to categorizing it as \"Storage\" because it encompasses backup and data records. I need to respond with a JSON format indicating the category. I'll choose \"Storage.\"**Creating a JSON response**\n\nI need to provide just a JSON object for the category response. The instruction emphasizes this format, and even though I could add a brief justification, it doesn't require it. After considering the content of the ticket, I thought about whether \"Hardware\" might fit due to mentions of cables and the CPU. However, since the main focus is on backups and tests, \"Storage\" seems more appropriate. So, I\u2019ve decided on: {\"category\":\"Storage.\"}"
