It could fall under \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous\" since it involves membership status and administrative contact. So, I'll classify it accordingly.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user seems to need help with membership status changes and access issues. Based on what I see, \"Access\" is the best fit, although it could also relate to \"Administrative rights\" due to mentions of administrators. However, the general issue revolves around access because of an ended membership. Since this is for IT ticket categorization, I'll classify it as \"Access.\" So, I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format, which is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
