It seems this is mostly about hardware and procurement. Given the options available, I think it fits best under either \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware,\" but it seems more aligned with \"Hardware\" since it's specifically about mouse types.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket seems to be about stocking or replenishing mice. I don\u2019t think \"administrative rights,\" \"access,\" or \"internal project\" applies here, so that narrows it down. The best fit looks to be either \"Purchase\" for procurement or \"Hardware\" since it involves equipment. Given the instruction to create a replenishment by an administrator, it clearly aligns with \"Purchase.\" I need to output the category in the specified JSON format, which will be: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
