But it\u2019s a bit nuanced!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, focusing on the phrase \"announce scheduled works tomorrow,\" which initially led me to think of \"Administrative rights,\" but that doesn't quite fit.\n\nThe mention of \"senior infrastructure engineer\" is a role reference. The phrase \"maintenance works on services\" could imply a maintenance window announcement. However, there isn't a specific category for \"Maintenance,\" so I\u2019ll opt for \"Internal Project,\" as it pertains to infrastructure tasks.\n\nNow, I'll create a JSON object to present the chosen category clearly. It\u2019ll be formatted correctly to meet the user\u2019s requirements!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
