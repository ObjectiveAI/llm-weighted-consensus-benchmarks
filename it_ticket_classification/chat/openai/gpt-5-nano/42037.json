The instructions suggest that I should respond with a JSON object, specifically {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. \n\nI need to ensure that I'm following the format as outlined. It\u2019s just about providing the category value as specified in the schema.**Preparing the JSON output**\n\nIn previous tasks, I've used a simple JSON object for the category, which in this case is {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. I want to ensure I stick to the options provided. So, I\u2019ll craft a concise answer: \"HR Support,\" but I'll format it correctly as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. \n\nI see that the response format requires this level of specificity, so I'll keep it straightforward and deliver just that without adding any extra text."
