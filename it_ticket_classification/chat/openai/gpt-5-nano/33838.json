The categories I have are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The mention of \"project extension\" and \"forecasting additional months\" points towards the \"Internal Project\" category since it\u2019s about a project timeline. The user seems to want this for triage purposes, so I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit.**Deciding the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m parsing a request that mentions \"project extension\" and \"forecasting additional months,\" and it seems to revolve around project management. Looking at the options, \"Internal Project\" feels like the right choice since it fits the context best. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" don\u2019t quite match, and \"Purchase\" isn't relevant without resource implications. If needed, I could fallback to \"Miscellaneous,\" but I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll respond with the category structured as a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Formatting the output**\n\nI need to respond with just the category based on the requirements. The instruction specifies to categorize the IT ticket, and \"Internal Project\" seems to be the appropriate choice. Given the schema requires a specific format, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and respond with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. No extra explanation is needed; I\u2019ll stick to the essentials and proceed with just the JSON object as instructed."
