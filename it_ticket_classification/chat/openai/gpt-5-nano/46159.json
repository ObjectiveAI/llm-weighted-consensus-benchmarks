It\u2019s a straightforward task in theory, but I want to make sure I don\u2019t miss anything important. Let\u2019s get this sorted out!**Categorizing IT ticket request**\n\nThe user provided a string that appears to be a request regarding \"leaver\" issues. They mention reminders for leaver forms and the need to submit these forms, highlighting a mandatory section related to role matching. It really sounds like it fits into the \"HR Support\" category based on the context. I want to make sure I categorize this IT ticket properly since it's crucial. Let\u2019s ensure it gets addressed the right way!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe categories I need to consider include \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The term \"leaver\" often refers to employees who are leaving, and IT tickets related to this typically involve access provisioning and deactivation of accounts. The user seems to be asking for help with a leaver form, mentioning mandatory sections and submission issues. Since the context is IT, I think \"Access\" would be the closer fit, even though \"HR Support\" might also apply. Let's categorize it accurately!**Categorizing leaver form request**\n\nThe content mentions a \"leaver form,\" likely relating to an HR process for when an employee leaves, while IT may assist with form submission or deactivating access. The user is asking for help in categorizing this ticket, so I should focus on picking the most fitting category. The mention of \"administration officer\" suggests HR personnel might be involved, but it\u2019s a bit ambiguous. I\u2019ll choose carefully to ensure it's categorized correctly!**Categorizing leaver form ticket**\n\nThe user's message is all about \"leaver issues,\" likely concerning HR processes related to employee departures. They're discussing the \"leaver form,\" which includes a \"mandatory section\" requiring specific roles. Given the IT context, it sounds like they're seeking help categorizing this IT ticket. I see potential for both \"HR Support\" and \"Access,\" but since the focus leans more towards HR due to the form details, the best category might be \"HR Support\" for HR processes involving leavers.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
