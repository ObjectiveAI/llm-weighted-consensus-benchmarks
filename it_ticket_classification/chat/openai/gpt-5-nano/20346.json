The provided message is challenging to decipher, but it seems to relate to HR matters, especially with terms like \"maternity\" and \"administration officer.\" \n\nSince there are predefined categories, I\u2019ll select \"HR Support\" for the JSON object. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This way, it fits the requirements and helps direct the ticket appropriately!**Interpreting ticket content**\n\nI need to interpret the ticket that mentions \"new starter,\" which suggests onboarding. The location \"Bucharest\" and timing details \"Thursday February PM\" are also included. The text mentions \"maternity\" twice, indicating HR-related tasks, like maternity leave and possibly returning from it, involving an administration officer.\n\nWhile there could be an argument for the \"Access\" category since onboarding often requires user accounts, the clear ties to HR make \"HR Support\" the best fit for the ticket classification.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nIt seems like the message is about filling out forms for a staff member returning from maternity leave in March. The \"HR Support\" category fits best. Since the user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, I should output it as a JSON object.\n\nAlthough \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" might seem relevant, they're not in this case. Given the repeated mentions of \"maternity\" and the \"administration officer\" aspect, I\u2019m confirming that \"HR Support\" is indeed the right choice. \n\nSo, I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
