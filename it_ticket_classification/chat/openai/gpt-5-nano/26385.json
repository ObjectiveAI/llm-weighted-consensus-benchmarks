It seems to be related to onboarding a new starter and mentions a starter form completion. The available categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since this ticket involves onboarding and possibly access provisioning, placing it under \"Access\" seems appropriate. However, \"Administrative rights\" might fit as well because it deals with access rights, making it a bit tricky to decide.**Categorizing onboarding ticket**\n\nI see the ticket mentions phrases like \"starter form,\" \"joining,\" and \"further assistance needed,\" indicating it\u2019s likely related to HR or access onboarding. Based on the categories we have, \"Access\" seems like a good fit. The user seems to be asking for help in categorizing this IT ticket properly. Given that it involves access for a new starter and forms related to onboarding, I think \"Access\" is definitely the right choice for this ticket.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI'm considering the category for the IT ticket. It might also fall under \"Administrative rights,\" but since it's about onboarding, \"Access\" seems to fit best. The user wants a JSON object that clearly states the category. The required format specifies that I need to provide a category within a JSON structure.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text, just as the user requested. That should do it!"
