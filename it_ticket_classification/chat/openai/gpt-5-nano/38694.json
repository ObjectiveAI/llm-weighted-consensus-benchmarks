I'm considering the categories available, like \"Storage\" since it involves file size limits, or \"Access\" since it might involve permissions to send files. There's also a chance it could fit under \"Miscellaneous.\" I really have to be careful about choosing the right one!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket talks about trouble sending files under a certain size and sharing large documents with the sales department in the North region. It seems like this could point to a \"Storage\" issue due to file size limits. While \"Access\" could also be considered, that's more about permissions and not really applicable here. Ultimately, it looks like \"Storage\" is the best fit. I'll output the category as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI need to provide the output as a JSON object with the category field, specifically stating \"Storage.\" The required format is clear, so I'll deliver it accurately as {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I could think about adding some rationale behind the choice, but it isn\u2019t required. Following the instructions precisely is crucial here, so I\u2019ll stick to just the essential JSON output. Let's keep this simple and straightforward!"
