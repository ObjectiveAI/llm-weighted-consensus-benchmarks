Since they seem to be requesting new items, I think \"Purchase\" might be the most fitting choice. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON category object as specified.**Finalizing category output**\n\nI need to create a category output for the IT ticket based on the user's hardware request. The ticket mentions wanting additional items like a monitor, keyboard, and headphones. Therefore, it's likely best categorized under \"Hardware.\" I'll format this correctly as a JSON object, specifically {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, since the system only requires this format. I\u2019ll ensure the output is concise to match the requirements. Let's finalize that response!"
