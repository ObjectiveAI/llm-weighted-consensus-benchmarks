The user mentions things like \"remove the domain net from the block list\", which points toward domain management, and also talks about filtering and blacklisting. There are multiple topics involved like CPS enforcement and trademark rights as well. Considering the possible categories, \u201cAccess\u201d seems to be the best fit since it relates to blocking and domain controls. \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d might fit too, but I lean toward \u201cAccess.\u201d{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
