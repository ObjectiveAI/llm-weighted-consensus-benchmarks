The text is a bit jumbled, but it seems to explain that the shredder isn't working and is located near a printer. They mention trying different outlets but with no success, leading me to think this is a hardware issue. Based on the options in my schema, I'll classify this request under \"Hardware,\" as it clearly focuses on equipment replacement.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket specifies that the document shredder on the 3rd floor, located near the printer, isn't working, and mentions the LED status. It seems they tried different outlets but with no success. I think I should categorize this as \"Hardware.\" If replacement is needed, \"Purchase\" might also apply, but I'll stick with \"Hardware\" since the device isn\u2019t functioning. I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format like this: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. Let\u2019s deliver that!"
