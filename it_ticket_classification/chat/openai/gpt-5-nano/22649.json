The appropriate categories from the provided list are \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" It seems like they are making a hardware request, so I\u2019d consider categorizing it under \"Hardware.\" But, I'm also thinking if \"Purchase\" could work. I need to decide which fits best since both could apply to the request for hardware components.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI see that \"Purchase\" is an available category, which could apply to procurement requests for hardware. The user needs a monitor riser and a keyboard, making the \"Hardware\" category a strong choice as well. But on second thought, \"Purchase\" might be better since they are requesting items. The ticket contains a clear request for equipment. Ultimately, I think I should categorize it as \"Hardware\" but may also consider \"Purchase\" for procurement tasks. I\u2019ll output the appropriate category in the required JSON format.**Interpreting Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m examining the IT ticket, which is requesting hardware components like a monitor riser and a keyboard. The usual classifications here are \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase,\" since they indicate obtaining hardware. Since the ticket content clearly relates to hardware procurement, \"Hardware\" is the most straightforward choice. The user isn\u2019t requesting anything related to access or HR. Therefore, I need to respond with the category in the specified JSON format, like this: {\"category\":{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}}.**Finalizing JSON Output**\n\nI need to ensure that the JSON for the ticket category is formatted correctly. It should just be a single object without any extra wrappers. The simple output should be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I want to stick to the instructions which state that I should respond with just the category in a machine-readable format, without any additional explanation. So, I\u2019ll deliver exactly that: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
