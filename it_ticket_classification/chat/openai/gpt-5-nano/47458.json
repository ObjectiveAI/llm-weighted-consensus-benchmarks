The messages discuss \"access to reports\" and the urgency of accessing server information, suggesting it's related to access control. The potential categories are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given that the request emphasizes needing access, I'll likely lean towards \"Access\" as the main category. But I should also consider whether it falls under \"Administrative rights\" because it involves permissions.**Deciding category for IT ticket**\n\nThe content clearly indicates a request for access to server information, making \"Access\" the most fitting category. The user emphasizes the high priority of accessing reports and links, consolidating the need for access. While \"Storage\" might seem relevant due to mentions of server storage, the core request is about accessing resources. Therefore, I'll finalize with the category as \"Access\" and structure my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
