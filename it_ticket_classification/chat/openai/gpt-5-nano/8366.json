The categories available include \"Access\" and \"HR Support.\" It seems like \"Access\" fits well since this involves onboarding and access provisioning. \"HR Support\" might work too, but the user\u2019s mention of \"new starter\" and \"joining\" points more toward \"Access.\" \"Administrative rights\" seems too narrow for this situation, and \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback if needed.**Categorizing IT ticket access**\n\nThis ticket likely concerns access for user account creation, email, and network access, so it should be categorized as \"Access\" for provisioning. I need to respond with a final JSON format that presents this category clearly. According to the instructions, it looks like I should structure it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nI wonder if it could fit under \"HR Support\" since it relates to a new starter form for onboarding. However, the IT classification leans towards \"Access.\" \"Administrative rights\" seems too specific in this case. So, I\u2019ll stick with \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
