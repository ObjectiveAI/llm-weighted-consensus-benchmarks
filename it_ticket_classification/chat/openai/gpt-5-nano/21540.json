If it requires admin rights, \"Administrative rights\" may be the best fit. However, there's also a note about purchasing licenses, which makes \"Purchase\" another option. The ticket mentions following procedures, pointing towards a need for admin rights to install software. But I wonder if it\u2019s related to a license renewal, considering Maven is usually free. Ultimately, it seems \"Administrative rights\" is the best choice for this situation.**Analyzing license requests**\n\nIt seems like they might be asking for a license for IntelliJ IDEA's Ultimate Edition, while mentioning the Community Edition, which is free. There\u2019s confusion about whether they want two licenses or if \u201cMaven license\u201d refers to something else. The best approach might be to categorize this under \"Administrative rights,\" since it\u2019s about installing software and needing assistance. However, \"Purchase\" could apply due to license requests. Given the unclear wording like \"monitor backpack,\" it\u2019s still safer to choose \"Administrative rights\" for the installation request.**Finalizing category output**\n\nIt looks like \"internal project\" is more for project-specific tasks. I\u2019m deciding to go with \"Administrative rights\" instead. I need to format the output as a JSON object, exactly as instructed: {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}. I'll make sure to keep it straightforward and just present the JSON without any extra text. Alright, here it goes!"
