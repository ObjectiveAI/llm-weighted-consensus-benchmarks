The ticket mentions issues with remote access, such as \"prompt credentials\" and \"session gets disconnected.\" That really points to the \"Access\" category. There's a possibility of it relating to \"Administrative rights\" if credentials are involved, but since it's about login issues, \"Access\" really feels like the right fit. Let\u2019s go with that.**Responding with JSON category**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category for the IT ticket. The allowed categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. Since the issues described point to \"Access,\" I\u2019ll format my response as:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}  \n\nI want to keep it concise here. The instruction is clear, and I might also consider asking clarifying questions in the future, but for now, returning just the JSON object seems to be the right approach. Let's go with that!"
