The content discusses access, permissions, folder migration, and it's marked as high priority. I see terms like \"permissions,\" \"owner,\" and \"decommissioning sites,\" which point to \"Access\" as a primary category. However, since it also touches on \"Administrative rights,\" it could fit there too. The best choice seems to be \"Access,\" focusing on access control and permissions. I\u2019ll output a JSON object with the selected category.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis ticket blends access for a Friday, old migration, permission schema, owner details, and restricting rights. I think \"Administrative rights\" is the most specific category, but \"Access\" could fit as well. Since the focus is on permissions and rights, I\u2019ll categorically go with \"Administrative rights.\" I need to prepare a JSON object with this category, like this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. Even though \"Internal Project\" could be relevant due to migration, the rights aspect is stronger. Let\u2019s finalize that!"
