It could fit into either \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll lean towards \"Internal Project\" since it involves adding a procedure related to changes, which points to a project-related task.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m contemplating the best category for the ticket. It could be \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" They want to add a weekly change procedure, suggesting it's related to an internal project or a process change. I think \"Internal Project\" fits best since it deals with procedure for changes. \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t seem right here, and \"Access\" isn\u2019t relevant either. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" in the response.**Preparing the response**\n\nThe system's category schema indicates I should format my response as a JSON object. The user asked to categorize an IT ticket, so I\u2019ll respond with {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} because that fits their request best. While I could provide a short explanation, it seems sufficient to stick to the schema format. I want to ensure the output matches perfectly, using the correct space in \"Internal Project.\" If needed, I could always ask for clarification later, but I feel confident about this choice."
