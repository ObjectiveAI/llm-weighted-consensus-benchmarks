The request focuses on access to booking details for a specific time, hinting at issues with visibility. I think the best fit would be \"Access\" since it relates to permissions or \"Administrative rights\" because it involves granting access. \"Miscellaneous\" might also work, but it feels less specific. I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" for clarity.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating the category for an IT ticket about making booking information for meeting rooms visible in Bucharest. The content clearly points to a need for access permission, so \"Access\" seems like the right choice. I also considered \"Internal Project,\" but that\u2019s not explicitly stated. I need to ensure my response follows the specified JSON format \u2014 with the correct category being \"Access.\" I'll structure it as a JSON object, ensuring it meets the guidelines.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
