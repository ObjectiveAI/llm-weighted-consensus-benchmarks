The ticket content is a bit jumbled\u2014it mentions a \"leaver,\" \"termination,\" and \"leaver form.\" Since it's about an employee leaving, it likely fits under \"HR Support\" if we're considering the HR aspect. But there\u2019s also a possibility it could relate to \"Access,\" especially if it involves access revocation. I'll go with \"HR Support\" since it's most aligned with the content.**Finalizing the category**\n\nI see that \"HR Support\" is definitely relevant, and \"Access\" could also be applicable since it relates to deactivating accounts. However, the ticket primarily mentions \"leaver form,\" \"termination,\" and \"leaving date,\" which strongly indicates it's an HR-related issue. Given the user wanted me to categorize this IT ticket in a JSON-like format, I need to structure the output correctly.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll return: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}, since it aligns best with managing HR processes for leavers in this context.**Outputting the category**\n\nI see that the text strongly references \"leaver form,\" \"termination,\" and \"leaving date,\" indicating that it\u2019s an HR process rather than a technical issue. Since the user asked to categorize the IT ticket, \"HR Support\" is definitely the best fit. \n\nI'll make sure to present just the required JSON format without any extra wording. So, I'll output:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"} \n\nThat looks perfect!"
