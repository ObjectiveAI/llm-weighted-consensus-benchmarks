The ticket includes various technical terms like \"Raspberry Pi,\" \"robotics,\" and \"automatic irrigation,\" which gives clues about its essence. It seems to be focused on hardware, particularly with the Raspberry Pi component. However, it could also fall under \"Internal Project\" due to the robotics context. Following the instructions, I\u2019ll assign it to the most fitting category and format the output accordingly.**Deciding on Category**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out how to categorize the IT ticket based on the schema provided. I\u2019m grappling with whether to label it as \u201cHardware\u201d since it discusses Raspberry Pi and related projects or to choose \u201cInternal Project\u201d given the robotics context. There\u2019s a mention of \"temporary allocation,\" but it lacks a clear request. While it seems safer to go with \u201cHardware,\u201d the internal project angle is plausible too. I need to ensure I make the most fitting choice based on the content!**Finalizing Category Answer**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the ticket as \"Hardware\" since it focuses on hardware components and setup. Since the user is asking for help categorizing the ticket, I\u2019ll stick to providing just the category in the specified JSON format without any extra explanation. The proper response will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI\u2019m ensuring that I follow the format exactly as instructed and will keep it concise as requested. Alright, I'm ready to provide the answer!"
