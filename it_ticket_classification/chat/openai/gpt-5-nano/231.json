I need to categorize this properly. It seems most relevant to either \"HR Support\" because of the maternity context or \"Hardware\" due to the mention of hardware allocation. There's a chance it could also fit under \"Administrative rights,\" but \"HR Support\" feels like the stronger option given the context.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI've got an IT ticket to categorize based on the user's provided text about returning hardware related to maternity. The strongest category seems to be \"Hardware\" since it directly involves hardware allocation and return. Others like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" and \"Internal Project\" aren\u2019t relevant. While \"HR Support\" could be considered due to the maternity context, it still relates to IT asset management. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware\" and respond in the required JSON format.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe user's instructions specify a certain format for the response, involving a JSON object to categorize the IT ticket. The schema clearly indicates that I need to provide a property called \"category.\" Based on my earlier analysis, the appropriate category is \"Hardware.\" So, I'll craft the response as: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"} without any extra text or content. It's important to follow the format strictly, so I'll ensure that\u2019s all that\u2019s included in my final output."
