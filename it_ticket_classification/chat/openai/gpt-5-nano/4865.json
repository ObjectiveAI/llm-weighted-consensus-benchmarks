The provided text mentions \"change missing timecard notification\" and some HR tasks, which feels related to HR system changes. The categories include HR Support, but I\u2019m wondering if it strictly fits there \u2014 it definitely leans toward HR, though. The mention of reports and notifications indicates it\u2019s HR-related, so I think I\u2019ll categorize it under HR Support after all.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm looking at this IT ticket about changing notifications for missing timecards and adding elements to HR reports. It seems related to internal HR system modifications. The categories I have include \"HR Support,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" While \"Internal Project\" seems broad, \"HR Support\" feels like a better fit because it directly addresses HR needs. The user wants me to categorize it, so I think \"HR Support\" is the most relevant choice after parsing the details.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the tasks related to the IT ticket: adding an employment information tab, filling out something for October, and amending a report to accommodate a period. These all seem to tie back to HR system modifications. The \"HR Support\" category feels like the best fit because it's directly relevant to HR tasks. While \"Internal Project\" could apply, it\u2019s more general. Since the platform asks for a single category, I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support\" in the required format.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
