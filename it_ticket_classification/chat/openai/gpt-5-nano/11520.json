Since the mention of \"OneDrive access\" implies it's about accessing a service, the category of \"Access\" feels most appropriate. However, since OneDrive is also related to storage, I wonder if \"Storage\" could fit too. Still, I'll go with \"Access\" for categorization and respond with the JSON object.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nI just need to format my response correctly based on the required output format for categorizing the ticket. The valid category from the list is \"Access,\" which is right there. I want to make sure it\u2019s spelled correctly, and it is. I'll keep my response minimal since the user only asked for the category. So, I'll deliver it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra details unless requested!"
