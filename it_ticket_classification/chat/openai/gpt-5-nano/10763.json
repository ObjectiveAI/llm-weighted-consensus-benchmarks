It mentions \u201cpop added to Thursday PM,\u201d which could indicate a point of presence. The following part seems to involve a request about Confluence and engineering. Since it pertains to a technical process, it likely fits under the Internal Project category due to its nature involving collaboration and documentation. I\u2019ll clarify that this ticket isn\u2019t well-formed, but it suggests an internal project context.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI'm evaluating the IT ticket, and it seems to relate to an \"Internal Project\" since it mentions adding something to the Thursday PM schedule, along with Confluence and engineering. It could also suggest access-related requests but doesn\u2019t explicitly ask for access. While I wonder about \u201cpop\u201d standing for \u201cPeople of...,\u201d it\u2019s unclear. To play it safe, I\u2019ll classify it as an Internal Project due to its references. I\u2019ll format the response with a category field as specified!**Outputting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m ready to output the category for the IT ticket. I believe \u201cInternal Project\u201d is the best fit since it references engineering and Confluence, along with the Thursday PM scheduling. Although \u201cAccess\u201d could work if it were explicitly about Confluence access, it\u2019s less clear. So, I\u2019ll stick with \u201cInternal Project.\" The response should be in a JSON format. Let\u2019s keep it simple and structured as:  \n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}**Providing JSON Output**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to output a JSON object with a single field for the category. Since I\u2019ve decided that \u201cInternal Project\u201d is the right fit, I\u2019ll format it without any extra text. This keeps it clean and concise. The final output will be:  \n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
