The content includes fragmented phrases like \"vc unit,\" \"networking,\" and mentions of \"test order these implementations.\" It seems related to a video conferencing hardware unit. While the ticket might also touch on purchases or an internal project, I'm leaning toward categorizing it as Hardware since it focuses on the video conferencing asset. It's clearly not about HR or Access.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize the ticket as \"Internal Project,\" but it seems more focused on the hardware aspect. The content involves terms like \"shipment,\" \"order,\" and \"implementation,\" which point toward tasks related to the procurement and configuration of video conferencing units. So, I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit here. The response needs to be structured in JSON format, with the \"category\" key set to \"Hardware,\" matching the required format outlined.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nHistorically, these tasks require a JSON object for the category. So, my response should simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nThe rubric specifies the format with \"## category\" and outlines that it must be a JSON object. I just need to output the category without any extra text to ensure clarity and accuracy. Alright, I\u2019ll make sure to quote it exactly as required."
