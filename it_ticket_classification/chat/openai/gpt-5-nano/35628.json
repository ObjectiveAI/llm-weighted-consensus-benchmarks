The user mentions \"posting a requisition\" and sending it out to everyone, which makes me think it relates to the procurement system. \n\nI\u2019m considering if this should go under \"HR Support\" or \"Purchase,\" and it feels more appropriate as a \"Purchase\" issue. Though it could also be tied to \"HR Support\" if it concerns job requisitions. I think \"Purchase\" is the best fit.**Evaluating requisition categorization**\n\nThe user\u2019s mention of \"posting a requisition\" and \"send everyone requisition\" makes me think this relates to job postings sent to all employees. This could indicate an auto-sending feature for requisitions. While \"HR Support\" seems fitting if it's about job postings, the details in the ticket lack clear HR context. \n\nThe description talks about a bug in sending requisitions, which leans more toward the \"Purchase\" category since it involves procurement issues. Still, it's a bit ambiguous.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nLet's take a closer look at the user's message. They mention that checking the \"send to everyone\" option results in the requisition being sent unexpectedly. This definitely sounds like a bug within the procurement system, which leads me to categorize this ticket as \"Purchase.\" \n\nAlternatively, I could consider \"Administrative rights\" if it were about access control, but it appears to be more about a malfunction. Given the user\u2019s request to categorize the IT ticket, I'll respond with the appropriate category value in a JSON format.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
