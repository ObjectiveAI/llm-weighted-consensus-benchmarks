The user mentions setting a project manager with phrases like \"change pm accordingly\" and \"exert his pm attributes rights.\" \n\nIt looks like the issue revolves around changing project management assignments and adjusting access permissions. So, I think it could fit into either \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll determine the best category from there!**Choosing the right category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, and it seems to revolve around access privileges for project management in Oracle. Phrases like \"set as project manager\" and \"change PM accordingly\" suggest it\u2019s about adjusting roles and rights.\n\nWhile \"HR Support\" could apply because of the mention of a new recruit, \"Administrative rights\" seems more precise for managing access. I'll categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" and respond with a JSON-like structure, possibly providing a brief explanation.**Preparing the JSON output**\n\nThe system requires a JSON object with a \"category\" field that must be a string enum. I\u2019ll prepare it as follows:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nThere shouldn't be any extra text needed, just this JSON object. Even though bullet lists are allowed, it seems I only need to provide the category in this case. I\u2019ll ensure the formatting is correct, delivering it as plain text. Let\u2019s go ahead and deliver!"
