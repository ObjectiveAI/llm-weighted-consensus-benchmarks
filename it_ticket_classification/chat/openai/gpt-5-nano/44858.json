They're experiencing problems with the approval panel not appearing and submissions not routing to approvers. I'll consider how best to categorize this. It seems like it could fit under \"Access,\" since the issues are related to permissions for approvals, or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" The \"Administrative rights\" category also sounds relevant. However, the main focus seems to be on access to the approval system.**Deciding category for IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, and after considering the details, it\u2019s best classified as \"Access\" since it pertains to the workflow for approvals and access to the approvals panel. It could also fit \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s an internal process, but the focus feels strongly on access issues. I need to format my response correctly as a JSON object, so I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That matches the required schema perfectly!"
