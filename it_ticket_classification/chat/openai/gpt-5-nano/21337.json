The user message is a bit garbled, but it seems they\u2019re asking to categorize something related to a project called \"caps\" and a pilot program that runs every Wednesday and Friday. They also mention creating a script, likely for maintenance or automation. I\u2019ll choose the most fitting category based on that.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nIt seems best to categorize this IT ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it relates to a project called \"caps.\" The mention of \"software consultant design lead\" indicates roles involved, but it's primarily focused on a project plan and scripting for a pilot. While \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant, they don't fully apply here. The content about scripts suggests it's more about automation. So, I'll respond with a JSON object indicating the category as \"Internal Project.\" \n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
