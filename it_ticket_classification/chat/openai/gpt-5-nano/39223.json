The user indicates they're receiving a message saying \u201cconnected,\u201d but without any error details, which is quite puzzling. I'll need to clarify what steps to take next to help resolve this.**Interpreting access issues**\n\nThe user is having issues with a remote connection, possibly related to a VPN or VNC. They mention trying to connect using a recommended client, but while it says \u201cconnected\u201d after a few seconds, they receive no error message and can't access something that\u2019s \u201coutside our\u201d location. This seems to fall under the \u201cAccess\u201d category. I need to consider next steps to advise them on resolving this access issue, particularly since it involves something crucial regarding sales.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user is looking for remote access rights to something important for sales, so I need to categorize their request as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll also craft a concise response in JSON format, ensuring it matches the required schema provided. The format indicates I should specify the category as \"Access,\" and I believe I should focus on delivering just that. I\u2019ll respond with the necessary JSON output without additional information. Here we go: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
