The text mentions terms like \"new purchase,\" \"purchase order,\" and \"log installation,\" which lead me to think this is about a new monitor and related receipts. The system has various categories available such as \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" Given that it primarily concerns the purchase of a hardware item, I think the best fit would be the \"Purchase\" category.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket related to a monitor installation. I need to choose a single category in the correct JSON format. The content involves a \"new purchase\" and mentions aspects like \"installing the monitor\" along with \"mandatory receipts.\" Given this, \u201cPurchase\u201d would likely be the most fitting category, but \u201cHardware\u201d could also work since it's about a hardware item. Ultimately, I think I'll go with:  \n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user's request is to categorize an IT ticket focused on the procurement and installation of a monitor. While \u201cHardware\u201d could be suitable since it's a physical item, the repeated mention of \"purchase\" leans me towards the \"Purchase\" category. I think it makes sense to select \"Purchase\" as the primary category. I'll provide the JSON format directly with no extra explanation, just like the user asked:  \n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
