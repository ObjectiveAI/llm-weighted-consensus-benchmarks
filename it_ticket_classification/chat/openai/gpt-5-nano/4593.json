I should decide whether to label it as \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access.\" To be sure of the categorization, I'll need to ask some clarifying questions. The user likely wants a specific category label.**Choosing IT ticket categories**\n\nIn this task, I need to pick the best category based on the content provided. The user mentioned \"automatic message calendar,\" \"automatic calendar,\" and \"change chat,\" which suggests they might want to modify an automated messaging system. Since there\u2019s no specific \"Chat\" or \"Automation\" category, I need to consider options like \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It could also relate to access or administrative rights if they're trying to adjust settings. However, the categories remain quite general, making it tricky.**Deciding on a category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is a safe option when the content is unclear, but I could categorize it as \u201cInternal Project\u201d if it\u2019s intended to modify an automation feature. The user's request doesn\u2019t seem related to hardware, storage, or HR. My proposal is to categorize it as \u201cInternal Project\u201d and note that the user wants to modify an automatic message calendar and chat, needing some clarification. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object, using the required structure.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
