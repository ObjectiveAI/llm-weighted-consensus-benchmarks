The relevant categories are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since it pertains specifically to access control and security, \"Access\" feels like the most fitting choice. Although it could also relate to rights if it were discussing granted permissions, the focus here is on reporting unauthorized usage. So, I'll go with \"Access.\"**Formatting IT Ticket Response**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the provided schema. The user asked for a specific response format, which is a JSON object. The category must be one of the predefined options, and since I've determined \"Access\" is the most appropriate category, I\u2019ll just format it simply. The response only requires the JSON object with no extra text or commentary. So, it\u2019ll look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
