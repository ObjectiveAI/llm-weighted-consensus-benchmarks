The focus here is definitely on revoking access-related permissions and tokens, which leads me to lean towards classifying this ticket under \"Access\" or potentially \"Administrative rights.\" It's a bit tricky to decide!**Classifying access requests**\n\nThe phrase \"Administrative rights\" refers to privileged access, and the user's requests, like \"revoke systems access\" and \"revoking accounts,\" suggest they're focused on access restrictions. The mention of \"switch off\" could imply decommissioning something. Parsing the text shows clear requests for revocation, particularly with \"revoke systems access.\" \n\nWhile \"Access\" seems to be the main category, \"Administrative rights\" might also be relevant if they intend to revoke admin permissions. It's a bit of a close call!**Confirming category classification**\n\nThe user\u2019s request to \"revoke systems access\" suggests they're focused on \"Access,\" not specifically \"Administrative rights,\" though the latter is a subset of the former. Given that the text refers to access management including accounts and AD tokens, it makes sense to categorize this as \"Access.\" \n\nBased on the prompt's structure for a JSON object, I\u2019ll produce one with the category property defined. So, I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and finalize it!"
