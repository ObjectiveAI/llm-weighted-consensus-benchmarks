Since it seems to fit with project management and task logging, I might consider several category options like \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or perhaps \"Administrative rights.\" It's not entirely clear, but those seem to be the best fits based on the context provided.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s message revolves around missing tasks, start dates, and possibly permissions for editing project code \u201coracle.\u201d I\u2019m thinking \u201cInternal Project\u201d makes the most sense since it\u2019s focused on internal project management. There\u2019s mention of adjusting a start date, which hints at needing \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d but that\u2019s not explicitly stated. I also considered \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d but \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems most accurate given the context. I just need to ensure my output is in the correct format, likely as a JSON-like structure.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
