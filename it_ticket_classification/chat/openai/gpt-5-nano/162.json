The ticket mentions \"new starter\" and \"two hires,\" which suggests onboarding. \n\nI\u2019ll consider categories like \"Access\" for system access, \"Administrative rights,\" or \"HR Support.\" Wait, HR Support is indeed an option available. I'll mark this ticket under \"HR Support\" since it pertains to onboarding. Let's go ahead with that!**Deciding ticket categories**\n\nI'm considering the most suitable category for the IT ticket about onboarding new hires. The categories include \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights.\" However, this is an IT ticket, so I think \"Access\" makes more sense, especially since it seems to request access for new starters to join.\n\nThe mention of \"two hires,\" along with the attachment, points to onboarding rather than needing actual admin rights, which aren't specified. So, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" That feels like the right choice!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
