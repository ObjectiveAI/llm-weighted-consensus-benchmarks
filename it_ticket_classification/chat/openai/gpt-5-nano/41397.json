The user's message discusses a \"time card approval flow error,\" which points towards HR-related issues. So, HR Support seems fitting since it's payroll-related. However, there's also a mention of changing configurations that might require Administrative rights. Overall, HR Support is likely the best category here.**Categorizing IT Support Request**\n\nThe user's message mentions a \"time card approval flow error\" and a request to \"change configuration,\" which suggests a focus on HR-related issues. While I could consider categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"HR Support\" seems like the best match since this revolves around fixing the payroll workflow. This is indeed an IT support request aimed at improving the timecard approval process. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and output it in JSON format as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
