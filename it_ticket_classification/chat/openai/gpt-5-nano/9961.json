The categories I can choose from are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the main focus is on hardware and potentially involves purchase orders, I think \"Hardware\" may fit best. However, \"Purchase\" could also work, given the mention of purchases.**Deciding on the category**\n\nI'm trying to determine the best category for the IT ticket provided by the user. It mentions \"hardware allocation\" and includes various items like a wireless mouse and keyboard, which suggests it's mostly about hardware. While there's also a mention of purchase orders (PO), I think the primary focus of the ticket is the allocation of hardware. So, categorizing it as \"Hardware\" seems the most appropriate choice, even though \"Purchase\" could fit too.**Outputting the category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket. The mention of \"bought po\" suggests some internal notes about purchases, but it seems more suitable to categorize it as \"Hardware,\" based on the main focus of the ticket. I need to respond with a concise JSON-like object. The structure I should follow is clear: it will just be {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I won\u2019t include any extra text, just this structured response since that's what the system expects to parse properly.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
