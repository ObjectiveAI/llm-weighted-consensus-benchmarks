The issue described involves Outlook not opening and continuously prompting for credentials, which seems to fit the \"Access\" category as it relates to an authentication issue. There's also a chance it could be classified as \"Administrative rights,\" but there\u2019s no clear request for that. I think \u201cAccess\u201d is the best choice. I\u2019ll note it's about Outlook not opening and credential prompts.**Responding with JSON**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to respond in a specific JSON-like format. I see that the required format includes a \"category\" field with preset options. The best fit for this ticket is \"Access,\" so I'll respond simply with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll keep it minimal without extra explanations unless requested. Just focus on providing valid JSON with the necessary key and value."
