Clarifying questions would help. I\u2019m thinking I could respond with the category and a brief reasoning and then suggest an action: for instance, categorize as \"Miscellaneous\" and recommend investigating the poll service suspension. Lastly, I\u2019ll make sure to use the specified JSON format for the output.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI need to provide a JSON object with the category as specified. I\u2019ll respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}\n\nIt's essential to ensure the category string matches one of the allowed values. While adding a note might seem helpful, the instructions specifically say to keep it to just the category. The valid format requires me to confirm that. \n\nI considered the possibility of using \"Access\" instead, as it could relate to permissions with the poll. However, I believe \"Miscellaneous\" is the safer choice for now."
