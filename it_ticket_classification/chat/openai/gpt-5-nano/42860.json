The user's query seems a bit jumbled, but it\u2019s clearly about an issue with loading applications and search performance. It could relate to loading too much data or slow performance. I should probably categorize it as Miscellaneous, Internal Project, or Access, depending on what fits best.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm trying to sort this IT ticket based on performance issues rather than access credentials. The categories I have are somewhat limited. The ticket mentions \u201cissue loading too much,\u201d which suggests it's a software performance problem. Based on the choices, the best fit may be \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Internal Project,\" depending on its context. Typically, I would lean toward categorizing this as \"Miscellaneous\" for general IT issues. I'll prepare the required JSON object with the category set to \"Miscellaneous.\"{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
