It could fit in \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project,\" but it seems to relate more to general IT support. Since the ticket describes UI issues during a course, \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the best choice. I should format the output as JSON with the category field.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nIt looks like I should respond with JSON only, as the prompt specifies the \"category\" schema. I plan to format it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. \n\nThe instruction is clear about providing just the category in a strict JSON format. Since valid channels require exactly that type of response, I'll keep it simple and provide only this JSON object without any extra text. Let's get that done!"
