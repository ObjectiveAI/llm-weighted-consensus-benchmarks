Therefore, it might fit into \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I need to consider the categories: Access, HR Support, and Administrative rights stand out for this case, as it seems to be about an HR-related IT issue.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nThe mention of \"line manager change\" and \"per attached\" suggests that the user is requesting an update to the line manager in the Oracle system. This could fall under \"HR Support\" since it involves a change in HR data related to manager assignments. Alternatively, it could also be about \"Access,\" referring to permission changes. \n\nHowever, the simplest and most fitting category remains \"HR Support.\" In this case, I think I should structure my response in a JSON format to reflect that.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
