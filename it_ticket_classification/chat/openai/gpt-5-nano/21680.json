It looks like it fits best into the \"HR Support\" category since it involves onboarding. However, I\u2019m also considering \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" as possibilities.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at several categories to classify this IT ticket. It seems to fit under \"HR Support\" since it involves onboarding and starter forms. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" don\u2019t really apply here, and \"Internal Project\" isn't relevant either. \"Miscellaneous\" might be an option, but since this ticket clearly asks about a starter form and an analysis, the best fit is \"HR Support.\" It\u2019s definitely more about onboarding than any technical issues.**Categorizing ticket in JSON**\n\nI need to categorize this ticket and determine if \"Administrative rights\" applies, but that doesn\u2019t seem relevant here. Since it mentions \"analysis attached,\" it points toward onboarding. I\u2019ll go ahead and categorize it as \"HR Support\" since it\u2019s about filling out a starter form. The instructions specify using a JSON format for the response. Therefore, I'll provide the output strictly as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Keeping it concise without additional text is the plan!"
