It seems they can't submit their hours in the Oracle system. The issue arose around Thursday and Friday in March, and they want advice regarding work shifts and free days during the week. This likely falls under HR/support for the timesheet system. I\u2019m considering the best category, which should be either \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Access\" if it's an access issue with Oracle.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m trying to clarify an IT ticket issue where the user has mentioned being \"unable to hours\" in Oracle. It\u2019s not clear if they can log in or if the problem is with submitting hours. I suspect it\u2019s mainly related to the HR system, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" However, there's a chance it could also fall under \"Access\" if it's a login issue. Given they said \"unable to submit hours,\" \"HR Support\" seems to fit best. I'll format my output as JSON indicating the category.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
