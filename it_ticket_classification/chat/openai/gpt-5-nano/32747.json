It mentions \u201cnew starter\u201d and \u201cstarter forms,\u201d so I consider categories that fit. \"HR Support\" seems appropriate since it involves the new hire, but \"Access\" might also work because a new starter needs access. However, since \"HR Support\" is listed as a valid category, that might be the best choice!**Categorizing onboarding tickets**\n\nIn IT ticket systems, I need to categorize requests for onboarding a new user. The mention of \"access\" suggests provisioning accounts, while \"administrative rights\" could indicate a request for admin capabilities. The phrase \"attach starter forms\" hints at HR-related onboarding paperwork. Since the text is a bit jumbled, I think the best category might be \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights.\" But wait, \"Access\" is indeed listed as a category! That's definitely an option. I'll go with \"Access\" for this ticket!**Crafting onboarding ticket response**\n\nI\u2019m looking at onboarding a new starter with a focus on access provisioning, so I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" Since the prompt requests a specific format, I need to create a JSON object to encapsulate this category. \n\nThe required output structure involves specifying the category, and that\u2019s straightforward: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Sometimes, I might need to provide a brief justification, but for now, I'll stick with the necessary JSON response. It's important that the JSON is valid, so I\u2019ll make sure everything is in order before delivering!"
