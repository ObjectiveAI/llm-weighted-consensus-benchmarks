The ticket mentions Oracle issues, submission difficulties with per diem captured, urgent receipts errors, and a client with a deadline tomorrow. This seems to fit best under \"Miscellaneous\" since it doesn\u2019t directly match other categories. I\u2019m concerned it's likely about expense submission in the Oracle ERP system.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket based on available options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket mentions Oracle, which doesn't fit any specific category, so \"Miscellaneous\" seems appropriate for general IT issues. While \"Purchase\" could be considered due to the context of per diem and receipts, it's primarily about an expense submission error. I\u2019ll conclude with the JSON category object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
