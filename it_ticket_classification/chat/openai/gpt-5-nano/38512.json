It likely relates to replacing leased devices, hinting at hardware management. So, I think it fits into the \"Hardware\" category since it involves swapping hardware. However, there's a question of whether to classify it as \"Purchase,\" too, if it\u2019s about leasing versus buying. I'll go with Hardware for now!**Formatting IT ticket category**\n\nThe phrase \"leased\" suggests this is about hardware. \"Swap leased for new set up\" indicates a request to exchange a leased device for a new one, which falls under hardware support. So, I conclude the category is \"Hardware.\" I need to format this as JSON. The required structure needs a category field defined as a string. I'll produce the output as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} and ensure it\u2019s properly formatted without any extra text. Let\u2019s deliver that!"
