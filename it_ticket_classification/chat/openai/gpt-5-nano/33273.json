It mentions load balancers and other details, which makes it tricky. While \"Access\" fits due to the remote port request, I might also consider \"Internal Project\" or even \"Administrative rights\" based on the context.**Processing Network Access Request**\n\nThis ticket is clearly a request for network access, focusing on terms like \"remote port\" and \"load balancer.\" There are mentions of developers and project-related details, hinting it might tie into an internal project. Considering everything, the best category for this ticket appears to be \"Access,\" as it involves enabling resources and remote connections. I just need to respond with a properly formatted JSON object: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI\u2019ll stick to the format without any additional text.**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this ticket, which involves terms like \"load balancer,\" \"infrastructure,\" and \"remote ports.\" It seems like it could fit nicely under \"Internal Project,\" but honestly, the main focus here is on enabling access to resources. Since the primary user request is about remote ports for office resources, I think \"Access\" is the safest and most accurate choice. I'll go with that for my response."
