The ticket mentions \"additional driver install\" multiple times, which suggests a hardware-related issue. The categories I have are \"Hardware\" and \"Administrative rights,\" but since the main focus is on the driver installation, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Hardware.\" It seems most fitting since it's clearly about drivers!**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nLet\u2019s clarify the categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The request to install an additional driver doesn't relate to HR or access issues. It's primarily about hardware, although installing drivers can sometimes need admin rights. However, since the ticket doesn't explicitly mention needing admin rights and seems clear, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with that category.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
