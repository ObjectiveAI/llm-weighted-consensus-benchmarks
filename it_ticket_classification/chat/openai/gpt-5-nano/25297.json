It's a bit messy, and choosing the right category is tricky. I could consider options like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" but neither seem to fit perfectly. \"Miscellaneous\" might be the safest choice given the unclear context, especially since it feels more HR-related. However, the IT angle makes things complicated!**Categorizing ticket ambiguities**\n\nIt looks like the content leans towards HR-related terms like \"discipline,\" \"leave,\" and \"commercial.\" The user is likely trying to create a taxonomy for IT ticket categorization. In uncertain situations, choosing \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" could work. There's a mention of \"oracle system corrections,\" which might fit under \"Administrative rights,\" but it doesn't explicitly indicate that. Nothing fits \"Access,\" \"Hardware,\" or \"Storage.\" I think \"Internal Project\" could be the best bet, but using \"Miscellaneous\" seems safer given the unclear context!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
