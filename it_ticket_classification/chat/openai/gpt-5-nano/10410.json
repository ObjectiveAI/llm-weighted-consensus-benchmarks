It clearly doesn't fit into categories like hardware or access. The best options seem to be \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but \"HR Support\" fits best since it directly relates to paternity leave. I\u2019ll finalize this by ensuring the JSON response includes the appropriate category string field.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object based on the provided schema, which specifies the categories available for the IT ticket. The ticket mentions a paternity leave form, so the appropriate category is clearly \"HR Support.\" I should ensure that my response is purely the JSON object without any extra commentary. I\u2019ll format my final output as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} to match the specifications and confirm it's accurate."
