They talked about not being able to add a link to a document stored in another library and mentioned various processes and teams related to this.  \n\nGiven the provided categories, I think it fits best in \"Access,\" since the problem centers around permissions and linking documents. I'll go with that!**Categorizing Document Issues**\n\nI\u2019m assessing a user's issue involving documents and linking in a library, which could point to various categories like \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Internal Project.\" The problem seems to center around a SharePoint-like library, where they can't link to a document from another library.  \n\nAlthough it\u2019s about documents being stored, the main problem relates to access permissions. I think categorizing it as \"Access\" might be the best fit since it involves linking rather than just storage.**Classifying the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned terms like \"library layouts,\" \"allowed content types,\" and \"incident escalation,\" which indicate this is likely a work-related IT ticket about a SharePoint library issue. They can't add a link to a document from another library. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply, the core issue seems to be about linking documents.  \n\nGiven that the problem revolves around permissions, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Access,\" since it relates to accessing or linking to documents across libraries.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
