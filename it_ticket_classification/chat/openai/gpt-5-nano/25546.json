The user\u2019s message appears to be about details for a new starter\u2019s date. The request suggests it\u2019s likely related to onboarding, so I need to categorize it. We have options like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I think \"HR Support\" would be most appropriate since it involves onboarding a new colleague.**Categorizing onboarding requests**\n\nThe content mentions a \"new starter\" and requests to \"fill enclosed,\" likely referring to the start date and tasks related to setting up for this new employee. I think this could fall under \"Access\" since it seems to involve account provisioning. However, \"Administrative rights\" feels a bit too specific for what they\u2019re asking. Given that they\u2019re requesting assistance with forms, it might also be appropriate to categorize it as \"HR Support\" for onboarding purposes.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThis IT ticket looks like a typical request for onboarding, mainly focused on \"Access,\" which involves setting up email and network drives. The phrase \"fill enclosed\" likely refers to a form that needs to be completed for the new starter. I think the best fit is \"Access\" for this request. I need to prepare a JSON-like category object for the response, so I'll structure it like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"} to match the required schema. It seems pretty straightforward!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
