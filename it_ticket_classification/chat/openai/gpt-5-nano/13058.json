The user\u2019s message is a bit jumbled, mentioning a \"new cable for monitor,\" which is probably hardware-related. However, it could be classified as \"Purchase\" if they're looking to buy one. Still, given the emphasis on the monitor cable, I think \"Hardware\" makes the most sense. I\u2019ll output a JSON object with \"category\": \"Hardware\" just as specified, and keep it simple without any clarifications needed.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI want to make sure I include the category as one of the exact enumerated values. I'm choosing \"Hardware\" for clarity. It\u2019s really important to get the formatting right for JSON, so there won\u2019t be any extra text around it. The goal is to provide a clean and precise answer. Alright, I think I\u2019m ready to deliver the response with proper JSON formatting, ensuring it meets all requirements."
