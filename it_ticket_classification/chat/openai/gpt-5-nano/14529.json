The mention of \"leave requests\" clearly directs me toward \"HR Support.\" However, there are other options to consider, like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or even \"Internal Project.\" I'll focus on the most relevant category. It looks like HR Support fits best given the context of leave management, so I'll classify the ticket accordingly.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user provided a request about adding annual leave to Oracle timecard updates, which seems connected to HR-related system updates. This aligns closely with \"HR Support,\" as it\u2019s not a hardware issue. While \"Administrative rights\" could be an option if they were asking for permissions, they specifically request updates, not access. So, HR Support is definitely the best fit here. Now, I'll prepare to respond with the appropriate JSON category.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
