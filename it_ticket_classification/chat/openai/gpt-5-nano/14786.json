However, if it\u2019s ambiguous, it might fit under \"Miscellaneous.\" The terms suggest it could also connect to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but there\u2019s no clear indication of permissions or login. Overall, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit, but I could ask for clarification to be sure.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and from the text, I see it could fit as \"Internal Project\" or maybe \"Miscellaneous.\" If things are unclear, it might make sense to ask a clarifying question. The content mentions \"new pre-sales code\" and \"creation form,\" so it could relate to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but those aren't explicitly mentioned. Ultimately, I think \"Internal Project\" is the safer choice since it pertains to an internal process, though \"Miscellaneous\" is a possibility due to its vagueness.**Categorizing Ticket in JSON**\n\nThe user is asking for a category, and it looks like I should choose the most accurate one. Given that \"pre-sales code\" implies programming work, \"Internal Project\" seems to fit well for this ticket dealing with internal tasks. I'll format the response as a JSON-like object according to the provided schema. I\u2019ll keep it simple and deliver just the category without extra commentary. So, I'll respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
