It seems to involve installing a monitor riser or lift stand, possibly due to neck pain caused by monitor positioning. The available categories are: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the ticket is about hardware like a monitor riser and requisition, it likely fits under \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" Let's clarify this!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket, which could fit under \"Purchase\" since it mentions requisitioning monitor risers. However, \"Hardware\" might be better because it\u2019s about installing a monitor riser, particularly since they mention neck pain related to monitor height. While \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" and \"Storage\" aren\u2019t applicable, \"Miscellaneous\" is a possibility, but I lean toward \"Hardware.\" The ergonomic concerns don't quite align with \"HR Support,\" so it's best to go with \"Hardware\" for clarity.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" as the most fitting category since the request is about installing a monitor riser, possibly to help with neck pain and ergonomics. Even though there\u2019s some mention of requisitioning the riser, the primary focus seems to be on installation. The text indicates they need help addressing neck pain, which ties back to the hardware aspect. Overall, choosing \"Hardware\" feels right since it's centered on that specific request.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
