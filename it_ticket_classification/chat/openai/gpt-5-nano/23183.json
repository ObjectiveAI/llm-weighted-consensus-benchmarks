There are mentions of a \"buffer folder\" and \"uploading photos,\" indicating this could be an IT support issue. The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the user's focus on shared and buffer folders for event photos, I think it might fit best under \"Miscellaneous\" for this request.**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt looks like I need to categorize the IT ticket based on the user's request. The mention of a \"shared folder\" suggests it could fit under \"Storage\" since it's about a storage location. There's also a reference to \"buffer folder,\" indicating creation, but not much about access permissions. While \"Access\" could be an option, it's less specific here. I think choosing \"Storage\" is the best approach for this ticket. So, I\u2019ll provide the response in a JSON format as required. \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
