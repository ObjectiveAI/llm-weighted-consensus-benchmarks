The content is a bit confusing, with phrases like \"add entries\" and \"music regular billable working maternity leave,\" which seem to relate to HR but are still within an IT context. Given that it mentions \"maternity leave\", it definitely leans toward HR, so I\u2019ll categorize it under \"HR Support.\" But still, the ticket isn't clearly written, which complicates things a bit!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m working on categorizing an IT ticket that includes a request for \"add entries for Tuesday,\" but the rest, like \"music regular billable working maternity leave,\" is muddled. It seems to lean towards HR because of the maternity leave reference. Although \"Internal Project\" could be a fit, the best choice seems to be \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll output it in the proper format. If the user needs clarification, I could always ask more questions later.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
