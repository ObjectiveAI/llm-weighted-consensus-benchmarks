Since it's about a stolen asset, it could also relate to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Hardware\" feels more appropriate overall. I\u2019ll craft a concise categorization saying it falls under \"Hardware.\" The format requires a JSON object showing this, so I'll respond with `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. That's the best fit for this situation!**Finalizing category response**\n\nI\u2019m weighing whether to consider \"Access\" due to the stolen identity angle, but ultimately, that doesn't fit well here. The instructions clearly state to focus on the category only. It says to categorize the IT ticket, and the only allowable response is a JSON object. So, I\u2019m going to finalize by outputting `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. I won\u2019t add any extra text since that\u2019s what the format requires. Let's deliver this straightforwardly!"
