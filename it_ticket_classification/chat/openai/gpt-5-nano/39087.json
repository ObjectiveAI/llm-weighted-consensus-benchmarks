The text mentions issues related to file uploading, a connector, and a request for investigation. This suggests it could fit into the \"Storage\" category since it involves uploading files. It might also relate to \"Access\" due to potential permission problems or even fall under \"Internal Project\" because of the context. If it doesn't align with these, it could be classified as \"Miscellaneous.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nGiven that the issue pertains to a file upload failure, the most appropriate category appears to be \"Storage\" since it\u2019s related to file storage tasks. There\u2019s mention of a \"connector,\" which could imply a connector error, but without additional context, \"Storage\" seems to be the best fit. So I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I want to ensure it\u2019s properly structured and to the point, as the user requested."
