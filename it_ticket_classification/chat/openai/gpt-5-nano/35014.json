Looking at the provided categories, it seems like this issue is centered around accessing a tool, so \"Access\" is likely the most fitting category. It could also relate to \"HR Support,\" given the tool's purpose for referrals, but since the primary issue is access-related, I'll go with \"Access\" for this ticket.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s ticket relates to a bug with the referral tool, which might suggest \"HR Support.\" But since it's an IT issue, the main concern here is technical. The message specifically mentions an error when accessing the tool, indicating a significant access issue. Thus, \"Access\" makes the most sense as the category. I should respond with a JSON object indicating the category as \"Access\": {\"category\":\"Access\"}. A brief note might also be helpful to clarify the issue!**Providing JSON response**\n\nI think the instruction here is pretty clear: I should provide just the JSON without any extra text. The \"category\" field needs to be set to one of the specified values. So, I\u2019ll respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nIt\u2019s best to keep it simple, focusing purely on delivering the JSON response, as the app likely only needs that."
