Analyzing the ticket's content, it involves \"Oracle Absence Management,\" approvers, timecards, and absence types, focusing on approval workflows and changes in approver order. It seems to align more with HR Support and possibly Access given the context of system management and user requests. So, I'll likely categorize it under HR Support.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT ticket since it focuses on absence management and approving leaves. It could also be about changing approver permissions, which might fit \"Administrative rights,\" but that seems less relevant. The mention of \"primary approver secondary approver compliance\" leads me to think it leans more towards HR support. Since it's not an \"Internal Project,\" I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll produce the required JSON output for this category.**Finalizing category output**\n\nI see that the category should exactly match the format, so it must be \"HR Support\" with the space. I\u2019m considering \"Administrative rights,\" but since the ticket\u2019s focus is on the configurational aspect of Oracle Absence Management for primary and secondary approvers, \"HR Support\" fits better given it's about the HR system. I\u2019ll just provide the category object as instructed, so I\u2019ll output:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
