The user talks about a \"new purchase\" and mentions items like a mouse and keyboard, as well as logging allocations and receipts. This suggests it's related to procurement, specifically hardware. So, I think the best categories for this request would be either \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" Since it's primarily about the items being requested, \"Purchase\" seems most appropriate.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe task here is to categorize an IT ticket based on the user's message, which mentions purchase orders and receipts. I\u2019ll classify this as \"Purchase\" since it's primarily about a new purchase order and procurement. While \"Hardware\" could also apply due to the mention of a mouse and keyboard, the core focus is on purchasing. The system indicates I should respond in a specific format. So, I'll return: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. No extra explanations are needed; just following the format!**Confirming JSON Format**\n\nI need to make sure that the category value is using the exact capitalization as specified, which is \"Purchase\" with a capital P. So, I'll respond using a JSON-like format. The category property must definitely be included. I'll write it as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Keeping it straightforward here, no extra content is necessary, just the category in the requested format."
