The user\u2019s request seems a bit jumbled, but I interpret it as regarding a new starter for Friday afternoon, maybe related to onboarding. It sounds like I should consider \"Access\" for permissions or \"HR Support\" since this is about a new employee. However, the taxonomy seems more IT-focused than HR-oriented, which confuses things.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI think the best category for this ticket would be \"Access\" or possibly \"Administrative rights\" since it's related to granting permissions. It might also be \"HR Support\" because it's about onboarding. The ticket mentions \"new starter,\" indicating that it involves setup for a new employee, and IT typically handles \"Access\" provisioning. The phrase \"more starter form him\" seems unclear, and I might need to ask for clarification. Given the context, I'll categorize this IT ticket as \"Access\" since it\u2019s about providing system access for a new starter.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe instruction says I need to produce a JSON object that specifies a category as \"type\": \"object\" with properties defined for \"category\" as a string. So I\u2019m going to respond with {\"category\":\"Access\"} since that fits what I determined is the most suitable category. \n\nI could add a note or brief rationale for why I chose \"Access,\" even though it\u2019s not required. But for clarity, I\u2019ll stick closely to the specified format to avoid any errors. So my final response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
