The categories provided include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Access.\" Since it seems to focus on disabling access for a departing employee, the best matches appear to be either \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\" However, \"Access\" seems the most fitting because it directly relates to disabling access and handling leaver documentation.**Categorizing IT Offboarding Ticket**\n\nThe content appears to be about an employee offboarding process, mentioning disabling access and sending a leaver document. Given the focus on access, the best category seems to be \"Access.\" While \u201cHR Support\u201d could apply since it\u2019s an HR-related process, this is primarily an IT ticket. There\u2019s also \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d but since it generally discusses \"disabled access,\" I\u2019m set on categorizing it as \"Access.\" Now, I need to format this as a JSON-like object with the \"category\" property.**Formatting the Response**\n\nI'm trying to figure out how to format my response. The required format is a JSON object with the \"category\" field defined within it, mentioning specifically that \u201cAccess\u201d is the correct label. In previous tasks, I\u2019ve returned just the category label, but now it seems I need the schema structure as well. I\u2019ll ensure to give a clean response with no extra text. \n\nSo, I\u2019m finalizing it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
