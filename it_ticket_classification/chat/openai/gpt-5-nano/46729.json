It mentions \"Oracle Fusion issues\" and difficulties with task selection for specific days, hinting at a potential bug in the system.\n\nSince it relates to an ERP system and task management issues, I\u2019d categorize it as a Miscellaneous ticket. The submitter might be a senior tester from Colombia, which adds to the context but isn't crucial for categorization. I\u2019ll proceed with this classification!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize an IT ticket. The issue seems to be related to an application problem in Oracle Fusion, which isn\u2019t hardware or storage-related. The closest categories appear to be \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or possibly \"Access\" since it relates to field selection. \n\nI\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" because it deals with selecting fields, though it might touch on \"Administrative rights\" depending on the permissions context. I\u2019ll finalize the JSON output with the selected category soon!**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about the best category for this IT ticket. \"Administrative rights\" is mostly for modifying user permissions, so it doesn\u2019t apply here. \"Internal Project\" seems fitting since it relates to issues within an internal system like Oracle Fusion. The other option is \"Miscellaneous,\" but since this is a bug with Oracle Fusion, I believe \"Internal Project\" is the best choice.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with the category formatted correctly in JSON as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
