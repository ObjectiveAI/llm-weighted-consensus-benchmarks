The possible categories could include \"Access\" if it involves granting permissions, \"Administrative rights\" if they're changing approval authority, or maybe \"Internal Project\" due to the nature of submissions. Given the phrasing, I think \"Administrative rights\" seems like the best fit.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI need to determine the best category for the ticket based on the repeated mention of \"approval.\" It doesn't fit into categories like hardware or storage, but it might relate to access control. The phrases suggest it involves either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, \"Administrative rights\" feels more specific since it could imply a request for elevated permissions to approve submissions in Oracle. Given that context, I think \"Administrative rights\" is the better choice for this categorization.**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nIn IT ticket classifications, \"Access\" generally involves requests for permissions, while \"Administrative rights\" seems to be a specific subset requiring elevated permissions. The ticket mentions the need to approve submissions, indicating that the user is likely seeking \"approval rights.\" While \"Oracle approval\" seems related, it doesn't imply giving full admin rights. Since this request is specifically about approval capabilities, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
