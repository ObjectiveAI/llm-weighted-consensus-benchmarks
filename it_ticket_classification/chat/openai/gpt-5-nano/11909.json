The ticket text mentions changing owners, approvals, and adding members, which makes it quite garbled. It seems to relate to access rights or ownership management. \n\nGiven the context, it could fit into \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project.\" This is challenging, but I'll focus on categorizing it clearly.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket, which involves requests about changing owners and adding testers. The terms \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" are relevant here since they both deal with ownership and access control. While \"Access\" is about permissions, \"Administrative rights\" specifically addresses admin privileges. Since the ticket text mentions switching ownership and adding members directly, I should categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" for better accuracy. I'll format the response accordingly in JSON!**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket and provided a specific JSON schema format. It requires a simple JSON object with the key \"category\" and the value \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nI confirm I should only return this JSON object without any additional text or wrapper objects. So, I\u2019ll focus on presenting it clearly like this: {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}. This aligns with the user\u2019s instructions perfectly!{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
