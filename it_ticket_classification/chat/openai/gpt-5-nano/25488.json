The ticket discusses a new starter named Martinez at Bogota, and it mentions a \"starter form complete,\" along with phrases like \"joining\" and \"administration officer.\" This indicates it's likely related to HR onboarding, making \"HR Support\" a fitting category. I also see some possibilities for \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" but those aren\u2019t explicitly mentioned. I'll lean toward \"HR Support\" for clarity!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm looking at the ticket details, and phrases like \"starter form complete,\" \"administration officer,\" and \"joining\" suggest it's related to HR processes. It seems like a good fit for the \"HR Support\" category since it involves onboarding. There's also \"Administrative rights,\" which could relate to access provisioning, but that's not explicitly mentioned. Since the main focus appears to be on completing forms and onboarding, I'm settling on \"HR Support\" as the most accurate category. I\u2019ll format my response as needed!**Formatting ticket category**\n\nI need to format my response as a JSON object specifying the category for this IT ticket. The instruction is clear: \u201cCategorize this IT Ticket.\" Based on the content, \"HR Support\" seems to be the right choice since the ticket discusses the completion of a starter form related to HR onboarding. The mention of \"administration officer\" doesn\u2019t strongly indicate \"Administrative rights.\" Thus, I\u2019ll construct my final response like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Simple and straightforward!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
