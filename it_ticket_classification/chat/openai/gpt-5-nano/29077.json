The user seems to ask for access to a new dedicated folder on Friday PM, mentioning terms like \"dedicated folder\" and \"reports.\" It feels a bit messy, but the main request is clearly about access permissions. So, I think the most appropriate category would be \"Access,\" but I could also consider \"Administrative rights\" if it relates to admin-level permissions.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user is asking for access to a new dedicated folder, which definitely falls under the \"Access\" category. I also think it could be tagged for \"Administrative rights\" if it includes permissions for folder creation. The text includes requests for accessing various folders, such as \"reports\" and \"layouts.\" It\u2019s clear that the primary need is for access rights, so I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object as required.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
