The mention of \"leave starting date\" and \"absence\" makes it seem more HR-related. So, I'll categorize this ticket under \"HR Support.\"**Determining IT Category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket, and it looks like the \"HR Support\" category seems the most appropriate for this. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" don't really fit here, and while \"Access\" could be an option, there's no explicit mention of access issues. The repeated phrase \"submit incomplete\" likely refers to an incomplete timesheet. Given the mentions of \"leave starting date,\" it confirms this is HR-related. So, I\u2019ll place this ticket under \"HR Support.\"{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
