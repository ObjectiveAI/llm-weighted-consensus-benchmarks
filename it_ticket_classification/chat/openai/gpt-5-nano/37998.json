I think \"Internal Project\" could be applicable if this is a specific project related to the \"zone awards.\" However, \"Access\" doesn't seem to fit, as there's no mention of login credentials. Other categories like \"Purchase,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Hardware\" don\u2019t match either.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI need to choose between categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Administrative rights\" could imply the user needs permissions to approve nominations, but the text isn't explicitly saying that. It feels like it's more about a workflow task, which could point to \"Internal Project,\" especially with phrases like \"nomination waiting for your review\" and \"zone awards.\" Since the user is asking for a proper category, I think \"Internal Project\" fits best due to its focus on internal workflows.**Responding with JSON category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it relates to a work process. The task requires a specific JSON format, so I\u2019ll create a category object following that schema. It looks like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI need to ensure that the capitalization matches exactly as required. Since the instructions are to simply categorize the IT ticket, I\u2019ll present just the JSON object without extra explanations. Alright, let\u2019s move forward with that!"
