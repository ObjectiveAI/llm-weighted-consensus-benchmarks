It could also fit under \"Access\" since it's about providing access to a new role, but it feels more HR-focused. So, I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support.\" For the response format, it needs to be a JSON object with a \"category\" property. The correct output will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll make sure not to include any extra commentary and stick to the required format."
