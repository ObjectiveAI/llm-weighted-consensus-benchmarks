The categories available are Hardware, Internal Project, Administrative Rights, Access, Purchase, Storage, Miscellaneous, and HR Support. The content has keywords like \"router\" indicating it leans towards Hardware. However, terms like \"decommission plan\" suggest it could be an Internal Project too. \"Shipment\" makes me think of Purchase. Ultimately, I need to pick the best single category.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm thinking that the IT ticket should be categorized as \"Hardware\" since it mentions routers, decommissioning, and shipment, which all relate to hardware. However, the phrase \"project friday\" suggests it could also be part of an \"Internal Project.\" Despite that, in typical categorization, IT tickets involving hardware usually fall under \"Hardware.\" There's a mention of a \"decommission plan,\" but it doesn't fit \"Administrative rights.\" So, I\u2019ll go ahead and choose \"Hardware\" and prepare a JSON output for it.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
