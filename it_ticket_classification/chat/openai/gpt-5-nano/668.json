It mentions renaming related to mobile, application management, and databases. There are several available categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The content suggests it may relate to an internal project or administrative rights, but it's not explicitly clear. I\u2019ll consider categorizing this ticket as either Internal Project or Miscellaneous.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nIt seems this ticket relates to application management and database. I\u2019m considering \u201cInternal Project\u201d because it\u2019s a task regarding the renaming of mobile to something like application management and database. There\u2019s also a mention of \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d but this seems less relevant since it\u2019s about renaming rather than permissions. I think \u201cInternal Project\u201d is the best fit here, although \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is also an option since it's a bit unclear. I\u2019ll respond with the chosen category in a JSON format.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
