The ticket mentions completing an attached starter form, which likely aligns with HR-related activities.\n\nI'll choose \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category for this ticket since it involves onboarding procedures. So, I'll format my output as a JSON object specifying the category. Let's get that done!**Determining ticket category**\n\nIn this IT context, the ticket could fit under \"Access,\" as it deals with a new starter and form completion, possibly for access provisioning. It may also relate to \"HR Support\" since it involves an onboarding process. The mention of \"induction\" and \"starter form\" suggests it\u2019s about getting someone set up. However, I think \"Access\" is the best fit here, focusing on granting access related to the new starter.**Choosing the right category**\n\nThe content of the ticket mentions \"starter form\" and \"assist completion,\" which leans towards \"HR Support,\" but in IT ticket classification, typical categories include \"Access\" for account setups and onboarding. Given this context, I'll classify it as \"Access,\" focusing on the implications for access provisioning. \n\nI need to output this in the correct format, which should be a JSON object. So I\u2019ll structure it accordingly: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Finalizing the IT ticket response**\n\nThe \"Valid channels\" dictate that I need to respond properly. The schema tells me I should return a JSON object but more specifically, I believe I should simply provide a value for the category. The instruction is to categorize the IT ticket, and given the content, \"Access\" seems to be the right choice.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll produce the response as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThough \"HR Support\" could also be a contender, the emphasis on a starter form suggests access provisioning is the more appropriate classification.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThis situation involves onboarding, and while \"HR Support\" focuses on HR processes, it fits well within the IT ticket context. The user's request revolves around assisting with form completion, suggesting a need for HR support. The categories given clarify that \"Access\" pertains to system access, whereas \"HR Support\" is more relevant for onboarding tasks.\n\nIn light of the references to a \"new starter\" and assistance with forms, I'll categorize this ticket as \"HR Support\". My final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
