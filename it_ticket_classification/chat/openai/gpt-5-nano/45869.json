The categories to choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nFrom the text, terms like \"extra screens\" and \"running battery\" point towards hardware issues. The mention of \"desks\" might suggest arrangement or setup. Overall, I think it's reasonable to categorize this ticket as \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll prepare the JSON output accordingly.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI have some other categories to consider like Storage, Purchase, Administrative rights, Access, Internal Project, and Miscellaneous. Since the text clearly isn't about those, it could possibly fall under Miscellaneous. But the \"extra screens\" mention really suggests that it fits best under Hardware. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with the proper JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll keep it concise, delivering just the JSON object without extra questions since the user was clear in their request."
