It's important to accurately classify it so the right team can address the issue efficiently. Let\u2019s dig into the ticket\u2019s details to make the best decision!**Analyzing access request**\n\nThe content I'm looking at appears to be a request for access to restricted document libraries on the \"eel site.\" The request comes from someone wanting to add a site and granted write access to restricted areas. There are mentions of \"unique permissions\" and a need for an \"exact link.\" It looks like this involves both a tester and an analyst, and the request also includes a note about the synchronization process. I need to categorize this request accurately based on its content and implications.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThis ticket seems related to \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I'm trying to figure out which category fits better. It discusses access to restricted document libraries and unique permissions, which suggests \"Access\" is appropriate. However, there are elements of \"Administrative rights\" since it touches on permissions and write access to restricted areas. The mention of \"granted write restricted areas\" strongly suggests it's focused on access management, rather than full administrative privileges. I'll lean toward classifying it under \"Access.\"**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe request involves providing an exact link for libraries and informing about unique permissions, which clearly relates to access permissions. I believe \"Access\" is the right category instead of \"Administrative rights.\" Other categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"HR\" don't apply. Based on the provided instructions, I need to format my response as a JSON object with just the \"category\" field. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll stick to the exact string to match the required format!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
