This suggests that the most appropriate category is \"Hardware.\" Since I'm required to return a JSON response, it needs to look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, making sure to follow the proper schema without any extra text or incorrect casing. Let's keep it neat and straightforward!**Outputting the category format**\n\nI need to ensure the output is in the correct JSON format since the instruction specifies that the category must be an object. So, I\u2019m confirming that I\u2019ll output it like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This aligns with the requirements, and I'll make sure to follow the specifications precisely. Let\u2019s proceed with this structured format to keep everything nice and organized! That's the plan!"
