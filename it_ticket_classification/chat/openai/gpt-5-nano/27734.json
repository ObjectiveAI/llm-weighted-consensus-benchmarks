Since the prompt is asking to categorize the IT ticket, I should respond with just the category. \n\nFollowing the instruction, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object that includes the category string. Here\u2019s what it looks like:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}  \n\nNow, let's deliver that succinctly!"
