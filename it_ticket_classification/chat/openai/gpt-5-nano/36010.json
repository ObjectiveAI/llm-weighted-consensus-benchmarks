Since this is related to procuring new hardware, the most fitting category would be \"Purchase.\" I'll provide a JSON with the category field set to \"Purchase.\"**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI need to format the output as a JSON object with the correct schema. The required structure is `{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}`. \n\nFor this particular ticket, the category should be \"Purchase.\" So the output should match that schema. \n\nHowever, I really should focus on providing just the category field in the expected format, which is `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. Let's go with that!"
