The text seems a bit jumbled, mentioning \"poll change\" and \"high watermark voltage output.\" It suggests they might want to log a poll change, but it's unclear.\n\nConsidering the available categories, the terms lead me to think it\u2019s related to \"Hardware\" or possibly \"Storage.\" The references to voltage suggest that \"Hardware\" is likely the best fit.**Interpreting IT ticket details**\n\nThe mention of \"high watermark\" often relates to storage or virtualization and, based on that context, seems linked to a hardware issue. Phrases like \"poll change\" indicate it might refer to system metrics or CPU scheduling.\n\nGiven the request to categorize the IT ticket, I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" since \"voltage output\" aligns with it. Yet, there\u2019s also a chance it could be about scheduling changes, making it a bit tricky. I'll categorize it as \"Hardware\" for now.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nIn classifying the IT ticket, the categories to consider include Hardware, Storage, Access, and others. Given the references to \"voltage output\" and \"high watermark,\" the safe choice here is \"Hardware,\" especially with the mention of an engineer.\n\nI need to format my response as a JSON object, ensuring it meets the specified schema. The final response will be straightforward: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra commentary."
