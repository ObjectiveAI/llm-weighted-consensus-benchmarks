The ticket text is a bit messy but includes terms like \"expedite planning kickoff,\" \"attached form,\" and \"resolution target date.\" So, it seems to relate to \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or possibly \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since there's a focus on access to systems and setting up tools, I think \"Access\" might fit best. Let's narrow it down!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"expedited planning kickoff\" and \"drop leave comment,\" which isn't very helpful. It could be about requesting administrative rights for Confluence, but it seems focused on project setup, especially concerning Oracle and Confluence. This makes \"Internal Project\" the most fitting category since it relates to setting up a project. If it can't be categorized, \"Miscellaneous\" could work, but I believe \"Internal Project\" fits best. I'll go with that and provide a concise answer.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
