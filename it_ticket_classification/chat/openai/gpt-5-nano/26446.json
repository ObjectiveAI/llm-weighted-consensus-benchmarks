It mentions issues like \"access to Friday November re wireless passwords change\" and problems with guest devices. I\u2019m considering the available categories: Access, Administrative rights, and more. Since this is primarily about access control to the wireless network, \u201cAccess\u201d seems the most fitting. However, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could also apply if the ticket involves granting rights.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket is asking me to investigate and provide passwords for guests, mentioning things like \"guests\" and \"document containing passwords.\" Since this involves sensitive information, classification is crucial for ticket routing. I think labeling it as \"Access\" makes sense due to the focus on network access and password changes. I need to output a JSON object in the format specified: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s vital to get this right! A brief note could help, but the main focus is on the JSON format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
