The provided ticket text is quite garbled, mentioning several phrases like \"oracle project setup,\" \"setup has assigned,\" and \"reference number.\" It alludes to actions that need to be taken on setup forms and attachments. Given the context, it could be related to \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" or potentially \"Administrative rights.\" I need to choose the most applicable category based on the overall focus.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve noticed mentions of \"setup,\" \"project setup,\" and \"oracle project setup.\" This leads me to think it aligns best with the \"Internal Project\" category, since there's no reference to hardware or storage. While the ticket hints at accessing rights and making assignments, the focus is primarily on setting up and requesting actions. Therefore, categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" is the most appropriate choice. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object reflecting this category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
