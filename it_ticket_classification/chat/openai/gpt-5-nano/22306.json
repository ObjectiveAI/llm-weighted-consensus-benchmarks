I\u2019m considering options like \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" since it sounds like a request to generate a report. Other categories include \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" and so on, but I should focus on what fits best based on the context.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think this Oracle support ticket is focused on generating a utilization report. I'm weighing options like \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Access.\" Given the context, \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems most appropriate since it relates to project usage. The mention of \"pm\" might refer to \"project management,\" and the request about the split consolidated report is about usage per member. Though it sounds a bit jumbled, it doesn't seem to be related to access rights, even if they say \"please assign.\"**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nIn categorizing IT tickets, I need to match each request to the most appropriate category, like Hardware for physical devices or HR Support for HR-related issues. This ticket is about running a report in Oracle, which makes \"Internal Project\" a likely fit since it seems related to project utilization. However, it could also fall under \"Miscellaneous\" as it's a general report request. If they're asking to \"assign\" something, then \"Administrative rights\" could apply too, as it might involve granting access.**Categorizing the ticket request**\n\nThe request says, \"hello please assign please utilization report run st july split consolidated report how days each member submitted by thanks.\" It seems to be asking to assign someone to run the utilization report for July, focusing on each member's submissions. This isn't about access rights; it leans more toward generating a report. Given that, \"Internal Project\" fits well since it's related to an Oracle project. I should output the category in that JSON-like format as a string.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
