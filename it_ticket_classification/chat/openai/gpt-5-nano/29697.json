The relevant categories include \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" Since the request directly concerns hardware equipment, \"Hardware\" seems to be the best fit. Although \"Purchase\" could work since it involves procuring a monitor, \"Hardware\" aligns more closely with the specific nature of the request. Ultimately, I'll categorize this ticket under \"Hardware\" as it directly pertains to hardware equipment needed.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nI\u2019m tasked with categorizing an IT ticket, and I see the user is requesting a PC monitor. The options include \"Hardware\" for hardware requests and \"Purchase\" for procurement-related requests. The ticket states \"please provide pc monitor,\" indicating it leans towards hardware provisioning. Therefore, the most straightforward categorization is \"Hardware.\" \n\nI\u2019ll follow the format I've been instructed to use, and output the category as a JSON object: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. This matches the required schema accurately.**Outputting IT ticket category**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket and only respond with the category. Since the tool might expect the output to be in JSON format, I will provide it accordingly. \n\nTherefore, I'm going to output just the JSON object as required: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. This way, I follow the instructions precisely without including any extra text."
