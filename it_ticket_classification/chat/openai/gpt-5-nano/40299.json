The user also emphasizes the importance as \"high.\" Given the context, this is likely an IT-related problem. I think the best fitting category from the options provided is \"Internal Project\" since it relates to internal IT issues.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nThis ticket seems to be about a computer not loading and documents failing to open. I have to decide on an appropriate category, but there's no specific \"Software\" option available. The issue might involve hardware or possibly be a general IT problem, which could fit under \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the user likely needs assistance accessing documents, the \"Access\" category might also apply if it involves permission problems. Ultimately, I should go with the most fitting option based on the computer issue described.**Determining the best category**\n\nIf I need to choose one category, \"Hardware\" seems a solid option because of the \"computer not loading\" issue, but there's also a chance it could be software-related. The category \"Internal Project\" doesn\u2019t quite fit, and while \"Miscellaneous\" could cover it, that's somewhat vague. Since the user is asking for a specific category in a JSON format, I should lean toward \"Hardware,\" given that the core problem seems to stem from the computer itself. So, I think the output should be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
