The ticket talks about problems with a card reader, related to access issues where it indicates that a light goes red. It suggests a failure in access control. I\u2019m considering the categories available, and \"Access\" seems to fit best since the problem relates to access control. Although it\u2019s also a hardware issue, I\u2019ll classify this ticket under \"Access\" based on the context.**Formatting output**\n\nI need to provide the output in the correct \"category\" JSON object format according to the schema. The system message specifies the JSON Schema for \"category,\" which includes the \"category\" field with enumerated options. Therefore, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to make sure to keep it concise and avoid any unnecessary details. So, I\u2019ll simply provide the JSON output without additional explanations."
