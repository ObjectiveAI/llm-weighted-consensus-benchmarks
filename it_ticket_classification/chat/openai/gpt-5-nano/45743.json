The user describes an urgent issue with a license that expired for a central application and wants to know how to renew it. They're also worried about potential attacks. This seems to be tied to software license management. I wonder if it fits best under \"Purchase,\" since it's about renewing the license, but \"Access\" could be relevant too.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m trying to decide how to categorize the IT ticket. It might be \"Purchase,\" since it\u2019s about a license that needs renewal, but there\u2019s also a request regarding how to renew it, which relates to license management. There's a chance it could be \"Access\" too, as the license is for a central application. Given the context of urgency and security concerns, I feel \"Purchase\" is the best category, so I\u2019ll go with that and prepare a JSON object to reflect it."
