The categories I have to choose from include various topics. It seems like \"Administrative rights\" fits best since installing software usually requires admin permissions. \"Access\" could also work since they reference rights related to permissions. I\u2019ll keep those insights in mind while preparing the output.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nThe user mentions \"rights,\" which could relate to access rights, but \"Administrative rights\" is a more specific category focused on admin privileges. Therefore, I'll categorize this as \"Administrative rights.\" I need to format my response as a JSON object according to the required category schema. So, it will look like this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I\u2019ll stick to the prompt which asks for just the category without any extra comments. Let's move forward!"
