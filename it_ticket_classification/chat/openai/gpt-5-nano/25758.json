The string contains phrases like \"leaver interns,\" \"bulk hardware allocation,\" and \"leaver form,\" which point towards a specific context. I\u2019ll use the categories in the schema to determine where this ticket best fits. It seems to relate most closely to \"Hardware\" since it discusses hardware allocation for interns. I'll prepare the output in JSON format with the relevant category field.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket seems to involve leavers and bulk hardware allocation. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" While it mentions leaver interns and forms, which hints at HR, the primary focus appears to be on hardware allocation. Typically, it falls under \"Hardware\" since it's about provisioning. The reference to a leaver form indicates it could touch on HR processes, but the main action here revolves around hardware. So, Hardware feels like the right fit!**Clarifying Ticket Content**\n\nOkay, \"leaver interns bulk hardware allocation\" could mean that bulk hardware is being allocated to leaver interns, rather than just allocation of hardware for leavers. It seems to focus on tasks like collecting leaver forms and logging tickets for offboarding interns. Among the categories, I think \"Hardware\" makes the most sense since it centrally involves hardware allocation. While HR Support and Administrative rights are relevant, the primary action here is hardware provision for leaver interns, so I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\"{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
