I think \"Access\" fits best since it's about password prompts. Although \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights\" could apply, \"Access\" is the most appropriate choice for this internal IT helpdesk situation.**Categorizing an Outlook issue**\n\nI received a ticket describing a problem with Outlook that mentions it slows down and prompts for a password repeatedly. This sort of issue relates to authentication, making \"Access\" a suitable category since it's for login and password problems. I also see that the response requires a JSON object to categorize this issue correctly. So, I'll format my response as a JSON object with the category set to \"Access\" to meet the system's requirements.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
