The user mentions \"automatically assign tickets,\" which seems to focus on queue management and scheduling for December. Their request likely relates to administrative rights concerning ticket assignments. It doesn\u2019t fit in categories like Hardware, Storage, or Purchase. It could also fall under Miscellaneous, but I'll lean towards Administrative rights or Access since it deals with automation and ticket management.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI think the ticket likely relates to Administrative rights since it concerns adjusting who tickets are auto-assigned to. Phrases like \"assigned queue\" and \"change assigned queue\" suggest it's about workflow configuration as well. However, it might fit under Miscellaneous if it doesn't align perfectly. I need to choose one category and respond in a structured JSON format. It makes the most sense to categorize it as Administrative rights since it's about the rights to assign tickets.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
