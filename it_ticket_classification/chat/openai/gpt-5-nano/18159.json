It looks like there's a request to text today regarding lists for distributing notices to groups. There\u2019s mention of upcoming improvements and tools for Teams or groups, and further updates on a product feature. Plus, I see a note to review the usage policy linked, and a planned holiday with a return on Tuesday. So, this seems like an IT-related communication.**Determining category classification**\n\nI'm considering the right category for a set of information regarding notices, policies, and guidelines. It's not HR-related or about access. \"Administrative rights\" seems like a stretch, but I think \"Internal Project\" fits since it involves technical programs and upcoming improvements. Still, it could be considered ambiguous and \"Miscellaneous\" might work if nothing else fits. Ultimately, I lean towards \"Internal Project\" because it relates to internal IT communications. I need to respond with the correct JSON format for this classification.**Interpreting the user's request**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I\u2019m realizing that I should likely provide just the category string. However, the instruction specifies a JSON schema for the category. I think I\u2019ll respond with the appropriate JSON object rather than just the string, so I\u2019ll use {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019m checking to confirm that \"Internal Project\" is indeed in the allowed categories. Alright, it looks good! I\u2019ll produce that output without extra explanation."
