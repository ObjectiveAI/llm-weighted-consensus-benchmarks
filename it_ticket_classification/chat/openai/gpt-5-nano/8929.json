The ticket is about timecards, including submissions, amendments, approvals, and annual leave. While options like Administrative rights and Access aren\u2019t relevant, the ticket fits best under HR Support because it deals with timekeeping processes and related inquiries. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object that specifies the category as HR Support.**Formatting the response**\n\nThe system needs a specific format for the response, which is a JSON object with a \"category\" field. I'll respond with {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} to categorize the ticket correctly. I should check the formatting to ensure that the value exactly says \"HR Support.\" Since the instructions emphasize categorization without extra notes, I'll focus on keeping it concise. The format should strictly be the JSON object without additional commentary. I'll make sure to follow that clearly."
