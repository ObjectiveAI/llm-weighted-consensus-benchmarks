The details suggest that users are having trouble connecting to guest machines due to network-related problems, possibly linked to IP address pool exhaustion or DHCP misconfiguration. Since this is primarily about user access to those machines, it seems appropriate to classify the ticket under the \"Access\" category. That should help route it to the right team for resolution!**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize an IT ticket. While \"Network\" isn't an option, and \"Hardware\" or \"Storage\" don't fit, the \"Access\" category clearly aligns with the issue of users not being able to connect to guest VMs due to potential DHCP pool issues. The system expects me to respond with a JSON object. So, I\u2019ll ensure I format it correctly: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. This maintains clarity while meeting the requirement!**Finalizing Output for IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m going to respond with just the necessary JSON for the IT ticket categorization. Since the user simply asked, \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" I\u2019ll keep my response concise: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I\u2019ll avoid any extra text or spaces to ensure clarity. While I\u2019m noting that the \"guest issues\" relate to guest machines and potential misconfigurations in DHCP, my instruction is purely to categorize. So I\u2019ll stick to the prompt and deliver that clean output!"
