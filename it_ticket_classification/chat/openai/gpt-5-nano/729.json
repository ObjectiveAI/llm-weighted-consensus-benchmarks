The user asks for help with adding someone to billing, which seems to indicate they want administrative access. The allowed categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the request about billing, it fits best under \"Access.\" So, I\u2019ll format the response in JSON to reflect this category.**Categorizing Access Management Ticket**\n\nI'm trying to determine the right category for this IT ticket, which is likely related to access management. The user's request seems to mention adding someone to a billing system, suggesting it falls under \"Access.\" It could also fit \"Administrative rights,\" but that's more about granting specific admin privileges. Since \"Billing\" isn't a category itself, \"Access\" makes the most sense for adding a user. So, I\u2019ll label the ticket as \"Access\" in the JSON output.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to produce a JSON-like object for the category according to the specified schema. The requested format is {\"category\": \"Access\"}, and ensuring I adhere to the required format is crucial. Since the user simply asked for categorization, I want to keep it straightforward. Providing any extra text isn't necessary, so I'll just focus on delivering the clean JSON snippet. In the end, it will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
