The key details include \"people operations dashboard\" and \"oracle dashboard.\" The categories suggest that \"HR Support\" is definitely relevant because it relates to people operations. \"Internal Project\" could also fit if it's about building the dashboard. \"Access\" might be necessary if they're looking to get into the Oracle dashboard. It seems \"HR Support\" is the most suitable option here.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for the IT ticket related to a people operations attrition dashboard. \"HR Support\" clearly fits, given the context. However, \"Internal Project\" could be relevant if they're constructing a new dashboard. The user's request suggests there are attachments and various discussions, but they asked for a specific categorization. Since the output needs to be in a JSON-like format, I will go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nIt seems like the most appropriate fit here.**Finalizing category response**\n\nThe user just needs a category for their request. I'll keep it simple and provide the answer in the required format. So, the output will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nThat seems straightforward enough! I won't add any extra commentary unless the user specifically asks for it. This keeps things tidy and clear."
