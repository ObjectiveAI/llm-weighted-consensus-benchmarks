I'd go with `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}` since the user is asking to categorize an IT ticket related to a mouse.\n\nI wonder if it could also be considered a \"Purchase\" if they're looking for a temporary mouse. But the mention of \"temporary\" seems more about replacement hardware, making \"Hardware\" the best choice. It\u2019s tricky, but I\u2019m sticking with \"Hardware.\"**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions a \"temporary mouse,\" which could fall into either the \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase\" category. I think the word \"temporary\" suggests it's likely a replacement to borrow for some time, but it\u2019s not explicitly clear. To be on the safe side, I\u2019m going to classify it as \"Hardware.\" So, my response will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nAlright, let\u2019s move forward from here!"
