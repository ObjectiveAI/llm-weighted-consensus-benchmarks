Since \"Administrative rights\" are a specific subset of Access, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Administrative rights.\" My response needs to be a clean JSON object with the proper format. So I'll say:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} \n\nI want to make sure there\u2019s no extra text\u2014just the necessary response!**Delivering Categorization**\n\nThe user's request indicates I need to provide \"Administrative rights\" as a relevant category. So, I'll go ahead and confirm that this enum is allowed. It sounds clear enough, and I want to make sure I keep things concise and straightforward. There's no need for extra commentary here; I just need to deliver the specified category cleanly. It feels good to finalize this! I'll ensure everything's put together neatly."
