The ticket content is quite messy, mentioning \"phone choice\" and \"mobile phone.\" It seems like the user is asking about selecting a phone model, indicating it could fit into either \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" I'll need to decide on one clear category to classify this ticket appropriately.**Categorizing IT ticket request**\n\nThe ticket states, \"phone choice Tuesday July pm phone choice hi let choice mobile phone please thanks.\" I need to classify it, considering options like \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Hardware.\" Since it relates to a phone device, \"Hardware\" seems most fitting. However, if the user is asking about purchasing, \"Purchase\" could apply too. But given the context, it feels more like a request for guidance on selecting a model. I think I should categorize it as \"Hardware\" and respond with a JSON object to confirm.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
