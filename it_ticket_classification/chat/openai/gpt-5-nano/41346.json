Given the key phrases like \u201ccannot approve,\u201d and \u201cinformation disappeared after she submitted,\u201d I\u2019m leaning toward the \"Access\" category since it's about lost profile info and approval problems. It could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Storage,\" but it really centers on IT tool issues and submissions.**Classifying IT ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m trying to determine which category fits an IT ticket that seems to revolve around a career review tool. It could go under \"HR Support,\" given its focus on career reviews, but since this is an IT ticket, we need to fit it into our specific categories. I see \u201cAccess\u201d as a good candidate due to mentions of lost profile info and approval issues. It might also relate to \"Storage\" if data loss is involved, but \"Access\" fits more with the context of using the tool.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
