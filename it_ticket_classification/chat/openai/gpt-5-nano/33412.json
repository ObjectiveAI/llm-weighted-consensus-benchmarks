The key phrases include \"leave prenatal,\" which makes me think it\u2019s related to HR, possibly a request for prenatal leave. However, considering the context of IT support, I see \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" might also apply. But since there's an explicit \"HR Support\" category, that likely fits the best for this ticket.**Categorizing IT ticket content**\n\nThe user wants to categorize an IT ticket rather than process it. If the ticket is about requesting prenatal leave, that's HR-related, not IT. However, there\u2019s an HR Support category included in the IT ticketing system, so that fits. The mention of \"automate drive develop together\" might refer to something about automation, possibly involving a cloud drive. Given the context, I believe the appropriate category is HR Support. I'll provide JSON according to the category schema.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that contains a category field. The instructions state to use a single key called \"category\" with a value that denotes the category string. According to this, the output format should be structured as a category object. \n\nSo, I'll create the response as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I want to ensure the formatting is accurate, with no extra text included. Let's get that done!"
