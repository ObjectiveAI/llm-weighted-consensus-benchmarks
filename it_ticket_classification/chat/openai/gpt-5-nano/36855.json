It seems they\u2019re experiencing issues related to storage space on their drive and are asking for assistance. \n\nI need to categorize this request within a predefined list. Based on the context, it looks like it fits best under the \"Storage\" category since they\u2019re focused on freeing up space for the upgrade process. That makes sense, right?**Selecting ticket category**\n\nI need to choose the right category for an IT ticket related to a Windows upgrade process and freeing up space. The content mentions moving personal data to a separate drive and using a tool to find large files. It seems like it fits best under the \"Storage\" category since it's about clearing space for the upgrade. While \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d was a consideration, it\u2019s mainly focused on storage cleanup for the upgrade. So, I'll summarize this as a JSON object with \"Storage\" as the category.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
