However, it may also relate to \"HR Support\" because it touches on human resources. I\u2019ll consider both categories, but leaning towards \"Access\" makes sense given the context of the access cards being returned once employees leave.**Identifying ticket category**\n\nThe term \"leaver\" refers to someone leaving, and \"returned access cards\" likely indicates that IT needs to deactivate or update access. The mention of \"Friday PM\" gives the time, while \"leaver si\" might imply \"leaver signature,\" although I\u2019m not quite sure. It seems like a request to update access since it's an IT ticket, and \"Access\" fits best. Therefore, I'll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
