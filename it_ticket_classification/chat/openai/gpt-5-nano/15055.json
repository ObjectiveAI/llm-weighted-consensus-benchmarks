The keywords are \"installation tickets,\" \"purchase order number,\" and \"administrator,\" which give me clues about its context. It feels like it could fit into either the \"Purchase\" category or even \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Given the focus on installations and purchases, I'd lean towards the \"Purchase\" category for this ticket.**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt looks like I\u2019m dealing with a ticket about installation, but there isn\u2019t an explicit \"Installation\" category. The \"Purchase\" category feels relevant because of the mention of \"purchase order number\" and \"purchased.\" I\u2019m considering whether to choose \"Purchase\" or \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The phrase \"correspondent purchase order number\" suggests that they want to perform a task related to that purchase order. Given this context, I think \"Purchase\" is the best fit for this ticket.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
