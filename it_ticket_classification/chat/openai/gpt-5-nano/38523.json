They mentioned things like \"not showing up,\" and \"senior engineer upcoming days off\" but the text is pretty messy. It seems like it could relate to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since there's a hint about permissions. However, it might also fit into \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" depending on further context. I'll figure it out!**Parsing user message**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the messy sentence: \"not showing up showing up hi was trying assign en but list thanks senior engineer upcoming days off phone number please consider environment you really need print.\" \n\nIf I add some punctuation, it becomes clearer: \"not showing up. showing up. hi was trying...\". It seems like they might mention \"assign EN,\" possibly relating to an environment. There\u2019s also a hint about availability with \"upcoming days off\" and something about printing in a certain environment. I\u2019ll continue breaking this down!**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI have a list of categories to choose from, like Hardware, HR Support, and Access. The user\u2019s message seems to hint at issues with access or permissions, especially with phrases like \"Administrative rights\" and \"not showing up.\" \n\nThey mention things like \"assign\" and \"upcoming days off,\" which could relate to accounts or access issues. I think the best fit is \"Access,\" so I\u2019ll categorize it that way and format my output as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
