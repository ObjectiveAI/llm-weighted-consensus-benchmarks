This seems to fall under an IT project, likely categorized as \"Internal Project\" since it's about updates to the internal system. The user mentioned \"expense reimbursement deposited\" and wants to modify the wording accordingly. The suggestions could also include \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Internal Project\" fits best here. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and plan to respond with a JSON object for the category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
