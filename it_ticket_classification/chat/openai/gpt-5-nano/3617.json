The available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Since the message doesn't clearly fit into any specific category, I think the best option is to classify it under \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object accordingly: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Classifying IT ticket queries**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a text message that seems to relate to setting up a form. It frequently mentions \"setup form,\" which might indicate a software issue rather than hardware or access requests. There's a mention of \"officer,\" suggesting it could involve an internal project. Given the ambiguity, I lean towards categorizing this under \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Internal Project.\" It doesn't explicitly request access or mention user credentials, so that seems off the table. I\u2019ll decide on the category soon.**Evaluating IT ticket categories**\n\nThe message seems to request help with setting up a form and includes \"code attached.\u201d It likely fits under \"Internal Project\" since it's focused on a coding task, clearly not a hardware issue, HR, storage, purchase, or administrative rights. However, since it also repeatedly mentions \"setup form,\" it could be considered \"Miscellaneous\" for a general ticket. I\u2019ll aim to identify the best category by parsing the entire request and determining the most appropriate one.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
