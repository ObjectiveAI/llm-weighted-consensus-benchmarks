The ticket is about \"zone awards,\" UI text changes, and user flows. It doesn't fit into hardware, HR, or access categories. It seems it could be \"Internal Project\" since it relates to changes in the internal site for the \"zone awards.\" There's also a chance it touches on \"Administrative rights\" if admin access is needed for the changes.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe content of the ticket is about implementing changes to the zone awards submission flow, including modifying the text and graying out the submit button. This seems like a software development or internal project task. While \"Miscellaneous\" could work, \"Internal Project\" is more precise, so I'll categorize it accordingly. I need to respond with the specified JSON format, which would be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nNo extra clarification needed!"
