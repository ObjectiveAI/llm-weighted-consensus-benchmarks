The appropriate category seems to be \"HR Support\" given the context. Now I'll format this in JSON format to finalize the categorization.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe user has mentioned a high-priority request regarding changing an approver. I'm considering potential categories: \n\n- \"Access\" might apply if changing the approver requires access rights changes.\n- \"HR Support\" could be the main category since changing a manager in Oracle typically relates to HR processes. \n\nIt seems \"Administrative rights\" would only be relevant if it involved changing permissions. Since this looks mainly like an HR-related task, I'll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" I'll ensure to put the JSON together accordingly.**Analyzing approver change request**\n\nIt seems that \"currently her approver\" refers to an existing approver in a workflow, likely related to a manager's approval in the Oracle system. If the user's asking to include 'her' as the new manager, that might involve changing approvals, which could fall under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the request to change the manager's approval is marked as high priority, I still think the best fit for this category is \"HR Support,\" as it directly relates to HR processes.**Parsing change request grammar**\n\nLet's break down the user's request: it seems to be an email asking to change a manager in the Oracle system, mentioning high priority and a current approver. The wording \"include her\" suggests they want to add someone else as a manager. This seems to indicate an update in a workflow approval chain. \n\nFor categorization, it looks like \"Access\" is more relevant here, as it often involves changes to approvals and user permissions, while \"Administrative rights\" focuses on elevating permissions.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
