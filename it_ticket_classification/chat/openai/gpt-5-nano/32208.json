The available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the user's text refers to a workstation change, I think \u201cHardware\u201d is the best fit. I\u2019ll format the output as JSON to meet the required structure: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019m focused on getting this right for clarity!**Interpreting IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket text mentions a \"change workstation order\" and seems to request an assignment, mentioning a senior engineer. This suggests it relates to hardware, specifically a workstation. The word \"order\" hints at procurement, which might categorize this ticket under \"Purchase.\" However, since it also pertains to hardware issues, I could lean towards the \"Hardware\" category instead. The mention of \"change\" might be related to scheduling. I need to decide between \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase,\" leaning more toward hardware.**Deciding Category for IT Ticket**\n\nI think the best category for this ticket would be \"Hardware\" since it deals with a workstation order, which is seen as a hardware asset. However, \"Purchase\" could be more precise since it indicates procurement directly. Given the emphasis on \"workstation order,\" I lean towards categorizing this as \"Purchase\" because it signifies ordering. The user's mention of \"please assign\" isn\u2019t relevant for categorization. Therefore, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
