It's mentioning \"internal transfer\" and \"hardware allocation,\" which indicates it leans toward the \"Hardware\" category. It could potentially fit into \"Internal Project\" if it's about a project transfer, but it really seems focused on hardware allocation. To respond correctly, I\u2019ll format it as a JSON-like object with the category set as \"Hardware\" per the specified schema. That seems clear and straightforward!**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the format required for the IT ticket categorization. The schema indicates a JSON object that includes a \"category\" property containing a string value. It's clear that I should return the answer formatted as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. While the schema suggests more complexity, it doesn't necessitate additional keys. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward. I\u2019ll finalize my response as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to align with what's needed. That seems like the best approach!"
