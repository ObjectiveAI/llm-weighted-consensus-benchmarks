The instructions say to use specific categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. The ticket mentions an Oracle problem related to holiday leave or vacation entries. It could fall under \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" The mentions of \"holiday leave\" and \"Oracle problem\" make it seem like it's a leave management issue. I'll classify it accordingly.**Classifying IT ticket category**\n\nI think this ticket is about holiday leave, which suggests it's related to HR support. Since it's mentioning Oracle, the system involved in managing leave, it aligns with \"HR Support.\" Alternatively, it could fit under \"Access\" if it concerns system access, but I feel confident categorizing it as \"HR Support.\" The final output should just be a JSON object with the category key set to \"HR Support\" as required. So, I'll prepare that now!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
