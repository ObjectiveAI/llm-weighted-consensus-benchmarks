The details suggest it's related to HR support rather than a technical issue. The categories to choose from include \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the mentions of a new starter and the return from maternity leave, I'd lean towards categorizing it as \"HR Support.\"  Let's make sure to format it correctly as JSON.**Considering access setup**\n\nIt looks like someone is asking to set up access for a new starter in Belgrade, though it's not very clear. They mention both \"new starter\" and \"return from maternity leave,\" which makes me think they could be requesting to grant or re-enable access after maternity leave. The categories available are \"HR Support\" and \"Access.\" Given the ticket's content, \u201cHR Support\u201d seems more appropriate since it addresses HR processes like maternity leave and onboarding, even though it's IT-related.**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize this IT ticket. The options are \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"HR Support.\" While \"Access\" pertains to IT-related access rights, the ticket mainly discusses maternity return, which feels more administrative. However, since the ticket mentions \"new starter,\" it might involve setting up access. The phrase \"return from maternity leave\" suggests restoring access, possibly indicating a reactivation request. Given this context, I think \"HR Support\" fits best, as it covers both onboarding and maternity issues.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
