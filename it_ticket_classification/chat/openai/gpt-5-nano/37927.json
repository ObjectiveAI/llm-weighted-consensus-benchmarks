It seems to focus on a referral issue regarding candidates. Specifically, it talks about referring a candidate without having an assigned requisition. The user is asking if it's possible to do that, mentioning concerns about visibility for recruiters and referring candidates without selecting an active job. Overall, it revolves around \"referral,\" \"requisition,\" and \"recruiter visibility.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket needs to be categorized based on the provided JSON schema, which includes options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and more. Since this ticket relates to the referral process in the HR system, it seems that \"HR Support\" is the best fit, as that's the precise wording in the options. So, I\u2019ll return a JSON object with the category set to \"HR Support,\" ensuring it's correct and free of any extra text."
