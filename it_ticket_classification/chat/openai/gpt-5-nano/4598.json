They seem to request a name change, possibly in the Oracle system or as a screen name. It isn\u2019t related to hardware or HR support, as this is more of an internal IT request for access or administrative rights to change information. My best guess is that this falls under \"Administrative rights\u201d or potentially \u201cAccess.\u201d**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe request could potentially fall under \"Administrative rights\" since they may need those privileges to change the name. However, they specifically mention changing the \"screen name,\" which suggests it may be related to a login username within the Oracle database. This seems like an access request to modify account details. My guess is that \u201cAccess\u201d is the most appropriate category since it typically covers permissions for user accounts and credentials.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user appears to want administrative privileges to change a name, so the most fitting category here is \"Administrative rights.\" This likely requires admin rights for modifying user identity. While \"Access\" could also apply, \"Administrative rights\" seems more specific given the request. Although \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback option if I'm unsure, being precise is key! I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object containing the category for clarity, possibly asking for any needed clarifications or justifications along the way.**Responding with JSON**\n\nI need to present a structured response that reflects the category properly. The category I determined is \"Administrative rights,\" and I should output this in a specific JSON format. So, my response will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nI\u2019ll stick strictly to this format without adding any extra commentary since the instructions call for that. It's important to follow instructions closely!"
