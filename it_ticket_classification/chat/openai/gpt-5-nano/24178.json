The ticket is about hardware allocation related to an internal transfer in Belgrade scheduled for December. The user seems to mention multiple phases of the transfer process and the urgency of opening these tickets. I\u2019ll classify this under the \u201cHardware\u201d category in accordance with the schema. My output will be in JSON format, focusing on clarity for the user.**Categorizing transfer ticket**\n\nI see that the ticket is focused on internal transfer, hardware allocation, ID cards, and returning equipment related to moving staff. It discusses transferring employees in phases and mentions hardware allocation. The relevant categories include \"Hardware\" for hardware issues; other categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"HR Support\" don't quite fit. Since this is primarily about hardware allocation for an internal transfer, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" My JSON output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Formatting JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nI need to ensure I'm formatting my response correctly according to the schema provided. The prompt is clear: I need to categorize the IT Ticket. The category should be a string that matches one of the specified options. Given that this ticket is primarily about hardware allocation related to an internal transfer, I'll confirm the category as \"Hardware.\" My final response will simply be the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll keep it clean and free of any extra text."
