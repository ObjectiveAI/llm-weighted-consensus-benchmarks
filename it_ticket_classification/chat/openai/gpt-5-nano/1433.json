The message is quite garbled, but it mentions a \"new starter\" and \"forms attached.\" I\u2019m thinking it could relate to HR Support, Access, or maybe be classified under Miscellaneous or Administrative rights.  \n\nGiven the available categories, it seems like HR Support is the most appropriate choice for this ticket, considering the mention of a new starter.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis content refers to a \"new starter\" and mentions an \"attached form\" for creating an account or access for this new employee. Phrases like \"importance high\" and \"excuse correction\" suggest urgency. I think the ticket primarily relates to access rights, as it involves creating accounts for a new employee. While it might also fit into \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights,\" my best guess is that it falls under \"Access\" since that's the usual category for this type of request.**Defining the category**\n\nThe phrases I see, like \"forms attached\" and \"internal form updated,\" suggest this ticket could fit under \"Administrative rights,\" but it may not involve rights specifically. Since it\u2019s an IT ticket, I\u2019m considering that \"HR Support\" isn\u2019t the right fit. It seems the best category for a new starter\u2019s access creation would be \"Access.\" That\u2019s where the focus lies\u2014creating user accounts and provisioning resources.  \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
