They mentioned having problems with entries in Oracle, specifically duplicating annual leave entries and encountering errors while trying to correct them. It seems they need assistance deleting these duplicate entries so they can resubmit their hours. The issue revolves around HR software, which makes \"HR Support\" the most fitting category, although \"Access\" could also be considered.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket based on the options available: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights\". Since the issue isn't related to hardware, storage, or purchase, I'm narrowing it down. While it could reach \"Administrative rights,\" the user clearly needs help with entry issues in the Oracle HR system. Given that they mention \"annual leave\" and hours worked, categorizing this as \"HR Support\" feels like the best fit. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON category string.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
