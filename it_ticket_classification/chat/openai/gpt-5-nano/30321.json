This points to storage quotas for email. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as \u201cStorage.\u201d I need to prepare a response in a JSON-like format, ensuring it fits the required format by including the category property.**Preparing category output**\n\nI need to respond with the correct category format for the IT ticket. The specification indicates that I should output a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. It\u2019s important to ensure the format is precise according to the provided instruction, which specifies a response in JSON format. I'm realizing the user just wants the category value, but I have to stick to the guideline of outputting it as a structured JSON object. So, I\u2019ll make sure to follow that!**Formulating the category response**\n\nI need to ensure my response aligns with the schema, which shows that the \"category\" property is a string and it has specific allowed values. According to the format, I should respond with: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. This keeps it concise and clear, perfect for what\u2019s required. I\u2019m ready to proceed with this format to ensure the response meets the expectations fully. It's important to stick to the guidelines here!"
