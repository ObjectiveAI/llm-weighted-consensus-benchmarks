The user message talks about an \u201cabsence schedule calendar\u201d and mentions \"human resources,\" which strongly suggests that this is an HR-related inquiry. It\u2019s repeated several times, making it clear that it's a request regarding HR software. The best fit for categorization seems to be \"HR Support.\" There might be some consideration for \"Administrative rights,\" but HR Support feels more appropriate here.**Categorizing the Request**\n\nI\u2019m considering the specifics of the user\u2019s request. They mention an \u201cabsence schedule calendar tab,\u201d which makes it clear this is related to HR, despite some confusing phrasing. It could seem like they were asking about access, but they\u2019re not explicitly requesting it\u2014they want details instead. Since \"HR Support\" is an existing category and most fitting, I'll categorize the ticket under that. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON-like object with that category.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
