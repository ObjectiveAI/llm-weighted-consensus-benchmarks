It looks like they can\u2019t find the folder across different locations and are seeking assistance. I could categorize this under \"Access,\" since it seems to be a search problem, or perhaps \"Storage\" if it relates to where the files are kept. There are several category options, so I need to make sure I'm selecting the most appropriate one.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like the user is having trouble finding a folder named \"employees photos\" and is looking for help locating it across multiple locations. Since the issue relates to finding a folder in shared storage, I think the best category is \"Storage.\" The text doesn't mention any access denial, so \"Access\" might not fit. I should also consider \"Internal Project,\" but it doesn\u2019t seem relevant. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Storage\" in a JSON-like format.**Providing category in JSON**\n\nThe system has given me a category schema that I need to follow. Since the user is asking for help with locating a folder, I\u2019m going to categorize it as \"Storage.\" While I did wonder if \"Access\" might be more appropriate, it seems that the issue is more about finding the location of the folder rather than access rights. So, I'll stick with \"Storage.\" The final response will be in the correct JSON format as: {\"category\": \"Storage\"}."
