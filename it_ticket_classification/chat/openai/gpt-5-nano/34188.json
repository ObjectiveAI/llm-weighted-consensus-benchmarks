Given the categories provided, it seems that none align perfectly, but it looks like a \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d ticket since it deals with satisfaction score routing issues and incident management. It\u2019s definitely not about hardware, HR, access, storage, or administrative rights. So I think \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is the best fit here!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket relates to issues with the high satisfaction score notifications not being directed to the mailbox, which is an IT service management problem focused on email routing. While it could relate to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" it's better classified as \"Miscellaneous\" since it's not about access credentials. \n\nFollowing the user's request, I'll respond using the required JSON format, keeping it straightforward without any extra text: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
