It seems like there might be file attachment problems or a virus scanner, like Avast, removing images. I need to categorize the ticket properly. It could fall under \"Administrative rights,\" \"Storage,\" or \"HR Support.\" Given the mention of access rights and the errors encountered, \"Access\" might be the most fitting category. This ticket seems to involve general IT issues with contract management.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm sorting through ticket categories. \"Miscellaneous\" could be a catch-all, while \"Internal Project\" is for specific projects. If it deals with attachments or files, \"Storage\" fits, and for anything related to approved orders, \"Purchase\" might work. Given that they encountered an error while trying to add something, this suggests potential access rights issues or a need for an approval workflow. They mentioned Word format and that some images were removed by Avast, pointing to antivirus interference. So, \"Access\" seems like the best fit.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user is asking me to classify the IT ticket. It seems like they can't add something due to a permissions error, which makes \"Access\" a strong candidate. Alternatively, if it's tied to an ongoing contract project, \"Internal Project\" might fit. However, given the overall context, \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access\" are the most applicable categories. The ticket focuses on drafting contracts and mentions an image being removed by Avast, reinforcing the idea of an access or permissions issue. I'll categorize it as follows: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Deciding on ticket classification**\n\nI'm evaluating how to categorize the IT ticket. The category \"Administrative rights\" refers specifically to permissions for tasks, but the user hasn't directly mentioned lacking rights; they just mentioned an error. While \"Miscellaneous\" might be a safe catch-all, I do wonder if \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" would be more appropriate. Given that the ticket relates to draft contracts and mentions needing an approved order, I'll lean towards categorizing it as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} since it pertains to contract drafting.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI'm considering which category to assign the IT ticket regarding a contract drafting issue and an error when trying to add something in a vendor system. It seems most appropriate to classify this as \"Access\" since it's related to permissions or access control\u2014after all, they can\u2019t add due to an error that likely stems from permission issues. \"Administrative rights\" also fits, but \"Access\" is more general. So, I'll respond with the JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That should cover it!"
