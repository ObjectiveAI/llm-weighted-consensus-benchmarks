From the provided information, it appears to center around a hardware issue since it mentions the headset\u2019s microphone stopped working and replacement. While you could argue for \"Purchase\" if they were getting a new headset, it's clear that the main concern is the hardware itself. So, I'll classify this ticket under \"Hardware\" and format my response as a JSON object.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nThe prompt provides a schema for a JSON object where I need to include a \"category.\" From my analysis, I see it's clear the category should be \"Hardware.\" My response should align with the expected format, containing only the necessary JSON snippet without any extra explanations or commentary. So my final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This keeps it straightforward and to the point as instructed."
