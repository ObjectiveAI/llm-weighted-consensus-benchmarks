Since the ticket isn\u2019t very clear, I think \"Miscellaneous\" might fit best for categorizing this ticket. \n\nNow, I just need to format the response in JSON. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe user seems to ask about a new delivery to the reception on Thursday, possibly meaning to log something related to \"lite,\" which might refer to a laptop. There\u2019s a chance \"lite\" was a typo for \"late.\" \n\nConsidering the context and that it\u2019s about a delivery, I think the category that fits best is \"Hardware.\" It seems straightforward since it\u2019s about logging new hardware delivery. So, I\u2019ll categorize the ticket as Hardware.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
