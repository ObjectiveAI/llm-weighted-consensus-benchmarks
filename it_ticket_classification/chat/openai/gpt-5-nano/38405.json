They mention having trouble for the past month, especially when using VPN or other external connections. The key phrases indicate the need for help with \"remote access\" or \"external connectivity.\" So, I'll classify this under \"Networking / Access\" or possibly \"Outlook not connecting externally.\" It's important to clarify the nature of the issue for resolution.**Deciding on category for IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket, and it looks like \"Access\" is the most appropriate option since the issue relates to remote connectivity outside the network. While \"Internal Project\" crossed my mind, it doesn't fit here. The instructions require me to return a category as a JSON object. I'll follow the schema provided and output the category neatly. So, I'll format it like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That should do the trick!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
