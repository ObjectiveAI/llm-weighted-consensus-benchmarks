The user\u2019s phrasing makes it clear that this involves onboarding, which directly relates to HR Support. While I might consider \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" the mention of the starter form leans strongly towards HR tasks. Therefore, I'll categorize this ticket as \"HR Support,\" as that makes the most sense.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI see \"HR Support\" is likely the right category since the request is about a new starter and a starter form. While there's a chance it could fit under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" this seems more like onboarding. I considered \"Access\" too, but there's no mention of account provisioning or access rights. So, I\u2019m sticking with \"HR Support.\" Now, I need to format this in the required JSON-like object format.**Outputting JSON Object**\n\nI need to provide a JSON object with the category, ensuring the value is one of the allowed options. Based on the discussion, it seems that the correct response should be simply:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nHowever, I'm double-checking that the response structure aligns with the requirements. The instructions indicate I should report it as part of a JSON object, which contains the \"category\" property. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and confirm that the output is:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nJust keeping it clear and concise!"
