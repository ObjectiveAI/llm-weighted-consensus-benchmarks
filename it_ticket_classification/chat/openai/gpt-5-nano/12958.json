The content involves \"service now changes,\" \"pm changes,\" and mentions of a selection pane, but it\u2019s a bit garbled, possibly due to voice-to-text errors. With the available categories being Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights, I want to figure out which fits best. I'll focus on understanding this message more clearly to categorize it correctly.**Analyzing ticket categorization**\n\nThis ticket seems to relate to ServiceNow changes, specifically mentioning interface adjustments in the \"selection pane\" and \"view.\" The user seems to be seeking guidance about these changes, which might fall under \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" The mention of \"upcoming annual leave\" hints that the infrastructure consultant might be unavailable soon. Since the content includes multiple references to \"changes,\" categorizing this as \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" appears most appropriate for proper ticket routing.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI think the best category for this ticket might be \"Internal Project\" because it mentions \"infrastructure,\" \"consultant,\" and \"annual leave.\" However, there's also a case for \"Access,\" since references to the \"selection pane\" and changes in \"view\" suggest access issues. If there's any doubt, requesting clarification from the user could help. Still, since they specifically asked for categorization, I could propose one or both of these categories as a JSON object like {\"category\":\"Internal Project.\"}**Parsing ticket content**\n\nI need to parse the ticket content more closely. The mention of \"pm\" could refer to \"project management\" changes, which suggests it\u2019s related to adjustments in ServiceNow's UI, particularly affecting the PM view. The user's note about \"selection pane\" hints at possible issues there. The \"br\" in \"br infrastructure consultant\" might stand for \"Business Requirements\" or even \"Brazil,\" but it feels random. Overall, the phrase regarding \"upcoming annual leave\" implies scheduling rather than helping with categorization.**Determining the category**\n\nI think the broad category \"Miscellaneous\" could work, but I need to stick to the allowed options. \"Internal Project\" makes sense due to mentions of infrastructure and upcoming leave. However, the ticket is primarily about \"ServiceNow changes\" and \"PM changes,\" which relate to UI changes. While \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could fit, they aren't explicit. Since this is a classification task, I\u2019ll choose \"Internal Project,\" formatted as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} without additional text."
