It\u2019s important to get this right so that the ticket can be addressed efficiently. Let's see which of these categories matches the ticket\u2019s needs!**Processing Ticket Content**\n\nThe ticket discusses improvements for \"OBI reports\" related to Oracle BI. It details filters for active candidates, specifically mentioning how to exclude rejected candidates to reduce duplicates in the candidate profile report. The focus is on adjusting filters like status, modifying date, and ensuring candidates are displayed appropriately within requisitions, especially those that reached the offer stage. It seems the goal is to enhance clarity and efficiency in reporting. I'll make sure to categorize this accurately!**Categorizing HR Ticket**\n\nThis ticket relates to HR recruitment reporting, and the most fitting category is \"HR Support,\" which aligns with HR processes. While \"Internal Project\" could be a consideration if it involved an internal IT project, it doesn\u2019t seem to focus on hardware or administrative rights. Since this is a feature request for enhancing Oracle BI (OBI) reports specifically for HR use, I'll go ahead and format the response as a JSON object with \"HR Support.\"**Preparing IT Ticket JSON Output**\n\nThe prompt asks me to categorize this IT Ticket, and I need to respond with a category in a specific JSON format. The required output is a JSON object that includes just the \"category\" field with one of the enumerated options. Based on the context, I'll use \"HR Support\" as the category. My final output will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}, with no extra text or justification, just the JSON as specified."
