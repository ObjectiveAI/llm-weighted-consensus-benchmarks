I\u2019m thinking about the appropriate category: is it \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights\"? It doesn\u2019t seem to be related to hardware, HR, storage, or purchase. Based on the content, it feels like a software-related issue rather than anything hardware-specific.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on given options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The ticket seems related to reports software configuration, which could fit \"Internal Project\" since it discusses configuring Oracle Reports. Alternatively, if it involves needing rights to modify reports, it could be \"Administrative Rights.\" Ultimately, I should format my response as a JSON object with the selected category. I think \"Internal Project\" makes the most sense.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ve determined that \"Internal Project\" is the closest category for this IT ticket, as it relates to reports configuration within a project. However, if it doesn\u2019t fit, \"Miscellaneous\" might be more appropriate. Given it's about configuring reports, \"Internal Project\" feels right. I need to format my response perfectly as a JSON-like object. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, making sure to match the required capitalization exactly. I'm ready to deliver this!"
