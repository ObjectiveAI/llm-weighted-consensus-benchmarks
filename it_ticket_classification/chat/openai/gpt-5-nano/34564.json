The ticket mentions issues with a laptop keyboard that requires replacement. I think it fits best under \"Hardware\" since it's a hardware issue, but it could touch on \"Purchase\" if we consider procurement, though the user is asking for a replacement specifically. So, let's go with \"Hardware\" for the JSON object.**Providing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to provide the category for the IT ticket. The required output format indicates that I should return a JSON object listing the \"category.\" While the schema has a more complex structure, the user\u2019s instruction is clear: categorize this IT ticket. Therefore, the best way to respond is to keep it simple and directly state the category:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra commentary and stick to this concise output."
