It seems like it mentions \"active directory\" or \"AD\" rights for someone on maternity leave. The main focus appears to be about access rights, so calling it \"Access\" makes sense. However, if it\u2019s specifically about admin rights, \"Administrative rights\" might be better, since it\u2019s a subcategory under Access.**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user has a list of categories that includes \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the ticket mentions \"remove project access rights\" and potentially \"Active Directory\" rights, it seems to indicate a need to remove access due to maternity leave. This points to access control offboarding. Given these details, \"Access\" fits best. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s critical to keep that capitalization exact when I finalize my output.**Formatting IT Ticket Response**\n\nI need to make sure I only provide the required JSON format for the IT ticket. The system specifies the output should have a \"category\" property as a string. So, I\u2019ll respond with just the following: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s important to avoid including any extra text or explanation, as I want to stick strictly to the format that the system requires. Keeping it clean and straightforward is key!"
