They mentioned \"too much access on shared drive\" and referred to \"folders\" and a \"senior accountant.\" The main idea suggests there are access control issues, which could point toward the categories of \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Storage.\" Since the user specifically asked for a categorization, I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the most fitting choice for this ticket.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nIt looks like the phrases from the ticket indicate \"too much access on shared drive\" and mention \"senior accountant,\" suggesting that access rights might be overly broad for this user. The \"Access\" category seems most suitable since it relates to permissions. Although \"Administrative rights\" is related, there\u2019s no explicit request for elevated privileges. I think I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Access\" since it captures the general issue at hand. I\u2019ll respond accordingly!**Formatting the JSON output**\n\nThe system needs a category field in JSON format: a string that corresponds to allowed categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context of the ticket, \"Access\" is the best fit since it addresses issues with shared drive access. While \"Administrative rights\" is possible, \"too much access on shared drive\" leans toward needing to restrict access. So, I\u2019m going with \"Access\" for the output. Here\u2019s the JSON:  \n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
