The text hints they want to set up a requisitioning profile and raise requisitions, suggesting access rights are needed. Still, the mention of \"Administrative rights\" might also be key. I need to find the best-fitting category here.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI'm looking at the categories \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket seems to focus on accessing requisitioning capabilities and creating a profile. Phrases like \"update requisitioning profile\" and \"unable to raise correctly\" suggest an access or permissions issue. While the \"laptop\" references hardware, the primary action is requisitioning. Given that it's about changing rights to raise requisitions, I think \"Administrative rights\" fits best, since it deals with access rights specifically.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and the format should be a JSON object. The prompt specifies the category should match one of the listed options. In this case, it\u2019s clear that the category is \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nI need to follow the required format precisely, so I'll create the JSON object as follows: \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nI will make sure there are no extra comments or text, just the clean JSON output. Here we go!"
