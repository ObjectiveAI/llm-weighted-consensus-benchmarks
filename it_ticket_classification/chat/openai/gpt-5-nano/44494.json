It's a request regarding the change request process, specifically about editing who can approve. To fit into the provided categories, it seems best classified as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" since it involves control over approvals. I'll output this as JSON with the chosen category.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI'm categorizing an IT ticket based on a user's issue related to editing a list of approvers. There are two relevant categories: \"Access,\" which pertains to user permissions, and \"Administrative rights,\" which involves modifying who has admin capabilities. Since the user can't edit the approver list in the system, this leans more towards \"Administrative rights,\" as it pertains directly to permissions. So, I\u2019ll go with that category and output it in JSON format as instructed.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
