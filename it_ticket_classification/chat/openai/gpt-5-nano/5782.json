Since it's related to access and naming conventions, it could fit under \"Access.\" However, if renaming is required, it might also be suitable under \"Administrative rights.\" I'm considering both options!**Classifying the IT Ticket**\n\nThis ticket could fall under \"Access\" since it's about restricted meeting rooms, but it primarily involves renaming rooms. It might also fit \"Miscellaneous\" if it doesn't align perfectly. However, it talks about the permission to rename, which makes \"Administrative rights\" seem appropriate. The user's request to modify room names for access control is significant. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Administrative rights\" due to the focus on renaming and restrictions. I'll return a JSON object with the selected category!**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe focus of this ticket is on restricting access to meeting rooms, making \"Access\" a contender. However, the user's request to append \"restricted\" to the names signals a change in naming convention rather than direct access control. It seems they're trying to label meeting rooms to avoid conflicts, which falls into administrative changes. Since this action requires admin privileges to implement, I believe \"Administrative rights\" is the best category for this ticket.**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nThis task is primarily administrative. While \"Access\" relates more to controlling entry to meeting rooms, the user's request to \"append restricted to names of meeting rooms\" focuses on labeling rather than access rights. The label \"restricted\" is meant for clarity, not for managing who can enter. They specifically mention avoiding confusion among colleagues. So, I believe \"Administrative rights\" is the best choice since it involves making changes to system resources, even if it doesn't explicitly involve granting rights.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe safest and most accurate category for this ticket seems to be \"Access,\" as it involves renaming meeting rooms to include \"restricted\" for access management. While \"Administrative rights\" is relevant since renaming requires privileges, the user's focus is on labeling the rooms to indicate restricted access. Therefore, I\u2019ll respond with a clean JSON object indicating the chosen category without any additional commentary, formatted as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This aligns with the request to categorize the IT ticket appropriately."
