So, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" as the category since that seems the most fitting. However, I\u2019m also considering \"Administrative rights\" because role changes often imply adjustments in admin rights. I'll choose which category is the most precise. This process is important for managing the ticket effectively!**Categorizing role change request**\n\nThe user is requesting a role change for Wednesday PM, indicating this might be an access request. I think it makes sense to categorize it as \"Access\" since it's specifically about changing user access. Some might prefer \"Administrative rights\" for privilege escalations, but the user didn\u2019t mention admin rights directly\u2014just a \"role change.\" Given the ambiguity, I feel more confident sticking with \"Access\" to ensure clarity in addressing their request!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
