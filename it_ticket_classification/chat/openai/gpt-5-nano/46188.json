It mentions \"investigation needed,\" issues with developers, and tests with different connections. Looking at the available categories\u2014like Hardware, Miscellaneous, and Internal Project\u2014I think the most appropriate fit would be Internal Project since it involves a technical investigation and collaboration with developers. I want to ensure I'm choosing the best category to reflect the user's needs accurately.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking this IT issue revolves around testing connections, possibly involving network or system integration. Keywords like \"developer,\" \"tests,\" and \"connection\" pop up, making me lean toward \"Internal Project\" as the most fitting category. It could also be \"Miscellaneous\" or even \"Access\" if it relates to permissions, but \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best given the investigation into a solution. I\u2019ll settle on \"Internal Project\" as it ties to the user's work IT concerns.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nThe user prompt asks us to categorize an IT ticket, and we need to format our response as a JSON object. Based on the specified schema, we want to include \"category\" as the key with one of the strings provided. \n\nGiven that the ticket mentions \"investigation needed\" and whether a \"dedicated\" option could solve an issue, it points toward an \"Internal Project.\" While \"Hardware\" could be a contender if it involved physical servers, the focus seems on network connectivity. So, I'll confirm the category as \"Internal Project\" and respond with the JSON object: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
