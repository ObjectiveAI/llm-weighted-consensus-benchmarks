The user\u2019s message focuses on a new purchase order for a monitor and mentions installation and receipts. It clearly involves hardware and also ties back to purchasing. Given the options, \"Purchase\" seems to fit best since it emphasizes procurement and order handling. However, I could argue for \"Hardware\" too since it pertains to the physical monitor. If I have to choose one, I\u2019ll lean towards \"Purchase.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket regarding a new monitor purchase and its installation. Since the focus seems to be on logging the new purchase and handling receipts, \"Purchase\" is likely the best category because it emphasizes the purchase order. Although \"Hardware\" also fits due to the monitor, my intuition leans toward \"Purchase,\" as it's most relevant to the main subject. So I\u2019ll output the category in the specified JSON format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
