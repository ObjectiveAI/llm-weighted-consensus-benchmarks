Their message is a bit jumbled, mentioning \"full access,\" \"site owner,\" and \"higher role.\" It appears to mostly deal with permissions. Our categorization schema includes \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" which both seem relevant. I\u2019m wondering which category fits better, especially given their desire for a higher role. I need to decide on the best match.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe user is asking for rights to subpages and folders, suggesting they want higher privileges, possibly \"Administrative rights.\" The general category \"Access\" is about access requests, whereas \"Administrative rights\" covers permission elevation specifically. Given their request for \"full access\" and a \"higher role,\" I think \"Administrative rights\" fits best. It also hints at a potential ownership change, making it an appropriate choice. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
