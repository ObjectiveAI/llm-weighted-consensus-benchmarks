The details include terms like \"purchase order,\" \"log allocation after receiving the item,\" and mentions of receipts and a video link. It seems to relate to the purchasing and hardware allocation process. I'm leaning towards categorizing this as \"Purchase,\" given it's directly about a new purchase order, but \"Hardware\" might also fit since it's specifically about a monitor.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe ticket is primarily about the purchasing process and logging allocation, so I think \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category since it relates to procurement. I considered other options like \"Hardware,\" but I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Purchase\" based on its content, which includes terms like \"new purchase\" and \u201clog allocation after receiving the item.\u201d I'll respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. This feels concise and to the point!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
