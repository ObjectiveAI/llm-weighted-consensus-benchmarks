It's not about hardware or HR, and there\u2019s no access issue. I think it fits best under \"Storage,\" but \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they need permission to change settings. \"Miscellaneous\" might fit if it doesn't align directly.**Categorizing IT ticket request**\n\nThe ticket's from a user asking to increase upload size, which is usually a configuration change done by an admin. I think the best categories here are \"Administrative rights\" or \"Storage.\" Typically, upload size requests would fall under \"Storage\" or \"Limits\" in IT taxonomies. Since the user is specifically mentioning Confluence and file uploads, I'll categorize it as \"Storage,\" relating to storage quota and limits.  \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}."
