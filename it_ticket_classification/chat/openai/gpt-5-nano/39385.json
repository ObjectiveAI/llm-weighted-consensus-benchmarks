While \"Access\" might relate if it's a login issue, it seems unrelated.**Finalizing the IT ticket category**\n\nIt looks like there's an issue with a persistent pop-up window, which might suggest needing \"Administrative rights,\" but it's not definitive. The categories available don't include \"Software\" or \"Application,\" so \"Miscellaneous\" seems the best fit. I\u2019ll provide a JSON response with the category labeled as \"Miscellaneous.\" The user asked to categorize the IT ticket, so the response should only include the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.
