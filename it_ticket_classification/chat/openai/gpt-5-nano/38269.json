I\u2019m narrowing it down to either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since both relate to user permissions. Given the phrases and context, it seems most appropriate to assign the \"Administrative rights\" category to address the user\u2019s problem with receiving errors.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a ticket where the user seems to lack rights or faces errors despite being an administrator. They mentioned \"added administrator board,\" which could mean they added an admin but are still encountering errors\u2014definitely suggesting permission issues. I\u2019m torn between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Considering the specifics of privileges, I think \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit.
