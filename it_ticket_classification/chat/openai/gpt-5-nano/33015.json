The request is quite complex, mentioning \"maps\" multiple times, along with terms like \"career maps\" and \"storage.\" It seems the user is asking for help related to these resources, particularly about where relevant date information on maps is stored. Considering the categories provided, the \"Storage\" category seems to fit best for this request. I need to ensure I categorize it correctly!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket details which mention things like \"date information maps stored,\" \"archives,\" and \"forms grades job titles.\" It sounds like the request is about document storage, particularly for \"maps\" and potentially HR-related forms. Given the need to find the location of these documents, the \"Storage\" category seems the most appropriate. I want to make sure I categorize this properly since it seems to be focused on finding where the relevant data is kept!**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI'm considering that \"assist her absence\" might relate to helping a program lead, but it doesn't seem relevant to our specific task. The best fit for this ticket is clearly \"Storage.\" I need to format my response as a JSON object containing the category. The system's instruction says to output only this, so I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. This ensures that I'm following the guidelines and providing exactly what\u2019s required. Let's keep it simple!"
