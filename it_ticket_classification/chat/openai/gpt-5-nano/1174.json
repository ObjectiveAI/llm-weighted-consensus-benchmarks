Looking at the category options, I realize this ticket likely fits under \"Internal Project\" since it relates to changes within a specific project or tool. However, \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" could also be contenders since it mentions assignments and changes. But, I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" for clarity.**Categorizing project name change**\n\nThis ticket seems to be about a project name change within a merchant origination tool. Based on the content, it doesn't fit as hardware, storage, purchase, HR, or access. It might relate to \"Administrative rights\" if it concerns permission to rename something. However, since it\u2019s mainly about the project name change, I'm leaning toward categorizing it as \"Internal Project.\" I'll format the response as a JSON object with the category set to \"Internal Project.\"{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
