Since the text explicitly states \"purchase requested,\" I think it makes the most sense to categorize this as \"Purchase.\" However, it could also fall under \"Hardware\" since it\u2019s a hardware accessory for the laptop. Still, the purchasing aspect seems more significant here!**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nThe ticket clearly indicates \"purchase requested,\" so categorizing it as \"Purchase\" seems correct. IT ticket guidelines typically classify requests for equipment purchases under this category. To adhere to the JSON format specified in the instruction, I need to respond with a structured object. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I'll make sure to keep it concise with no extra text! That's all I need to do.**Crafting JSON object**\n\nAlright, I need to create the JSON object correctly. The required field name is \"category\" in lowercase, not \"Category.\" It definitely needs to be a proper JSON object with just that property and the right value. Also, I shouldn't include any extra whitespace. Keeping it neat and simple is key here. So, I'll produce the final output as: { \"category\": \"Purchase\" }. That\u2019s all I need to ensure!"
