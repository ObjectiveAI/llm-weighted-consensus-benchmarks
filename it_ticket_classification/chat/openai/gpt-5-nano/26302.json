The user seems to be indicating problems with \"approval,\" \"assigned responsibility,\" and the \"submit\" button functionality. Given my category taxonomy, I see potential fits in \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or possibly \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" They mention issues surrounding approvals and notifications, which could influence the final decision. I want to choose the most relevant category!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for this IT ticket about access control since the user's text includes \"cannot approve,\" which indicates a permission issue. \"Administrative rights\" seems like a strong candidate as it relates to the ability to approve. But \"Access\" is also on the list of categories. I need to determine whether to go with \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or perhaps \"Miscellaneous\" if I can't be sure. The user's description suggests a focus on approvals within a system, possibly a Google sheet or an internal tool.**Choosing the right category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, and I believe \"Access\" is the most suitable category since it's focused on permission to approve. While \"Administrative rights\" refers to elevated permissions, \"Access\" is broader. Given the user\u2019s description of \"recently assigned responsibility\" and \"members cannot approve,\" it reflects a permissions issue rather than specific admin rights. Therefore, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text."
