It mentions time notifications, maternity leave, and person records, which seems to relate to HR or time tracking. The available categories include HR Support, Administrative rights, Access, and others. HR Support feels like the best fit since it deals with personnel and time issues. So, I'll prepare a JSON object to represent the category as \"HR Support\"!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
