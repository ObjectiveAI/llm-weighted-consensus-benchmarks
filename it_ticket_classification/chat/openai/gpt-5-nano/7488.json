It sounds like they might be referring to team structure changes. I think the most relevant category seems to be \"Internal Project,\" as it relates to team organization. Alternatively, it could also involve \"HR Support\" if it's about reallocating employees. There's some ambiguity in the wording, but it appears they\u2019re asking about switching disciplines within the team.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI think it makes the most sense to categorize this as \"Internal Project\" since it involves project discipline changes. The user specifically asked for the categorization of an IT ticket, so I need to respond with a JSON-like format. \n\nMy response should be something like: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Even though the message is a bit unclear, sticking to the format is essential, and I could mention it's my best guess based on the information provided."
