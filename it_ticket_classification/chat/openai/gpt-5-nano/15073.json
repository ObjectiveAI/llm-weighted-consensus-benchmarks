The categories to choose from are: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the focus is on mailbox space, it seems to fit best under \"Storage,\" though \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, but not as strongly. I think the best choice is \"Storage,\" and I'll respond using a structured JSON-like object.**Finalizing the JSON output**\n\nI need to create a JSON object that matches the required schema with the chosen category value. The category here is \"Storage,\" so I should respond with just that in the correct format. The schema indicates I need to include the type as well. I understand the instruction says to keep it concise, so I'll stick with the essential information. My final output will be {\"category\":\"Storage\"} without any extra text or notes, as requested."
