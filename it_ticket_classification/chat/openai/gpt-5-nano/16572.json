The text provided contains key phrases like \"new purchase,\" \"installation,\" and \"receipts.\" It seems to focus on acquiring new hardware. Therefore, I'll assign the category of \"Purchase\" since it relates to processing a new hardware request. It\u2019s essential to align the ticket to the most relevant category to streamline the process!**Categorizing Purchase Order**\n\nThe request involves a new purchase order, and the item mentioned may refer to a \"Pro Retina Intel,\" likely a product from Apple. Keywords in the request like \"receipts,\" \"log installation,\" and \"order\" indicate it's tied to purchasing and administrative tasks. The category \"Purchase\" fits best here, while categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project\" don\u2019t apply. So, I\u2019ll prepare the output as a JSON object indicating the category as \"Purchase.\"**Formatting Final Output**\n\nI\u2019m preparing the final answer: it needs to be in JSON format that aligns with the specified schema. The category I'll use is \"Purchase,\" so I want to make sure the output reflects that correctly as an object. The required format specifies an object with properties showing the category. While the user just asked to categorize the ticket, I\u2019ll stick to providing one clear category to keep it simple. Here goes: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
