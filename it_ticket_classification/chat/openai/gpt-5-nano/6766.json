The available categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket discusses replacing wallpapers across all locations with updated push screen savers. It\u2019s a bit garbled, but it sounds like IT work. I think it could fall under \"Internal Project\" for updating, or maybe \"Administrative rights\" if they require permissions to make those changes. \"Miscellaneous\" might also apply because it's a general task.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to categorize this IT ticket. It seems the task involves replacing wallpapers, which might need administrative rights. If it\u2019s about pushing screensavers across locations, it could qualify as an \"Internal Project.\" But since it's a pretty generic IT request, \"Miscellaneous\" also fits. However, there aren't categories like \"Software\" or \"Deployment\" in the allowed options, which complicates things. Overall, I feel \"Internal Project\" might be the best choice here.**Selecting ticket category**\n\nThe best fit for this IT ticket seems to be \"Internal Project,\" as it involves replacing wallpapers across multiple locations. The mention of needing input from the requester suggests this is at a planning stage. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they need permissions, we can't assume that necessity. Therefore, I\u2019ll output the category as a JSON object, making sure it's valid and succinct. My response will be: \n\n{\"category\": \"Internal Project\"} \n\nI might also note that it involves a cross-location wallpaper or screensaver deployment.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
