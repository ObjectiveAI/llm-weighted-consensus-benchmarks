I could classify this as \"Administrative rights\" since they want to disable something, or maybe \"Access\" since it's about Outlook prompts. \"Miscellaneous\" might work too. Let's decide on the best category!**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nDisabling notifications may require admin rights or access changes. The user mentions wanting to \"disable outlook prompt\" related to meeting rooms, which could imply \"Access\" due to permissions. However, it looks more like an \"Administrative rights\" issue if it involves configuring settings.\n\nSince it\u2019s not about hardware, storage, or HR, it might be too ambiguous for \"Miscellaneous.\" But I think \"Administrative rights\" is appropriate since they're requesting changes that likely need admin privileges. I'll lean toward categorizing it that way!**Finalizing Ticket Categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket since the taxonomy is limited. \"Administrative rights\" seems plausible because disabling system-wide prompts likely requires those rights. However, it also could be \"Access\" if the issue pertains to resource mailboxes for meeting rooms. \n\nIf it\u2019s a general IT ticket that doesn\u2019t fit neatly into other categories, \"Miscellaneous\" might work too. But since I think admin rights are necessary, I'll choose \"Administrative rights\" for the final category. Now, I\u2019ll format it in JSON!{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
