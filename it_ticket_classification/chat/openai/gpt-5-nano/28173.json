I need to make sure to format this correctly as a JSON object. The structure should have a \"category\" key, and the value will be \"Access.\" So, the final output needs to be:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}  \n\nI'm confirming that this matches the required specifications.**Clarifying response format**\n\nI see that the tool's category format is defined in a certain way, and I need to ensure I follow that properly. The expected output should be a JSON object that specifies the \"category\" field. The schema indicates I should return an object with the key \"category,\" and its value should be one of the enumerated strings.\n\nSo, to be clear, while the detailed schema is there, I think the best way to respond is with:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nIt keeps things straightforward!**Providing concise response**\n\nI want to keep things straightforward and avoid any extra wording. The goal is to respond clearly, focusing solely on delivering the necessary JSON format without any additional text. I will adhere to the requirements, making sure my output meets the specifications exactly as needed. Alright, I'll make sure I deliver the essential information in a precise and clear manner! Let\u2019s go ahead and output just the JSON."
