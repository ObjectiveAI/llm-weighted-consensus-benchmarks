The description is quite messy, but I understand that they spilled coffee on the laptop, which caused issues with the left side of the keyboard. They\u2019re asking for advice on how to stop the internal keyboard from malfunctioning so they can use an external one instead. I\u2019ll ensure to summarize and categorize this ticket properly.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the user's keyboard issue. The options include categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. Since this is a hardware issue due to a coffee spill, \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate category. While it could be \"Access\" if they want to disable the internal keyboard, that's more about permissions. I'll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to conform with the required format. I\u2019m thinking a brief rationale could help, too!**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, and the instructions specify that I should only provide the category without any extra content. Based on previous tasks, it seems the best approach is to output just the required JSON. So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It\u2019s straightforward, and I think I\u2019m getting it right!"
