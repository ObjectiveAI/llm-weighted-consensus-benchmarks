Looking at the categories available\u2014like \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" and others\u2014it seems this is clearly a hardware request. Since they are asking for hardware provisioning, I think \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category for this ticket. It just makes sense to classify it this way!**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI see that there\u2019s an explicit \u201cPurchase\u201d category, and while the request mentions providing a second monitor, it focuses on hardware provisioning rather than explicitly asking to buy it. Since the user wants to categorize this, I\u2019ll respond with the right category. According to the required format, I need to create a JSON object with just the category field. I\u2019ll keep it concise and output {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any extra commentary."
