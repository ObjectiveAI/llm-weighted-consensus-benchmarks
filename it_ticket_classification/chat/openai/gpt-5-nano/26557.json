The user emphasizes the high importance of the ticket and is asking how to categorize it. Based on the context, the simplest categorization seems to be \"Internal Project\" since it's about developing code for holidays in Colombia. While this relates to HR and holiday management, it specifically involves a software code change, making \"Internal Project\" a fitting choice.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI'm evaluating an IT ticket that isn't about rights or access, which helps narrow down the categories. It's not about storage or purchase either. However, since it's related to code development, \"Internal Project\" seems like the right place for it. I also considered \"Administrative rights,\" but without clear requirements for admin privileges, it doesn\u2019t fit as well. So, I\u2019m going to categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and output the structured JSON object: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`."
