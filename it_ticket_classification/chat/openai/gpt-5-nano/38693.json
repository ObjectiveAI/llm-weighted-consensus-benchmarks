The ticket involves technical equipment procurement, mentioning things like microphones, headsets, and budgets. Since it's primarily about purchasing hardware, I think \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category. However, some might also consider it \"Hardware\" since it refers to the equipment itself. In this case, I\u2019m leaning toward \"Purchase\" due to the focus on acquiring the items.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket discusses technical equipment and mentions a desire to purchase or get recommendations for a more professional microphone. It definitely falls under procurement. Given the context, \"Purchase\" is the most appropriate category. I need to format the response as a JSON object, specifically outputting: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I'll make sure to use the exact name from the available options, and I won't include any extra text in the response. Let's get that done!"
