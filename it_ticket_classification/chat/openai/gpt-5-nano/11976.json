I'll prepare a JSON object with that classification!**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019ve gone through the keywords in the text, like \"new purchase,\" \"purchased,\" \"log allocation,\" and \"receipts.\" Initially, I thought it might fit into categories like Administrative rights or Internal Project, but those don't seem relevant here. It looks like \"Purchase\" is indeed the best fit based on the content. \n\nI'll output the JSON object with the \"category\" set to \"Purchase,\" aligning with the provided schema. That should work perfectly for the user's request!**Preparing JSON output**\n\nThe user expects a JSON snippet that includes the category field, and they've provided a schema to guide me. Based on my analysis, I\u2019ll output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nThat's the right response without any extra text needed. I must ensure it\u2019s concise and accurate.
