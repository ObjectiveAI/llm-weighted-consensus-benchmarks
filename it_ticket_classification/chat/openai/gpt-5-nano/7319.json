They want to activate a feature for Teams devices that show joined or exited meetings. The text-to-speech engine reportedly struggles with English. I'll categorize this ticket into the defined categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Let's determine the best fit for their request.**Categorizing IT Support Ticket**\n\nThe ticket relates to activating the meeting join/exit notifications feature. It mentions Teams stand devices showing joined/exited meetings and poorly functioning text-to-speech. I\u2019m considering categorizing it under \"Hardware\" due to these devices or \"Administrative rights\" for permission-related issues. The main request is about activating a software feature, which also suggests \"Access.\" However, since it feels vague, \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit. I need to choose between \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Hardware.\"**Analyzing IT Ticket Categories**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the ticket about activating meeting join/exit notifications. If admin rights are needed, it could go under \"Administrative rights,\" but that\u2019s not explicitly requested. The feature requested pertains to Teams stand devices, which makes me think about \"Internal Project,\" as it's an internal capability request. The ticket mentions \"meeting join exit notifications,\" and I need to decide among the given categories. I wonder if \"Teams stand devices\" refers to devices used during meetings or something else. Let's pinpoint the best fit!**Categorizing Device-Related Request**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating the ticket about the join/exit notifications feature for meeting room devices. The request has two aspects: activating the notifications and addressing the issues with the text-to-speech engine. I\u2019m considering categorizing this under \"Hardware\" due to the involvement of devices, or \"Administrative rights\" if it relates to enabling features. \"Miscellaneous\" is also an option, but I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit since the mention of devices likely drives this issue.**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m narrowing down the most appropriate category for this ticket. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if enabling features requires such rights, the user isn't asking for permissions; they want an assessment. The \"Internal Project\" category seems most fitting since this is a feature request for organizational use related to the Teams stand devices. I\u2019ll craft the final answer in the required JSON format: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI want to make sure this is precise, sticking to just the category. Let's deliver it!"
