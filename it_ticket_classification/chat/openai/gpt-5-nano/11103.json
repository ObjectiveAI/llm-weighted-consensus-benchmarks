It seems connected to HR Support, given those terms. The issue might involve allocations in Oracle or access permissions, especially if someone can't submit requests.\n\nI think the best fit for this category is \"HR Support\" because it deals with leave and benefits. There\u2019s a possibility to categorize it as \"Internal Project\" too, but \"HR Support\" feels right. Administrative rights may not apply unless it's about permissions.**Parsing Oracle issue**\n\nIt looks like the user is dealing with an \"Oracle short time allocation issue,\" likely related to the system\u2019s feature for short time allocations. They mention terms like \"annual leave,\" \"TOIL,\" and a \"short term location option,\" particularly regarding Dublin. \n\nThey're requesting help quickly, which makes me think the category should be \"HR Support,\" since accessing permissions doesn\u2019t seem to be the problem. I\u2019ll structure it like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That seems to fit well!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
