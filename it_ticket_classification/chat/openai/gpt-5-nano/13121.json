The message mentions needing help with this form and includes an attached filled-out document. This strongly suggests it relates to HR Support since it\u2019s about intern onboarding. While \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" might fit, it seems best to categorize this ticket as \"HR Support\" due to the nature of the request.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket about the \"bulk starter form.\" It suggests an onboarding process for interns, which leans me toward \"HR Support.\" However, the mention of generating access or accounts makes me consider \"Access\" as well. Since the ticket requests help with the form, it definitely falls under HR-related matters. Given the context, I think the best categorization would be:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"} \n\nBut I\u2019ll keep \"Access\" in mind as a potential option.**Interpreting IT Ticket Request**\n\nThe user\u2019s message indicates they are asking IT to help fill out the \"bulk starter form\" for new interns. This form seems linked to the onboarding process, which aligns with HR functions. While I could consider \"Access\" since it might involve provisioning accounts, \"HR Support\" feels more appropriate because it directly relates to intern onboarding. Given the context, I believe the best category for the ticket is \"HR Support.\"{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
