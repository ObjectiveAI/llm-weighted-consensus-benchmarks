The text is a bit garbled, but it includes phrases like \"new starter,\" \"Bogot\u00e1,\" and \"administration officer.\" This suggests it\u2019s related to a new employee onboarding process. It could reasonably fit under \u201cHR Support\u201d or \u201cAccess,\u201d especially since it relates to onboarding tasks. I'll likely classify it as \"HR Support\" because it involves joining forms and access implications.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the available categories: HR Support, Access, and Administrative rights. Since this is about a new starter, access provisioning for accounts and email seems appropriate, making \"Access\" the best choice. The mention of \"administration officer\" and \"join\" hints at onboarding tasks, which also supports categorizing as Access. While it could fit under HR Support too, the IT ticket system focuses on IT aspects. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" and respond with a JSON format as instructed.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to provide the response in the specific JSON format given by the system, which requires a \"category\" field. The format looks like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. So, it\u2019s clear I should select \"Access\" as the category for the IT ticket to reflect the intended purpose. I\u2019ll keep it concise and avoid any extra comments. A straightforward response with the required JSON format will be best!"
