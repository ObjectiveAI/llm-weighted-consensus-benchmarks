It describes an error when trying to recommend a friend for a job, mentioning issues with the \"recommend a friend\" feature and a \"print screen with error message.\" This sounds like it's related to a software issue, likely linked to HR or Recruitment. I should classify it under \"HR Support\" to ensure it's addressed properly and efficiently. I'll prepare the JSON category object with that information.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nIt seems like I need to figure out whether to categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project\" or \"HR Support.\" Since it involves recommending a friend for a job and includes an error message about submission issues, \"HR Support\" seems like the most fitting choice. The mention of \"jobs developer\" points towards a software bug in the recruitment portal, which leans towards HR. I'll finalize the category as \"HR Support\" for clarity.**Categorizing IT issues**\n\nThe best category for this ticket seems to be \"HR Support,\" since the end user is involved in HR and it concerns recommending a friend for a job. This appears to be a bug in the \"Recommend a friend\" feature within the job posting system, which likely falls under HR IT issues. I ruled out other categories like Hardware, Access, and Miscellaneous since they don\u2019t fit the situation. It clearly indicates an application-related problem, specifically in the recruitment portal.**Deciding on category for ticket**\n\nI see the ticket could potentially route to \"Internal Project\" since it addresses a software bug in the jobs/recruitment portal. However, the category list is somewhat generic, and \"HR Support\" feels more appropriate since it directly connects to HR issues. The mention of \"jobs developer\" seems to refer to the internal development team, but I think \"HR Support\" suits better because it deals with HR processes. Ultimately, I'll format the response in the required JSON format to categorize the ticket correctly.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
