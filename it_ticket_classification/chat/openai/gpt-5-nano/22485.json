It mentions \"additional memory,\" \"upgrade,\" \"installation tickets,\" and \"goods order.\" These elements point to a few possible categories, like Hardware for the memory upgrade, Purchase for the goods order, or perhaps Internal Project due to mentions of \"two teams ramping.\" The emphasis on hardware makes me lean toward Hardware as the most fitting category, but I\u2019m still weighing the options.**Categorizing as Hardware**\n\nI'm leaning toward classifying this IT ticket as Hardware since it primarily discusses upgrading memory and installation tickets. The presence of terms like \"part contract upgrade\" and \"goods order\" suggests procurement for hardware upgrades. It also indicates action items, such as creating installation tickets. All signs point to it being an internal IT ticket focused on memory upgrades and installations. Therefore, my final categorization will be as Hardware, and I\u2019ll format this as a JSON object.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
