They likely want \"full access\" to something on Friday PM and are asking to add a specialist. Considering the available categories, \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" seems appropriate since it\u2019s related to access privileges. I\u2019ll choose \"Access\" for the JSON response.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at two relevant categories for this IT ticket: \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The user requests \"full access\" and mentions adding a \"specialist,\" which hints at needing permissions. It\u2019s a bit tricky to decide between them. Although \"full access\" might suggest general access, it also leans towards administrative permissions. Since it\u2019s about privileges, I think I should choose \"Access\" as the more specific category that covers their request effectively.**Selecting the category**\n\nThe user\u2019s phrase \"full access\" suggests they're requesting high-level rights, which points towards the \"Administrative rights\" category. Based on the provided JSON schema, I'll format my response accordingly. The ticket text is a bit ambiguous as to what they're asking, but because they specifically mention wanting \"full access,\" I lean towards \"Administrative rights,\" which indicates more specific privileges. So, my final response will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
