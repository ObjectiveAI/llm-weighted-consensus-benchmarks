The mention of \"fill maternity leaver form\" indicates it's related to HR processes rather than anything technical, like hardware or internal projects. So, I'll go with HR Support as the most fitting category since it's an administrative process.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nIn classifying the IT ticket, it's clear that the message is focused on HR formalities, particularly related to a maternity leave form. While \"Administrative rights\" might seem relevant, that pertains to access requests, which isn't the case here. The user is clearly asking to fill out a form for maternity leave, so I should categorize this ticket as \"HR Support.\" For the output, I'll format it as a JSON object, like this: {\"category\":{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
