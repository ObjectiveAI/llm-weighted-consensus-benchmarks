Although it could fit under \"Hardware\" as well, I think \"Access\" is the best fit, given that it's about user access control. So, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\"**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe description mentions terms like \"attendance control,\" \"facial fingerprint attendance control,\" and \"fingerprint reader,\" which makes me think it\u2019s related to devices, hence \u201cHardware\u201d seems relevant. However, since the focus is on access permissions, \u201cAccess\u201d really fits better, especially for a ticket about implementing access control. They also mention software and servers related to this process, but I'll simplify it to just \u201cAccess.\u201d I\u2019ll format the output as JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}\u2014concise and straightforward!"
