It seems to involve an access issue since they might need help with signing documents. I'll lean toward the \"Access\" category, but \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant if it's related to access permissions for HelloSign. I'll finalize my choice.**Deciding the IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering which category fits the IT ticket best. The content implies trouble with signing, possibly referring to HelloSign, and mentions that it was solved by an intern. The \"Miscellaneous\" category feels too general, but \"Access\" might apply if there are underlying access issues, even though there's no mention of login or credentials. The other categories like Hardware, HR Support, Storage, Purchase, and Internal Project don't seem relevant. I need to balance being specific while not over-focusing on access.**Finalizing the IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m reflecting on the best category for this IT ticket related to HelloSign. While I considered \"internal project,\" it doesn't seem to fit perfectly. However, since \"Administrative rights\" don't apply, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best choice. There\u2019s no specific category for software or applications, so it suits the situation. The user asked me to categorize the ticket and provided a format request for a JSON object. My final response will be: {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}."
