I\u2019ll consider options like \"Miscellaneous\" for its vagueness and \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" if it requires specific permissions. I need to decide carefully!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned \"installed core tool work,\" which probably indicates a software tool for work. Since it's not clearly hardware-related, \"Miscellaneous\" feels appropriate for this ambiguous request. If they were specifically asking for installation requiring admin rights, \"Administrative rights\" could apply, but no explicit rights are mentioned. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous\" and format the output as a JSON object to fit the schema, adding a brief justification for clarity.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
