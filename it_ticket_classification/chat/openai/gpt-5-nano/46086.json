The text indicates an inability to connect, which makes me think it's related to access. It mentions needing to be connected and possible additional steps. The allowed categories include \"Access,\" which seems to fit well here. I\u2019m concluding that the appropriate category is \"Access,\" so I\u2019ll output a JSON object reflecting that with the category set as \"Access.\"**Formatting the JSON output**\n\nI'm working on getting the correct format for the JSON-like category object. The schema indicates that the output should include a property called \"category\" that directly holds a string from the allowed list, rather than a nested structure. This means my final output should be simply: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to eliminate any extra commentary and focus on providing just this JSON object without additional formatting. So, I'll ensure the output is strictly: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
