The text refers to \"development access problem,\" mentions \"members\" struggling with tracking submissions, and discusses permissions related to managing cards. It clearly indicates issues with access control and permissions in a development environment. Considering the context, the most fitting category for this ticket would likely be \"Access,\" although \"Administrative rights\" could also work. I'll settle on \"Access\" for simplicity.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user describes a \"development access problem\" and mentions that \"each member got permission.\" This suggests the issue could fit in the \"Access\" category, which is broader. However, if it's specifically about permissions within an application, it could also fall under \"Administrative rights.\" The emphasis on permissions suggests that \"Access\" is the most appropriate category since it addresses the user's main concern. I\u2019ll respond with JSON reflecting this choice, like so: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to ensure only this JSON is provided.**Formatting IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize this IT ticket in JSON format. The appropriate category here is \"Access.\" I can confirm that this value is a string and included in the list of allowed values. I\u2019ll keep the response minimal and straightforward to meet the requirements. So, my final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This should ensure clarity and succinctness for the user!"
