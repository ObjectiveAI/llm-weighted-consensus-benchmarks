Since \"change owner\" implies modifying ownership, it relates to access rights. The best fit for this request appears to be either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" I need to decide which one is more appropriate.**Categorizing IT requests**\n\nThe phrase \"change owner\" refers to an administrative task in IT. The user likely wants to assign ownership to themselves, which makes \"Administrative rights\" the most fitting category. I need to format my response as a JSON object to categorize the request properly. The allowed value needs to be exactly \"Administrative rights,\" so I\u2019ll make sure the capitalization is correct: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward without any extra text."
