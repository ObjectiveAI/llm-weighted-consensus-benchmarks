The categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.\n\nThe ticket seems garbled, but it mentions peripherals and is about purchasing headphones, mouse models, and backpacks. Based on the context, it seems to be primarily about purchasing devices, so \"Purchase\" is probably the best category. Although \"Hardware\" could fit too, I think \"Purchase\" is more appropriate. \n\nI'll respond with a JSON object stating the category as \"Purchase.\"**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI'm focusing on using the exact allowed enum string for the category response. The instruction clearly states to respond with just the JSON object, no additional text needed, so I'll go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nI want to be careful not to include any quotes around the whole thing as a code block, just keeping it as plain text. It seems the ticket emphasizes \"peripherals,\" \"purchase,\" and \"urgent,\" which supports classifying it under Purchase. Alright, I\u2019ll deliver the final output without extra punctuation. Here it is!"
