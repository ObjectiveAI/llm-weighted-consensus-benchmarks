It seems like a maintenance request, possibly about hardware, since it relates to the door not closing properly. Although we don\u2019t have a \"Facilities\" category, it fits best under \"Hardware\" as it concerns a physical device.**Categorizing IT Ticket Issues**\n\nIn the IT ticket system, I notice doors might relate to security or access control. However, \u201cAccess\u201d isn\u2019t an available category, and it seems that\u2019s more for login issues. The user mentioned a door not closing properly near the printer, which could indicate a hardware issue rather than access. It might be a maintenance request since it's about a physical door. So, I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit for this ticket.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m working on categorizing this IT ticket about a door that doesn\u2019t close properly. The ticket mentions \"the door near the printer\" on the \"th floor,\" which might mean the 3rd or 5th floor. Since it\u2019s an IT ticket, it seems like \"Facilities\" would fit, but that category isn\u2019t available. \"Hardware\" feels more appropriate since it relates to the physical door. I'll need to respond with the category in a JSON format as instructed.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
