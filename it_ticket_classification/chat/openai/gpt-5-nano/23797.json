Looking at the provided categories, it seems to relate to HR since it mentions \"annual leave\" multiple times, requests a date, and mentions a senior developer. It's definitely not about hardware or access. I\u2019ll determine that HR Support is the most appropriate category. My next step is to output a JSON object with the category property set to HR Support.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nI need to follow the required output format, starting with \"Category:\". However, the actual response should be a JSON object containing a \"category\" key. The user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, and based on the provided details, I determined it belongs in \"HR Support\". There isn't a request for access, so that rules out \"Administrative rights\". I\u2019m just going to deliver the JSON without any additional commentary. Here\u2019s my final response:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
