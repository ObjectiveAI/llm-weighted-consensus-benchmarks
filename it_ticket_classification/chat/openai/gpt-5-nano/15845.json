The message seems to refer to issues regarding documentation and DNS forward lookup zones. It includes terms like \"synchronized,\" \"changed,\" and \"technician informed,\" which suggests it relates to IT infrastructure. However, the categories I have to choose from are broader and don't exactly fit these specifics. I might consider \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but I'm unsure which is the best fit.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI'm trying to determine the best category for this IT ticket. The possible choices seem to be \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Storage.\" The user\u2019s text suggests a focus on documentation and DNS forward lookup zones, so it feels like it might relate to an admin task. \"Administrative rights\" might fit if they\u2019re asking to make changes, but it's not entirely clear. Unfortunately, the categories don\u2019t include terms that directly reference networking or infrastructure.**Deciding on the category**\n\nI'm determining the most fitting category for this DNS-related task, and \"Internal Project\" seems appropriate since the ticket references documentation and DNS zones synchronization. It could be categorized as such. If I'm unsure, \"Miscellaneous\" would be my backup option. The rationale here is that it addresses IT infrastructure, specifically regarding DNS forward lookup zones and documentation. I need to format my response as a JSON object to categorize the ticket correctly. So, I'll output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
