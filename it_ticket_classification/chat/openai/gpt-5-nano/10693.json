This primarily concerns installation processes and seems related to \"Internal Project\" because it involves internal ticketing. However, since there are also delivered modules, it could fit under \"Hardware.\" Given that logging installation tickets is the main action, I think \"Internal Project\" might fit best.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nIn categorizing an IT ticket, I think \"Hardware\" fits best for the installation of physical devices. \"Internal Project\" relates more to project management tasks. The user asked me to categorize the ticket, and \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t apply here.\n\n\"Access\" is likely about user permissions, which isn't the case. If it's unclear, \"Miscellaneous\" might work, but I should aim for a clear classification. Since the ticket involves installation and modules related to hardware, I'll go with \"Hardware\" and prepare the JSON response as {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}.**Formatting category response**\n\nThe prompt has a specific category schema. It indicates that I should output a JSON object with a type and properties. However, I understand that we only need to focus on providing the category.\n\nIn previous tasks, I've outputted this as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Even though the schema has more structure, my task here is straightforward.\n\nSince the instruction emphasizes that I should focus solely on the category, I will produce this response as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I'll keep it clear and concise."
