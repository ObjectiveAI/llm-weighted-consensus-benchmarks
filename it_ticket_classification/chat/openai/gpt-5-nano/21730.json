They want it sorted into categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and more. The text is quite garbled, referencing things like submitting, statuses, assignments, and senior engineers. It could potentially fit under \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Access.\" I'll have to parse through the content carefully to determine the most relevant category for this ticket.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ve assessed the IT ticket details, and it doesn\u2019t mention hardware, HR, admin rights, or purchases. The phrases \"export word\" could refer to exporting to Word, while \"upload feedback\" suggests something internal. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The ticket seems to describe a workflow issue related to submissions and statuses, which makes \"Internal Project\" the most fitting option. I should respond with a JSON object setting the category to \"Internal Project.\"**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with the category value in a specific format, which is a JSON object. The format requires a \"type\" set as an object and \"properties\" that include the \"category.\" I\u2019ll confirm that the allowed categories are listed, and we need to select one. The system message asks for the IT ticket to be categorized. I\u2019ll finalize my response by crafting a clean JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} without any extra text."
