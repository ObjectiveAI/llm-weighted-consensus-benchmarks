The user's string mentions \"leavers interns,\" \"forms,\" \"creating accounts,\" and \"hardware.\" It seems to involve HR and Access issues. I will choose a category that best fits the ticket's context, likely leaning towards HR Support and Access. Let's make sure it\u2019s properly categorized!**Determining the IT ticket category**\n\nI notice multiple mentions of \"interns,\" \"forms,\" \"leaver process initiated,\" and \"create accounts.\" This strongly suggests user provisioning or deprovisioning, with the \"leaver process\" pointing to HR-related access issues. While I could consider \"Administrative rights\" due to hardware deployment mentions, the ticket's primary focus is on interns and account access. The best category here is \"Access,\" as it encompasses provisioning and offboarding for leavers. I'll classify the ticket and return it in JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Formatting the response**\n\nThe interface requires a category object as specified in the schema. Since the prompt is asking me to categorize an IT ticket, I need to respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll ensure proper capitalization, as the category enum includes \"Access.\" I want to make sure there\u2019s no extra text involved, so I will format it precisely. Let's go ahead and deliver that response!"
