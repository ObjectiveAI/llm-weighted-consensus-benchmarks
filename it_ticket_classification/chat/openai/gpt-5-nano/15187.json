The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket mentions moving a conference room system, which suggests that \"Hardware\" could be the right category since it involves hardware relocation. It might also fit under \"Internal Project\" if it's considered a project. I'll format the response as a JSON object.**Finalizing category response**\n\nI think we should respond with the JSON object: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}` since it fits best for moving a conference room system. I considered \"Administrative rights\" if they needed permission, but that's not likely. \"Miscellaneous\" could work too, but \"Hardware\" is the top choice because it involves hardware relocation. I'll make sure to keep it as a pure JSON object without any extra text so it's exactly what\u2019s needed. Let's finalize with just the JSON: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`."
