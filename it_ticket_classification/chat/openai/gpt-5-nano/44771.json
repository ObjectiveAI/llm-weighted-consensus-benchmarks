This lack of clarity makes it tough to categorize, but it seems related to Access since it discusses someone accessing an older system. I\u2019m trying to focus on key phrases that might indicate the right category here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI think this ticket fits into the \"Access\" category since it discusses an access issue and mentions something being decommissioned last weekend. It could also relate to an \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s about integration, but I believe \"Access\" is the best fit. I need to respond with the category in the required JSON format, so I'll go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nThis keeps it clear and straightforward!"
