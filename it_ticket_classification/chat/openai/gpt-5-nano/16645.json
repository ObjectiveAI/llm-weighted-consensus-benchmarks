The options available for categorization are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nI'll parse the ticket's content to determine the most appropriate category and then format my response as a JSON object with the selected category property. This should help in logging the installation effectively!**Interpreting IT Ticket Content**\n\nThe message seems focused on a purchase order (PO) related to logging installation, with mentions of a Yale engineer and an administrator. Repeated references to \"PO\" suggest it fits best under the \"Purchase\" category since it's about a procurement process and installation logging. Although it could also relate to \"Internal Project\" due to the installation context, the explicit mention of the purchase order strongly indicates that \"Purchase\" is the appropriate choice for categorization.**Outputting JSON for Category**\n\nI need to create a JSON object for the category based on our conclusion that it should be \"Purchase.\" The specified format in the schema shows that we need to adhere to the structure provided. \n\nSo, I'll keep it simple and output the JSON directly without any extra commentary. It will look like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nLet\u2019s go ahead and deliver that!"
