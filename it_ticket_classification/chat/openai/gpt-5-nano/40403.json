Let's get this organized and make sure it\u2019s accurate!**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize this IT ticket, which seems to focus on approval workflows and permissions. The phrases like \u201capproval not visible\u201d and \u201conly one stages approval\u201d suggest it aligns with \"Access\" or possibly \"Administrative rights.\" Given that it\u2019s about visibility and access to approvals, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" as the best match. Now, I need to format this as a JSON object with the category field. Let\u2019s produce that final answer!**Finalizing IT ticket response**\n\nThe user\u2019s input has multiple lines, but since my task is to categorize the ticket, I've determined that the appropriate category is \"Access.\" So, my final response is straightforward: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Now, I\u2019m ready to respond with this information! Keeping it simple and clear is important here. Let's go ahead and provide that response to the user."
