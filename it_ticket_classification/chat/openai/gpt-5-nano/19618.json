The content includes terms like \"wallet,\" \"git,\" \"jobs,\" and making separate repositories, which gives a hint of a project request related to that. It seems to also mention elements like Android components and user access rights. Overall, I think this ticket best fits under \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Access,\" but it could be a bit messy.**Evaluating IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm evaluating the appropriate category for this IT ticket. It seems to lean toward \"Internal Project\" since it's about creating separate repositories related to components such as \"wallet,\" \"Android,\" and \"jobs.\" There's also a mention of \"rights\" and adding users later, which suggests a need for access control, linking it to \"Administrative rights.\" Although it could touch on \"Storage\" because repositories store information, I believe \"Internal Project\" captures the essence of this request best since it focuses on project-related tasks.**Preparing IT Ticket Category**\n\nSince the user\u2019s request involves creating repositories and managing user access, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Internal Project.\" It fits best because the primary task is setting up repositories for components like \"wallet,\" \"Android,\" and \"jobs.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could also work, the focus seems to be on the project. I\u2019ll be sure to form a valid JSON response: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. I want to ensure it\u2019s properly formatted so that everything is accurate!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
