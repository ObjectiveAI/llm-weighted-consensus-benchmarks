The instructions show a schema with categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and so on. The text seems unclear but includes phrases like \"call to action\" and mentions possibly updating code. It might fit \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I have to carefully parse the information to determine the best category, as it appears somewhat jumbled. Let's figure this out!**Analyzing software task**\n\nThis seems like a software development task focused on updating code, adding a user to a project, and creating a call to action. I could categorize it as \"Internal Project\" since it relates to project management. However, if it's unclear, \"Miscellaneous\" might fit. The mention of \"add user\" raises possibilities for \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The wording in the ticket hints at a coding task too, suggesting there's some code that needs updating. Let's clarify which category fits best!**Generating JSON response**\n\nThis task clearly relates to software development, and \"Internal Project\" seems like the right category. I need to format the response as a JSON object, using the exact schema provided. The instruction mentions a category enum, so I should just output {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} without any extraneous content. It looks like the system expects just the JSON category, so I'll ensure it\u2019s valid and respond accordingly. Alright, let\u2019s go with that!"
