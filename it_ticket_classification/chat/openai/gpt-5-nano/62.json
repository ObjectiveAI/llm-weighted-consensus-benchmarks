But it\u2019s often part of timesheet systems. The mention of needing permission to reset a time card might tie it to \"administrative rights.\" The user says \"hi guys please card period thank application engineer,\" which suggests they might be referring to the time card period. While \"Access\" could apply, it doesn't seem like there's an access issue here. I believe HR Support is the best category to use.**Categorizing an IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m reflecting on the user\u2019s request: \"reset time card card hi guys please card period thank application engineer.\" The grammar is a bit off, but it seems like they want to reset a time card, and \"card period\" likely refers to the relevant time period. The mention of \"application engineer\" suggests that this ticket is meant for them. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they need permission, \"HR Support\" fits best since it relates to payroll. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support.\"{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
