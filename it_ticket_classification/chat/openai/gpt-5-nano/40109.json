The user's ticket mentions issues with approving timesheets in Oracle, likely related to access rights. It's somewhat unclear, but it seems they are a line manager needing assistance to proceed. Based on this, I\u2019m thinking the appropriate category might be Access or possibly Administrative rights, since it appears they can\u2019t approve timesheets due to permission issues.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket is about Oracle application timesheet approvals, so it likely requires checking access or permissions related to Oracle. The \"Access\" category fits since it revolves around the ability to perform a function. While \"Administrative rights\" is also a permissions issue, it typically implies a higher level. This situation isn't related to hardware, storage, or purchases. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll present the output as a JSON object containing this category: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
