The message mentions busy slots, free/busy information, and needing a fix. It sounds like an access or permissions issue with the calendar system. \"Access\" seems like the most fitting category since it relates directly to calendar permissions. However, it could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" if it pertains specifically to permissions for visibility. Overall, I\u2019m leaning toward \"Access.\"**Determining calendar category**\n\nThe user wishes to fix calendar visibility, likely related to access control or permissions for sharing the calendar. I think \u201cAccess\u201d is the right category, or possibly \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d if it deals with permissions to view the calendar. The ticket specifically mentions \u201ccalendar visibility\u201d and \u201cfree busy information,\u201d indicating it\u2019s about showing busy slots. Given that context, I will categorize it as \u201cAccess\u201d and prepare to respond with the JSON format required: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
