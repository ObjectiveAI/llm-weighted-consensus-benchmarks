The ticket relates to HR support, particularly time tracking and timesheets. There's an \"HR Support\" category available, which fits well since the ticket involves direct reports, maternity leave, and record updates. So, I\u2019ll format the response as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It seems straightforward since they specifically asked for a categorization.**Outputting JSON Category**\n\nI need to produce a JSON object that specifies the category according to the given schema. It seems the format should definitely include just the category value, like: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. The key here is to respond strictly with that JSON object and without any extra text. It's important to ensure I meet the format requirements exactly, so I'll go ahead and present it just like that: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
