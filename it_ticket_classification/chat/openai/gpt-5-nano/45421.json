The text suggests they're having trouble submitting something because a \"pass section\" isn\u2019t filled out. They mention that they marked part of the plan but can't submit without completing this section. It leads me to think this might be an access or permissions issue. Based on the provided categories, I\u2019ll likely classify this ticket under \"Access\" due to the issues with submission requirements.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this ticket. It could fit into \"Access\" because it involves submitting a plan that needs specific access rights. Alternatively, \"Administrative rights\" might work if the user is missing admin privileges to submit. The mention of a \"pass section\" suggests a password requirement might be at play. They also refer to wanting a \"plan for approval,\" which could link to \"Internal Project.\" Overall, I\u2019ll probably classify it under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Internal Project\" is also a possibility.**Finalizing category determination**\n\nI need to decide the best category for this ticket, as it involves submitting a form and having issues with required fields, particularly the password section. This sounds like an \"Access\" issue or possibly \"Administrative rights,\" but since it seems to hinge on form submission rather than blocked access, \"Access\" fits better. The user wants to resolve this and submit a plan for approval. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and prepare to return the JSON object accordingly. \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
