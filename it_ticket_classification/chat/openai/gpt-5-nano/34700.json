The options I have are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given that it involves server performance, \"Hardware\" seems to fit well, but \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could also apply. The existing categories might not perfectly match, but I\u2019ll make my choice.**Finalizing category response**\n\nSince the ticket involves memory, CPU resources, and performance issues on an Azure Windows Server, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" This makes sense because it directly relates to server resources. The ticket also requests help with the investigation, reinforcing this categorization. I should respond with a JSON object for clarity, following the given format. Therefore, my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It seems appropriate to stick to the straightforward response the instructions ask for."
