I need to look through the text content carefully to figure out which category it fits best. This is all about matching the issue with the right classification to ensure smooth handling. I'll focus on understanding the context to make the right call!**Analyzing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user provided a complex text regarding an \"approval flow error.\" It seems to be about submitting direct reports for weekly approval, with mention of maternity leave and the need to update records. Given the focus on HR processes, I'd say the most fitting category here is HR Support, since it involves managing employee absences and records. Access doesn't quite seem relevant, so I'll stick with HR Support for this ticket.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm deciding on the best category for this IT ticket. HR Support seems to fit best because it's focused on direct reports, weekly submissions for approval, and considerations for maternity leave. While Administrative Rights and Internal Project might also come to mind, they don't match this case as well. I need to format my output as a JSON object, specifically structured with the category \"HR Support,\" ensuring it's part of the required format.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
