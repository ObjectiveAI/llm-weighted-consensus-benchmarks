The instructions say to produce a JSON-like object, using the format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. So, I'll make sure to only output this JSON without any additional text. I briefly considered other categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but they don't seem to fit as well as \"Purchase.\" Let's respond with just the JSON.**Classifying the message**\n\nI'm looking at the content: it seems messy and might be prompting for classification. The key seems to relate to \"oracle requisitions\" and the notion of purchase orders, which suggests that the appropriate category here is \"Purchase.\" So, I\u2019ll go ahead and output this as a JSON object. It\u2019s straight to the point, no unnecessary fluff \u2014 just what the user likely needs! Let's finalize that JSON."
