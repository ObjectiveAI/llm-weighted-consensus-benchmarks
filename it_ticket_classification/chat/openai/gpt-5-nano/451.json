The key points are about a pushed-back start date, completion of forms, and joining New York. \n\nFrom the available categories, it looks like it's not related to hardware, storage, purchase, or internal projects. It seems to fit best under \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Access\" due to the onboarding context. I think \"Access\" might be the most appropriate choice.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm trying to categorize this IT ticket and think it might involve provisioning access and onboarding tasks. \"HR Support\" is specifically listed as a category, and it fits since the ticket discusses start date updates and completion of starter forms, both of which are HR-related.\n\nAlthough \"Access\" could work too since it involves enabling access, \"HR Support\" seems like the best match overall. I\u2019ll respond with the appropriate JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
