The categories are [\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", \"Administrative rights\"]. Since it involves HR-related changes, the best fit seems to be \"HR Support.\" However, it could also be classified under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" depending on whether it involves system permissions. It looks like \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate choice here.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned something that prompts me to categorize the IT ticket. According to the system's instruction, I need to respond with a JSON-like object that specifies the category. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" since it's related to permission changes for the annual leave approver. However, since it's an IT ticket, I wonder if \"HR Support\" might be better. Still, I'll go with \"Access\" because it fits the permission aspect directly. So, I\u2019ll format my response as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
