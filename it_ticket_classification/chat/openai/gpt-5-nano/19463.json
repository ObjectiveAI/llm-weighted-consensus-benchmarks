The phrases indicate it's about a \"mobile phone protection case replacement.\" Given that it's about a protective phone accessory rather than a full phone replacement, it seems to fit into either \"Hardware\" since it's a device accessory, or possibly \"Purchase\" if they're ordering a new one. I'll determine which category aligns best with the content provided.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nIt looks like this ticket is about the replacement of a mobile phone protection case, which means it\u2019s primarily a hardware accessory. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" I need to format my response as JSON, which will include the key \"category\" alongside the value \"Hardware.\" Keeping it concise is important for clarity. Alright, I'm ready to produce the output now!"
