Typically, access issues arise when users need permissions tied to their accounts. The message hints that there was a problem booking rooms on Wednesday, but the core request is for permission to book any meeting rooms. So, categorizing it as \"Access\" fits best. I'll format the answer as a JSON object with the proper structure: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Providing the category response**\n\nThe system provided a schema for the category object. In prior tasks, I noticed we should only output something straightforward like {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's essential to stick to the allowed categories, and \"Access\" is definitely one of them. Since the instruction emphasizes categorizing the IT ticket, I'll keep my response concise and focused on just the category. So, my final answer will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, and I\u2019ll proceed with that."
