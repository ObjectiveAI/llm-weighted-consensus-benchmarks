I think the best fit for this ticket is \"Hardware\" because it centers around equipment transfer. I'll output this as a JSON object with the appropriate category.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nIt seems that \"Transfer request - hardware\" indicates an asset transfer. The categories available include \"Hardware\" and others like \"Administrative rights.\" The phrases like \"transfer,\" \"hardware,\" and \"bench\" all suggest this is about transferring hardware. While there are references to an \"attached form\" and clients being canceled, the main focus appears to be the hardware transfer. Therefore, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware\" and respond with the required JSON object."
