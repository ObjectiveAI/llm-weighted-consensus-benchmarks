The relevant categories include \"HR Support\" and \"Access.\" The ticket discusses a maternity leaver form and Oracle account access, which leans towards the \"HR Support\" category since it involves HR processes. However, since it also concerns account access, I might consider the \"Access\" category as well. Ultimately, I need to pick the best fit.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nThe content is focused on HR processes and access to Oracle during maternity leave. I see the category options are \"Access\" and \"HR Support.\" Since the ticket discusses the Oracle account and mentions a \"maternity leaver form,\" it seems to pertain to modifying access when someone goes on maternity leave. Although \"HR Support\" might fit, I think \"Access\" is the best choice here. So, I need to provide a JSON object categorizing this as \"Access.\" Here's what it should look like:\n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Access\"}}"
