This points me toward the \"Access\" category, but \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant since permissions might be involved. Ultimately, it seems the ticket falls under the \"Access\" category more directly.**Determining access issues**\n\nIf the user is unable to access Oracle or run the report due to a permission issue, I need to categorize it correctly. The message indicates they require access to Oracle for a project cost report, emphasizing its importance and noting they encountered errors while running the report. This suggests two situations: needing access and facing an error when running reports. While both \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" could apply, the focus here is on system access, leading me to select \"Access\" as the appropriate category. I'll prepare a JSON object with the \"category\" value.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
