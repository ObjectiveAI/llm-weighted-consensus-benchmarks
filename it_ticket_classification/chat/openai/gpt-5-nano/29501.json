The ticket seems chaotic and pertains to migration information related to files, site owners, and deadlines. \n\n\"Storage\" could be relevant due to mentions of file transfer, while \"Internal Project\" might fit if it focuses on internal migration. \"Access\" could be a possibility, but \"Administrative rights\" seems unlikely. I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since it's about a migration project. However, \"Storage\" is also a reasonable option.**Parsing migration content**\n\nI need to parse through a rather chaotic message about migration information for Friday PM. It mentions site owners, file transfers, old sites, and unclear instructions. The whole message focuses on the migration process, with requests for clarification, feedback about file uploads, and deadlines for transferring files. There are concerns about moving beyond the beta phase and needing to upload files soon. Overall, it seems centered on the logistics of transitioning sites and related deadlines.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think the best category for this IT ticket is \"Internal Project,\" given its focus on migration. However, there's a chance \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it involves site owners and access rights, though that's not clear.\n\nWhile \"Access\" is mentioned, it seems less accurate because it's not about login or access issues. \"Storage\" does fit some aspects like file transfer, but the project's core is migration. So, I'll respond with the format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} to comply with the required schema!**Clarifying category output**\n\nI see that the prompt indicates I need to provide a category label in a specific format. The expected output could be something like {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}, aligned with the JSON schema provided. \n\nI should double-check other possibilities, like \"Storage,\" since the ticket discusses file transfer and storage. However, the main focus remains on migration, which suggests \"Internal Project\" is more accurate. I need to keep it concise, ensuring compliance with allowed categories while highlighting that the ticket centers on an IT migration.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
