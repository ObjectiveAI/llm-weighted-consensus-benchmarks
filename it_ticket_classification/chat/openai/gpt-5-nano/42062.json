The user mentions they can't submit past timecards, which seems like an HR-related issue since it's connected to timekeeping. The best fit might be \"HR Support,\" but it could also be considered \"Access\" if it\u2019s about login problems. If I'm uncertain about the classification, \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option, though \"HR Support\" feels most accurate here.**Formatting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket specifically for HR purposes. Since \"HR Support\" is one of the available options, I\u2019ll format the response in JSON as required. The prompt indicates that it should follow a specific schema, which includes \"HR Support\" with proper capitalization. So, I\u2019ll make sure to present the category exactly as specified without any extra text. This leads me to output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Let's do that!"
