The ticket clearly mentions both of these items, which fall under \"Hardware.\" However, since it also involves requesting these items, it could fit into the \"Purchase\" category. It's a bit tricky to decide which category is more appropriate: \"Hardware\" for the items themselves or \"Purchase\" because they are being requested.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user's text \"network cable and laptop backpack request\" suggests they're asking for items to be purchased or provided. I think it\u2019s best to categorize this as \"Purchase\" because it\u2019s clearly a request for hardware items. I'm planning to respond with a JSON-like object. I want to make sure it\u2019s formatted correctly as {\"category\":\"...\"} and that \"Purchase\" is the most fitting choice. I\u2019ll confirm this is a valid JSON object before finalizing."
