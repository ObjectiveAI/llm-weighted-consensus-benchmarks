The ticket talks about \"po template changes\" and seems to refer to Purchase Order template changes. So, I think the category should be \"Purchase.\" There's also mention of things like \"Mandatory po\" and \"po reference quoted invoice order avoid delays,\" which supports that. I should respond with a JSON object, formatted correctly to reflect this category. The user may expect just the category name, but I need to stick to the specified JSON format.**Finalizing response**\n\nI need to keep my response clear and focused, so I\u2019ll just provide the JSON object directly. I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It's important not to add extra content since the user expects a straightforward answer. Delivering the response in this simple format should meet their request perfectly, so I\u2019m ready to send it. Let\u2019s make sure it\u2019s clean and to the point!"
