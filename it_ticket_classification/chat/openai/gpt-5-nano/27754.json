The message seems focused on forms, new starters, and interns, making it likely HR-related. Since there's no specific HR category, I think \"HR Support\" best fits. The references to \"starter form,\" \"interns date,\" and requests for help indicate it's about onboarding. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support.\"**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI'm dealing with an IT ticket that seems more related to HR processes. While it could fit under \"Access,\" since there's no mention of access rights or passwords, that seems off. The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket involves onboarding forms, which leads me to think \"HR Support\" might be the best fit. However, if it's unclear, I could also consider \"Miscellaneous.\" I need to choose the most appropriate category based on the content.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThis request revolves around onboarding forms for new starters and interns, with a plea for help filling them out. There's no technical issue mentioned, just forms and attachments. I can see this fitting as \"Administrative rights,\" if they need these forms filled out before starting, but \"HR Support\" makes more sense since it's related to onboarding. The instruction is clear: categorize the ticket with a JSON format, like {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. So, I\u2019ll confidently classify this as \"HR Support\" while keeping it straightforward.**Formatting the response correctly**\n\nI need to make sure the output matches the required format exactly. They want a JSON-like object with just the category value. According to the instructions, I should output it as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I want to be precise, so I'll make sure it fits their specifications. I'll go ahead and provide that categorized response in the appropriate format. This should keep everything neat and straightforward!"
