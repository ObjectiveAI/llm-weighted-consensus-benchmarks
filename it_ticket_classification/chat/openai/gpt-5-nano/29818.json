The ticket mentions problems with Outlook, search features not working, and attempts to delete mails and clear the mailbox\u2014for potential mailbox size increases. Given this context, I think \"Storage\" is the most fitting category since they are primarily asking for help with increasing mailbox size. \"Miscellaneous\" might also work, but it seems storage-related overall.**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nThe main issue here is related to mailbox storage and the request to increase the mailbox size, so the appropriate category is \"Storage.\" I should respond with a JSON format following the provided instructions for categorization. It looks like I need to structure it as:\n\n{\"category\": \"Storage\"}\n\nI think it's straightforward, and I'll just deliver that JSON response without any extra notes since the task is clear. It fits the allowed categories perfectly!"
