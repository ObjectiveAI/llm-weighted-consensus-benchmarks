They mention things like \"notifications\", \"feedback link\", and \"footer that opens browser\". It sounds like there are several issues\u2014maybe relating to behavior with the feedback link? I\u2019m considering options, like \"Miscellaneous\" because the message is unclear. \"Access\" might fit if it\u2019s about notifications not showing. I\u2019m trying to get a clear category for this ticket based on their information.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket based on the user\u2019s message. It might fit \"Internal Project\" if it concerns an internal app feature. The options include categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Since there's mention of notifications and a feedback link opening an external browser, it could lean towards \"Miscellaneous\" due to uncertainty. I should choose a category and provide my reasoning based on what they mentioned, particularly about the feedback link.**Choosing category for ticket**\n\nI\u2019m trying to decide how to categorize this IT ticket. It might fit \"Internal Project\" since it's related to an in-house system. \"Administrative rights\" isn\u2019t applicable, as there's no mention of rights. \"Access\" would pertain to login issues, which don't seem relevant. \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a safe option. I\u2019ll provide a recommended category and maybe a note. The output should be in JSON format, like: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}, but \"Internal Project\" could work if it's about notifications. I'll go with the best fit!**Categorizing unclear ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the garbled message: \"new its notifications give me feedback.\" I think it might refer to \"new IT's notifications.\" The next part about the \"feedback link\" in email or footer that opens a browser is tricky because it seems some users are having issues with it. Since it\u2019s unclear, the safest category to choose is \"Miscellaneous.\" I might also suggest a note about a possible issue with the feedback link but will focus on delivering just the category for now.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nThe prompt clearly states, \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" and requires me to output a JSON object with the \"category\" property. I\u2019ll go with {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} as the safest choice since the information is unclear. While \"Internal Project\" could also work, I feel it\u2019s better to stick with \"Miscellaneous\" given the ambiguity. I could ask clarifying questions, but since the user just needs the category, I'll keep it simple and provide exactly that JSON output."
