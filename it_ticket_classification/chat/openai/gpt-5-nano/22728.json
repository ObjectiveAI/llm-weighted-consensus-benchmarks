There are several options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" The ticket is about a wallpaper roll-out and screen resolutions. It could fit \"Internal Project\" since it involves updating wallpapers related to digital communications. Alternatively, I considered \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative Rights,\" but \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit overall.**Confirming IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket could be categorized as \"Miscellaneous,\" but if I dig deeper, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit. I considered \"Hardware\" since it mentions screen resolutions, but that doesn't apply since it's not about hardware changes. Other categories like \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" and \"HR Support\" don't fit either. The ticket clearly relates to a project about wallpaper rollout, so I'll categorize it accordingly. I plan to respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
