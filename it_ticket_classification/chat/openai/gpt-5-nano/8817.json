Typically, IT tickets related to hardware procurement land in one of these two categories, so it\u2019s a matter of which one suits it better.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe request is to log replenishment of hardware, with phrases like \"receive near future\" and \"admin phone.\" This doesn't fit HR, Access, or Administrative rights categories. It also isn't related to Internal Projects or Storage. The focus is on replenishment and order numbers, which typically ties back to inventory for hardware items. Since the ticket mentions peripherals, it fits under the \"Purchase\" category best. I just need to respond clearly with the appropriate JSON format.\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket. I see references to hardware items like monitors and various peripherals, suggesting it relates to stock replenishment. The system has categories \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase,\" but the ticket leans towards requesting to purchase or receive items, especially with phrases like \"log replenishment.\" This indicates a procurement process, so \"Purchase\" is the most appropriate category. I'll respond directly with the JSON format.\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
