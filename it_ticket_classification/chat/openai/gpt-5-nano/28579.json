The input is a bit jumbled with terms like \"port,\" \"Friday October PM,\" and \"merge.\" I'm considering \"Access\" or \"Internal Project,\" especially since \"port\" might relate to permissions or network, and \"merge\" could hint at a version control issue. This ticket feels low on context!**Determining ticket classification**\n\nThe text includes terms like \"merge,\" \"port mine,\" and \"Friday October PM.\" It feels like it might relate to porting something or asking for port access. I think the best-fitting category might be \"Access,\" since \"port\" could refer to permissions. However, there's also a chance it involves \"Administrative Rights\" or even an \"Internal Project\" if it's about a code merge. Since the ticket is quite unclear, I could suggest possible categories and ask for clarification from the user.**Creating a JSON category**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON-like object containing a category since the user didn\u2019t specify the format. The available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The text mentions \"merge,\" possibly indicating a software development context, which leans toward \"Internal Project.\" The phrase \"port mine\" might refer to \"porting,\" so categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" seems the most fitting since it relates to internal coding tasks. Alternatively, \"Miscellaneous\" is an option, but \"Internal Project\" feels more precise.**Delivering category response**\n\nIt looks like I\u2019m deciding to categorize this IT ticket as \"Internal Project\" since nothing in the text indicates rights. I\u2019ll prepare the output as a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. The user asked me to categorize, so I want to stick with just the category object without any additional text. Even though a brief note seems nice, the instruction says to follow the category schema strictly. So, I'll deliver just the requested category."
