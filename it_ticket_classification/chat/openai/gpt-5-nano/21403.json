Given that the phrase mentions \"access to planning\", it seems to fit best under the \"Access\" category. Although \"Internal Project\" might be relevant, it primarily revolves around access. So, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" for this ticket.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nFor IT ticket categorization, the \"Access\" category is for access requests, while \"Administrative rights\" relates to elevating privileges. The phrase \"contribute access to planning\" may imply adding someone to a planning document or project, possibly leaning towards \"Internal Project\" if it's about internal planning. The user requested, \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" and I need to provide an organized response, likely in JSON format containing the appropriate category. It has to conform to the required output schema.**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nI usually output something like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. However, the schema requires a JSON format with a \"category\" property that's a string. So, it would still look like {\"category\":\"Access\"} within a structured JSON object. I need to ensure that there aren't any other nuances in the request. Considering the phrase \"contribute access to planning,\" the key focus is on \"access\" and \"planning.\" Since it refers to gaining access, I confirm the right category is \"Access.\" I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
