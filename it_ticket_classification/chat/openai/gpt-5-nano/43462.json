The main issues seem to relate to changes not progressing to approval and repetitive logging of these issues. It could fit under categories like \"Administrative Rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" but I don't think it's about access. Given the details, it seems to map more closely to \"Internal Project\" as it\u2019s about the change workflow.**Deciding on IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize an IT ticket. There\u2019s the \"Miscellaneous\" category for issues that don't fit neatly elsewhere, but \"Internal Project\" is also relevant for internal projects. The text hints at a change management workflow issue, mentioning \"change not moving to approved\" and \"locale field.\" It could touch on \"Administrative rights\" if it relates to permissions, but seems more about the workflow process. Parsing this, it might be best to choose either \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Evaluating ticket categorization**\n\nI'm trying to figure out the best category for this IT ticket. The text mentions a \"locale field,\" possibly indicating something specific in the change record. The user expresses a desire for fixes, suggesting there's a bug in the change management system related to approvals and workflow. While \"Internal Project\" seems relevant, it might not fit perfectly since it\u2019s not explicitly about a project. \"Miscellaneous\" could be the safest choice, but I\u2019m still weighing my options carefully.**Deciding on JSON category output**\n\nI'm thinking about how to handle the categorization for this IT ticket. The user prompt specifies a JSON format, and while \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a safe choice, I'm considering \"Internal Project\" since the issues relate to an internal process. However, without more context, \"Miscellaneous\" feels the most appropriate. I\u2019ll prepare to output it as a JSON object with the category set to \"Miscellaneous.\" The system expects just the JSON, so I\u2019ll provide: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
