The mention of \"senior tester\" makes me think it could be about administrative rights too. I need to decide which category fits best, but it likely falls under \"Administrative rights\" or possibly \"HR Support\" based on the context.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis message seems to revolve around \"access\" or \"administrative rights,\" as it talks about making someone an owner, adding members, and a leaving owner. It likely involves permissions relating to a group or project, so \"Access\" feels like the right category. However, \"Administrative rights\" might also apply if the request includes granting admin rights. I think the core of this ticket relates to ownership within a team, making it more about group membership and access.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m weighing whether to categorize this ticket as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The user requested a JSON object for the category, so I need to provide just that. The ticket suggests changing ownership and adding members, which relates to managing permissions. Since \"Administrative rights\" seems more specific than a general \"Access,\" I think that may be the better choice. However, both categories relate to ownership and managing membership, so I need to decide which fits best overall.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
