Given the choices, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since it concerns adding locations.**Parsing project requests**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the phrases: \n\n- \"com adding new locations on job search selector\" suggests it's a request to add locations.  \n- \"Wednesday PM\" might indicate the timeline for this task.  \n- \"Hi giving heads Friday activate locations careers landing jobs selector\" isn\u2019t very coherent.  \n- The line about updating after activation indicates they want feedback once things are active.  \n- Lastly, the request for assistance with \"logging performing\" seems a bit mixed up.  \n\nOverall, this looks like a task for adding new locations to the job search selector, so I think it fits best under \"Internal Project.\"**Categorizing and responding**\n\nThis seems to be about \"Administrative rights,\" but the user is focused on activations, not access. So, I\u2019ll go with \u201cInternal Project.\u201d  \n\nI need to respond with a JSON object in the right format, based on the schema provided. It specifies a \u201ccategory\u201d field, and I believe the correct response should look like:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI just need to ensure it\u2019s valid JSON and doesn't contain any extra text. So, I'll output that directly!"
