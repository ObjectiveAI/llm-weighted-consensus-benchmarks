It looks like there are mentions of rights and codes, particularly regarding a \"new starter\". The categories available are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\", but since the message revolves around user access, I think \"Access\" is the broader and more fitting choice. I'll categorize this ticket under \"Access\" to cover the user's needs effectively.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the ticket that seems to involve a \"new starter\" and requests for rights or codes. It might be asking for access permissions related to project management. I have to choose between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since it focuses on access rights, \"Access\" is likely the best category. The format I need is a JSON-like structure, so I\u2019ll make sure to output it accordingly with the category field. I'll be ready to respond!{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m double-checking if \"Administrative rights\" might fit better since the message includes \"rights\" and \"codes.\" However, considering the phrase \"new starter,\" it suggests onboarding and typically involves access rights rather than full admin privileges. I think \"Access\" is the more suitable category here. I\u2019ll move forward with categorizing the ticket as \"Access\" and prepare it for the final output. It feels like the safest choice!"
