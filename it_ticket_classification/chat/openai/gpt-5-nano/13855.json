                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing IT Tickets**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the user's message. Their request mentions several things like \"assign to me Friday pm,\" \"expense report,\" and \"approve.\" The wording is a bit messy, which makes it tricky. It could relate to task assignments or expense report approvals. I'm thinking it might fall under Administrative rights since they might want privileges related to these actions. But it could also fit in Internal Project or Access. Let's choose carefully!**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe content seems focused on administrative tasks like expense report approvals and order assignments. It could fit under \"Administrative rights\" since it involves both task assignments and approvals. Although \"expense report\" leans towards finance, in the context of IT tickets, it appears to relate to permissions. \"Internal Project\" might also be a contender for project assignments. The mention of scheduling with \"Friday pm\" could suggest \"Access,\" but that usually pertains to login rights. I'll weigh these possibilities carefully!**Analyzing Ticket Categories**\n\nI'm considering the best category for the ticket. \"Internal Project\" might apply to tasks within IT project management, while \"expense report\" could suggest procurement. \"Purchase\" feels off since the ticket isn't about making a purchase, it's about approving existing orders. \"Administrative rights\" could relate to permission requests, but the mention of \"assign to me Friday pm\" is more about scheduling. If nothing fits clearly, \"Miscellaneous\" might work as a fallback, but I want to be sure I'm picking the best option!**Parsing the Ticket Request**\n\nLet's break down the user\u2019s message: \u201cplease assign to me Friday pm\u201d indicates a request for assignment on a specific date. The repetition of \u201cplease assign hello please assign\u201d seems unnecessary. The phrase \u201cexpense report older report did approved yet\u201d suggests they're inquiring if an older expense report has been approved. \u201cView report\u201d indicates they want to see a report, while \u201corder approve\u201d is about approving an order. This seems related to \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" as these tasks need permissions, but it might also relate to the purchasing process.**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nIt's clear that the user\u2019s request isn\u2019t about initiating a purchase; it revolves around approving an order. The part about the \"older expense report\" connects to finance, but I won\u2019t focus on that. Since they need classification, I should suggest appropriate categories, but typically, they expect just one. \n\n\"Access\" feels like the best fit because they\u2019re requesting access for assignments and viewing reports. The \"Administrative rights\" category applies to elevating permissions, but viewing reports also requires access. So I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" as the category and prepare the JSON object accordingly, which should be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nNo extra notes, just the clean category output!"
