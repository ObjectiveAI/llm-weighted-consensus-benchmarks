The ticket seems to indicate a \u201cRAM upgrade Wednesday PM at LA school.\" However, it\u2019s unclear. \n\nConsidering the options, this likely fits under \"Hardware\" since it involves a RAM upgrade. I\u2019ll proceed with this assumption while keeping an eye out for any additional context that might clarify things.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI need to choose a category for a ticket about a RAM upgrade, which is clearly a hardware issue. The timing and location are also noted, being \"Wednesday July PM\" at the LA school. While there's some ambiguity in the rest of the message, I\u2019m confident that \"Hardware\" is the right category. It might also fit under \"Purchase,\" but since it\u2019s an upgrade, I\u2019ll stick with \"Hardware.\" \n\nNow, I\u2019ll respond in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It might be smart to add a note about the RAM upgrade too!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
