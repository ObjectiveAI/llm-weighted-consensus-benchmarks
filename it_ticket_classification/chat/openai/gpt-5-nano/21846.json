The fragments suggest it could involve scheduling support, but also issues with forms not populating and requesting an option to select. Given the context, it seems like it could fit into categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or perhaps \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll analyze the content further to pinpoint the best category. It's tricky when the input is unclear!**Analyzing IT ticket content**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the content, which mentions issues like \"cannot populate by default,\" \"add option selecting,\" and \"amend details.\" This suggests a request to modify a form for automatic detail population or selection options. While it seems related to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" it also might involve a feature flag rather than access rights specifically. I think \"Internal Project\" could be relevant if it relates to a project. The scheduling mention doesn\u2019t fit any categories. If nothing else matches, it might need to be labeled as \"Miscellaneous.\"**Selecting ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"populate by default\" and \"option selecting,\" which don\u2019t seem to relate to access. I\u2019m considering \"Administrative rights\" because it could involve requests to amend details or permissions to adjust forms. This makes sense for someone needing admin-level access to edit a form. Alternatively, it might relate to an \"Internal Project\" if this is about a project form. Since the user asked to categorize the ticket, I need to output a JSON object showing the selected category.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI believe \"Administrative rights\" is the most fitting category since the user wants to amend details and set default values, which likely requires admin permissions. I'll categorize this as \"Administrative rights.\" Now, I need to output just the JSON category object as instructed. So it should simply be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nI'm making sure not to add any extra text. This should be clear and concise!"
