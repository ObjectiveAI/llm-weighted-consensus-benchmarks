The categories provided are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the user mentioned toner for a color LaserJet Pro printer, I think \"Hardware\" fits well since it's about a supply for the hardware. However, \"Purchase\" might also work as it\u2019s a request for procurement. So, maybe \"Purchase\" could be a better fit as well.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s request is clear: they need a black toner cartridge for a Color LaserJet Pro printer in Dublin. There\u2019s a mention of \"director mob fixed zone,\" which confuses me a bit, but it seems secondary. Since they\u2019re asking for toner, not reporting an issue, we should categorize it as \"Purchase\" because it's a procurement request for consumables. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It's straightforward!"
