It's about issues with viewing Excel files and errors possibly involving browsers, like \"server address could not be found.\" The ticket seems to relate to errors in browser settings and file accessibility. The categories we have to choose from include \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Given the content, I think \"Access\" might be the most appropriate category here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis IT support ticket relates to access issues with Excel files, and I'm considering the \"Access\" category since it aligns with file accessibility concerns. The mention of \"IE\" and \"Chrome\" suggests browser-related issues, along with a typical DNS error about a server address that could not be found. I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category rather than \"Storage.\" I\u2019ll respond in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Finalizing category JSON**\n\nI need to create a JSON object for the category according to the instruction. The structure is clear; it needs to include a \"category\" string value. I'll provide the response without any extra text. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That should meet the requirements perfectly!"
