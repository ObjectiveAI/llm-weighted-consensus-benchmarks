The request mentions a \"new purchase PO,\" \"purchased ceiling TV supports,\" and a request to \"log installation.\" It seems to primarily relate to a purchase order, which aligns with the \"Purchase\" category. However, since it also involves the installation of hardware, I\u2019m considering whether to label it under \"Hardware.\" Ultimately, it looks like the best fit would be \"Purchase,\" given its focus on procurement.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"purchased ceiling TV supports,\" which falls under hardware, and requests to \"log installation\" of them. I\u2019m torn between categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" or \"Hardware.\" Although \"Internal Project\" could relate to hardware installation, the clearer focus on actual hardware makes \"Hardware\" a stronger candidate. The mention of a \"new purchase PO\" also suggests it fits into the \"Purchase\" category for procurement. In the end, \"Hardware\" seems to be the best fit because it directly involves installation.**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI believe \"Purchase\" is the right choice since the text mentions \"new purchase\" and \"PO,\" which stands for purchase order. The request is instructing to \"log installation,\" indicating that there's installation tied to the purchase of ceiling TV supports. While internal conventions might suggest categorizing it as \"Hardware,\" the emphasis on \"new purchase\" makes \"Purchase\" more suitable. So, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format required: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. Let's deliver that!"
