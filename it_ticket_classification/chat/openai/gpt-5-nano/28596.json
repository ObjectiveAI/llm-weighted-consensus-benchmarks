The ticket talks about a \"new migration,\" which involves transferring an old site and managing content on a hub. It mentions important tasks like uploading files, access rights, and deadlines for the transfer. I\u2019m considering classifying it as an Internal Project, Storage, Access, or Administrative Rights.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket asks for advice on migrating an old site, including access, editing rights, uploading files, archiving content, deleting files, and site transfer. I need to figure out the best category for this request. \u201cInternal Project\u201d feels like the best fit since it revolves around project management and site migration. However, \u201cAdministrative Rights\u201d could also work because it involves editing rights. While \u201cStorage\u201d might seem relevant, it\u2019s more focused on content management rather than just storage.**Finalizing category output**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"editing rights\" and \"upload files,\" which makes me consider categorizing it as \"Administrative Rights\" due to the access and permissions involved in the migration. However, since it\u2019s clearly a migration project, \u201cInternal Project\u201d feels more fitting. The request is to categorize the IT ticket succinctly, so I\u2019ll format my answer as a JSON object specifically for the category. I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} to keep it clear and direct! Let\u2019s ensure that\u2019s in lowercase.**Delivering category**\n\nI see that the enum specifies \"Internal Project\" with capital letters for both words, so I\u2019ll stick to that format exactly. It might be nice to ask if they\u2019d like alternatives, but the instruction is clear: just provide the category. So, I\u2019ll make my response straightforward without extra fluff. I\u2019ll simply deliver the category as requested, which keeps things concise and to the point!"
