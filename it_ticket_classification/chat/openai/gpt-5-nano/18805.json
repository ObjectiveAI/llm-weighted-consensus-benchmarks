It sounds like it could fit under \"Internal Project\" since it involves project management. However, if the request pertains to access or permissions, it might also qualify as \"Administrative rights.\" If it\u2019s not clear, I could lean toward \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll make sure to map it correctly to one of the allowed categories!**Classifying the issue type**\n\nWhen I see \"additional issue type,\" it often relates to project management adjustments. In this case, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best fit since it's about a specific project. The mention of wanting to add \"improvement\" reinforces this. If the user were asking for access, \"Administrative rights\" could also work, but it seems more like an internal change. If unsure, I could default to \"Miscellaneous.\" For now, I'll present the result as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Creating the final response**\n\nI need to focus on delivering the final output as a JSON object. I\u2019ll specify the category as \"Internal Project,\" making sure the value is exactly as it should be, including the space. I want to keep the response clear and without unnecessary information. This way, it\u2019s easy for the user to understand. So, I'll confirm the output is simply: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} to be direct and precise!"
