The user expressed a desire to obtain these items along with a request for links to instructions. It feels most appropriate to categorize this ticket under \"Purchase\" since they want to order these items. However, since it\u2019s also about hardware, I wonder if \"Hardware\" might work too. But based on the guidelines, I\u2019ll stick to \"Purchase.\"**Categorizing hardware procurement**\n\nThis is about procuring hardware and includes product documentation. I\u2019ll categorize this IT ticket as \"Purchase\" since the user is looking to acquire hardware. I\u2019ll need to respond with a JSON-like object, specifically: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. The instructions indicate that I should only return this JSON without additional commentary to prevent formatting issues. I\u2019ll make sure to double-check that capitalization matches exactly what\u2019s in the category enum. So, here\u2019s the response: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
