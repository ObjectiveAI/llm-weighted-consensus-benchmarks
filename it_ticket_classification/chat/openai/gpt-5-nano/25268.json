The ticket text is quite garbled, but it seems to reference onboarding a new employee with mentions like \"starter form\" and \"joining jersey.\" It looks like it could fit into either HR Support or Access. Since the focus seems to be on a new starter, I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as HR Support.**Selecting the IT ticket category**\n\nFor this onboarding process, I\u2019m considering the \"HR Support\" category since it relates to new starter forms. It also potentially fits into \"Access\" if it's about provisioning accounts, but the contents suggest issues with an attachment, such as a \"cannot open\" error. Given that the ticket seems focused on onboarding and assisting with starter forms, I believe \"HR Support\" is the best choice. It doesn't appear to involve hardware issues, so \"HR Support\" is really the way to go!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
