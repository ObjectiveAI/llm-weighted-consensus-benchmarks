This points to \"Storage\" as the most appropriate category, though \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could also fit. However, since it's primarily about storage quotas, \"Storage\" is the best choice. I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format now.**Preparing the JSON output**\n\nI've got to ensure my response matches the specified JSON schema, which suggests I use a structure with \"type\":\"object\" and \"properties.\" The only property I need is the \"category,\" which will be a string from the provided options. For this IT ticket, the appropriate category is clearly \"Storage.\" I need to remember that the output should be clean and minimal\u2014just the JSON object itself with no extra text. So, I'll finalize it as {\"category\":\"Storage\"}."
