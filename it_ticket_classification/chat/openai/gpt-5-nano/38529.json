The user mentions issues with a network cable that's not working, plus other cables are functioning, which suggests a hardware issue. The other categories, like \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" don\u2019t fit here. While \"Miscellaneous\" is a possibility, \"Hardware\" seems like the most appropriate choice because it relates directly to the network cabling problem. Therefore, I'll classify it as \"Hardware.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user is having wireless issues and mentioned switching cables, which leads me to lean toward the \"Hardware\" category. I need to format my response as a JSON object, as outlined in the instructions. The category options provided include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Given the circumstances, it's clear that \"Hardware\" is the right fit. So, my final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll stick to just this category since that's what the user asked for.**Delivering IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user simply wants me to categorize the IT ticket. I need to focus on providing just the JSON object and avoid any extra text in my response. So, I'll prepare the output to be strictly formatted as a JSON object. My final answer will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This way, it\u2019s clear, concise, and meets the user's request directly."
