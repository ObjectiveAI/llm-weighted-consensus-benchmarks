The mention of \"administration officer\" hints at their role. It\u2019s unclear if they need forms filled out or something else. I'll consider categories like HR Support, Access, and Administrative rights to classify this appropriately.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe content mentions terms like \"new starter,\" \"former intern,\" and \"upcoming annual leave.\" When it comes to categorizing this IT ticket, it seems like it could fit under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" particularly for setting up a new employee. The request hints at needing to provision access for a new starter. While \"upcoming annual leave\" might suggest an HR aspect, the strongest category here appears to be \"Access\" for setting up necessary logins and systems for the new employee.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering that \"HR Support\" could apply here since it involves onboarding or hiring, but typically, onboarding in IT is categorized under \"Access.\" The user mentions \"administration officer,\" which might indicate the need for forms related to upcoming annual leave\u2014perhaps the officer needs to fill them out before taking leave? I need to categorize this ticket properly, so I\u2019ll output the required JSON format with \"Access\" as the category choice.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
