It might also fit under \"Internal Project\" or \"Purchase,\" but the user mentioned assigning a currently assigned monitor. That leans towards it being an asset management type of request, although there's no specific category for that in the list. Given the context, categorizing it as \"Hardware\" feels like the right choice. I'll respond with a JSON object indicating that.**Outputting JSON correctly**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the system's requirement for a JSON object that only includes a single field, \"category.\" Based on the schema, it seems clear that it expects something like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I just need to deliver that without any explanations. Sometimes, I worry about whether the grader wants just plain text instead, but in this case, I\u2019ll stick to the JSON format. It's crucial to ensure everything is properly formatted and no extra text is included. Let's go ahead and provide that!"
