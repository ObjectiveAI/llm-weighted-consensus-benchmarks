It mentions \"new purchase po,\" \"purchased led,\" and \"log installation,\" which all indicate it\u2019s related to a new purchase order for LED items. This strongly suggests it aligns with the \"Purchase\" category, especially since receipts are involved. However, it could also fit into \"Hardware,\" since LEDs are hardware items. Since I need to choose one category, \"Purchase\" seems like the best fit.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions several key phrases like \"purchase,\" \"log installation,\" and \"mandatory receipts,\" which indicate it's related to procurement and installation. I believe the \"Purchase\" category fits best, as it's primarily about a new hardware order and associated receipts. While \"Hardware\" could work too since LEDs are hardware, the focus on purchase orders makes \"Purchase\" the most suitable category. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Let\u2019s deliver that!"
