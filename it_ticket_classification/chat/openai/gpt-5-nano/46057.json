It's important to get this right for the user!**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the category for this IT ticket, and \"Hardware\" makes the most sense since it relates to physical connections and ports. The recommended action involves checking cable connections, which reinforces this choice. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object that looks like this: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. It\u2019s important to make sure the JSON is valid and strictly adheres to the schema provided. I\u2019m considering adding a brief justification, though the primary focus is on categorization."
