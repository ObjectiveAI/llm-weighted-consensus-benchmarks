The ticket mentions \"request configuration on side urgent,\" and it seems related to infrastructure and policy. The categories available include Access and Administrative rights, which might fit. Internal Project could also work since it involves infrastructure tasks. However, the message is quite messy, so choosing an exact category is a bit challenging. I'll need to carefully consider the context.**Determining category for JSON output**\n\nI need to determine the correct category for a JSON output based on the user's message. It mentions \"add policy,\" \"infrastructure,\" and \"upcoming holiday,\" suggesting it's related to infrastructure engineering. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit if it's about assigning privileges, the phrase \"request configuration on side urgent\" feels relevant too. After weighing the options, \"Internal Project\" seems most plausible since it aligns with infrastructure needs and policy changes. The other categories don't seem applicable here.**Formulating the JSON response**\n\nI need to determine if the ticket is about access control policy or something related to \"Administrative rights,\" which deals with permissions. The mention of \"add policy\" may suggest a security policy, though \"assign\" could relate to assigning tasks to an engineer. Given the context, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Internal Project,\" reflecting that it's about an infrastructure task. The user wants a JSON object, so I will format my response as `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}` based on the schema provided.**Generating the JSON response**\n\nThe category schema indicates that I need to provide a JSON object specifically for the category field. Based on our earlier discussions, I\u2019ll format my response as `{\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}`. This straightforward approach seems to meet the user's request, and I won\u2019t add any extra commentary to keep it concise and clear."
