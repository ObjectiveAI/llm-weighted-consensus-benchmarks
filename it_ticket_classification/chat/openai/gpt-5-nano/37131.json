It seems related to implementing security measures, software installations, and resource access. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project,\" since it focuses on access to resources and security protocols. It fits best within \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt seems the most appropriate category for this ticket is \"Access\" since it deals with resource access, login, and web access control. \"Administrative rights\" might also be relevant if admin permissions are needed for software installation. The user, an infrastructure manager, mentioned enforcing security controls that impact access to external sites. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and construct a JSON object for that. The output should be concise: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. A brief justification might be helpful as well.**Preparing IT ticket output**\n\nThe user specifically asked me to categorize the IT ticket, so I'll focus on providing just the necessary output. They want the final response in a certain format, which looks like a JSON object with the property \"category.\" I\u2019ll make sure to structure it correctly as {\"category\":\"Access\"} since that\u2019s the chosen category. Alright, I\u2019ll proceed and create that output now!"
