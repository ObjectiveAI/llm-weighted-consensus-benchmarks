Additionally, they report poor connections and frequent downtimes when logging in via mobile ID, and they're requesting advice from a senior tester.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket into one of the existing categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since the issue is about network access and login connectivity, the best fit seems to be \"Access.\" It could be considered \"Administrative rights\" if it relates to the expired certificate, but \"Access\" is more straightforward. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
