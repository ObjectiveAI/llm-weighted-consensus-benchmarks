The ticket is a bit messy, but it talks about sending notifications to MS staff, issues with a link-shortening solution, and problems related to document libraries and apps. It seems to focus mainly on access, document libraries, exploration or viewing, apps, and infrastructure issues.**Analyzing ticket organization**\n\nThe ticket is quite messy and includes various requests, notifications, and issues concerning MS staff. It mentions sending notifications, problems with link shortening, document libraries, and users unable to view documents. There's a recurring focus on infrastructure needs, app errors, and requests for updates. It's important to summarize these issues coherently to address the access problems and ensure the right support is provided. Overall, I need to clarify and categorize the key points from this jumble of information.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket and generate a JSON-like output with the right category. It appears to be primarily about \"Access\" since there are many mentions of accessing documents, login issues, and site permissions. Although it could potentially relate to an \"Internal Project\" concerning infrastructure, the references to user credentials and document library access clearly point towards \"Access.\" So, I\u2019ll prioritize that. I'll respond with a JSON object that has the category field set to \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
