The allowed categories include things like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the issue is about not being able to upload, it seems to relate to access or storage. However, I'll lean toward \"Access,\" as this seems to be the most precise category for their inability to upload due to permissions.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user has a request saying they're unable to upload a contract, highlighting a permissions issue that implies this is an access-related problem. It seems like the best fit for categorization is \"Access,\" though \"Storage\" could be a consideration. However, since the main issue revolves around their inability to upload files, I'll go with \"Access\" as the most appropriate choice.
