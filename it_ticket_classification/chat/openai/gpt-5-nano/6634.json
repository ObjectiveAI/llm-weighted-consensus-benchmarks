The available categories are \"Access\" and \"HR Support.\" It looks like the message is emphasizing urgency and suggests a mistake with \"snow termination.\" That aside, it\u2019s clear that terminating access is the primary concern here. I think \"Access\" is the best fit since it directly pertains to the employee's user accounts. Perhaps \"Administrative rights\" could be considered too, but \"Access\" seems more appropriate.**Producing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond to the IT ticket about terminating an employee's access. The content seems urgent, but since the primary focus is on deactivating access, I should categorize it as \"Access.\" The system provides a JSON object format, so my output will look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nEven though \"HR Support\" is an option, the message mainly revolves around IT operations, so \"Access\" is the right choice.
