The user describes an issue with a \"calc rule\" not working, which sounds like a software problem. The most relevant categories could be \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Hardware.\" It\u2019s important to route it to the right team. The mention of \"planning analyst\" suggests it relates to a user role, which might also help in classification. Let\u2019s figure this out!**Choosing the right category**\n\nThis ticket could potentially be categorized as \"Access\" since the user mentions they cannot run a calculation rule, suggesting there might be a permissions issue. However, it's not entirely clear. It\u2019s definitely a software problem and not related to hardware, storage, or HR. It might fit \"Internal Project\" for internal tasks or \"Miscellaneous\" for general IT issues, but \"Administrative rights\" could also apply. The user's role as a \"planning analyst\" might help clarify things. I need to pick the best category.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like the best category for this ticket is \"Miscellaneous,\" as it deals with a general software or application issue. Unfortunately, the allowed categories don't include specific options for software bugs, so \"Miscellaneous\" is the closest match. I should provide the category in a straightforward JSON format as requested by the user. \n\nI\u2019ll output it like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. This should keep it clear and concise!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
