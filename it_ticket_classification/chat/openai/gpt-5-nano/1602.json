However, if the user needs permissions to enable this, it might fall under \"Administrative rights.\" If I'm unsure, \"Miscellaneous\" could work too. I should definitely consider asking clarifying questions!**Categorizing IT ticket request**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to select the most fitting category based on the content provided. The mention of \"archiving\" and \"mailbox\" strongly suggests that \"Storage\" is the best option since it relates to storage management. There might also be a case for \"Administrative rights\" if there's a need for permissions. Since this seems to be about email archiving and cleaning tools, I'll categorize it as \"Storage\" and format my response accordingly."
