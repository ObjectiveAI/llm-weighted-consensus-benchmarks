The text is quite jumbled, mentioning the \"Oracle Project Management module not working\" and referring to different browsers. Since it seems to be a software issue, I'll lean towards categorizing it as \"Internal Project.\" However, \"Miscellaneous\" could also fit if there's no direct category for software. \"Access\" might apply if it relates to login issues, but it seems more about investigating the module itself.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket, and the closest options seem to be \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The ticket discusses the \"Oracle Project Management module,\" which indicates it's about software rather than hardware. \"Internal Project\" fits since it's related to internal tools or tasks, while \"Miscellaneous\" is a more general category. Since the issue involves investigating a bug in the Oracle module across Chrome and mobile, I'll lean towards \"Internal Project\" as the most fitting choice.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out how to categorize this ticket, and I think \"Internal Project\" fits best since it relates to an internal project management module (Oracle). The user doesn\u2019t mention login issues, so \"Access\" seems less suitable. The reference to the \"July module\" indicates it\u2019s related to project management, and it mentions the issue occurring across different browsers. I\u2019ll need to format my response as a JSON object to select the appropriate category value for clarity.**Preparing the JSON output**\n\nI need to ensure I\u2019m getting this right: the prompt asks me to categorize the IT ticket and shows a specific category structure. It looks like I just need to provide a clean JSON object with the \"category\" field. So, I\u2019ll go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI won\u2019t add any extra text or justification since the user simply requested a category. Keeping it straightforward is key here, so I\u2019ll deliver only the necessary JSON format. Let's do this!"
