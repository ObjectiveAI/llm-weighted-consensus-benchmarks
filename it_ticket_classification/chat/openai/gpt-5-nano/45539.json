The user is asking for help with logging in and mentioning that a blocker is causing issues with Safari. It sounds like they\u2019ve resolved part of the issue but need a ticket logged. Based on this, the most fitting category is \"Access,\" since it's primarily about login access. So, I'll classify this ticket under \"Access.\"**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to categorize the IT ticket based on the user's message. The issue seems tied to login problems with a browser blocker, likely related to Safari. The user specifically asked for categorization, and according to the prompt, I need to present it in JSON format. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and respond with just the category in the right format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It seems straightforward enough!"
