They want me to fit it into predefined categories like Hardware, HR Support, and others. The text hints at a request about contract extensions and notifications, which feels more HR-related than IT. I\u2019m thinking it should go under HR Support or Administrative rights, since it talks about an administration officer and requires some input. It's a bit challenging to pin down!**Assigning the IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the IT ticket and it seems to focus more on administrative tasks rather than typical IT operations. The user asked me to categorize it, and the available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and a few others. The text references \"contract extended,\" \"notified,\" and \"administration officer,\" which leads me to think it aligns more with HR Support. The \"Administrative rights\" category is too specific since it pertains to permissions, not this ticket's content. HR Support seems to be the right fit!{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
