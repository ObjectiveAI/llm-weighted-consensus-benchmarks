This indicates that it\u2019s likely HR-related, especially given the mention of onboarding. While it could involve \u201cAccess,\u201d the text doesn't specify anything about login, so that's not certain. Based on the context, I think the best category for this ticket is \u201cHR Support.\u201d It seems to fit the content best!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions terms like \"new starter,\" \"upcoming holiday,\" and \"administration officer,\" which clearly points to HR/Onboarding. Therefore, I'll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" I know I need to return a JSON object with the category field, so it should look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I considered if \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant, but I think \"HR Support\" fits best since it\u2019s focused on onboarding rather than access rights for the new starter.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nThe ticket content is a bit messy, but since the user asked me to categorize it, I\u2019ll classify it as \"HR Support\" because it relates to onboarding a new starter and an administration officer. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and provide the final JSON without extra commentary to follow the user's request. So here it is: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
