The user asked for replacement and it's clear this is about equipment. It seems to fit under \"Hardware\" because it's a request for a hardware asset, but could also be \"Purchase\" since they want a new item. Given the content, which mentions the old backpack was worn out, I'll go with \"Hardware\" for the proper classification.**Finalizing Category Assignment**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the IT ticket as \"Hardware.\" Now, I need to create the JSON object as specified in the instructions. The expected output format for the category is straightforward: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It\u2019s essential to adhere to the API\u2019s structure, ensuring no extra text is included. The allowed values include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others, but I\u2019m focusing solely on my decision for this ticket. So, here\u2019s the final output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
