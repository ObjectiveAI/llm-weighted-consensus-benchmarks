I'll make sure to do that correctly!**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI need to format the response as a JSON object according to the provided schema. The category should simply be \u201cAccess,\u201d and I must ensure it aligns with the required format, which specifies it should be a string within an enum.\n\nOkay, so the output structure is straightforward: it must just contain the category field.
