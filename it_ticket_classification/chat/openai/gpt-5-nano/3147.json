The ticket seems to be about onboarding new staff, including things like names, dates, and disciplines. It could fit under HR Support, Access (for permissions), or Administrative Rights depending on our internal taxonomy. There\u2019s also mention of file naming and disciplines, which might tie into an Internal Project aspect too.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThere's mention of joining dates and potential whereabouts for the new employee. I think the best categorization might be \"Access\" since that involves provisioning accounts and permissions for new starters. However, the text is primarily focused on names and disciplines, which could also point to \"Administrative Rights\" for creating accounts and access levels. Another option is \"HR Support\" since it's about onboarding, even though that's not common for IT categories. \"Miscellaneous\" might work if it's too ambiguous. I need to select one of these categories.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI believe \"Access\" is a strong choice for this ticket since it deals with onboarding new staff and includes creating a file with their details for access provisioning. Therefore, I need to follow the required format and produce a JSON object that simply specifies the category. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Even though it might seem helpful to provide justification, the instructions strictly say to respond with just the category in the specified schema, so I\u2019ll stick to that."
