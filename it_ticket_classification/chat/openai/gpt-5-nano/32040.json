It mentions \"new starter access to Bucharest Friday re PM NE Prima administration officer.\" It seems like a ticket request but might be shorthand. \"Access\" feels like the best fit since it involves granting new starter access, but \"Administrative rights\" could also apply due to the mentioning of an \"administration officer\". The context suggests it's about access for a new starter. I'll go with \"Access\" as the category.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT ticket. There's a mention of \"administration officer,\" which hints at the need for \"administrative rights.\" However, \"new starter access\" generally suggests it falls under \"Access.\" The phrasing implies this is for a new starter in Bucharest on Friday. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if specific admin privileges are requested, I think \"Access\" serves as a broader category. Ultimately, I'll go with \"Access\" as it's likely what the user needs.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
