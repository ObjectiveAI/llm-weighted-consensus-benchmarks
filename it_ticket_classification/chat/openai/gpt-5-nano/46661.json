The categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The user describes problems with network authentication, mentioning issues while trying to connect via cable or Wi-Fi after restarting their computer. It looks like it's primarily an access issue, so I\u2019ll probably categorize it under \"Access\" since that's a fitting label for authentication failures.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI am analyzing the user's message about their network connection issues. They mention that after restarting their computer, they can't connect via cable and face authentication problems. This clearly points to an access issue, so I think it's best to categorize it as \"Access.\" While \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights\" comes to mind, they don\u2019t fit as well. I'll respond with a structured JSON object that specifies the category as \"Access.\" Here\u2019s how the output will look.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
