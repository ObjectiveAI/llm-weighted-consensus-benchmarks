It's likely related to an Oracle application issue, possibly software-related. I should choose from the available categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and a few others. Since it's not about hardware or HR, I wonder if it fits under \"Access,\" as the error might prevent submission. Let's see!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe phrase \"when try submit\" indicates the user is attempting to submit something to an Oracle application, possibly forms submission. This situation might relate to \"Access,\" especially if they're unable to submit due to an error. However, the issue could also be within Oracle's database or ERP system. Since the options include \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" and others, I think \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit since the content is minimal and seems software-related.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nThe user\u2019s request to categorize the IT ticket points to an error when trying to submit something, possibly indicating an \"Access\" issue, but it might not be strictly about that. Since the prompt gives a schema for the response, I need to adhere to it and format my answer as a JSON object. Considering the options, \"Miscellaneous\" seems the safest choice since it captures the situation without being too specific. I'll output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
