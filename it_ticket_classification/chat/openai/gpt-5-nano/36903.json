The user mentioned a problem with job deployment and an error related to a production instance. It seems like a software deployment issue, which makes me think this could fit under either \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" Considering the specifics about job deployment, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Internal Project.\" This seems to match the ticket's content best.**Finalizing the IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ve realized that \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems to be the best fit for the IT ticket due to its focus on deployment issues related to internal software. The other categories either don't apply or are too generic. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and respond with a JSON object following the required format. It will specify the category as \u201cInternal Project,\u201d ensuring I stick strictly to the allowed fields without adding any extra text.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
