The user mentions wired and wireless issues, poor call quality, and server failures. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Hardware.\" Access seems focused on permissions, while Hardware pertains to physical devices, but that\u2019s not clearly indicated here. \"Miscellaneous\" might suit general IT problems well. Since there's no \u201cInfrastructure\u201d category, I'd lean toward \"Miscellaneous\" to capture the scope of the issues mentioned.**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the IT ticket as \"Miscellaneous\" since it deals with general connectivity issues and server failures. While \"Storage\" could be a consideration if the servers are malfunctioning, it seems less fitting. I should prepare a JSON object to respond. The user asked me to categorize the ticket, so I'll follow the expected format and include the category. \n\nHere\u2019s the response in the required format:\n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
