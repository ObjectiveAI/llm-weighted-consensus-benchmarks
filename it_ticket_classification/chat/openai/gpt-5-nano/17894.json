Given that it primarily discusses a new purchase order and items, it might fit best in the \"Purchase\" category. However, it could also relate to \"Hardware\" due to the mentioned devices.**Categorizing Purchase Ticket**\n\nThis ticket appears to be related to procurement or purchase, especially considering the phrase \"new purchase po tuesday pm,\" which signifies a purchase order. Therefore, I'll categorize it under \"Purchase.\" I need to respond with a JSON object format that specifies the category as \"Purchase.\" Following the required structure, I\u2019ll produce: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.
