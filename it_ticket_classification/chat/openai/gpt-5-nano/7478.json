Overall, it seems to revolve around implementing security and creating user accounts. I'll go with \"Access\" as a fitting category.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" due to the request for creating users. The phrase \"security for all users\" might imply security policies or authentication, but since it also mentions user provisioning, I lean towards \"Access.\" Typically, provisioning users fits under that category because it involves creating accounts for access. \"Access\" seems like the best choice here, as it clearly relates to both creating users and their security requirements."
