This likely relates to a UX or content issue regarding how location metadata is shown in an app. The \"Internal Project\" category could suit this, as it aligns with enhancing the location display. Alternatively, \"Miscellaneous\" might work if it doesn't fit neatly into existing categories, but \"Internal Project\" appears to be a better fit.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nIt looks like I'm evaluating different categories for an IT ticket and I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. Other categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Storage,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Purchase\" don't seem relevant here. Since the user mentioned a \"communication specialist,\" this could indicate involvement from the communications team. So, I should respond with a JSON object that categorizes it as \"Internal Project,\" but I'll just stick to delivering the category without additional text. Here's the output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}**Delivering IT ticket category**\n\nThe user's request is clear: I need to categorize this IT ticket. The category type expects just one property, so I will keep it simple and deliver the JSON with no extra text. Based on the content about location tagging and improving its presentation, \"Internal Project\" fits best. Therefore, my output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nI\u2019ll stick to this straightforward response as instructed!"
