It might relate to HR support or possibly access or administrative rights. The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the content, I think a reasonable choice would be either \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" I should definitely clarify if needed!**Parsing IT ticket details**\n\nI\u2019m breaking down the request here. The phrase \"hr specialist\" indicates it\u2019s related to HR, and \"view salary\" suggests it concerns HR data. Then there's \"oracle,\" which likely refers to the Oracle software system, possibly an HR module. The term \"friday location\" might indicate a specific place of work for that day\u2014or something puzzling like \"located Friday.\" The user seems to want help categorizing the IT ticket, so it\u2019s time to choose a fitting category!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI have a set of categories to consider: Hardware, HR Support, Access, and a few others. This ticket seems focused on HR data (salary) and Oracle, which leads me to think \u201cAccess\u201d could be fitting, especially if they need permission to view salary information. Since it's more about IT access rather than HR's tasks, \u201cAccess\u201d feels right. The content likely relates to permissions, so I'll go ahead and categorize it as \"Access\" in the JSON format!**Formatting the response**\n\nThe prompt is clear: I need to provide the category in a specific JSON format. The desired output schema has a category field, so I\u2019ll format my response as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. While it might be nice to give a rationale, the instructions don\u2019t require one. Since the ticket centers on IT and \"view salary\" in Oracle, \"Access\" fits best. I\u2019ll ensure the JSON is correctly escaped and organized. Returning it now, I feel confident in this choice!"
