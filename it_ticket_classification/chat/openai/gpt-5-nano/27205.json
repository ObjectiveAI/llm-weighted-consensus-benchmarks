The text discusses a \"completed starter form\" and mentions \"head testing mob,\" which seems to refer to a new hire in October. This likely relates to HR Support since it's about onboarding. I'll structure the output in JSON with the appropriate category field, choosing \"HR Support\" based on what fits best from the options provided. Let's finalize that!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nIt looks like this ticket is centered on HR and onboarding, with terms like \"new starter\" and \"completed starter form attached.\" This likely means it's related to setting up accounts and access for a new employee. The category options include \"HR Support,\" which fits well for onboarding, and \"Access,\" which would pertain to user access privileges. Given it's specifically about new hires and attached forms, I believe \"HR Support\" is the best category for this situation.**Parsing IT ticket details**\n\nThe IT ticket categories usually include \"Access,\" especially for new user permissions. The phrase \"head testing mob\" is a bit confusing\u2014maybe it means the \"Head of Testing\" group. The user's message mentions a \"new starter,\" a \"completed starter form attached,\" and ends with \"regards head testing mob.\" This suggests they are submitting a form for onboarding a new employee. I think \"head testing mob\" may refer to a mobile testing team, but I'm not entirely certain about that!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI believe the right category for this ticket is \"Access,\" since it's about a new starter and indicates that a starter form is complete, likely for provisioning access. The \"HR Support\" category pertains to onboarding forms, but this ticket is more about configuring user accounts in IT. Since the prompt explicitly asks me to categorize the ticket, I'll go ahead and output a JSON object with {\"category\": \"Access\"} as specified in the instructions. No extra text will be included!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
