Given these details, it looks like the most appropriate category is \"Access,\" as it primarily discusses permissions related to software and roles. I'll make sure to classify it correctly based on these insights!**Assessing ticket categorization**\n\nI'm noticing that the ticket focuses on access rights related to Oracle, specifically mentioning viewer roles, approvals, and license implications. It seems like the most fitting category is \"Access\" since it primarily addresses these access rights. The term \"admin rights\" appears, but it might not be in the context of requesting those rights, so I believe \"Access\" is appropriate. I'll make sure I classify it correctly based on my observations!**Deciphering IT ticket content**\n\nThis ticket text is quite garbled, but it clearly references \"access to Oracle,\" indicating it's about user permissions for the Oracle ERP or database. It mentions several key terms like \"viewer role,\" \"planner,\" \"approve,\" and \"budgeting application,\" which suggest it focuses on access rights and role creation. Given this context, the most fitting category seems to be \"Access,\" although there could be elements related to \"Administrative rights\" as well. I want to make sure I categorize it accurately!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThis ticket is discussing granting viewer roles, role creation, and access approvals, which may indicate \"Administrative rights.\" However, the categories \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" are separate. \"Administrative rights\" pertain to admin-level permission changes, while \"Access\" refers to general resource access. The request to \"create viewer role planner\" strongly hints at role creation, leaning towards \"Administrative rights.\" Ultimately, I think \"Administrative rights\" fits best since it addresses creating roles and managing permissions. I should format my response as a JSON-like object accordingly!{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
