The user's text discusses issues with task statuses and cloning problems, which really feels related to project management. It\u2019s a bit messy, but it is clear that they are experiencing an issue where tasks can\u2019t be modified. So, I think \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" might fit best. Let's clarify that to understand the specifics!**Categorizing IT ticket options**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize this ticket, which might fit under \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The main issue revolves around not being able to change a task's status, which could be due to a bug in a project management tool. It seems related to permissions, meaning \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" could be appropriate. But since it's a specific task issue rather than system access, \"Internal Project\" might be the best fit overall!**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI see that \"Administrative rights\" relates to permissions for changing task statuses, and the user\u2019s message is somewhat ambiguous. Also, since this involves a workflow issue in project management, it could fit under \"Internal Project.\" However, the focus on unresolved bugs and cloning issues leans me more toward \"Internal Project.\" The instruction is to categorize this IT ticket with one of the given categories, so I\u2019ll go with \"Administrative rights\" because it\u2019s fundamentally about task permissions.**Confirming ticket category**\n\nThe phrase \"nobody can change status task\" suggests a permission issue, so I need to categorize this ticket accordingly. I should provide a JSON-like object with the category property as specified. The categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since \"Administrative rights\" directly addresses permissions, I\u2019ll go ahead with that. My final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}  \n\nThis aligns with the user's request for categorization!"
