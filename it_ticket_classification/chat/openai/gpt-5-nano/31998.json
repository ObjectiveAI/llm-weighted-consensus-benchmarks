It refers to Oracle Fusion and mentions tasks related to a project. I\u2019m considering several categories: Internal Project, Administrative rights, Miscellaneous, or Access. The phrase \u201crequires access\u201d hints at needing access but isn\u2019t explicit. However, since it's focused on tasks for a project, it seems best to go with \"Internal Project.\" I'll lean towards that.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI see that the ticket mentions Oracle Fusion, which may refer to an ERP system integration. I'm looking at categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, and others. Since this content revolves around tasks related to Oracle Fusion, I lean towards classifying it as \"Internal Project.\" It fits best, especially with phrases like \"project does not have any tasks.\" \n\nI need to respond with a valid JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I could include a note, but the instructions emphasize just providing the category."
