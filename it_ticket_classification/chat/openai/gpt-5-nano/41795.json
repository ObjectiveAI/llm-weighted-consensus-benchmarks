The user's error in the Outbox suggests it's a permissions problem or possibly related to the Exchange/Calendar feature. Given the limited categories, \"Access\" seems most appropriate since it's about accessing a resource mailbox. However, \"Miscellaneous\" could fit too, depending on how we interpret it.**Finalizing category output**\n\nI see the user\u2019s issue could also relate to an \"Internal Project\" if it's about migration, especially since the phrase \"being moved\" suggests a resource change. However, the \"outbox shows error\" signals an email client issue. The most fitting category here is \"Access\" since it relates to booking access to a resource. I\u2019ll prepare the output as a JSON object that fits the required format: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I need to keep it clean and without extra text. Here we go!"
