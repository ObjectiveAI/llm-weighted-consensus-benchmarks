It appears they want to restrict visitor card access to a specific area on a Friday in February. The message points to access control issues, suggesting that visitor cards should still be granted for a specific tower while restricting others. Given the context, the most fitting category for this ticket would be \"Access\" since it pertains to limiting access for visitor cards.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to determine the right category for the IT ticket. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit if it involves changing permissions, this sounds more like access control, so I think \"Access\" is best. Based on the user's request, I'll provide the response in JSON format, specifically as {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text to keep it clear and concise. I just want to ensure it's valid JSON according to the schema provided. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
