They seem to need help granting updates and rights, which makes me think it's related to \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d \n\nSo, I\u2019ll format this response as a JSON object, ensuring it matches the required schema. The category will be set to \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d since it fits the context best. This should help the user effectively!**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket involves terms like \"grants rights,\" \"granting rights,\" \"Oracle,\" and \"each developer,\" implying it's about access control. I see two potential categories: \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The focus seems to be on granting admin rights to Oracle, as suggested by phrases like \"granting rights to change Oracle rights.\"\n\nGiven that it pertains specifically to admin privileges, I think \"Administrative rights\" is the more fitting category. This is because the context suggests it\u2019s about granting deeper rights rather than general access.**Outputting JSON Category**\n\nI need to output the category as a JSON object, specifically set to \"Administrative rights.\" I want to ensure it matches the required format, which specifies that \"category\" must be a property within an object.\n\nIt seems the acceptable structure is simply: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} but I do want to confirm that it's clear we're following the schema precisely. Based on the instructions, I\u2019ll go ahead and output that correct JSON format."
