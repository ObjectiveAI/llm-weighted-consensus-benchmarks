The repeated phrase \"device needed\" and mentions of various devices like \"pro plus,\" \"pixel plus,\" and \"yoga tab\" stand out. It looks like they're requesting devices or estimates. Therefore, this ticket could likely fit into the \"Purchase\" category because it revolves around requests for hardware. I just need to ensure I'm choosing the most appropriate category!**Categorizing device request**\n\nIt seems like the user wants to order or provision a device, so the categories I\u2019m considering are \"Purchase\" for procurement and \"Hardware\" for hardware issues. Given the repeated phrases about needing a \"device\" and asking for an \"estimate,\" it's clear they're requesting to acquire devices. The best fit is definitely \"Purchase,\" especially as they seem to be looking for a cost estimate. I\u2019ll go ahead and categorize it as \"Purchase\" and format the output as requested. \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
