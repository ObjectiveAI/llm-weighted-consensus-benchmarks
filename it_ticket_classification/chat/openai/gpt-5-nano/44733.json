Since the options include categories like \"Hardware,\" I\u2019ll go with that.\n\nI need to format my response as a JSON object with the category \"Hardware.\" It seems like the user expects just the category without extra explanation, so I\u2019ll keep it simple and to the point in the output.**Confirming JSON format**\n\nI'm considering the category for the IT ticket again. It clearly mentions a \"problem with monitor\" and \"colors changed,\" which reinforces that it\u2019s a hardware issue. Even though \"Display\" isn\u2019t an option, \"Hardware\" fits perfectly. \n\nI'll confirm that my response should just be the JSON with the category \"Hardware\". I just need to make sure I format it correctly, using quotes around the string and keeping it simple; no extra text is necessary."
