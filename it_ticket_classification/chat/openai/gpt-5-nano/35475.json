I'll prepare the output in JSON format, ensuring the \"category\" field reflects this choice.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m interpreting a somewhat garbled text that suggests issues with an \u201cexternal network,\u201d likely meaning internet connectivity outside the office. The user can't connect when traveling, whether via VPN or not. They seem to mention being able to send some communications but experiencing issues with calls. This seems to relate to connectivity. Considering the options, \"Access\" fits best, since it involves accessing external networks. I\u2019ll categorize this IT ticket as \u201cAccess.\u201d{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
