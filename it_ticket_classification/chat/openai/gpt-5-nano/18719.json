The ticket text indicates a request for support regarding an HR recruitment system report on active candidates, and there's a mention of a tool issue. This seems to fit under \"HR Support,\" as it directly pertains to HR data and reporting needs. I'll choose \"HR Support\" for classification.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket clearly mentions \"active candidates,\" \"report,\" and \"tool,\" which clearly aligns with HR system reporting. While it could be deemed \"Miscellaneous,\" I believe \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category. Now, I need to format my response in JSON for the system. It requires something like:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI\u2019ll ensure the capitalization is exact as required by the guidelines. The output won't need further explanation unless the user requests it. I\u2019m all set to provide just the JSON output!"
