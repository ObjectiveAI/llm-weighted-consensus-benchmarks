It mentions several important terms like \"forbidden software,\" \"internal audit,\" and \"file sharing.\" These terms suggest the ticket relates to software policy and auditing, possibly hinting at compliance issues. Given the context, the most fitting category seems to be \"Access,\" since it ties into forbidden software and its implications across different entities. Now I just need to finalize that decision!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to determine the best category for this IT ticket from a list: Access, Administrative rights, Internal Project, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Hardware, HR Support. The content focuses on forbidden software and internal audits. I think it could fit \"Administrative rights\" due to installation restrictions or \"Access\" for file access issues. However, given it's mainly about an audit report and policy enforcement, \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems most suitable. If it doesn't fully fit, \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d could be a fallback. Time to finalize it!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
