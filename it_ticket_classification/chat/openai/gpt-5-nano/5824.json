I\u2019ll return a JSON object with that category.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the user's messy request: \"project license license hello please help license process changing note old regards.\" My best guess is that it fits \"Purchase\" due to the license procurement aspect. However, if it involves admin privileges, it might be \"Administrative rights.\" Since the phrase leans towards changing a license for a project, \"Internal Project\" could also work. There's always \"Miscellaneous\" as a fallback. Ultimately, I think \"Internal Project\" may be the best fit based on the context provided.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nI\u2019m considering the ticket details that mention \"license process changing.\" While \"Purchase\" could be an option for license procurement, the internal nature of the request leads me to think \"Internal Project\" is more fitting. The required format is a plain JSON object for categorization. I\u2019ll respond with {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} since that aligns well with the context. Keeping it concise, no extra text is needed.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
