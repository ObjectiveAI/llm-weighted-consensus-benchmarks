It seems to focus on user offboarding and deprovisioning access, so I could categorize it under \"Access,\" related to user account deactivation, or \"HR Support,\" regarding employee offboarding. The tasks involve transferring mailboxes and managing roaming profiles. Although \"Administrative rights\" exists as an option, it may fit better under \"Access\" since it's clearly about access rights and permissions.**Deciding on the category**\n\nThe leaver process involves HR and IT deprovisioning, but this ticket seems more aligned with IT admin tasks since it mentions \"approver\" and \"backup pm purchase coordinator.\" I think \"Access\" is the best category because it involves managing ad rights, mailboxes, and roaming profiles. The user asked to categorize this IT ticket, so I'll choose \"Access\" as the primary category. I'll respond with a JSON object formatted as required, which looks like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
