There are also references to \"installing device\" which might suggest \"Hardware\" as another appropriate option. Overall, it makes sense to lean towards \u201cPurchase\u201d as the main category considering the focus on procurement and order details.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe primary request seems focused on managing purchase orders and receipts, with mentions of installing a device that hints at hardware involvement. I\u2019m wrestling with categories like \u201cHardware,\u201d \u201cPurchase,\u201d and \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d The phrases about mandatory receipts and administrator roles suggest this ticket might center around the procurement process. However, I think the best fit is \u201cPurchase\u201d since it\u2019s mainly about orders and receipts. Ultimately, I\u2019ll respond with JSON formatted as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
