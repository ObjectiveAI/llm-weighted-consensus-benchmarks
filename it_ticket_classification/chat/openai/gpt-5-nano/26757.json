The term \"ext mob\" might refer to external mobility, and \"administration officer\" hints at needing administrative help or rights. \n\nGiven that the text mentions a new starter, it likely involves provisioning access for them, including remote access or admin rights. Since the categories include \"Administrative rights,\" that seems to fit well here. Overall, it appears to be about onboarding processes for IT support.**Analyzing access categories**\n\nIt looks like the category \"Access\" is relevant for provisioning login and access, while \"Administrative rights\" could be important if they're requesting admin privileges. The term \"ext mob\" might refer to external mobility, but I'm not entirely sure. Asking for clarification is a good idea, but the user specifically asked for a category tag. \n\nGiven the garbled content, I think the best options are \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but if this is about a new starter, \"Access\" might be the more general choice.**Determining the category of an IT ticket**\n\nThe term \"ext mob\" might imply they\u2019re requesting an external mobile number, which usually falls under \"Hardware\" for mobile devices. If it's about provisioning a company mobile phone for a new starter, that could also be relevant. However, without an explicit device mentioned, \"mobile\" could just refer to hardware setup. \n\nSince this ticket appears associated with onboarding, I think the best category is \"Access,\" as it aligns well with access rights. I\u2019ll format my output as JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
