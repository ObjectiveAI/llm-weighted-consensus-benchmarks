The categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and more. The text mentions keywords like \"leaver,\" \"mailbox,\" and \"AD rights.\" It clearly relates to the offboarding process and handling access rights. The most fitting categories seem to be \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"HR Support.\" I need to decide on the best option among these.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket seems focused on IT access provisioning for an employee's departure. The category \"Access\" fits best since it covers access rights, mailboxes, and roaming profiles. \"HR Support\" could also work, but since the instruction is to categorize the IT ticket, I\u2019ll go with \"Access.\" \n\nI need to respond with a clear JSON-like object, formatted simply as `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I\u2019ll make sure to provide only the category without any explanations."
