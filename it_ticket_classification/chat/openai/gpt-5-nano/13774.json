The ticket mentions an \"adapter request\" and seems to be asking for an adapter related to a monitor. This suggests it's a hardware request. The predefined categories include \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" Since the user is requesting to log and assign an adapter for a monitor, it looks like it fits best under \"Hardware,\" although it could also be considered a \"Purchase.\"**Categorizing Adapter Request**\n\nI think this ticket is clearly a hardware request since it concerns an adapter. The text mentions \"adapter request\" and implies it\u2019s related to a monitor connection. While it could also fall under \"Purchase,\" since it's specifically requesting an adapter, I believe \"Hardware\" is the best fit. I should prepare a response in a JSON-like format to clearly indicate the category. The final output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Outputting Category in JSON**\n\nThe template specifies the category field as a string that must be part of an enum. Based on that, I need to ensure the output is a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It's clear and concise, without any extra text. The user has requested me to categorize this IT ticket, so I\u2019ll stick to just providing the category. I\u2019ll finalize the response as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to comply with the schema."
