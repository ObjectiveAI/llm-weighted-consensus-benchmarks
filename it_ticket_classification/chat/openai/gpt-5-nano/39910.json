They can't connect to internal sites because of an authentication failure, which clearly falls under \"Access.\" There\u2019s a chance it could also relate to \"Administrative rights\" if they need those credentials, but it doesn't explicitly mention it. Since \u201cAccess\u201d seems the most relevant, I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The system expects just the category object, so I'll keep it simple.**Confirming output format**\n\nI need to ensure that my output for the ticket categorization is valid. The category \"Access\" fits perfectly since the user is having issues accessing internal sites. I considered if \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" might apply, but the context clearly indicates it's an access issue. So, I'll stick to the straightforward JSON object without any extra text: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Keeping it simple ensures I\u2019m following the required format correctly!"
