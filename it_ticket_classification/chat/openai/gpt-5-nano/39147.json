There's also \"Access\" concerning permissions, and they mention specific code refreshing data, which might relate to an internal project. If that's the case, I could use \"Internal Project.\" However, since these categories are for an IT ticket system and we don't have a \"Software\" category, I think I'm settling on \"Miscellaneous.\"**Categorizing Excel issues**\n\nI'm looking at a message that indicates issues with Excel workbooks connected to data sources not updating. The user is trying to refresh the data but somehow isn't seeing the updates. It could relate to \"Administrative rights\" to run code, but overall, I think categorizing this as \"Miscellaneous\" is a good approach since it's a general category for software issues like Excel. The allowed list includes \"Miscellaneous,\" so I can confidently respond with that JSON format.**Outputting category format**\n\nI need to determine whether to output just the category in plain text or in JSON. The system instructions indicate using a JSON object format for the response. They specifically require the \"category,\" so I'll stick to the format we've used before: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. \n\nI suppose I could consider adding a brief note, but the prompt emphasizes that I should only categorize it. So, I'll keep it simple and produce that single JSON line."
