The API requires a JSON with a category field. The content suggests this is related to HR due to mentions of intern onboarding and attached forms. I\u2019m leaning towards \"HR Support\" because it seems most relevant. However, I\u2019ll consider that it might also connect to \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" depending on possible access provisioning for these interns.**Analyzing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT ticket about \"new interns\" since they typically need accounts and access. The text mentions forms attached, suggesting it might be about onboarding. While \"Access\" could fit if it's about accounts, it's not explicitly stated. Alternatively, \"HR Support\" seems most appropriate because it relates to the intern onboarding process. However, there's also a case for \"Administrative rights.\" I need to choose the closest category, and \"HR Support\" feels like the safest option here.**Parsing the IT ticket**\n\nI see the message mentions new interns starting on Thursday July in the PM shift, along with forms attached. This likely means the user is informing IT to set up accounts for the interns. The forms probably relate to onboarding, so I could consider \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" if admin privileges are needed. However, \"HR Support\" feels most fitting since it revolves around the interns' onboarding process. I think I'll go with \"HR Support\" to align with the purpose of the forms.**Finalizing the IT ticket category**\n\nThe content mentions \"HI interns starting forms attached,\" but it doesn't explicitly talk about systems. Since this is an IT ticket, I might lean towards \"Access\" if it's about granting system access. However, without a clear request to set up accounts, I think \"HR Support\" is the most direct category here. I\u2019ll craft a JSON response like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This keeps it straightforward and adheres to the category schema. Let's proceed!"
