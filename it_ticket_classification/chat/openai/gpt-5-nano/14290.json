The categories available include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given that the ticket mentions \"membership,\" \"add member,\" and \"approve,\" I think \"Access\" could fit well. However, \"Administrative rights\" might be more specific. I'm weighing which category fits best here.**Choosing the ticket category**\n\nThe ticket appears to focus on membership requests and approvals, which relates to access rights within a team. I need to categorize it as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The format requires a JSON-like object where I specify the category. Based on the ticket content mentioning \"add member\" and \"approve,\" I think \"Access\" is the more appropriate choice here. So, I plan to respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"} in the required format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
