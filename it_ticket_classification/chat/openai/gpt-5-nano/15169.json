I'll format my response as a JSON object with this category.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nGiven the user's IT ticket requests a hardware device, I should categorize it as \"Hardware.\" The phrase about having issues connecting might suggest an \"Access\" category due to potential network problems, but the primary focus is the request for a \"windows laptop needed for Wednesday.\" Therefore, \"Hardware\" is the best fit.
