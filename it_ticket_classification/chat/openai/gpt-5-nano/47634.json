The text includes mentions of Oracle account issues, modifying rate schedules, access card management, and employee versus internship matters. It seems to heavily focus on Active Directory and access management, which would likely place it under the \"Access\" category. However, some aspects, like the distinction between internship and full employment, could also fit under \"HR Support.\"**Classifying IT Ticket Issues**\n\nThe ticket involves IT issues related to accounts, Active Directory (AD), and credentials. Since it specifically mentions \"delete reactivate ad for access card\" multiple times, I\u2019ll categorize it under \"Access.\" The user requested that I categorize the IT ticket, so I'll respond with a JSON object that fits the specified schema. The final output should strictly follow the format: {\"category\":\"Access\"} to ensure it aligns with the required category JSON schema."
