The options include categories like Hardware, HR Support, and Administrative rights. However, the main focus seems to be on access issues. The content mentions the unavailability of project management features, leading me to conclude that the \"Access\" category is the most appropriate. While \"Internal Project\" could fit, \"Access\" feels more generic and relevant in this case.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm reviewing the ticket categories, including Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. Given that the ticket discusses enabling project management functionalities and addresses access issues, it seems clear that the \"Access\" category fits best. The instructions specify that I need to respond with a JSON object containing the category. I should format it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI\u2019ll stick to just providing that JSON without extra commentary, since that's what the user needs. Let's get this delivered!"
