The user's asking for help from a specialist. I'm considering how to categorize this ticket\u2014it could fit as \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access.\" \"Access\" pertains to permission, but this issue isn't about that. Since it's a software bug, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the best choice. But I might also consider \"Internal Project\" if this tool is part of something like that.**Categorizing the issue**\n\nThe issue at hand isn't about access denial, but rather how the form behaves. So I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the right category. According to the system guidelines, I need to respond with a structured JSON object that includes a \"category\" key.\n\nSince the ticket involves a referral system issue and uploading documents, it definitely doesn\u2019t fall under hardware, HR support, or other categories. So I'll respond with exactly:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} \n\nThis keeps everything concise and clear!"
