The mention of \"attached files\" could also imply support, and \"senior consultant\" likely refers to someone needing to be involved in the process.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI'm weighing the best category for the ticket regarding a \"new confluence space.\" It seems to fit into \"Administrative rights\" if they need permission to create the space. However, they also mentioned needing a \"senior consultant,\" which might indicate it's a collaborative effort, but still tied to admin rights. There's also a chance it could fit under \"Internal Project,\" since this space appears project-specific. Overall, \"Administrative rights\" might be the most suitable option here.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe categories include \"Internal Project,\" which fits for tasks related to internal setups. Since the request involves creating a new Confluence space, I'm leaning toward \"Administrative rights.\" This seems to be the safest choice considering the context of the ticket. I need to ensure that my response is in a specific JSON format for categorization. So my final output will be succinct and clear:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} \n\nThis keeps it straightforward and directly addresses the request!"
