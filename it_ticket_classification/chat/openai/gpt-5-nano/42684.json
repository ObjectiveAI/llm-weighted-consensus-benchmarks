The categories I have to choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It seems like I need to interpret the text carefully to decide which category fits best. This could be a bit tricky since the text is messy, but I\u2019ll do my best to make the right choice!**Interpreting the ticket**\n\nThe ticket describes that the user is unable to edit an application they sent on Wednesday. They\u2019re having issues accessing or editing it, and there's an error message attached. They\u2019ve already tried a few things like clearing the cache, restarting the browser, signing out and back in, and accessing the link again, but nothing has changed. They seem to be in a bit of a rush, hoping for a resolution before a deadline tomorrow.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering if there's a difference between being connected via WiFi and wired. The user mentioned they\u2019re currently connected but could try a cable if it helps. They really need assistance because of a deadline tomorrow related to accessing/editing an application in a web app. I believe this fits best into the \"Access\" category, rather than \"Administrative rights,\" since it\u2019s about access to editing. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and respond with the required JSON format for clarity."
