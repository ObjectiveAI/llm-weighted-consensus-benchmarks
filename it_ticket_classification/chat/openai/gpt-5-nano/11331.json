The message mentions deleting host names, particularly pointing out some confusion with duplicates. The best category could be \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d as it likely involves permissions to delete those host names. Alternatively, it might also fit under \u201cInternal Project\u201d or possibly even \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d if it\u2019s less clear cut. \u201cAccess\u201d could apply if they need specific permissions to perform the deletion, but it seems like \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d makes the most sense here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user didn\u2019t mention anything about hardware or purchases. The request seems primarily about an IT admin action to delete hostnames, making \"Administrative rights\" the most fitting category since it involves privileged actions. \"Internal Project\" might work if it's part of a specific project, but typically, \"Access\" refers to permissions. However, since this is about a deletion action, I\u2019ll go with \"Administrative rights.\" I'll format my response as a JSON object with the appropriate structure: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.**Formatting the category**\n\nI need to stick closely to the schema provided, which specifies output as a JSON object with a category field. I\u2019ll use {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} since that matches exactly, with the right capitalization. It\u2019s crucial to keep it concise, as the instruction seems clear that only one category is needed here. Also, even though the ticket mentions possibly deleting two hosts, that doesn\u2019t change the category choice. So, I\u2019ll finalize it as {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
