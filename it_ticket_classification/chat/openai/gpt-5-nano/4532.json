The ticket is about providing a monitor for a visiting colleague for two weeks, which clearly relates to a hardware device. They indicate wanting to provide her monitor and return it once her stay is over. Given that it focuses on hardware provisioning, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Hardware.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could be considered, it\u2019s not likely the right fit here.**Formatting category response**\n\nThe phrase \"by providing her monitor\" clearly indicates that we\u2019re dealing with equipment provisioning, which confirms that \"Hardware\" is the appropriate category. The instructions specify outputting a JSON-like format with a category field. So, I need to structure my response as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any extra explanation. The content of the ticket mentions the monitor and the two-week period, further solidifying that it falls under hardware. Thus, I'll respond in the required format.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
