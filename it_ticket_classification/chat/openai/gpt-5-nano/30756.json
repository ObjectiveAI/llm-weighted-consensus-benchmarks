They mention wanting help with the \"attached photo visible profile,\" which suggests they need assistance with account settings. It could fall under \"Access,\" as it relates to profile visibility permissions. Alternatively, it might be \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it could require admin rights to set up the profile picture for their organization. However, the categories are pretty broad.**Parsing IT ticket request**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the message about making an attached photo visible in an Outlook profile. It seems to involve someone noting \u201csenior developer\u201d and \u201cWednesday PM,\u201d possibly for scheduling. The main request appears to be about modifying a profile photo, which might suggest \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d but typically users can upload their own photos. \"Access\" seems to fit better since it\u2019s about profile settings, but it\u2019s often linked to login issues. \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d could apply if it doesn\u2019t neatly fit these categories, but it\u2019s primarily about enabling the photo. \"HR Support\" might be relevant if it relates to HR matters.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
