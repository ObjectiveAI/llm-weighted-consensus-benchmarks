The provided categories include hardware, HR support, access, miscellaneous, storage, purchase, internal project, and administrative rights. Since there\u2019s no specific \"Network\" category, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Hardware\" for possible device issues like a router or switch. However, \"Miscellaneous\" might be a safe fallback if it doesn't fit neatly into a specific category.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm thinking about how to categorize the network outage ticket. It seems to relate to \"Hardware\" since it's about a temporary connection issue on the floor, likely linked to network hardware. The user's message suggests a brief outage, and while \"Access\" could apply if it were about user rights, the phrasing seems to focus on the connection itself. I should respond with a JSON-like object based on the allowed categories. My best guess for now is {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} or possibly \"Miscellaneous\" if needed.**Providing the Category in JSON**\n\nI need to ensure that the category string matches one of the specified options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Based on the context, I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit. The format requires me to provide just the JSON object with the \"category\" field. So, I\u2019ll respond with {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any extra text or formatting since the prompt clearly asks to categorize the IT ticket."
