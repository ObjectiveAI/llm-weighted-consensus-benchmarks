Given the available categories, it looks like \"HR Support\" is the best fit since this is related to intern onboarding. However, I\u2019m also considering \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" since it mentions filling out a form. But it really leans more toward HR Support, with the context focusing on onboarding.**Identifying ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering this ticket about providing a form for new interns to fill out for onboarding purposes. It doesn't seem to relate to system access, which might\u2019ve made \"Administrative rights\" a fit. Instead, the message suggests it's requesting help with the bulk starter form for interns. Reviewing the categories, \"HR Support\" seems to match best since this pertains to HR onboarding, while \"Administrative rights\" doesn't really apply here given the context. So, HR Support it is!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I think \u201cHR Support\u201d fits best since it relates to new interns and a starter form. I considered \"Miscellaneous\" too, but the mention of a \"bulk starter form\" signals it's likely about administrative tasks for onboarding. I also noticed some unclear phrases, likely due to the user's non-native language. Anyway, I'll confirm that I'll respond with a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Responding with category object**\n\nI see the instruction is clear: I should respond with just the category object in JSON format. No extra text is needed, so I\u2019ll keep it concise and direct. It\u2019s good to clarify this point, just to ensure I\u2019m giving exactly what the user wants. I'll make sure my response adheres strictly to that guidance. Simple and to the point! I'll produce the JSON as instructed."
