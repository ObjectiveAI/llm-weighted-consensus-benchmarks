The user reports high importance, can only connect wirelessly, and indicates that the wireless is slow. I\u2019m looking at the categories available: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights\". Since the issue clearly pertains to the physical network port, I think \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate category for this ticket.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe issue states \"network port not working,\" which might suggest a problem with the wall jack or switch. Since the user can only connect wirelessly and finds it slow, this definitely indicates a network problem. The available categories don't align perfectly, as \"Access\" seems more about permissions, and \"Networking\" isn't an option. Since the problem is clearly about hardware (the ethernet port), I\u2019m deciding to categorize this as \"Hardware\" and will format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe prompt asks to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" and typically for these tasks, the main focus is just on providing the category. I need to offer the JSON format directly as specified. The situation seems to point towards a high-priority issue, likely a hardware problem, given that \"network port not working\" implies a physical issue, whether on the PC or the wall. Therefore, the best fitting category is \"Hardware.\" I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
