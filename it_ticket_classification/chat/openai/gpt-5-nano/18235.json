It mentions terms like new starter, date, accepted offer, travel, and administration officer, but there\u2019s no clear indication of hardware, access, storage, or most of the other categories. So, this is going to be a bit tricky! I might lean towards \"Miscellaneous\" in this case.**Categorizing IT Tickets**\n\nThis IT ticket seems to revolve around HR processes related to a new starter, mentioning dates, offers, travel, and approvals. Key phrases include \"administration officer,\" \"new starter,\" and \"accept offer,\" indicating it fits into HR Support. Since that's one of the allowed categories, I'll categorize it as HR Support.\n\nI need to format the response as a JSON object according to the specified schema, which should look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. So, I\u2019ll make sure the output is exactly in that format!"
