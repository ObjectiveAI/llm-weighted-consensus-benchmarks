The options I have are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nUpon parsing the ticket, it seems to involve maternity leave, time reporting, and attendance tracking. This suggests it falls under HR-related issues, particularly concerning leave management and weekly submissions, so I should categorize it as HR Support.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI need to determine the correct category for the ticket. It\u2019s not Hardware, Storage, Purchase, Access, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. However, \"HR Support\" is an option on the list. Since the ticket mentions maternity leave, time reporting, and weekly submissions, it fits under HR Support.\n\nI should finalize this with a JSON output specifying the category. The response will look like:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nLet\u2019s deliver that."
