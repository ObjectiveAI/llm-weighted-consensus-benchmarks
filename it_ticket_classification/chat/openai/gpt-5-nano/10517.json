The term \"new starter\" clearly indicates someone new to the company. The IT category of \"Access\" seems appropriate for user account creation, but the focus is on form completion. The mention of \"HR Support\" could also apply, as onboarding often involves both HR and IT. Overall, \"Access\" might be the best fit for provisioning.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nIt seems the ticket is about completing a starter form for a new employee, which aligns more with HR onboarding. Since it's an IT ticket, I\u2019m debating whether to assign it to \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, \"Administrative rights\" relate to granting access privileges, which doesn\u2019t seem applicable here. I think \"HR Support\" fits best, but given the focus on IT, \"Access\" might also work. The form likely involves creating accounts, so IT would assist with provisioning access.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI see the phrase \"starter form\" relates to onboarding new employees, and that fits under the \"Access\" category in IT. This is primarily for managing new starter accounts and access provisioning. I think I need to respond in a specific format, presenting a JSON-like object. So, I'll create: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Given the instruction to deliver just the structured object, I\u2019ll make sure to output only this JSON without any extra text. Here\u2019s my response: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
