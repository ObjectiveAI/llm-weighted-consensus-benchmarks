This suggests it could fit under HR Support for human resources processes. There\u2019s also a chance it involves Access or Administrative rights for account setups. But I think HR Support is probably the best fit!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nIn terms of IT ticket categories, \"new starter\" usually refers to provisioning user access or setting up a new employee in the system. The instructions to categorize this ticket lead me to think it could be either \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"HR Support.\" The mention of \"please fill date\" suggests someone is asking for the new starter\u2019s start date, tying it to HR processes. Given the context, I believe \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe task is to categorize the IT ticket, specifically regarding new starter provisioning. This typically falls into categories like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, since \"new starter\" involves creating a user account, it fits best under \"Access.\" I\u2019ll just provide the category in a JSON format as requested in the schema. Since the user specifically asked for a category, I won\u2019t add anything else. My output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
