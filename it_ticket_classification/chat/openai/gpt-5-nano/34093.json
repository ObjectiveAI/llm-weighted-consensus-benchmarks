The best fit for this ticket seems to be either \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access\" due to the connection issues and server certificate verification involved. However, \"Access\" might lean towards user permissions, and there\u2019s no dedicated \"Network\" category. Since the main focus is on a connection issue that doesn't neatly fit other categories, I think \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is the way to go. I\u2019ll respond with JSON format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
