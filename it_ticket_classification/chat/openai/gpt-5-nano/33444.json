The options I have for categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.\n\nIt seems like this ticket mainly relates to camera hardware, possibly CCTV, and access to footage. I think the best fit here would be \"Hardware\" since it specifically concerns physical devices like cameras.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Access\" due to mentions of secured entrances and cameras. However, it doesn't clearly discuss granting access, so that might not fit. \n\nUltimately, it seems best to categorize it as \"Hardware,\" since it's primarily about camera equipment and footage. I also think about whether it could be an \"Internal Project,\" but that's unclear. I\u2019ll respond with the appropriate JSON format, ensuring I keep it straightforward. \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
