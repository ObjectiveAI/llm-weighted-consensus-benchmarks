The request mentions changing a project name and title, which could fall under \"Internal Project\" since it concerns project details. However, it sounds like they might need permissions or access control too, so \"Administrative rights\" could fit as well. The options are limited, and it\u2019s clear they\u2019re looking to initiate changes related to an existing project. I'll have to decide carefully!**Categorizing the project change request**\n\nThe user wants to initiate a title change for a project, which likely requires admin privileges. Their request doesn't specify anything about hardware or storage. Based on the context, I think \"Internal Project\" fits best since it's focused on project name/title changes. \"Miscellaneous\" is too vague, so I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object that clearly indicates the category. I should ensure there\u2019s no extra text in the output. Here\u2019s what I need to provide: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
