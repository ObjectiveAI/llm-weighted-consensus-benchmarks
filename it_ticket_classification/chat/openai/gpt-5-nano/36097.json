The problems seem to be focused on the referral system not functioning correctly. \n\nThe categories I can choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. Since the issue deals with referral problems, HR Support appears to be the best fit for this ticket. I'll proceed with that categorization.**Deciding on HR Support category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket based on the user\u2019s text about ongoing problems with the referral system. It mentions that colleagues can refer candidates for open positions, indicating an HR-related issue. \n\nGiven the context, \"HR Support\" appears to be the most suitable category, as it relates to HR processes. I don't think it's about hardware or other listed categories. Now, I should respond accordingly, possibly in a JSON-like format.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
