The ticket text mentions that sent emails appear to be stuck in the drafts folder. This isn\u2019t a hardware, HR, access, purchase, or administrative rights issue. It might fit under \"Miscellaneous\" as a general IT problem. I'm also considering whether it could be classified as \"Storage\" since it involves the drafts folder itself.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nAfter considering the user's IT ticket, the best fit appears to be \"Miscellaneous\" since it's a general IT problem that doesn't clearly fit other categories. I also thought about \"Access\" related to sending issues, but that doesn't seem to apply. There's no specific \"Email\" category, so \"Miscellaneous\" is definitely the right choice. I need to respond with the formatted JSON object for the category: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. That confirms everything!**Delivering IT category response**\n\nI need to ensure that my response is strictly a category object, as instructed for the IT ticket. The prompt clearly asks for a JSON object, so I won't include any extra commentary. The \"category\" property should only contain the designated string. After checking, I confirm that \"Miscellaneous\" fits the situation best. So, I\u2019ll present my final answer in JSON format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I think I've got everything right!"
