Given the context, it likely falls under \"HR Support\" since it involves a new employee and their onboarding paperwork. However, it might also touch on \"Access\" if permissions are needed, but I think HR Support is the more fitting category here.**Determining Category for Ticket**\n\nThe \"starter form\" mentioned seems to relate to onboarding, which leans towards \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Access,\" depending on its purpose. The phrase \"new starter\" clearly indicates it's for a new employee, and the references to the form and filling it out suggest HR involvement. Looking at the categories, \"HR Support\" appears to be the most fitting option for onboarding, but \"Access\" might also apply if it involves system access. I'll go with \"HR Support.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket Request**\n\nThe request mentions filling out a \"starter form,\" which likely indicates it's about onboarding. In this case, I think it's best categorized as \"HR Support\" since that aligns with the purpose of onboarding a new employee. While \"Access\" could also fit if system permissions are involved, \"HR Support\" is more relevant here. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object, keeping it to the category only, such as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll make sure it's concise and clear for the user!"
