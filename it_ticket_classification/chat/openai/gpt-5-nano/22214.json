The best category for this is \"Hardware,\" as it directly relates to the laptop's functionality. It's not about access, storage, or purchase, so I'll go with Hardware.**Formatting the IT ticket response**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize the IT ticket using a JSON object. According to the prompt, the expected format is: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I need to follow the structure strictly, as it's required for the API. There are specific categories provided, and since this ticket relates to hardware issues, \"Hardware\" is the right choice. I\u2019ll keep it concise, no extra details needed unless the user asks for more. So, my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
