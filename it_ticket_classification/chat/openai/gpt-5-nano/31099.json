This could either fall under the \"Access\" category or \"Administrative rights,\" since they\u2019re requesting access to manage settings. The repeating mention of \"library\" suggests it\u2019s focused on access management, so I think it's best categorized as \"Access.\" However, I should also consider \"Administrative rights\" due to the specifics of the request.**Categorizing an access request**\n\nThe user's message appears to be an access request for a library or list. The grammar is a bit off, but I think \"bone\" might actually be \"one.\" They mentioned \"Wednesday pm,\" indicating a specific time, and they seem to want access management. I should categorize this as \"Access\" since it's primarily about accessing the list or library, but I\u2019ll also consider \"Administrative rights\" due to the mention of managing settings. I\u2019ll respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Classifying the ticket**\n\nThe ticket title suggests it's about an access request for a library, mentioning access to a list and links, as well as managing settings. Since this aligns with the category of \"Access,\" I think it makes sense to categorize it that way. The response should be in JSON format, as specified in the provided schema. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
