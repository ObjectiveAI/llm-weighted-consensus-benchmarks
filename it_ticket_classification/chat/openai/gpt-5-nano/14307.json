The message mentions wanting access to \u201cFriday,\u201d but it\u2019s unclear if \u201cFriday\u201d is a system, project name, or even a person. Since it\u2019s about access and includes \u201caccept/decline,\u201d it seems reasonable to categorize this as an Access request, at least for now! Let's proceed carefully.**Finalizing category response**\n\nIt seems like the message \u201cwants to access Friday wants work accept decline\u201d could be a bit jumbled. The user likely wants access to something called \u201cFriday\u201d and is thinking about accepting or declining a request. Because of the mention of access, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format my response according to the required schema, outputting the category as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This should meet the requirements clearly!**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI'll go ahead and format my response as a valid JSON object that specifies the category. Since we've determined the ticket falls under the \"Access\" category, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to make sure it adheres to the required structure so that it's clear and meets expectations. Alright, that sounds good to me! Let\u2019s proceed with this output."
