The content mentions cleaning up duplicate client records, merging customers, and updating client codes. This looks like a data cleanup task in a CRM. It doesn't fit well under \"Administrative rights\" since that's about access control. \"Internal Project\" seems broad. I might lean towards \"Miscellaneous\" since it's a general cleanup task.**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, and the best option seems to be \"Internal Project\" since it deals with a data cleanup task. The user requests that I output a JSON object with the specified category. The ticket outlines tasks like deduplicating clients, merging records, updating codes, and transferring information. Since it fits this internal project description, my response will simply be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I won't add anything extra, just keeping it clear and precise."
