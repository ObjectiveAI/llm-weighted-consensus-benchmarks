The ticket text is a bit jumbled but mentions an approval flow concerning timecard submission. It suggests there might be issues with submitting under personal codes. Given the context, it seems this relates to HR Support, as it pertains to timecard approvals and potential errors in the process.**Clarifying Approval Workflow**\n\nIt looks like we're discussing a timesheet approval workflow issue where someone might be trying to submit their own timecard under their code, which raises concerns about improper self-approval. I\u2019m trying to figure out where to categorize this; should it fall under Access, Administrative rights, or HR Support? Since it relates to timecard submissions and approvals, HR Support seems most fitting, but it also touches on access control due to permissions regarding approving one's own timecard.**Determining the Category**\n\nThe ticket description highlights concerns around the \"approval flow\" and someone submitting their timecard with their own code. This raises potential issues of misuse, possibly indicating a bug in the approval workflow. While it relates to security and access control, there's no specific category for security. So, \"Access\" seems like the best fit. Alternatively, \"Administrative rights\" could apply since it\u2019s about approving timecards\u2014which involves admin privileges. Ultimately, I need to decide between those two categories.**Choosing the Category**\n\nI see that \"Administrative rights\" fits well here since it relates to access control and the ability to approve timecards. The description mentions the flow needing review and issues with submitting timecards under one\u2019s own code, hinting at a misuse scenario. This suggests that allowing self-approval of timecards might bypass necessary restrictions. Given that context, it's clear this falls under \"Administrative rights.\" Now, I\u2019ll respond with the appropriate JSON format as requested. \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
