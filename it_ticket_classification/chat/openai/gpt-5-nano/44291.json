They mention \"failed backup jobs,\" incident logging, and server restart due to updates in February. I see that this involves IT operations, likely related to storage since backups connect to storage aspects. However, it could also involve \"Administrative rights\" if they need to log the incident. I'm leaning towards \"Storage\" as the best fit, given its direct relation to backup jobs.**Deciding incident category**\n\nThe user's request is clear: they want to log an incident regarding failed backup jobs. While \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t really fit, I\u2019m looking at the details like \"backup jobs failed,\" \"server restarted due to updates,\" and \"log incident.\" This sounds operational, making \"Storage\" the most fitting category since it's directly related to backups. I should respond with the JSON format for clarity, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Storage\" and return that in the appropriate format.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
