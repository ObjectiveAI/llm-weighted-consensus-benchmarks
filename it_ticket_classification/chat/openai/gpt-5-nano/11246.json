The \"Access\" category seems to fit best since it relates to accessing documents or building permissions. I'll prepare to output a JSON object with the category field as expected: {\"category\":\"Access\"} to ensure it matches the content.**Classifying IT request**\n\nThe content likely pertains to access to documents at a specific time. It could relate to \"Administrative rights\" if elevated permissions are needed, but overall it seems too vague. The best fit is \"Access,\" as the user wants to access documents. While the phrase \"wants building accept decline\" suggests potential building entry, the relevant category for documents is \"Access.\" So, I'll finalize the output as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI\u2019ll keep it concise and straightforward without extra commentary."
