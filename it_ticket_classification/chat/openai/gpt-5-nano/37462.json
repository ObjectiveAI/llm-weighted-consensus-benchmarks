The user describes issues with project time approval duplicates, likely tied to an approval workflow. I'm considering the most fitting categories: \"Administrative rights\" might be relevant if permission issues are involved, but it could also fall under \"Internal Project\" since it appears connected to internal project management. \"Miscellaneous\" is another option, but I think I'll lean toward \"Internal Project\" for this one.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize this ticket as \"Access\" due to potential duplication from system access or look at it from another angle. The user's issue involves duplicate approval notifications, which seems software-related. The available categories include \"Administrative rights\" for permissions, but the problem isn\u2019t about access rights. Maybe \"Miscellaneous\" works, or I should stick with \"Internal Project\" since it relates to project time approval. I'll go with \"Internal Project\" for clarity. Now, I need to format the response in JSON.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
