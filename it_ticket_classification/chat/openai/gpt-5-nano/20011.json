The ticket seems to relate to access rights related to a metrics application. Looking at the options, \u201cAccess\u201d feels like the best fit since the user is asking for rights to use Sonar for dashboards and metrics. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll create a JSON-like object reflecting this category as \u201cAccess.\u201d This should help organize the ticket appropriately!**Interpreting IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket centers around granting \"rights\" or access to Sonar, suggesting it\u2019s likely about user access to a metrics application. I see two possible categories: \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nThe user seems to want rights for accessing Sonar rather than specific admin privileges, so \"Access\" feels more appropriate here. The repeated requests for user rights emphasize this. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as \u201cAccess\u201d to keep it straightforward!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
