The user is facing errors and requests help. Considering the options\u2014Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights\u2014this ticket appears to best fit the \"Purchase\" category since it mentions purchase orders and the procurement process. I'll log this ticket in the appropriate category to help resolve the issue efficiently!**Identifying ticket category**\n\nIt looks like there\u2019s a software issue relating to the \"change order\" in the procurement system. The ticket might fit into \"Purchase\" since it deals with purchase orders. While \"Administrative rights\" could also be considered if it relates to permissions, the user is unable to edit a purchase order, indicating a likely software problem rather than a permissions issue. So, I think \u201cPurchase\u201d is the best category. I\u2019ll prepare the response in a JSON format as instructed!**Preparing JSON output**\n\nThe prompt instructs me to categorize the IT ticket and provide a specific output format, which is a JSON-like object. It specifies that the category should be one of the enumerated options. I\u2019ll use \"Purchase\" since that's the most fitting category for this ticket. The required output looks like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I have to make sure there\u2019s no extra text; just the JSON object is needed. So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
