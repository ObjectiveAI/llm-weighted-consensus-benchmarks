It seems to suggest a need for either a license or approval related to an idea, but there\u2019s no direct category for \"Feature Request\". \"Purchase\" might fit if it's about buying a license, while \"Access\" could refer to approval rights. I wonder if it relates to an \"Internal Project.\" Repeated mention of \"license\" stands out.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI'm weighing options to categorize an IT ticket regarding a license request. Without additional context, \"Purchase\" seems fitting since the user appears to be seeking a license. However, if it's related to an internal project, \"Internal Project\" might be more appropriate. The message hints at needing approval, so \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" could also come into play, especially regarding license access. Since it\u2019s from a developer, I feel \"Internal Project\" could be the best choice.**Finalizing category decision**\n\nI'm deciding how to categorize this IT ticket about licensing for an internal project. \"Internal Project\" feels like the best fit since approval is needed for that specific context. While \"Purchase\" could work since licenses often require buying, \"needs approve\" indicates a focus on obtaining approval rather than purchase. I want to ensure I follow the format too, so I'll respond with the JSON properly structured like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let's deliver that clearly!"
