It could be classified as \"Miscellaneous,\" since it's an IT issue related to scams. The prompt needs a category in JSON format, like {\"category\":\"...\"}. \n\nIt looks like this email is definitely spam, suggesting changes that relate to access, which makes me lean towards \"Administrative rights\" for labeling it. However, if there's a request for email configuration changes, \"Administrative rights\" would fit best.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI'm considering a user request that includes \"please add br blacklist,\" which suggests that they want to blacklist something. This task likely requires admin rights. However, there\u2019s a phrase \u201cse livre\u201d that might be French, adding some uncertainty. Given this complexity, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Administrative rights,\" since it's about managing email blocking.\n\nSince the task aligns with admin-level responsibilities, outputting the JSON object as {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} seems right. I'll ensure it fits the specified schema format.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
