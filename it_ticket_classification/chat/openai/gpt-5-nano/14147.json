They mentioned \"annual leave,\" \"oracle,\" and \"software tester,\" which suggests it might relate to HR tasks. The mention of \"annual leave\" points directly to HR Support as a likely category. However, \"Access\" could apply if it involves account permissions, and \"Administrative rights\" might also be relevant. I'll focus on HR Support since that's the most appropriate category.**Finalizing category output**\n\nI think the best category for this ticket is \"HR Support\" since it's about submitting annual leave in the Oracle system. While \"Miscellaneous\" could work, \"HR Support\" is a better fit. The user\u2019s prompt specifies to categorize the IT ticket, and I need to respond with a JSON object. The format is clear: I\u2019ll just output the category string. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll provide the final response as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} without any extra text."
