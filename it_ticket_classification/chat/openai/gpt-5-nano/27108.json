There are mentions of relocating an existing center and planning for a hosted environment. The ticket could fit into either \"Internal Project\" or \"Access\" categories because it discusses infrastructure changes and tunnel setups. I need to pick the best category based on these details and it seems like an IT infrastructure project!**Choosing the correct category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding between the categories of Internal Project, Access, or Administrative rights. Access seems to refer to user permissions, and \"Administration rights\" relates specifically to admin controls, but the text doesn\u2019t mention access rights explicitly. Given that it involves relocating a data center and tunneling, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit. I\u2019ll create a concise JSON object as required, showing just the category. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
