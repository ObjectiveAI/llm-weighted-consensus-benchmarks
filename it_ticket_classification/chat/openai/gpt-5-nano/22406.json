The focus is clearly on the purchase of PC hardware along with installation, which leans towards the \"Purchase\" category. So, I need to decide if \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware\" is the most fitting label.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user sent a message about a \"new purchase\" regarding a PC and mentions logging installation and mandatory receipts. This points to a procurement request. While both the \"Purchase\" and \"Hardware\" categories seem relevant, I believe the \"Purchase\" category fits best since it emphasizes the purchase order and receipts. The request for installation also supports this choice. So, I\u2019ll organize the final response as a JSON-like format in the \"Purchase\" category.**Formatting the IT Ticket category**\n\nI need to output the category in a specific JSON format that looks like this: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[...]}}}. The task requires me to provide just the category as a simple JSON object. Since the ticket pertains to a purchase, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase.\" Therefore, the final response should be clear and concise: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. There won\u2019t be any extra text; it\u2019s straightforward!"
