It mentions identifying servers related to a public pen test report and fixing vulnerabilities. Based on the content, it seems best categorized under \"Internal Project,\" since it deals with infrastructure and vulnerability fixes. I\u2019ll confirm that this category aligns with the user's intent and the details presented in their message.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for this IT ticket. It could be \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access,\" but parsing the content helps a lot. The user talks about identifying servers from a public penetration test report and mentions fixing vulnerabilities. This suggests a focus on IT security, specifically maybe vulnerability management. Since there's no explicit \"Security\" category, the closest match seems to be \"Internal Project\" since it relates directly to internal infrastructure and the pen test report.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket again, which could be \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" but there\u2019s no clear request for either of those. The phrases like \"assign queue\" and \"ext zone\" hint it might relate to a ticket queue. Since it focuses on mapping servers related to a pen test report, I think \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category. So I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"} and keep it simple, as that\u2019s what the user requested."
