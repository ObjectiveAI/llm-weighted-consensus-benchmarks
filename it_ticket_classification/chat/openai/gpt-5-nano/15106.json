It seems to deal with access control, possibly involving IP addresses. Given its focus on extending the range of allowed addresses for accessing repositories, I think classifying it under \"Access\" is the best fit.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI've determined this IT ticket is not about hardware, HR, storage, purchase, internal projects, or administrative rights. It clearly relates to access, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" The instructions specify that I need to respond with a JSON object, so my final output will be simple: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I just want to ensure that the string matches exactly what's allowed, with no extra text included. Alright, here we go!"
