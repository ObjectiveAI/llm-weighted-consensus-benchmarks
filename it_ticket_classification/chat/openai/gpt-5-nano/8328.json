It seems like \"Administrative rights\" might fit since it involves permissions, but \"Access\" could also apply if it\u2019s regarding calendar access. However, they aren\u2019t requesting admin rights, which complicates things. I think \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best choice.**Analyzing ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering categorizing this ticket as \"Administrative rights\" since it involves admin actions to delete calendar bookings or adjust meeting room reservations. The user is requesting help to remove specific meetings and seems to need permission to cancel them. There could also be an \"Access\" issue at play because they may not have the right permissions to modify the calendar entries. \"Miscellaneous\" is also an option, but the focus seems to lean toward needing access for calendar management.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for this IT ticket. \"Administrative rights\" seems fitting because it involves managing calendar permissions and cancellations. However, \"Access\" could also apply since the user is looking to delete specific meeting bookings. They are asking for help to find who booked the meeting rooms and cancel them, which feels like an administrative action. Ultimately, I think \"Administrative rights\" is the most accurate choice, and I\u2019ll provide it in the required JSON format.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
