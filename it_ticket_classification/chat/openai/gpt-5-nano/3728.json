The ticket fits several categories like Hardware, Access, or Miscellaneous, but I should ask the user for clarification to ensure I categorize it correctly.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on its content. It mentions \"card leaver,\" which might relate to \"card access,\" so it could fit into the Access category for credentials and login issues. The words \"la firma\" hint at \"signature\" and \"weekend\" might refer to availability for signing. To avoid miscategorization, I should ask clarifying questions. However, if I had to propose a category, I\u2019d suggest \"Access,\" or possibly \"Administrative rights\" if granting permissions is involved.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nIn classifying the IT ticket, \"card\" might refer to \"card reader\" hardware, placing it in the Hardware category. However, the repetition of \"card leaver\" could suggest a vacation context, which is confusing. The phrase \"la firma weekend\" translates to \"the signature weekend,\" hinting at some signing involved. Given the unclear information, I think the best category might be Access since it relates to badges or software access. I should offer to recategorize based on any further context and suggest multiple options if needed. I can format my response as JSON too!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
