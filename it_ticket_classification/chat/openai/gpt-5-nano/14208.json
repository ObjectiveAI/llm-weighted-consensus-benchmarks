It seems to involve tickets logged through self-service that the filter didn\u2019t catch, possibly indicating an automation problem. The categories seem limited; \u201cInternal Project\u201d might fit since it\u2019s about an IT automation issue. \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could apply if permissions are involved, but it's not clear. Ultimately, I'd choose \u201cInternal Project\u201d because it's about a filter configuration issue in the self-service portal.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering categorizing this ticket. \"Access\" could work if it relates to user access or detection by filters, but that category usually addresses login issues. I think it\u2019s better classified as \"Internal Project\" since it deals with filter configuration and ticket discovery\u2014an IT process issue rather than hardware or storage. Therefore, I\u2019ll just output the JSON object exactly as needed: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. No extra text; that should work perfectly!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
