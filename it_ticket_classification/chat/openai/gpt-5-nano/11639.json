It seems like a request to add something related to training for a supplier or an event, possibly indicating an internal project.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI see that the ticket mentions adding \"branch\" and \"education.\" The best categories for this IT ticket seem to be \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \n\n\"Internal Project\" is relevant for specific initiatives, while \"Administrative rights\" relates to permission changes, which this ticket doesn't indicate. \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" don't fit either. \n\nSince the request mentions adding a branch to the supplier professional education program, it could be classified as \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but I think \"Miscellaneous\" might be a better fit for general tasks.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nFor IT ticket categorization, \"Administrative rights\" is typically for granting admin access, which doesn't fit here. \"Access\" would be relevant if it were about granting access to resources, but it\u2019s not. \n\nThe best category seems to be \"Internal Project\" since it relates to creating or adding something for an education program. \n\nSo, my response will be a JSON object that reads: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s properly formatted without extra text!"
