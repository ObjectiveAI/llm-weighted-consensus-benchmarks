The ticket mentions inaccessible reports and the need to extract data, which suggests it\u2019s about access. The phrasing is a bit unclear, but it seems to fit best under \"Access\" since it doesn't explicitly mention needing permissions. \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant, but since the description leans towards general access issues, \"Access\" seems most appropriate.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user wants to extract data from the previous year, which suggests it's related to accessibility of reports. So, the fitting category seems to be \"Access.\" I need to respond with a JSON object that specifies this category. The required format indicates I should include just the category as a string enum. \n\nI\u2019ll structure it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This aligns with the guidelines, ensuring it's correctly formatted and ready for submission. Let's proceed with that!"
