They mention \"access cards usage\" which seems to indicate that this fits well under the \"Access\" category. It could also be related to \"Administrative rights\" if it's about managing access rights specifically, but it really feels more aligned with monitoring access control overall. So I think I'll go ahead and classify it as \"Access.\"**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to output a JSON-like category object. The system specifies that the response should contain properties for the category, so I\u2019ll stick to the provided schema. Since the ticket suggests access cards usage is related to internal audits, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" \n\nIn line with the instructions, I\u2019ll return just the category in the required format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra text needed!"
