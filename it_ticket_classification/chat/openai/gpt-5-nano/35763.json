I'll format the output as a JSON object with \"Access\" as the chosen category.**Finalizing IT category**\n\nI'm considering that certificate errors usually relate to access or authentication issues. Since there's no specific \"Security\" category, I could use \"Miscellaneous\" if I'm unsure. However, \"Access\" seems the most appropriate because these errors typically block access to services. I\u2019ll format the response strictly as a JSON object, specifying {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll keep it clean, as the user expects a straightforward response with just the JSON output and no extra text."
