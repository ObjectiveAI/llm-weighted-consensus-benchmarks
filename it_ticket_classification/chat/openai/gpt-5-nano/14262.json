The mentions of \"physical machine,\" \"older computer,\" and \"template\" suggest that this is likely related to hardware provisioning. I\u2019m torn between labeling it as \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase,\" but it could also fit under \"Internal Project\" since it involves a project task. I'll think carefully about which category best suits the ticket content!**Classifying IT Request**\n\nI see that the text is likely a request for a machine related to automation, indicating a hardware request for a project. I think \"Hardware\" is probably the best category since it's clearly about a machine. There\u2019s also mention of a template and some uncertainties with \u201ctest lead ext.\u201d But for output, I need to generate a JSON object with the chosen category. It seems I'll be producing something straightforward like: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Determining the Right Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the nuances between \"Internal Project\" and \"Hardware\" for this request. It\u2019s for \"project automation\" and mentions a \"physical machine\" and \"older computer,\" which could imply it fits under \"Internal Project\" since it\u2019s related to internal tasks. However, because it's predominantly a machine request, it seems to align more with \"Hardware.\" Following standard IT ticket practices, I\u2019ve decided to categorize this as \"Hardware.\" I'll output the final answer in JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
