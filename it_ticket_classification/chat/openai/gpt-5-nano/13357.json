They've mentioned needing to remove something by IT, with a focus on high importance and an inability to change flows or proceed with approvals. I think this leans toward issues with access and permissions, specifically regarding administrative rights and the workflow of approvals. It seems like a good fit for the \"Access\" category due to the challenges they're facing.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI could categorize the ticket as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it's related to access control, changing flows, and proposal deletions. However, \"Administrative rights\" seems more specific, especially since the user is requesting an IT removal and describing issues like a project manager needing to be removed due to an approver leaving. This suggests that administrator rights are needed to modify workflows and delete proposals. So, I'll categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" and return it as {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.**Delivering category output**\n\nThe required output format is clear: I need to provide a category object in JSON format. The instruction specifically states to output just the category as {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I don't think I need to include additional reasoning here since the prompt only asks for the categorization. I\u2019ll keep the response concise and deliver just the JSON without any extraneous text. Alright, let's get that sorted!"
