The provided text suggests they're asking to create new Tuesday PM changes related to user groups, mentioning specific actions like \"add\" and \"create by.\" It seems that the ticket's main focus is on group creation and modifications, which relates to permissions or access management. Given the context, the best fitting category appears to be \"Access.\" That seems like the most appropriate choice for this ticket.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether the category could be \"Administrative rights,\" especially if it involves adding those rights. However, the ticket text doesn\u2019t explicitly mention admin rights. It focuses on \"groups\" and \"changes,\" which leans toward access control rather than just administrative tasks. Given the context of creating and adding groups, I think \"Access\" is the best fit. I\u2019ll need to respond with a JSON object detailing that category according to the specified format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
