The user-submitted text discusses asset compliance, mentioning non-compliant tickets and encryption. This suggests it fits best under \"Hardware\" since it specifically talks about hardware assets. However, \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could also be possible. I'll settle on \"Hardware,\" given the focus on asset compliance. I'll make sure to output this in JSON format.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI need to create a JSON object with a category property. I\u2019ll go with {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} since the focus is on asset compliance. Initially, I thought it might be \"Administrative rights\" because it involves tickets, but it's clearly about hardware assets. I want to ensure the output is short and precise without any extraneous details, so I'll stick to this categorization. Let\u2019s finalize the JSON format!"
