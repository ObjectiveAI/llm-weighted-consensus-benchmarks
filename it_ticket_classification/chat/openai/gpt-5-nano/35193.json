It's important to assign it to the right category to ensure it gets addressed properly!**Interpreting survey feedback**\n\nI see multiple mentions regarding a survey invite linked to a resolved ticket. It seems we should send satisfaction surveys when a caller has resolved an issue to avoid bias in results. There's a specific case where a high satisfaction score was given for an access control issue about doors being left open. The caller needs clarity on why they received a survey after resolution. I'll investigate and ensure the process leads to more accurate feedback moving forward!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket that involves triggering and subsequently canceling survey results, with some confusion around the status showing \"resolved by himself.\" The core issue relates specifically to access control\u2014doors being open. I need to categorize this under \"Access.\" Since the ticket focuses on satisfaction surveys linked to this access issue, it aligns well with the taxonomy. I'll prepare the response in the required JSON format, specifying the category as \"Access\" without any extra text. Here it goes!  \n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Access\"}}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
