The process usually involves identifying the type of issue, assigning priority levels, and ensuring it's routed to the appropriate team. I wonder if we should also consider the urgency of the request. It's important to have clear categories to streamline troubleshooting and support. Let's make sure that everyone involved understands how to classify these tickets accurately!**Classifying user request**\n\nThe user\u2019s message is pretty ambiguous but seems to revolve around Outlook and employee addresses not being displayed. They mention \u201ccheck names,\u201d hinting it might relate to the address book or global address list. The phrase \"two space tabs\" is confusing. Since this likely involves access to email addresses, I think the best category for it would be \"Access.\" They seem to need help with how Outlook is showing employee information. Let's categorize it properly based on that!**Finalizing category classification**\n\nThis issue seems to relate to Outlook and the display of employee addresses, which likely falls under the \"Access\" category. The user is mentioning that addresses aren't showing properly, indicating a potential permissions issue with the address book. They also refer to using the \"check names\" function in Outlook, which is common for access-related problems with contact information. So, I\u2019m concluding \"Access\" is the most appropriate category here. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object with the required structure: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
