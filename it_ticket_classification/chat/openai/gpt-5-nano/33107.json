The ticket text appears to be a jumbled email about a new starter in New Jersey. It mentions things like required hardware notes, monitor, software addition, phone, and seating details, but some sections, like the building floor table seats, seem irrelevant. I'll focus on relevant information to categorize appropriately.**Analyzing IT ticket content**\n\nI\u2019ve got a ticket that seems to be about onboarding a new starter in New Jersey, with a request for hardware like a monitor, software, phone, and seating details. There\u2019s a note about needing to \"update form relevant return cannot log tickets without,\" which could suggest a need for access, but it feels more aligned with hardware requests. Given the mentions of onboarding and hardware, I think the best fit for categorization here is \"Hardware.\"{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
