The category list doesn\u2019t have options specifically for HR, Payroll, or Attendance, which complicates things.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the categories available for the IT ticket: \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Internal Project.\" Given the context about timesheets, absence, and relocation, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it were about system access, this ticket focuses on correcting timesheets due to location changes. It\u2019s definitely not about hardware or storage. So, I'll go with \"HR Support\" and respond with the category structure in a JSON format as required.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
