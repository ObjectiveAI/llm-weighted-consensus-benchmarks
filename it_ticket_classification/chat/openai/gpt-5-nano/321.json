The request mentions needing a \"clicker,\" which seems to refer to a presenter clicker for a session on Thursday. It could fit into \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Hardware,\" since a clicker is a hardware device used in presentations. However, it might also imply they need access to a session, but it seems more likely they just want the clicker this time. Parsing it has been a bit tricky!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m working on categorizing the IT ticket. If someone is requesting a hardware item like a clicker, it falls under \"Hardware.\" There\u2019s also the possibility of needing access based on \"pass session,\" but I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit here. The instruction is clear: I need to provide the response in JSON format without extra text. So, I\u2019ll deliver just the necessary format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Alright, let's finalize that!"
