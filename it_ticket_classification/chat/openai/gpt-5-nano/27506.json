The user's message is a bit jumbled but touches on \"report,\" \"maternity leave,\" and \"calculated total.\" It seems to fit within \"HR Support\" since it mentions maternity leave and reporting issues. Although the categories are IT-specific, I believe this ticket falls under HR. It seems like a payroll-related concern.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ve ruled out several categories for the IT ticket, such as \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and others. Given that it mentions maternity leave and reporting, \"HR Support\" seems fitting. However, since it's an IT ticket, we could also consider \"Miscellaneous\" if it feels unclear. But I still think \"HR Support\" is appropriate. So, I need to format this response as a JSON object and choose a category from the given options. Let\u2019s go with \"HR Support.\"**Interpreting the user's message**\n\nThe user's message is quite garbled, but I see some clues: there are mentions of \"report importance high,\" \"maternity leave,\" and an \"inactive order.\" This seems to indicate issues around payroll or a calculation mismatch related to maternity leave. I really don't think \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" fit here, so I believe \"HR Support\" is the best choice since it connects directly to maternity leave. So, I should categorize this ticket as \"HR Support.\"**Outputting the JSON category**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize the IT ticket, and I need to provide a JSON object based on the schema given. So, I will simply output the category without any extra explanation, following the guidelines. Here it is:  \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
