We have categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. I need to evaluate the ticket's content to determine which of these categories it best fits into. It\u2019s all about ensuring the ticket gets to the right team efficiently! Let's make sure we do this accurately for smoother processing.**Analyzing survey modifications request**\n\nI have a long, unstructured text from the user regarding survey modifications in ServiceNow. It mentions tasks related to logging points, managing requests, deadlines, and resource allocations. There are notes about assigning tasks and discussions about triggers and linked surveys too. A key part of this conversation seems to revolve around a deadline set for Friday morning and how to effectively implement two working requests. I\u2019ll need to extract structured information and clarify actions needed to assist the user properly.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket is related to internal project work focusing on survey modifications, so I believe it fits best under the \"Internal Project\" category. The available categories include Administrative Rights, Access, and Miscellaneous, but modifications to a system like ServiceNow indicate an internal project. I need to respond with a JSON object formatted correctly: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It\u2019s important to stick to the exact capitalization specified and avoid any additional text. So, the final response will be that JSON object.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
