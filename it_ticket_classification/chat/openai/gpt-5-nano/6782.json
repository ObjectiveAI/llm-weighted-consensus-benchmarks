The string includes terms like \"access,\" \"link resolution unresolved epic link,\" and \"help.\" It seems related to access issues, so I think \"Access\" could be a fitting category. However, there's also mention of \"epic link,\" which might refer to something in a project management system like Jira. Depending on the context, it could also be classified under \"Internal Project.\" I'll weigh these two categories.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s mention of \"epic link\" suggests this is a Jira-related issue. They\u2019re requesting help with an unresolved epic link, which could fit under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the initial word \"access,\" it seems the user might be indicating an access issue, but that seems too vague. The phrase \"unresolved epic link\" indicates a technical problem related to project management. I should consider classifying this under \"Internal Project\" or sticking with \"Access.\"**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nSince the issue revolves around an internal project management system, the \"Internal Project\" category seems appropriate for this situation. The mention of \"Access\" could fit if it were about user permissions, but it doesn\u2019t clearly state anything about login or access rights. Instead, the focus is on resolving an \"unresolved epic link,\" which confirms it\u2019s tied to Jira. I think I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Internal Project\" and suggest the JSON output as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
