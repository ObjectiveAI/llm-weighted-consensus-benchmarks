They mention wanting to \"remove Wednesday pm,\" which might refer to a calendar entry. They also say something about a \"shared mailbox\" and \"calendar synched information,\" which makes me think this relates to access or administrative rights. Given the emphasis on removing access to the shared mailbox, it seems like the \"Access\" category is the most fitting for this ticket.**Determining ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering the administrative rights aspect since removing access could be relevant. When the user mentions \"remove shared mailbox,\" it hints at mailbox management, pointing towards either Access or Administrative rights. The ticket mentions removing a calendar event on \"Wednesday pm,\" so it feels like it\u2019s about access related to that calendar. I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate category here, since it specifically addresses issues with mailbox access and permissions, which fits the user's request.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe user\u2019s mention of \"shared mailbox\" and \"calendar synched information\" makes me think they might want to remove something from the calendar, or ensure synchronization is working correctly. It could fit into several categories, but to be safe, I\u2019m sticking with \"Access.\" So, I\u2019ll create the response as a JSON object because that\u2019s how the system wants it. I\u2019ll format it as {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text since the user just needs the categorization.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
