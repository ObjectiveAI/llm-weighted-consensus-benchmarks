The user wants a simple JSON-like structure, so I should format it correctly too. The essential output would be just: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to be sure it aligns with the required structure and includes the category properly.**Categorizing wireless connection issues**\n\nI'm considering whether \"Wireless\" might fit under \"Hardware\" due to a potential hardware issue. The ticket mentions wireless connections not working properly, which makes it a bit ambiguous. However, I believe the best category is \"Access\" since it deals with network and server access via wireless versus wired connections. It really is about accessing resources. I should keep it minimal, so I\u2019ll go ahead with the response: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
