It seems to relate to a \"third-party application integration with banks and supplier statements\" and an \"automated supplier side order process.\" Keywords suggest it could fit \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or even \"Purchase\" since it mentions supplier payments. Given the context, I think \"Purchase\" makes the most sense due to procurement aspects. Let's be sure to categorize it correctly!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe categories I have don\u2019t include \"Integration\" or \"Procurement,\" but \"Purchase\" fits well since it relates to procurement and supplier payments. The mention of \"side order process\" suggests a purchase or order workflow. I think categorizing it under \"Purchase\" makes sense. However, I could consider \"Internal Project\" due to the integration aspect with third-party applications, but \"Purchase\" seems more fitting overall. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
