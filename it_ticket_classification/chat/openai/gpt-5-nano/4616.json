The ticket content mentions elements related to leaver forms and various processes tied to staff leaving, like leave dates, mailbox management, and inventory. I need to determine the best category from options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Given the focus on departing employee procedures, it seems to fit into the HR Support category.**Mapping IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket regarding an employee's departure, focusing on various aspects like leaver forms, leaving dates, mailboxes, and access rights. This appears to be about deprovisioning access, which could fit into categories like Access or Administrative Rights. While Access encompasses various rights and mailbox removals, there\u2019s a mention of storage and asset management, which could lead me to consider Storage too. However, Access seems to be the best fit for this ticket.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for the IT ticket related to leaver processes. While \"Storage\" might seem relevant, it usually refers to data storage, and here it likely indicates hardware inventory management. Since this ticket primarily involves deprovisioning access rights, \"Access\" fits best. I need to respond in JSON format as specified in the instructions. The valid response should be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll ensure this is the correct format with no extra commentary."
