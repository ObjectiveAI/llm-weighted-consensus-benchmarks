This makes me think it fits under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given that it's about modifying privileges, \"Administrative rights\" seems like the more precise category. Access is general, while Administrative rights is specific.**Generating JSON for category**\n\nThe user has requested a change in user rights, which fits under Administrative rights. Since that's a valid category, we should categorize it as \"Administrative rights.\" The output needs to be in a specific JSON format. I understand that I need to ensure the response is structured correctly according to the provided schema. So, I\u2019ll provide exactly: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} without any extra text. Let\u2019s go ahead with that!"
