They mention \"new starter,\" \"starter form complete,\" and \"administration officer,\" indicating it likely relates to onboarding. It seems they might need help specifically with access or administrative rights. I'm torn between choosing the \"HR Support\" category or going with \"Access.\" The situation feels a bit unclear, but I\u2019ll lean toward one of those categories based on context!**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm working on classifying an IT ticket related to onboarding. Given the user's mention of a \"new starter\" and a \"completed form,\" it leans toward needing access to systems. There's a hint of needing administrative rights, but \"administration officer\" seems more like a sign-off. \n\nSo, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access\" since it's about provisioning for a new employee. I will format the output as a JSON object with the category specified as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
