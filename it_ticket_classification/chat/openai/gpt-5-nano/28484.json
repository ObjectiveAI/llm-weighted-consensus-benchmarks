The ticket text is quite messy, but it focuses on purchased Apple devices, allocation, and logging receipts for devices. It refers to \"purchase,\" \"receipts,\" and \"PO number,\" which suggests that it could fit into \"Purchase\" and possibly \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Internal Project\" might not apply. I'm weighing the appropriate category options based on the specifics mentioned.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nIt looks like \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category, as the ticket revolves around purchasing devices and PO numbers. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" don\u2019t apply here. While \"Hardware\" could fit since they are Apple devices, the focus is clearly on logging receipts and the procurement process. The user asked for the IT ticket to be categorized, so I should respond with JSON specifying \"Purchase\" as the category. I\u2019ll ensure the format complies with the specified JSON structure.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
