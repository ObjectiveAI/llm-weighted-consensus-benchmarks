They mentioned an error related to creating a branch in a Git repository, with issues like \"initial commit error\" and a message saying the request entity is too large. It seems to involve a restriction on the repository size. I'm considering whether to categorize it as \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" since it seems to relate to repository access issues but might also be a general error.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking through the categories for this IT ticket. The user mentioned a size restriction for their repository, which probably fits into the \"Storage\" category since it talks about limits on file sizes and has phrases like \"request entity too large.\" The error, likely a server-side issue, reinforces this classification. While \"Internal Project\" could apply if the problem is project-specific, it seems more straightforward to categorize this ticket as \"Storage\" given the context about repository limits.**Parsing ticket details**\n\nI\u2019m looking closely at the user\u2019s message about a Git error related to pushing or branching to a remote repository. It mentions an \u201cinitial commit\u201d error and a \u201crequest entity too large\u201d message, which likely points to a file size limit issue. Additionally, it implies that the local folder might be at a certain size. Based on this information, I\u2019m concluding the best category for this ticket is \"Storage.\" \n\nNow, I'll structure the output in the required JSON format.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
