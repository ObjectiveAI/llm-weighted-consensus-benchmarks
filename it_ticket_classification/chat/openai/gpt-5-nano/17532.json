It seems to involve issues surrounding Confluence access and restrictions for external users. The phrase \"restrict board view for external user\" suggests it fits within the \"Access\" category, but it could also relate to \"Administrative rights\" if it requires altering permissions. However, I think \"Access\" is the more appropriate category here since it's primarily about user access restrictions.**Preparing IT ticket response**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket, and the appropriate choice seems to be \"Access\" since it involves control over Confluence board access. I'll follow the required format for the response using a JSON object. I'll create something like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nIt's crucial to ensure the output is exactly as needed, with no extra commentary. Alright, let's deliver that JSON object!"
