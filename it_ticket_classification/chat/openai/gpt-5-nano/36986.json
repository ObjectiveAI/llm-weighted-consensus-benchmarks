The options I'm considering are \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Access,\" as there are no references to hardware or storage. The details include references to a dashboard and some requests for help, so I should pick a category that fits best. This is a bit tricky!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering categorizing the IT ticket as \"Internal Project\" because it relates to dashboard design for Sonar. The phrase \"sonar dashboard index design lead\" indicates a project focus, while \"problems with sonar\" suggests a technical issue. It could also fit under \"Admin rights,\" but there\u2019s no clear request for access. Since this is about dashboard design, I'll lean toward \"Internal Project\" as the most suitable option unless I find it too vague, in which case \"Miscellaneous\" might work. I should output the category in JSON format!**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe ticket mentions repeated \"problems with sonar\" and requests more information, which leans towards a support issue. Since it concerns dashboard design, I see it best fitting under \"Internal Project,\" as the phrase \"design lead\" suggests project leadership. I\u2019ll respond with the category in the required JSON format, ensuring no extra commentary. I just need to craft the final output as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} without any additional details. Here we go!"
