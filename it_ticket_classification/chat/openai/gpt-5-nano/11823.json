The text seems like a maintenance notification mentioning scheduled infrastructure work with high importance, though it\u2019s a bit garbled. Based on the content, I think it fits best under \"Hardware\" because it refers to replacing a central switch. Now, I\u2019ll format the output in JSON.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions replacing a central switch, which is definitely hardware-related and involves an infrastructure upgrade. The category list includes options like Hardware and Internal Project. Given the context of \"scheduled infrastructure replace central switch,\" I\u2019m confident that this belongs in the Hardware category. I need to format the output strictly to JSON with \"category\": \"Hardware\". Let's keep it concise. I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Got it! Let\u2019s deliver that.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI need to make sure I only deliver the JSON response without any extra commentary. It's important to follow the request exactly. So, I'll format the output as specified, ensuring there are no trailing comments or unnecessary text. Just getting straight to the point with the JSON. Let\u2019s go with that and deliver the clear response!"
