The text is quite messy, covering topics like a new purchase PO, mobile subscriptions, devices under user names, and mandatory receipts. It suggests areas like procurement and hardware allocation. The category options include things like \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", and \"Purchase\". Given the mention of \"new purchase PO\" and \"lite mobile subscription,\" I'm leaning towards the \"Purchase\" category, but I\u2019m not entirely sure about the mention of \"video explorer.\"**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on categorizing this IT ticket. There's a \"Purchase\" category in the allowed list, which seems fitting because the ticket discusses a new purchase order, items to receive, and receipts. The mentions of \"lite mobile subscription\" and \"allocation device\" hint at hardware too, but \"Purchase\" seems more accurate overall. I'll format the output as a JSON object, specifying the category as requested. My final output will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
