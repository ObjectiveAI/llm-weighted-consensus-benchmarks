This task involves importing mobile numbers and formatting phone numbers, suggesting it\u2019s an IT function. I\u2019m considering whether it falls under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context, it seems more aligned with Access since it involves user data management.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this ticket. It's related to AD (Active Directory) and involves importing contacts, which suggests it could be an \"Access\" issue. However, since it might involve admin tasks, \"Administrative rights\" also seems relevant. Still, the main focus is on user access to AD, so I think \"Access\" is the best fit. The details about phone number formatting indicate it's about data management, not hardware or storage. So, overall, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\"**Formatting Ticket Output**\n\nI'm looking at the ticket to categorize it based on the task of importing contacts to Active Directory (AD). While \"Miscellaneous\" is an option for unclassified tickets, \"Access\" seems to fit better since this task requires admin rights. \n\nI need to format my response as a JSON object because of the specified schema. So, I\u2019ll output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThis keeps it clear and concise, focusing solely on what's necessary!"
