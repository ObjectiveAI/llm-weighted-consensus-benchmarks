It seems focused on onboarding, mentioning \"joiners,\" likely referring to new hires. This suggests it involves granting access or provisioning accounts for the new employee. \n\nI\u2019m leaning towards the \"Access\" category, as it fits with the idea of providing system access for onboarding. If administrative rights are relevant, that could be a subcategory as well, given the context.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m working with the allowed categories for this ticket regarding a new starter in Belgrade. \"Administrative rights\" might be a subcategory when it comes to granting admin access, but the ticket seems more IT-focused overall. While \"HR Support\" could fit since it mentions onboarding, there's no explicit reference to HR tasks. I think the best category is \"Access,\" as it pertains to provisioning user accounts for this new employee. This aligns with the context of the ticket.**Providing Category for IT Ticket**\n\nIn IT ticket taxonomy, \"Joiners\" usually refers to new employees, which involves tasks like creating accounts, provisioning access, and granting rights. That makes \"Access\" the most fitting category. \n\nI\u2019ll prepare the response in the required JSON format, ensuring it matches the specified structure. They asked me to categorize the IT ticket, so I\u2019ll return just the category with no extra text. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll provide: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. \n\nNow, I\u2019m ready to send that!"
