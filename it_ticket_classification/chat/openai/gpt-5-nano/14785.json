The ticket text discusses line manager changes and maternity leave, which seem to relate to HR support. \n\nSince it involves modifications and holiday requests, it likely fits into the \"HR Support\" category. So, I'll categorize this ticket as HR-related, focusing on the relevant aspects highlighted in the message.**Parsing IT ticket details**\n\nThe content seems to relate to HR processes but also hints at a request for help with modifications regarding sheets and holiday requests. There\u2019s mention of not being able to access sheets, which could fall under \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since \"Administrative rights\" is a specific category, that seems relevant. The user indicates these changes are important and asks for assistance with modifications related to the line manager. So the key focus here is on access issues and HR-related changes.**Classifying ticket category**\n\nI think this ticket is likely related to HR processes. The urgency in \"changes importance high\" indicates the request is pressing. The mention of \"maternity leave\" suggests assistance is needed for someone going on leave. They also express a need for modifications concerning an old name, and it seems they're having issues with sheets connected to holiday requests that are approved.\n\nSince all these elements point to HR processes, I'll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and respond with the appropriate JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nThe system wants a JSON object that includes a \"category\" property with specific allowed values. Since I\u2019ve categorized this ticket under \"HR Support,\" the proper format for my response is: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure the formatting is correct and provide only this JSON object without any extra text. That keeps it clear and concise!"
