The ticket mentions needing help to retrieve an important file. From the options available\u2014like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others\u2014it seems this falls under a storage issue related to data recovery. I think the most fitting category here is \"Storage,\" since it mainly involves retrieving the deleted file from storage. Access might be a consideration, but \"Storage\" feels most accurate.**Outputting IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m going to respond with a JSON object designating the category as \"Storage.\" The system has specified a structured output format, and the prompt confirms the allowed categories. Based on the previous tasks, I know I need to deliver a JSON-like object with the \u201ccategory\u201d key. So, I'll make sure it's formatted correctly: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I'll provide this in plain text JSON without any extra commentary, just following the instructions as required."
