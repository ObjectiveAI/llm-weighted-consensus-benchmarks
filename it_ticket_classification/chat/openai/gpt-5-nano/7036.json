This ticket fits best under the \"Access\" category, maybe even \"Administrative rights.\" Now I\u2019ll format this in JSON with the appropriate category field.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis IT ticket could fit into either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The user is asking for access to a system called \"planning\" and seems to want the ability to accept or decline requests, which relates to permissions for workflow approvals. This suggests administrative capabilities. So, while both categories are relevant, \"Administrative rights\" feels more precise since it specifically addresses the ability to approve requests. However, I could still consider \"Access\" if it's primarily about gaining access to the planning module itself.**Deciding on category**\n\nThe phrase \"accept decline requests\" suggests that the user is seeking an approval capability, which aligns well with \"Administrative rights.\" So, I\u2019ll choose \"Administrative rights\" as the appropriate category. I need to respond using a JSON format with the specified structure. As per the schema, I\u2019ll create an object that looks like this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. Yes, I\u2019ll produce that final response without any extra text."
