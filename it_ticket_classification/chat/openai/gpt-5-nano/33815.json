The ticket seems related to a purchase request, specifically for IT assets. While it could fit under \"Hardware,\" there's a separate \"Purchase\" category listed. The phrase \"allocation purchase request\" indicates that it\u2019s mainly about procurement. Given these details, it seems best to categorize it as \"Purchase\" since it focuses on the request and allocation.**Confirming JSON Response**\n\nI need to classify the ticket properly for the support system, which seems intended for the \"Purchase\" team. The response should be in JSON format, following the provided schema. Thus, I want to ensure the output is simply: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I won't add any extra text since the user only needs the category, confirming that the ticket pertains to a purchase based on the details provided. I'll go ahead with that clear, straightforward response."
