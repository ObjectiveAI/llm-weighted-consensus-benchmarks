The mention of the \"th floor printer\" and that it\u2019s \"unavailable\" really points to a hardware issue. It might also relate to access rights since they can't add it. I think \u201cHardware\u201d is the best category here. However, there's a chance it could also fit under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" depending on the specific issue with permissions. Overall, \"Hardware\" seems the most fitting choice.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to output JSON according to the specified format, ensuring the category field is included. The text mentions a printer issue, which leads me to think the \"Hardware\" category is the best fit. While \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" comes to mind, I believe \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate. I\u2019ll be concise and respond simply with:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}  \n\nI must remember to avoid additional text or internal codes in the response."
