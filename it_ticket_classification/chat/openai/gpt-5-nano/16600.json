There's a list of categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights. The ticket mentions connection to web servers, urgency during training sessions, and client-hosted infrastructure which makes me think it's about access.\n\nSo, it could fit into \"Access\" or \"Internal Project\" based on the context. Also, the mention of \"application engineer ext\" might imply it's related to a specific request for that person.**Categorizing IT ticket as JSON**\n\nThe ticket indicates a request to connect to web servers through client-hosted infrastructure during training sessions, which seems urgent. It makes sense to categorize this as \"Access.\" I see that we need to respond with a JSON object in the specified format. \n\nThe correct structure looks like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"} which is valid since \"Access\" is included in the available categories. I'm ready to provide that response. So, here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
