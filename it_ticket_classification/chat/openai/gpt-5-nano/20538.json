It seems like a clear fit for the \"Hardware\" category since it's a hardware item. However, if providing it requires procurement, it could also fall under \"Purchase.\" Given that it's primarily about the plug adapter itself, I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll structure my response in JSON format.**Categorizing the IT request**\n\nThe user's request for an \"electrical plug adapter\" seems to fit the \"Hardware\" category since it's a physical item. While there might be a case for \"Purchase\" if there were a procurement need, the request doesn't explicitly state that. I see it more as a direct request for the hardware itself. So, I\u2019ll structure the response as a JSON object indicating the category as \"Hardware\" without adding extra text.**Finalizing the response**\n\nI think it's important to stick to the user's request for categorization, so I won't ask any clarifying questions this time. I'll just go ahead and categorize it straight away. Since I determined it best fits under \"Hardware,\" I'll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Keeping it simple ensures the user receives exactly what they asked for! Alright, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do."
