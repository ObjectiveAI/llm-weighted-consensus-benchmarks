However, phrases like \"new purchase\" and the repeated \"po\" suggest that this is primarily about purchasing. Since there's no mention of hardware, access, or storage, it seems best to categorize this as \"Purchase.\"\n\nSo, I\u2019ll follow the required format and respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I need to remember not to include any extra text!**Outputting JSON Category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to just provide the required JSON response as plain text. It looks like I should include only the category field inside the object as specified by the schema, which makes sense. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. \n\nThis keeps things simple and in line with the instructions. Perfect! Just need to make sure it\u2019s formatted correctly."
