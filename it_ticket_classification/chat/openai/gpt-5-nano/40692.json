It really seems like this falls under an access issue, so the best category would likely be \"Access\" or maybe \"Administrative Rights.\" Based on the context, it doesn\u2019t seem related to hardware or storage at all.**Determining ticket category**\n\nBased on the ticket, it seems the best category is either \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" The user references a server authentication issue, which aligns more with access problems. I should respond with a JSON object that follows the required format. The appropriate output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll make sure to avoid adding any extra commentary since the instructions are clear about formatting. Let's keep it simple and direct!"
