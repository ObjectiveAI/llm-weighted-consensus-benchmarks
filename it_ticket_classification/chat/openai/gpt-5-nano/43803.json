The options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It doesn\u2019t seem to fit Hardware, HR, or Storage. \"Access\" could be relevant, as it could involve permissions. \"Miscellaneous\" feels a bit too generic. I\u2019m weighing my options here!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe user's issue mentions \"empty excels when trying to download reports,\" which seems more about the content being empty rather than access restrictions. I\u2019m contemplating whether it\u2019s a permissions issue affecting data retrieval. While it might fit \"Miscellaneous\" due to the generic nature, \"Access\" could be relevant if insufficient permissions cause these empty files. However, the description doesn't mention access being denied. I'm torn between \"Software,\" \"Access,\" or possibly \"Storage\" based on the context!**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m debating whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" but those don\u2019t quite fit. The user's issue with \"empty excels when trying to download reports\" seems more like a software bug related to Excel exports. Since there's no specific \"Software/Applications\" category listed, \"Miscellaneous\" is likely the best choice for unknown issues like this. I plan to respond with a JSON object simply stating the category as \"Miscellaneous.\"{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
