The message mentions disabling a mailbox and references \"Leading the Way,\" suggesting it's related to an internal project or possibly access issues. The key phrases include disabling shared mailboxes and requesting assistance. The content indicates it's likely about internal project management. So, I think it fits best in the Internal Project or Access category.**Classifying Mailbox Request**\n\nThe user talks about a \"shared mailbox,\" mentioning things like \"disable\" and \"delete,\" with references to a project possibly named \"Leading the Way.\" I have several category options like Internal Project, Access, and Administrative rights. Since disabling a mailbox relates to access control, I think \u201cAccess\u201d fits best. This request isn\u2019t asking for admin rights but rather for disabling mailbox access. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \u201cAccess\u201d and prepare to output the category in the required format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with just the JSON object for categorizing the IT ticket. The prompt specifies the allowed categories and requires that I follow the provided schema. Previously, I've classified this as \"Access,\" so I should stick to that. My final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll make sure to avoid any extra commentary and keep it clean."
