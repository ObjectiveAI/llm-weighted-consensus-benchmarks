The categories available in the schema include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the phrase might relate to Oracle database software, I'm thinking it could fall under a relevant category, but the user's lack of details makes it tricky to decide. I need to respond in the correct JSON format!**Analyzing IT Ticket Categories**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the categories available for the IT ticket, which include Access, Administrative rights, Internal Project, Purchase, Hardware, Storage, Miscellaneous, and HR Support. The phrase \"oracle de friday december pot\" suggests it might relate to Oracle software, possibly implying it's about a database or an internal project. However, there's no specific software category. My best guesses might be \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access,\" but it could also be helpful to ask the user for clarification instead of making assumptions.**Deciding on Category Output**\n\nThe system prompt requires a specific category object. Since responding with a clarifying question wouldn\u2019t fit the format, I need to choose a category directly. The phrase \"oracle de friday december pot\" seems to relate to software rather than hardware, but there's no \"Software\" category listed. The closest options are \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" Given the ambiguity of the phrase, I\u2019ll classify it as \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll format the output as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} without any extra text."
