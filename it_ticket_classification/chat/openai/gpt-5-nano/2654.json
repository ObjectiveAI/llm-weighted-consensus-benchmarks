It seems to be about errors with submitting time entries and involves contacting an administrator. This might fall under \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it pertains to time entry submission errors, it could also relate to \"Access\" if there are permission issues. I\u2019m considering which category fits best based on available options.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket repeatedly mentions \"administrator,\" suggesting it could relate to administrative tasks or permissions. This makes \"Administrative rights\" a likely category since it involves a time entry submission error due to permissions. However, \"Internal Project\" could also be relevant if it\u2019s project-specific. The user asked me to categorize the ticket and provided some text. I need to format my response as a JSON object that includes the correct category. I\u2019m making sure to choose wisely!**Classifying the ticket**\n\nThe user's message highlights errors with submitting time entries and repeatedly mentions \"administrator,\" which implies they might need admin help for fixing issues within an application. This points towards the \"Administrative rights\" category rather than \"Miscellaneous,\" though the text is a bit messy. Given the administrator's role, I\u2019m confident in choosing \"Administrative rights.\" I need to provide my answer as a JSON object with a \"category\" field, so I\u2019ll format my response accordingly.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
