I should consider the category options: it could fall under \"Administrative rights,\" \"Purchase\" (since they mention \"please order\"), or maybe \"Internal Project\" if it's related to a specific project. I'll choose the category that best fits!**Choosing a category**\n\nI need to select a category from the given options. The request mentions terms related to installation and procurement, specifically \"install\" and \"order.\" The \"order\" makes me lean toward \"Purchase,\" as it indicates they want to procure something. However, since installation is also involved, I could consider \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" Yet, focusing on the primary nature of the request, \"Purchase\" seems to be the best fit.
