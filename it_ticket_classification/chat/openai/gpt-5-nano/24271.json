The key phrases suggest it relates to onboarding, which likely falls under \"HR Support.\" I could also consider \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" but the terminology strongly indicates it's HR-related, especially when it mentions a starter form. It\u2019s important to ensure that it fits within the correct IT category.**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket that mentions a new starter in Bucharest and a request for assistance with a starter form. This likely focuses on onboarding. I could categorize this as \"HR Support,\" as it pertains to new employee processes. While \"Access\" could fit if there were a direct mention of access rights, it seems more appropriate to classify this as an HR-related issue, specifically for onboarding. It\u2019s really about the assistance needed with the form.**Deciding on the IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket categories and think \"HR Support\" fits best because it relates to the onboarding process and the starter form mentioned. Other options could include \"Administrative rights,\" but that doesn't seem to apply since there's no mention of admin access. Since the content clearly indicates help with onboarding, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" I'll respond using the required JSON format: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. A brief note could also be helpful, just to clarify my choice."
