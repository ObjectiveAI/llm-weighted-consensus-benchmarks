The possible categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket discusses importing grade changes and may relate to a process for updating grades. It doesn't seem hardware-related, so I\u2019m considering \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" I'll select a fitting category soon!**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI have a few categories to choose from: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The user's message might suggest \"Internal Project,\" potentially related to a data import process, or perhaps \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Administrative rights\" wouldn't fit since it relates to access permissions, which aren't mentioned. The ticket talks about grade changes and forecasting, indicating it\u2019s likely a data import task. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\"**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI need to output a JSON with a category field as a string since the user asked me to categorize an IT ticket. The required format specifies that I present it as a JSON object with the \"type\" set as \"object.\" So, I\u2019ll structure it like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I want to ensure I avoid any extra content because the spec emphasizes responding strictly with the JSON. I'll keep it clean and straightforward!"
