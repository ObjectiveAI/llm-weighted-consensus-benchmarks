It mentions a \"new starter\" and a few details about a form needed at the Tudor Center. There are typos that make it tricky to interpret, but it seems like they might want help with onboarding forms. I think this could fit under categories like \u201cHR Support,\u201d \u201cAccess,\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d It\u2019s all a bit muddled, so careful thought is needed here.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing categories for an IT ticket, and it seems that the terms \"new starter\" and \"administration officer\" point to an HR onboarding process. This could fit under \u201cHR Support\u201d or, potentially, \u201cAccess,\u201d especially since new starters often need system access. However, since they refer to the administration officer, it leans more towards HR. Ultimately, I\u2019m thinking \u201cHR Support\u201d is the best match, given the context of the request.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m assessing how to classify this IT ticket, specifically regarding an onboarding process. Typically, such requests fall under \u201cHR Support.\u201d However, there's mention of a \"starter form\" that hints at something related to access and new user setup, making \u201cAccess\u201d another potential fit. The ticket's wording is quite jumbled, which complicates things. Since it's an IT ticket and mentions both onboarding and access, I think \u201cHR Support\u201d might still be the most straightforward choice here.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
