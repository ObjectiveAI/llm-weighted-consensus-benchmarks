The details mention \"meeting room TV,\" \"TV cables,\" and \"cannot share screens,\" indicating a hardware problem. It's clear this isn\u2019t related to HR Support, Access, or any internal projects. So, I\u2019ll classify this under the \"Hardware\" category. My output will be a JSON-like object with the field \"category\" set to \"Hardware.\"**Formatting Output for IT Ticket**\n\nI need to produce the output in a specific JSON-like format with a category field. The user requested to categorize an IT ticket, and it seems they expect a straightforward category label. While the schema indicates I should provide a structure, the essential answer is simply {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. However, to ensure I meet the schema requirements, I\u2019ll focus on returning just the chosen category value, which is \"Hardware.\" This keeps it clear and compliant!**Determining the Response Format**\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about how to respond to the categorization request for the IT ticket. From previous tasks, it seems the user simply wants the category string itself. However, there are mentions of needing a structured JSON object. The safest approach is to provide: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This matches the expected format and aligns with the allowed values. I\u2019ll keep my answer concise by sticking to just the category object with no extra text or details."
