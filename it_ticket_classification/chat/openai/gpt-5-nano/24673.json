They provided a string that mentions changing something related to December and requests an update for an area in Singapore. It could fall under several categories, like \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d \u201cInternal Project,\u201d or \u201cAccess.\u201d The phrase about updating might imply it's about access rights. So, I think \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d is the most fitting category since it involves permissions related to the right person.**Clarifying ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m trying to sort out the category for this IT ticket, which includes options like \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The user\u2019s request about updating the December project manager and assigning someone for the area in Singapore hints at an \u201cInternal Project\u201d category, as it relates to internal tasks. There's mention of needing to change the PM, but it leans more towards project management than simply access rights. So, I'd say this ticket fits best under \u201cInternal Project.\u201d**Generating JSON category object**\n\nI need to format a JSON-like category object for the IT ticket. Based on the instructions, I should categorize the ticket, and considering it mentions \"December PM change\" and assignments for the area in Singapore, I think \"Internal Project\" fits best. The final output should strictly follow the required format without any extra text, focusing only on the category. So, I\u2019ll simply output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
