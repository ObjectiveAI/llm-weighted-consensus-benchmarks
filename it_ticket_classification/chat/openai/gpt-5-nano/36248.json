The message includes phrases like \"connection not working\" and \"can connect through cable only,\" which suggests a problem with network connectivity. I\u2019m considering the categories available: \u201cAccess,\u201d \u201cHardware,\u201d or \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d Although \u201cAccess\u201d typically refers to login issues, \u201cHardware\u201d could relate to physical network components like a wireless adapter since it seems the wireless isn\u2019t functioning. I need to decide which category fits best.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding between \u201cAccess\u201d and \u201cHardware\u201d for this IT ticket. The user's mention of \"connection not working\" indicates a network issue, not necessarily access problems. The phrase \"connection through cable only\" suggests that wireless isn't working, hinting at connectivity hardware issues like the NIC or router. Since the user didn't mention login issues and because \"was working Friday\" implies intermittent problems, it seems safest to classify this under \u201cHardware\u201d due to the focus on connectivity. However, \"Access\" could apply too since they can\u2019t connect wirelessly.**Choosing the category**\n\nFor the IT ticket, I\u2019m considering the best category. The user mentions they can\u2019t access the network wirelessly but can through a cable. This makes me think \"Access\" might relate to system access, rather than network issues. However, \"Hardware\" is more fitting because it focuses on connectivity hardware problems, particularly wireless ones. So, to categorize the ticket per the schema, I'll stick with \"Hardware\" as the category value. The final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
