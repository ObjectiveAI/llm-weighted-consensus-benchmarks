It's important to assess the ticket's content carefully to ensure it fits into the most appropriate category. I want to do my best to make sure the categorization is accurate and helpful for the team!**Analyzing the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket text is about an issue with a public holiday not showing correctly in the calendar view. The customer is asking for help in rectifying their timecard and mentions submitting their leave code for the public holiday but needing to notify someone. It sounds like they can only see working hours instead of the usual setup. I need to gather information on how to assist with reopening and resubmitting the timecard properly.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket seems related to HR and timekeeping, so the category 'HR Support' feels appropriate. It doesn't fit under 'Administrative rights' or 'Access' since it's an internal issue about a timecard. Therefore, I will categorize it as 'HR Support.' I need to respond in the required JSON format, which includes a \"category\" field with allowed values. I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra text, just the JSON output like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
