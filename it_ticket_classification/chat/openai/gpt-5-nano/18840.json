It could fit as an internal project or something miscellaneous, but what\u2019s unclear is the exact nature of the request. Since it could pertain to project management, I'd like to ask for more details to be sure.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI need to determine the best fit for the user's request. \"PM\" likely refers to \"Project Management,\" and they ask to \"add post,\" which might relate to an internal forum or social platform. I\u2019m considering whether to categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" It feels like it could be more relevant to \"Internal Project.\" There's also a possibility for \"Administrative rights\" if they need posting permissions, but I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project.\" I'll respond in the required JSON format.**Preparing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on delivering the necessary JSON format for the categorization task. The best guess is to categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" So, I\u2019ll produce the output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.\n\nI\u2019m also considering whether I should ask the user clarifying questions to ensure accuracy, but the primary task is just categorization. The instructions are clear that they want a concise category response, so I\u2019ll stick with what I\u2019ve decided for now."
