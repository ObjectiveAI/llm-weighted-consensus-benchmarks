It might relate to access rights or ownership assignments. The phrase \"make owner\" clearly signals a need for admin rights or ownership definition. Since the core of the request is about permissions and ownership control, I believe \"Administrative rights\" fits best, as it's a subcategory of Access.**Clarifying Category Assignment**\n\nI need to categorize the user's request, which is a bit tricky to parse. It seems they want to create something for their application related to address display name members and possibly make someone the owner. This mention of \"owner\" hints at a need for administrative rights. I\u2019m considering categorizing it as either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" I should prepare to respond with a JSON object format that includes the appropriate category.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nThe prompt clearly instructs that I need to output a JSON object with a category field, choosing from specified strings. Based on the ticket's mention of \"owner\" and the need to \"move forward,\" it seems appropriate to select \"Administrative rights.\" I must ensure my JSON matches the given schema exactly. So, I\u2019ll respond with the precise format: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}, without adding any extra text. This way, I\u2019ll follow the user's request accurately!"
