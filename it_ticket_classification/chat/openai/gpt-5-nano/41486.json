I notice the repeated mention of \"approval,\" which likely relates to permissions or rights. Since this seems to involve an issue while trying to approve access, I conclude that \"Access\" is the best category. This particularly refers to an error tied to administrative rights in the Oracle system.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI see the subject \"Oracle approval error.\" It might indicate a need for specific \"Administrative rights\" to approve something. But since \"Administrative rights\" are a type of access, I want to consider if this is about approving a purchase order or a property listing, especially since it mentions \"one particular showing.\" The error likely relates to access permissions in the Oracle system. I conclude that \"Access\" is the appropriate category for this ticket, focusing on the rights needed to resolve the approval error."
