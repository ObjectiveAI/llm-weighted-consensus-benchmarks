The user has mentioned various phrases like \"problem issue\" and \"reminder calendar.\" It's clear this doesn't fall under hardware, HR, or access. I keep debating whether it should be \"Administrative rights,\" but that doesn't feel quite right. \"Miscellaneous\" seems to fit best for a general IT issue, so I think I'll categorize it as that.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI'm considering if the ticket should be categorized as \"Administrative rights\" since it mentions setting a calendar reminder for Friday. It also references certificates, which could imply \"Purchase,\" but it doesn't seem to fit because the user isn't asking to buy anything. Although it could lean towards \"Access,\" that feels uncertain. Ultimately, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the safest choice since it's a generic IT task. I'll present the output in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
