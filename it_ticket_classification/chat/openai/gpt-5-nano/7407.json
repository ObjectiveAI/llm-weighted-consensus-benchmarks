The ticket includes various mentions of things like \"leaver\" and \"mailbox,\" along with details about rights and inventory, which makes it somewhat complex. I should consider the allowed categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll examine the content closely to select the most appropriate category that accurately fits the ticket's content.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket involves an employee leaving and several details related to access, such as \"leaver form,\" \"AD rights,\" and \"mailbox.\" It seems to fit best in the \"Access\" category since it pertains to deprovisioning. Although I considered \"Administrative rights\" due to the mention of AD rights, \u201cAccess\u201d feels more appropriate as it covers a broader spectrum here. There's also a bit that relates to \"HR Support,\" but it's primarily about IT processes for leavers, so \"Access\" seems ideal for categorization.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
