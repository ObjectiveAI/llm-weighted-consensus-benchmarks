The ticket mentions issues with a web app, collaborating on documents, and an error when clicking on a document. It also references browser compatibility and network settings like an IP address and gateway. Given all that, I should classify it under \"Access\" since it primarily revolves around access to documents in the web app and related error messages.**Classifying Ticket Category**\n\nIt looks like I should classify this ticket under the \"Access\" category since the primary issue revolves around accessing documents in a web app and the associated error. There are mentions of a laptop and network details, but these seem secondary to the access problem. I also see references to browser compatibility. Based on all this, categorizing it as \"Access\" feels like the most accurate choice. Now I\u2019ll prepare that in a JSON format specifying the category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
