The ticket text references a \"leaver form\" for an employee, so it's about offboarding, covering access removal, mailboxes, and associated rights. The appropriate category seems to be \"Access,\" as it captures the main theme of user offboarding and access removal. Therefore, I'll respond with a JSON object categorizing this as \"Access.\"**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nThe prompt is clear: I need to categorize an IT ticket based on the given text. The output should be a JSON-like object following a specific schema. I'll produce a simple JSON object like {\"category\":\"Access\"} to fit this format. Since the instructions emphasize only responding with this information and not including extra explanations, I'll make sure the final output contains just that JSON object. So, it'll look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That's all I need to do!"
