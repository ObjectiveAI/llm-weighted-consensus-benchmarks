Additionally, phrases like \"new tuesday march pm\" seem to relate to scheduling, but they seem less relevant here.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nGiven the request, I should categorize it as \"Internal Project\" since it's about creating a new project area and adding owners. It's not related to hardware, storage, purchase, HR, or access, which involves granting access rather than project ownership. \n\nThe response format is important; I need to provide this as a JSON object. Based on the system's requirements, I will respond with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I'll keep it clean with no extra text.**Verifying project category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" since \"add owners\" implies some access rights. However, the main focus seems to be on creating something called \"AGILE AREA SCALING,\" which points more toward an \"Internal Project.\" \n\nSo, my best guess is still \"Internal Project.\" I'll finalize the categorization based on this reasoning and prepare to present my conclusion. Let's go ahead and produce that final categorization!"
