The user seems to be requesting a laptop riser due to neck and back pain caused by a height difference with their monitor. It looks like they want to purchase this riser to create a more ergonomic setup. Given this, it fits best in the \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase\" category. I'll lean towards \"Purchase\" since it\u2019s explicitly about ordering equipment.**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, and the user is requesting a laptop raiser for better ergonomics. This falls under hardware, but also implies a purchase. I see two potential categories: \"Purchase\" and \"Hardware.\" The mention of \"purchase raiser\" suggests procurement, making \"Purchase\" a stronger option. However, there's also a note about an ergonomic position and a mention of escalation for Friday\u2014it's a bit unclear. Given all this, I'll decide on \"Purchase\" for clarity and accuracy.**Determining Category for IT Ticket**\n\nThe main request is about a laptop raiser, and the user emphasizes \"purchase raiser,\" indicating this is a procurement request for an ergonomic accessory. Since there are distinct categories for \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase\" in the system, \"Purchase\" seems to fit best here. I need to provide a JSON object formatted according to the defined schema. So I\u2019ll deliver it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nI won't add extra commentary; I\u2019ll keep it concise and straightforward.**Delivering Category Object**\n\nI see the instruction to respond with a category object, so it\u2019s clear I need to proceed with that. I'll make sure to deliver it as stated, ensuring it meets the required format. This should be straightforward, and I want to make sure the user receives exactly what they need. Alright, let\u2019s get that category object presented properly!"
