The ticket text discusses adding a special leave type for natural disasters, which suggests it falls under HR/Leave management. It seems there's an \"HR Support\" option available, which is fitting since the request is about adding a new leave type regulated under the agreement sector. So, it\u2019s indeed HR-related and not about hardware or access.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the ticket as \"HR Support.\" Now, I need to format the response correctly as a JSON object specifically, based on the instructions provided. The schema indicates that the output must have a \"category\" field with the value \"HR Support.\" It\u2019s critical I follow this exact structure without adding any extra text or formatting. So, my final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
