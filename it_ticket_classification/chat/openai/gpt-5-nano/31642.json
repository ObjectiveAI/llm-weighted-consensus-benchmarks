                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket from a garbled user message. The request mentions Confluence, asking to remove something on Friday PM, and mentions obsolete content with some complex phrasing about subsidiaries and liabilities. It seems like they want to remove old Confluence spaces or pages, which makes me think this might fit best under \"Administrative rights.\" I'll need to parse the message carefully to ensure I categorize it appropriately.**Narrowing Down the Category**\n\nThe user\u2019s request mentions \"remove Friday PM,\" which makes it tricky to categorize. It could involve \"Access\" since it\u2019s related to Confluence, but it seems more focused on removal. Given the category options, if this is about obsolete Confluence pages, it might align with \"Administrative rights\" since it involves admin tasks. However, if it\u2019s project-related, \"Internal Project\" could fit too. My goal is to categorize this correctly for effective triage, but which is best?**Determining the Right Category**\n\nIt looks like the user\u2019s request is about removing an obsolete Confluence page or space, which strongly suggests an administrative task. \"Internal Project\" might be suitable if it's specific to a project, while \"Miscellaneous\" could fit if the details are unclear. However, \"Access\" seems less relevant since it's about content removal. The mention of corporate structure implies there might be regulatory aspects involved. Ultimately, I feel \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d or \u201cInternal Project\u201d are the best fits for the categorization.**Categorizing the Confluence Request**\n\nThe ticket mentions a \"Confluence request to remove... obsolete,\" which suggests it\u2019s an internal maintenance task. I\u2019m considering categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" since there's no request for access, just content removal. \"Administrative rights\" focus on permission changes, which doesn\u2019t apply here because removing content is more about management. If it's unclear, \"Miscellaneous\" might work, but I want to choose a single relevant category. So, I think \"Internal Project\" fits best for maintaining and decommissioning old Confluence spaces.**Finalizing the Category Output**\n\nI want to ensure I mention \"Confluence cleanup\" since it relates to this task, but can\u2019t add new categories. The final response should adhere to the required format, which is a JSON-like object with a \"category\" key from the provided list. The prompt clearly states to categorize the IT ticket, so I will format my answer as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.\n\nI\u2019ll double-check that I\u2019m not including any unnecessary text, just the JSON object with proper casing. So, my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
