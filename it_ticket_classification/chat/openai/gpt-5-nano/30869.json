The ticket content seems noisy, but it's focused on network changes, specifically for New Jersey. It mentions needing a completed form and order details, alongside references to starting projects and availability for additional information. I\u2019ll sift through this and make sure to classify it accurately based on those key points.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThis ticket seems focused on network changes, possibly fitting best under \"Internal Project\" since that relates to the modifications required for the New Jersey notification. There\u2019s no direct \"Networking\" category. \"Access\" might apply if \"PM\" refers to a project manager, but it\u2019s not clear. I guess I should categorize it as \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous\" if the details don\u2019t neatly fit. Ultimately, I'll need to include a category field in the JSON output for clarity.**Outputting category JSON**\n\nI\u2019m ready to respond with the category object. Since the ticket discusses network changes for a project involving New Jersey, the best fit seems to be \"Internal Project.\" I need to follow the required JSON format as specified. It clearly states that the output should be a single JSON object with the property \"category\" defined as a string.\n\nSo, my final response will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Keeping it minimal as instructed!"
