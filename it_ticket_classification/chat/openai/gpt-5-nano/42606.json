The options we have include \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" and a few others. Given that the issue revolves around physical access control, it seems that \"Access\" is the most appropriate category. Although \"Hardware\" could also apply since the access card is a physical device, the focus here is on access management.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing the ticket as \"Access\" since it primarily deals with access control and the provisioning of a new access card. Although \"Hardware\" could apply because the access card is a physical item, the main focus is really on access management. The phrase \u201csi se sa alt card va\u201d seems to have some Spanish or Portuguese in it, but that doesn't change my category choice. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It might help to add a brief justification too!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
