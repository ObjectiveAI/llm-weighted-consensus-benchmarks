It talks about \"Admin rights,\" with phrases like \u201ctouch teams\u201d and \u201cexpenditure type.\u201d Typically, we categorize tickets into areas like Purchase or Administrative rights, but this feels more aligned with finance and governance due to terms like \"cost centres\" and policy mentions. They detail various expenditures, suggesting it could be about cost center types or perhaps an internal project. It's a bit of a puzzle!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user mentions \"new cc categories and expenditure type list,\" indicating they want to categorize this as \"Purchase\" due to its focus on procurement. In the schema, allowed categories include Hardware, HR Support, and Purchase, among others. Given the context, \"Purchase\" seems to be the best fit. The user asked to \u201cCategorize this IT Ticket,\u201d so I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object specifically formatted as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} without any extra text."
