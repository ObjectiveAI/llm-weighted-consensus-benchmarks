While HR Support could fit, the ticket touches on IT aspects, like setting up access for a new starter. It seems that categorizing this as Access could more accurately capture the intent since it involves system access.**Evaluating category options**\n\nI see there\u2019s an \"Access\" category that fits for getting system access, but the user asks for help with a \"starter form,\" which suggests an onboarding context. It might lean towards \"Administrative rights,\" but that's not clearly indicated. \"Miscellaneous\" is an option if I can't decide. However, since the request is about a new starter and involves onboarding, categorizing this ticket as \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit.**Determining category for ticket**\n\nThe user provided details about a new starter and requested help with a \"starter form,\" possibly for onboarding. This gives me two main categories to consider: \"HR Support\" and \"Access.\" The phrase \"please help by filling out starter form\" suggests it's primarily HR related, which traditionally handles onboarding. However, since it\u2019s in an IT context, there's the potential for \"Access,\" but without any clear mention of login issues. I think the best category would be \"HR Support.\"{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
