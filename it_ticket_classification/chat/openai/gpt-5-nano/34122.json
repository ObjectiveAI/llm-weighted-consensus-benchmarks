It seems the user is having issues with Outlook, specifically errors while sending from a web app, and possibly a server error. Phrases like \"remote server returned\" and references to \"resolver found with server id\" and technical details like \"content transfer encoding binary\" suggest some deeper issues. This will definitely require careful handling to resolve the user's concerns effectively!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nIn categorizing this IT ticket, I have a list of options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and others, but I see \"Security\" is missing. The user's issue with Outlook involves sending emails and a server error indicated by \"remote server returned.\" This isn't precisely an access issue; it's more about troubleshooting. Given the limited categories, \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the safest option, as \"Access\" is not entirely accurate in this case. So, I'll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous.\""
