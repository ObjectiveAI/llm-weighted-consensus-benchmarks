The categories I can work with are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights \u2014 but there's no \"Software\" category. Since this ticket relates to a software issue, the nearest fit would likely be either Miscellaneous or Access. So I'll go with one of those for the JSON output. Let's see what makes the most sense!**Evaluating ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize the IT ticket regarding the referral tool not accepting attachments. It could possibly be \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative Rights\" if it's about permissions. However, since the main concern is about attachments, I think \"Access\" fits because it may relate to upload permissions. Yet, it could also be classified as \"Miscellaneous,\" given that it doesn't neatly align with the other categories. Since there's no clear mention of rights or defect, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Miscellaneous.\"**Finalizing category response**\n\nAfter reviewing the options, I\u2019m confident that \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit for this IT ticket regarding the referral tool and attachments. Since categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Storage,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Hardware\" don\u2019t apply, I\u2019ll stick with \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\nI need to respond with a JSON object, structured according to the instructions. So, I\u2019ll produce: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. This ensures I follow the schema correctly without adding any extra text. Alright, let's finalize it!"
