The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The user sent a somewhat messy ticket, so my goal here is to identify which category fits best. I'll review the text and pick the most appropriate category to ensure it gets addressed correctly.**Analyzing incident report**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a messy content related to various incidents, specifically mentioning shared infrastructure and issues with polls being down, some marked critical or high priority. This makes it sound like it could fit under \"Operations\" or \"Infra,\" but the available categories are limited to Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. None of these categories seem to fit perfectly, which makes categorizing a bit tricky!**Considering ticket categorization**\n\nI'm weighing the options for categorizing this ticket. \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a safe choice since it's a generic ticket related to incident management. Alternatively, \"Internal Project\" could fit if it\u2019s specifically about infrastructure, which the mention of \"shared infrastructure\" suggests. However, there\u2019s no \"Infrastructure\" category. The mention of \"visitor card incidents\" leans me towards \"Access,\" but I realize that \"Access\" is indeed an available category. Overall, it seems tricky!**Examining IT ticket details**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize this IT ticket, and there's a lot going on here. The mentions of \"remove from Wednesday ooh report\" and \"summary out\" suggest it might involve generating or editing a report, possibly indicating an \"Internal Project.\" I need to look closely at the keywords. The phrases point towards incident management related to shared infrastructure and even a project that could humorously be named \"ancient golf.\" My best guess for categorizing it might be \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access.\"**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI'm considering that \"Ancient Golf\" could relate to an environment involving multiple polls down and critical network infrastructure incidents. The best fit might be \"Internal Project,\" but since \"Infrastructure\" isn\u2019t an option, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" since none of the categories perfectly match. The user asked to categorize this IT ticket, so I need to respond in the required JSON format. After careful thought, the safest option seems to be \"Miscellaneous.\" My final output will be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
