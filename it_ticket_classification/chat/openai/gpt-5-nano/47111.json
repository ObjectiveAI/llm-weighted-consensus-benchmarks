They mention migration, image errors, and document uploads, but it's a bit garbled. It seems related to space upload and possibly permissions. The options include categories like Storage, Access, and Internal Project. Given the mention of uploading and space, I'm leaning towards Storage for eligibility. Access could also fit if this involves permissions. I\u2019ll break down the details to categorize it correctly!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the user's message, which mentions \"migration\" and \"client also can use space to upload update documents.\" This seems to relate to permissions and accessing shared drive space. It could fit into the \"Storage\" category due to issues with uploading and accessing images. Alternatively, \"Access\" might apply because it sounds like there are access rights concerns for other users. Given all this, I'm leaning toward \"Storage,\" especially when considering the context around document uploads!**Formatting the response**\n\nI\u2019m considering that \u201cmigration\u201d suggests a system migration, but since the user wants me to categorize an IT ticket, I\u2019ll focus on just providing that category. The format requires me to respond with a JSON object, specifically outlining the category based on defined options. Given that \"Storage\" fits best, I\u2019ll output the category as a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I'll make sure it\u2019s clean and follows the specified schema, with no extra text needed!"
