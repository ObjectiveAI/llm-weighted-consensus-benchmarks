I'll take care to ensure the categorization aligns with the user's need!**Finalizing Ticket Categorization**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket regarding issues logging in guests through a web app. It seems like they\u2019re having trouble with access, specifically when trying to log in as a guest user for meetings. So, \"Access\" seems to be the right category. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object since the format requires it. \n\nI\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Keeping it straightforward is important, so I won't include any extra commentary!**Outputting Response Format**\n\nThe response format directs me to provide a JSON object with the required category field, which means no additional text or commentary should be included. It's clear that I need to focus on delivering just the necessary information in the specified format. So, I'll get right to it and answer with the precise JSON structure without any extra information. Let's proceed!"
