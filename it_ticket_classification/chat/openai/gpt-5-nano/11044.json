Phrases like \"please fill enclosed starter form\" and \"short notice appointment\" suggest this relates to HR processes. It sounds like the category most fitting is \"HR Support,\" possibly leaning toward \"Administrative rights\" too.**Selecting ticket category**\n\nI'm looking at the categories available, which include \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket's content suggests it's related to onboarding, mentioning a starter form and a new starter joining soon. While there could be a case for \"Administrative rights\" if access is needed, there's no clear indication of that. The term \"starter form\" indicates an HR function \u2014 it\u2019s clearly for creating accounts. Therefore, I think \u201cHR Support\u201d is the best category for this ticket.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nThe ticket is in the IT system, but it seems to involve HR tasks like onboarding forms. \"Administrative rights\" would fit if there was a need for admin access, but that's not specified. Categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" don't apply. \"Access\" could work if there were indications of needing to access resources, but it's not explicit. So, I\u2019ve decided to categorize this as \"HR Support\" and will respond with the appropriate JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
