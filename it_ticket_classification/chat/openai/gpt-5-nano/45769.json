The user is expressing difficulty using their conference phone in a conference room, so it likely relates to Audio/Phone equipment. I\u2019m debating the best category: Administrative rights doesn't seem right; Access might fit for external lines; but Hardware seems to be the most appropriate since they're specifically mentioning the phone in use. This might lean towards hardware issues.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m sorting through the ticket categories. \"Hardware\" fits well since it's about conference room phone hardware, and \"Access\" might work if it involves external calls. However, it seems more about device functionality rather than system access. The user clearly mentions issues making outside calls from their conference phone. While \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback, I believe \"Hardware\" is the right choice. Now, I\u2019ll prepare the final answer in the required JSON format.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
