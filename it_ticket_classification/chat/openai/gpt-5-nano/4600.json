I'll create a JSON object with \"category\": \"Hardware.\"**Finalizing category classification**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether the category might be \"Internal Project,\" but that doesn't seem likely. \"Administrative rights\" is out too. \"Purchase\" could apply if they are trying to get a temporary phone, but it sounds like they want a replacement for a lost phone. So, the most fitting category is clearly \"Hardware.\" \n\nI\u2019ll format the JSON object correctly: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} and respond only with this JSON without any extra commentary."
