It seems the message is indicating a delivery failure because the recipient's mailbox is full during maintenance. The text mentions issues like \u201cundeliverable notification\u201d and \u201cpermanent exception.\u201d I want to label this ticket accurately, as it pertains to a failed email delivery due to full mailboxes. I'll take a closer look at the details for proper categorization.**Categorizing IT ticket issue**\n\nThe text mentions several phrases indicating an email delivery failure due to a \"full mailbox.\" Given that context, it seems the ticket relates to an \"undeliverable notification.\" To categorize it, I have options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Storage,\" and several others. Since the issue is tied to mailbox storage, \"Storage\" feels like the best fit. While \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" might seem relevant, they don\u2019t quite match. I'll classify it as \"Storage\" and prepare to respond in a JSON format.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI see that the prompt includes a category schema, so I need to provide a JSON object with the \"category\" field set to one of the enumerated options. Since the ticket relates to a full mailbox, I\u2019ll respond with: \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}\n\nI should keep this concise, following the user's instruction to output in the specified format without extra commentary. It seems they specifically want just the category, so I'll stick to that. Alright, let's finalize this response!"
