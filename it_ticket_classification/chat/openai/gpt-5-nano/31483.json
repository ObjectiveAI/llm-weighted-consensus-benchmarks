The message also mentions an attachment, suggesting they might want to add some people to these resources. Overall, it looks like it's about managing resources for a project or initiative.**Categorizing ticket for triage**\n\nThe available categories are limited to eight, and if I'm unsure, I could use \"Miscellaneous\" as a safe choice. However, for ticket triage, \"Internal Project\" seems most appropriate. There's also \"Access,\" but there's nothing explicit about permissions or access needs. Since the user asked for categorization, I'll go with \"Internal Project.\" I need to output a JSON object in the required format, so it\u2019ll look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That's straightforward!**Finalizing the output**\n\nI need to make sure I don't include any extra text, so the final answer will be straightforward: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It's important that I follow the expected format. I think I\u2019m ready to output this now! Keeping it clean and direct helps fulfill the user's requirements properly. Here we go!"
