The ticket mentions a new starter and an attached starter form, which makes me think it relates to onboarding. It could fit in either \"HR Support\" or \"Access,\" as they likely need access to systems for the new starter. However, the presence of the \"starter form\" suggests that \"HR Support\" might be the best category. This isn't about hardware, storage, or purchases.**Categorizing IT ticket for onboarding**\n\nThe IT ticket could fall under \"Access,\" but since it involves completing an attached starter form, it likely belongs in \"HR Support\" because onboarding is an HR function. While I considered \"Administrative rights,\" it doesn't fit as well. The best fit is clearly \"HR Support.\" The required output format is a JSON object specifying this category. Therefore, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} without any extra text, as per the instructions.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
