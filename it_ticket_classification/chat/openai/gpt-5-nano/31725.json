The category list includes options like Hardware, HR Support, and others. Since the ticket talks about monitors and DisplayPort, it clearly relates to hardware, so \"Hardware\" seems like the right choice. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format that includes the category. The final response will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI need to ensure the response perfectly matches the formatting requested in the prompt. The answer should be a JSON object categorizing the ticket, which I believe is \"Hardware\" based on the content about monitors and inputs. It could potentially be \"Purchase\" if it's about adapters, but since the focus is monitors, \"Hardware\" is the safer choice. I'll format the response as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to keep it clear and parsable, avoiding any unnecessary text.**Classifying the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s request is to categorize an IT ticket based on the provided categories, which include options like Hardware, HR Support, and Purchase. While \"Purchase\" could apply if they're looking to buy adapters, the mention of \"monitor inputs\" seems more hardware-related. Since there's no explicit request to buy, I think \"Hardware\" is the most suitable choice here, focusing on devices like monitors. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" and respond with {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
