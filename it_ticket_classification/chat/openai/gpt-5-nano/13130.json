This sounds like it might relate to access or administrative rights. It could also potentially fit into \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019m assessing where it best belongs!**Interpreting the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket centers on enabling a button to collate feedback, which seems to be a software function possibly requiring administrative rights. The user\u2019s phrasing is a bit unclear, but they mention \"Administrative rights\" and inquire about enabling the collate feedback button when feedback is approved. While it\u2019s not related to hardware, it might fit into \"Internal Project\" if it concerns a project feature. Overall, the category could be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but clarity is needed!**Determining the category for the ticket**\n\nThe user seems to be asking how to enable a \"collate feedbacks\" button after certain feedback statuses are approved, possibly looking for steps for automation. This could fit into \"Administrative rights\" as enabling features often requires admin privileges or \"Internal Project\" if it's an internal tool. They mention \"export feedback,\" indicating it may involve permissions, so \"Access\" might be the most relevant category since it deals with enabling functionalities after approvals. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" here!**Choosing the right category for the ticket**\n\nThe user likely wants to know how to enable the \"collate feedbacks\" button after certain feedbacks are approved. This could involve admin rights, but it might also be more about the process rather than just privileges. Their request suggests they can't access the collate button due to the feedback status, so it relates to permissions. I\u2019m deciding that \"Access\" is the most fitting category here. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object indicating the category as \"Access.\"**Structuring the output**\n\nThe instruction asks to categorize the IT ticket, and I realize the expected format is a JSON object as specified in the schema. I believe I should provide the category as \"Access.\" So, my output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI am considering whether there's any ambiguity. The user mentioned needing advice on enabling the collate feedbacks button when certain feedback statuses are approved. While \"Internal Project\" could also apply, \"Access\" seems most appropriate. So I'll stick to the JSON format without adding extra commentary."
