The user mentioned things like \"standardize signatures,\" \"active directory,\" and \"signature format.\" This seems related to automating email signatures, which typically falls under system administration tasks. Given that it involves Active Directory, I'm leaning toward \"Administrative rights\" or perhaps \"Internal Project.\" It could also be \"Miscellaneous,\" but I\u2019m fairly certain it's related to managing signatures through Active Directory.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the categorization of this IT ticket. It seems to involve standardizing signatures through Active Directory (AD), so there's a case for \"Internal Project.\" While \"Access\" could fit, that's usually more about user permissions, and this ticket mentions automated processes, which suggests it\u2019s more project-focused. The content also leans toward a structured approach to applying signatures, so I'd finalize it as \"Internal Project.\" I'll respond with a JSON object indicating that.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
