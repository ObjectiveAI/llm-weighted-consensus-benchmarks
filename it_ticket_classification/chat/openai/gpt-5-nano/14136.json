The ticket speaks to deactivation of commercial accounts, user offboarding, and access revocation, with references to AD rights, mailboxes, and roaming profiles. Given the categories available, \"Access\" seems appropriate for general access management, while \"Administrative rights\" pertains to elevated permissions. Since the main focus is on user account deactivation and offboarding, I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category here.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, which is clearly related to access deactivation, mailbox access, and AD rights. The best fit here is \"Access,\" so I'll format my response as a JSON object according to the required schema. The output must clearly state the category with the correct format, like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. There should be no extra text; I just want to ensure I'm delivering exactly what\u2019s needed!"
