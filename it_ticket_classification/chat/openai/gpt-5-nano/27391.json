The main focus is clearly on \"add printer,\" indicating it's likely a hardware issue. It might also fit under \"Purchase\" if they're requesting a new printer. However, since this involves a printer device, the best category seems to be \"Hardware.\" The phrase suggests they might want a printer installed in a specific location.**Finalizing category response**\n\nI'm thinking about whether this ticket could fall under \"Access\" if rights to connect to the printer are needed. However, since there\u2019s no mention of access rights, and it\u2019s primarily about \"add printer,\" the category should definitely be \"Hardware.\" I need to respond in the correct JSON format, as requested. The format should look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to follow these instructions precisely, without adding any extra text."
