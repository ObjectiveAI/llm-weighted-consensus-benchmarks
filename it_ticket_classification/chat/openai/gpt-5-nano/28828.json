The ticket text mentions tasks related to backing up a live environment and restoring it to a staging area. This indicates it's about storage and environment management. The closest category here is \"Storage,\" since backups directly relate to that. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as Storage and output a JSON object with that category.**Constructing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object containing the category. The valid channels require a specific format that includes a \"category\" type object. Given the task description, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.\n\nI must ensure the JSON is valid. The ticket mentions backups, which primarily fits under \"Storage.\" I do wonder if it could also relate to \"Internal Project,\" considering ongoing tasks, but given that storage backup tasks are the priority, I'll stick with \"Storage\" as the most appropriate category. So, I'll proceed with that answer."
