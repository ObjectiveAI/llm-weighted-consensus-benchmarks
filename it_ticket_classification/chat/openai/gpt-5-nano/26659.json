The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" \n\nThe text provided is pretty garbled, but it seems to refer to updates about employment type, which might fall under HR Support or Administrative Rights. I'll consider if it better fits an Internal Project too, but it really hinges on the context of employee status change mentioned.**Clarifying IT Ticket Categories**\n\nI need to clarify the categories for this IT ticket. \"HR Support\" relates to HR issues, while \"Administrative Rights\" concerns admin privileges, \"Access\" is for logins, and \"Internal Project\" covers project tasks. The ticket mentions updates for employment type hourly, which likely pertains to user accounts reflecting hourly employment. This requires HR data updates and likely involves \"Administrative Rights.\" \n\nIf I must choose one category, I\u2019d lean towards \"Administrative Rights\" or \"HR Support,\" since \"HR Support\" is on the allowed list after all!**Categorizing IT Ticket in JSON**\n\nYes, \"HR Support\" is indeed in the allowed categories! The user wants me to categorize the IT ticket, so I need to output a JSON object with the category string. \n\nSince the text mentions \"employment type hourly,\" it makes sense to categorize this as \"HR Support.\" So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} as the answer in the required JSON format. I see that I need to keep it simple and follow the instructions closely!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
