It touches on user off-boarding, de-provisioning, and access rights. I think \"Access\" fits best since it's specifically about access cards and related rights, although \"Administrative rights\" could be a possibility too. But I'll go with \"Access\" as the primary category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
