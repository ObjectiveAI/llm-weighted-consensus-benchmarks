It fit well into the \"Hardware\" category. If there's uncertainty, \"Miscellaneous\" might also work, but I think \"Hardware\" is more accurate. So, I'll prepare a JSON response to identify the category as \"Hardware.\" \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}**Clarifying IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe user's request includes a somewhat confusing statement about a video cable change at a station. It likely indicates a hardware task, so \"Hardware\" seems like the right category. I need to respond in the specified format as a JSON object, though I\u2019m a bit confused about whether to just provide the category value or the full object structure. However, since the instruction is clear about needing the category object, I\u2019ll go ahead and prepare it with \"Hardware.\" \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}**Finalizing category response**\n\nThe task requires responding with a JSON object that specifies the category, which in this case is \"Hardware.\" The schema shows that we only need to include the category field, so I\u2019ll keep it simple. It looks like there\u2019s no need for any extraneous explanation in the final response. After confirming that \"to video cable hi change station video cable\" indicates a hardware issue, I\u2019ll prepare the final answer as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
