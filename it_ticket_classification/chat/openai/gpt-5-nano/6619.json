The categories I'm considering include Access, Administrative rights, Internal Project, and Miscellaneous. It looks like the mention of \"change ownership\" fits well under Administrative rights since it's about permissions. Although Access could work too, I think Administrative rights is the most suitable category here, as it relates directly to distribution list ownership changes.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI see \u201cmailing list change\u201d and \u201cchange ownership\u201d mentioned multiple times, so \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d feels like the best fit. I could consider \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d but I should stick with the more precise option. Since I need to output a JSON object for the categorized IT ticket, it has to be formatted correctly based on the instructions. I\u2019m confirming that I\u2019ll write: \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nI need to be careful with the case of \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d since it must match the enumerated list."
