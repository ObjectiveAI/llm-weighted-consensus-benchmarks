Since password reset often falls under either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but doesn\u2019t explicitly request admin rights, \"Access\" seems the most fitting category. I\u2019ll format the response in JSON with the category field.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI see that I need to provide an output in a specific JSON format that includes a \"category\" field. The response should resemble a structured schema, so I should return something like `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. The instructions indicate I should stick to just the category value. It sounds like it's crucial to follow the format precisely, ensuring it aligns with the defined categories. The final output must comply with the required structure while being clear and concise.**Generating JSON category output**\n\nIt looks like I need to create a simple JSON object with a \"category\" field, which should just be `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. That's the format I need to stick to without adding any extra text. I'm keeping it short and to the point. I also want to ensure that I recognize any urgency or high priority indicated in the task, but since it still falls under Access, I should keep the focus on that category. Let's make this clear and concise!"
