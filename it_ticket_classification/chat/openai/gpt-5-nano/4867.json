It could fit \"Administrative rights\" due to access changes or \"Internal Project\" since it involves an internal tool. If it remains vague, \"Miscellaneous\" might be the safest bet. Given the focus on a project update, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best choice.**Selecting IT ticket category**\n\nI need to choose the best category for the ticket based on minimal information. The message mentions \"change title, change old git tool, please log,\" which could imply a need for \"Administrative rights\" if they're requesting a title change or access. However, there's no explicit mention of access permissions. Since \"old git tool\" relates to internal software, \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best. If they need admin access, that would lead to \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Internal Project\" is likely more appropriate here.**Categorizing IT request**\n\nThe user's message reads: \"title change old git tool,\" which likely indicates a request to change something in a project tool. The repetition of \"changes\" might just be a typo. They ask for a title change related to the \"old git tool\" and mention \"please log,\" which could mean they want to log this change or log into something. Given it\u2019s about a tool from an internal project, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best category. But there might be an \"Access\" category if \"log\" pertains to login credentials.**Choosing ticket category format**\n\nThe term \"log\" in their message might mean they want to log a change, which makes me think of the \"Administrative rights\" category for requests needing those permissions. However, it remains uncertain. In IT ticket classifications, requests like \"change title\" can fall under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" I should format the response like this: {\"category\": \"...\"}. Based on their request regarding an old git tool, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" If I'm unsure, \"Miscellaneous\" could be a safer fallback, but I lean towards \"Internal Project.\"{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
