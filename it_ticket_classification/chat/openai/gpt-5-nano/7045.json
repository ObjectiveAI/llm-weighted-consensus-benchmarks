Considering the context, it seems like \u201cInternal Project\u201d might be the best fit since it addresses projects. However, there's also a possibility of it falling under \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d if it\u2019s about access. I'll need to finalize my choice!**Finalizing the category selection**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the text again, and it doesn\u2019t mention anything about login or permissions, which makes \"Access\" less likely. \"Miscellaneous\" could fit, but the content seems specific to tasks like \u201cagent architecture design\u201d and \u201cautomation.\u201d My options are narrowing down to \u201cInternal Project\u201d or \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d and since it\u2019s clearly tied to internal tasks like architecture design and reviews, \"Internal Project\" feels like the right choice. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
