The key terms suggest it's related to adjusting mapping for transactions related to sponsorship versus donations. This seems like an internal IT project rather than a general request. Although \"Administrative rights\" could relate to access, there\u2019s no specific mention of needing permission. Mostly, it focuses on data and configuration, so I\u2019d categorize it as an Internal Project.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like the category \"Internal Project\" fits best here. I\u2019m thinking we should respond using a JSON format since the user asked to categorize the IT ticket. The required output is a JSON object with the category specified as a string enum. I\u2019ll keep it simple with: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. While \"Miscellaneous\" could be considered if there\u2019s uncertainty, I believe \"Internal Project\" is the most appropriate choice. Let's finalize this!"
