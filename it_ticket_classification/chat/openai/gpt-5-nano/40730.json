Although it\u2019s labeled as an IT ticket, I think \u201cHR Support\u201d is the most suitable category since it directly involves timekeeping and attendance processes.**Outputting category JSON**\n\nI need to prepare a JSON response with the category based on the user's ticket. It should follow the required format, specifically as a category object. The allowed categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since I determined the category to be \"HR Support,\" I\u2019ll format it as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.
