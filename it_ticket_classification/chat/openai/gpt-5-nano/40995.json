The content of the ticket is a bit garbled but seems to relate to an Oracle issue regarding adding absence dates and annual leave, especially around a migration that includes public holidays. It appears to involve HR issues, so HR Support might be the right category.**Categorizing IT Issue**\n\nI\u2019m considering the right category for the IT ticket, and \"HR Support\" looks appropriate since it deals with HR processes\u2014like annual leave, absence dates, and public holidays around a migration in an Oracle system. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" don\u2019t seem suitable. So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON category object specifying \"HR Support\" since that matches the content. The format will be straightforward: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Let\u2019s make sure it\u2019s properly formatted!"
