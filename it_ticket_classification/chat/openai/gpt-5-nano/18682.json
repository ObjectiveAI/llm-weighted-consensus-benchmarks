The ticket says, \"add to project wednesday march pm hi please create grand regards.\" It's a bit vague, but it seems like they want to add something to a project scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. \"Internal Project\" might fit best since it's project-related. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also apply if they intend to grant access to someone. \"Miscellaneous\" might work too if it remains unclear.**Selecting ticket categories**\n\nI need to categorize the ticket based on standard classifications: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative Rights. The ticket mentions adding to a project, which points towards \"Internal Project.\" The mention of \u201cWednesday March PM\u201d suggests it's related to scheduling something. Since they're asking for creation, I believe outputting it as a JSON formatted category object is the best approach. So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
