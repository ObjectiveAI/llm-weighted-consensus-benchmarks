The ticket mentions needing to change the default assignee, which seems to relate to system configuration. \n\nI'm considering whether it fits best as \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" since both involve permissions. \"Administrative rights\" typically refers to performing admin tasks, while \"Access\" might focus on the overall permission aspect. In this case, it seems like \"Administrative rights\" could be the most appropriate category.**Categorizing IT request**\n\nThe user has requested changes regarding the default assignee, possibly setting it to \"Wednesday\" or \"analyst.\" This request appears to fit the \"Administrative rights\" category since it relates to permissions for assigning default roles in an issue tracker. It doesn't seem to align with categories like hardware or HR. The mention of \"unassigned\" suggests they want to allow unassigned issues, but since it's primarily about permissions, I believe \"Administrative rights\" is the best choice.**Creating JSON response**\n\nI should output a JSON object with the category set to \"Administrative rights\" based on the user's request. The required format specifies that it must match a certain schema. So, I\u2019ll structure it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nWhile I'm considering whether \"Access\" might fit better, it seems more appropriate to stick with \"Administrative rights\" since this request involves admin-level changes in the issue tracker. It doesn't seem like a typical access request, especially since they're focusing on changing the default assignee. Thus, \"Administrative rights\" is the best choice for this JSON response.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nSince this request pertains to admin settings for modifying the default assignment, \"Administrative rights\" indeed seems plausible. Although I could ask a clarifying question, the user directly asked for a categorization, so I should stick to providing that. I\u2019ll go ahead and present only the JSON response as per their request. \n\nSo, the JSON object will look like:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nThat should effectively meet the user's need."
