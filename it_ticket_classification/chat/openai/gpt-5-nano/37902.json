They mentioned a problem with a monitor in a meeting room that doesn\u2019t display an image when connecting a laptop. It looks like they\u2019re experiencing the same issue regardless of the laptop used. Given it\u2019s about a hardware display issue, I believe it fits best in the \"Hardware\" category rather than \"Miscellaneous.\" So, I'll go ahead and categorize it as Hardware.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON category object based on the provided schema. The instruction specifies creating an object with a \"category\" field that should align with the enumerated values: Hardware, HR Support, Access, and so on. The required format is clear, and it seems I just need to ensure the output stays concise and follows the guidelines. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and finalize the response as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. No extra text or information needed!**Outputting JSON category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I'll ensure to output just the JSON response related to the category. I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It's essential that I check for any trailing spaces or extra text to keep it neat and concise. The format is straightforward, so there's no need for anything beyond the required output. I'll make sure that\u2019s all I provide in response!"
