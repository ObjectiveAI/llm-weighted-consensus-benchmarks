This ticket is about access management, specifically regarding disabling accounts for employees who have left. It seems to fit best under the \"Access\" category since it's focused on user access management rather than just permissions. I'll respond with a JSON-like format following the required structure, making sure it's clear and accurate.**Finalizing JSON Category Response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON-like object, specifically {\"category\":\"Access\"} to meet the requirements. I should be careful not to include any personal data from the ticket, like names or locations, since we\u2019re only focusing on categorization. The final answer must be a single clean JSON object, which aligns with the provided schema. So, I\u2019ll confidently say: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, ensuring there\u2019s no extra text in my response. Let's deliver just that!"
