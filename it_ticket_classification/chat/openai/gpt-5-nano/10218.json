I will need to extract key parts to understand the main request and find the appropriate category for this ticket.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI've got category options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. This ticket mentions \"install client machines,\" which suggests it's about hardware deployment or installation. It could fit into \"Hardware\" or \"Internal Project,\" depending on how it's connected to internal projects. The phrase \"as a service Friday\" might imply a scheduled service. Since it's primarily about logging installations, \u201cHardware\u201d seems like the best fit among the available categories. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware.\"**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize this IT ticket using a JSON object format. The category should be one of the specified values like \"Hardware\" or \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019m leaning towards \"Hardware\" since it relates to installing client machines and is the simplest choice. I need to respond strictly with a JSON snippet that fits the required format, which looks like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. So, I'll make sure to stick to the JSON object format!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
