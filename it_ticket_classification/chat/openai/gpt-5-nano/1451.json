Considering the available categories, this likely falls under \"Hardware\" since it\u2019s an equipment request. However, it could also be \"Purchase\" if they\u2019re asking to procure the cable. The request clearly indicates a need for hardware, so I'll output a JSON object using the appropriate category from the enumerated list. Let's make sure to structure it correctly!**Deciding on ticket classification**\n\nI need to classify the IT ticket based on the user requesting a cable to connect their monitor. I\u2019m considering \"Hardware\" since cables are hardware accessories. However, it could also fit \"Purchase\" if they\u2019re asking to buy it. Typically, in IT ticketing systems, a request for hardware is classified as \"Hardware,\" not a purchase, but I see room for ambiguity. I think I'll go with \"Hardware\" for clarity and then provide the JSON object with the category.**Finalizing the response**\n\nI\u2019m set to respond with the category for the IT ticket. Based on my reasoning, I\u2019ll say: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It's essential to ensure that I format this correctly, as the instruction specifies that \"category\" must be clearly defined without any extra text. I want to follow the guidelines precisely, so I'll stick to that format and present it exactly as required. So here we go!"
