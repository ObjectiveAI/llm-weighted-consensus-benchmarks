The ticket text is a bit confusing, but it mentions \"security champions\" and \"testing,\" which may hint it's related to an internal project. Given the context and garbled phrases, it seems like the ticket could be about adding someone to a security champions committee and focusing on testing efforts. Thus, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking this ticket is likely related to the \"Security Champions Committee,\" which might fit into the \"Internal Project\" category. It doesn\u2019t seem to involve hardware, storage, purchases, or HR. Though \"Access\" could work since it mentions adding someone, I doubt it's strictly administrative rights. The focus on testing points me toward \"Internal Project.\" Ultimately, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit given it's about a committee and ongoing testing efforts.**Deciding on Category**\n\nI\u2019m contemplating whether to categorize the ticket as \"Administrative rights,\" since it might involve granting access to the committee. The phrase \"please add\" suggests a permission action, but it's not very clear. Ultimately, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit given its project-like nature. There\u2019s a mention of testing, too, which points toward it being an ongoing effort related to the committee. I\u2019ll proceed to format my output as a categorized JSON response.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI need to confirm that the JSON object includes the correct field name, which is \"category,\" and set it to \"Internal Project.\" So the output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nThe prompt instructs me to categorize, but it might help to provide a brief justification. However, since the task specifies responding only with the JSON format, I'll stick to that. It's important to keep it clear, so I won't add any extra text. Just the JSON it is!"
