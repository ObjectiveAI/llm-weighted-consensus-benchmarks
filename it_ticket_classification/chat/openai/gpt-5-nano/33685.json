Given the list of categories, it seems clear that this falls under hardware issues. Therefore, I'll output a JSON object with the category value, specifically using \"Hardware\" as the appropriate category. The final output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I should make sure to keep things clear and concise, without any additional text.**Confirming Category Output**\n\nI need to focus on producing a JSON object that categorizes the ticket correctly. The system specifies that it requires plain JSON, and I'll ensure proper escaping. The category I'm outputting is \"Hardware\" based on the ticket details, which mention memory configuration and console issues. I briefly considered \"Storage,\" but that doesn\u2019t fit as well here. So, I'll finalize the output as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} and deliver it clearly and correctly!"
