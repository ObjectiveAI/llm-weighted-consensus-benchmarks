The term \"starter form ext\" might refer to something like an extension. Since it mentions \"new starter,\" it aligns with HR support, which seems to be the best category from the options. The goal is to classify this ticket correctly.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the best category for the IT ticket about enabling access for a new starter. \"Access\" seems most fitting, but there\u2019s also \"Administrative rights,\" which is more for elevated privileges. While \"HR Support\" could work since it involves onboarding, \"Access\" aligns better with typical IT support for new starter accounts. I\u2019ll make sure to present my final answer in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It fits the guidelines, and I think I\u2019m on the right track!**Choosing the right category**\n\nThe phrase \"starter form\" makes me think about filling out a form, possibly related to HR support for creating new starter forms. However, since this ticket is categorized within IT, I need to focus on what fits best in that context. \"Access\" is likely the right choice because it's about new starter access. I could consider \"Administrative rights\" if they need higher permissions, but it\u2019s not clearly stated. So, I\u2019ll definitively go with \"Access.\" I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
