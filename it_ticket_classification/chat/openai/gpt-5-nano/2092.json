I should output a JSON object with the appropriate category. \n\nGiven the mention of missing policies and permissions, it seems best to categorize it under \"Administrative rights\" since it's focused on policies and rights, rather than just general access issues.**Categorizing policies in IT tickets**\n\nI'm looking at this text that mentions missing policies and the phrase \"assigned correctly.\" The mention of needing resources might suggest a request for more resources to apply these policies. Access usually refers to logins and permissions, while Administrative rights are about admin-specific permissions. Given how \"Administrative rights\" is commonly used in IT ticket categorization for issues with access control, I'll categorize this as such since it reflects policy issues best.\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
