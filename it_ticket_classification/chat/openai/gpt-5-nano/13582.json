I think the right category could be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since \"Administrative rights\" specifically deals with elevated permissions, it would make sense to choose that if the ticket is about removing admin rights. Given the context, I\u2019ll likely categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" and format the response as the required JSON.**Deciding on category for ticket**\n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing this ticket as \"Administrative rights\" since it specifically involves the removal of rights and possible code updates. The mention of \"pm code updates\" might not be essential, although it still relates to access and permissions. I'll go ahead and craft the response as a JSON object with the category \"Administrative rights.\" It\u2019s clear that the user asked for a straightforward answer, so I\u2019ll keep it minimal: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
