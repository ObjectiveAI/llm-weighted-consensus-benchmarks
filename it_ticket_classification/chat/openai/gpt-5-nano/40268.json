The details mention \u201ccritical alerts\u201d related to a \u201ctape library\u201d and \u201cfailed operations.\u201d This suggests it's connected to hardware or storage issues. Evaluating the context, it seems most appropriate to classify it under \u201cStorage\u201d since it directly relates to tape production and inventory. However, \u201cHardware\u201d could also be an option. I'm leaning toward \u201cStorage\u201d based on the specific mentions.**Categorizing tape library ticket**\n\nI'm confirming that since the ticket is about tape library and inventory, it clearly fits under storage hardware. The options provided include Storage, which is separate from Hardware. Given that these types of tickets usually fall under Storage, I should respond with a JSON object containing the category. I\u2019ll format it as required:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}\n\nIt's important to ensure everything is quoted correctly since \"category\" is a string enum. I'll finalize it this way!"
