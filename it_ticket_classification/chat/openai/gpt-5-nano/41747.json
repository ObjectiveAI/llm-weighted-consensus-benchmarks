The message includes phrases like \"lost access,\" \"previously had access,\" and \"add following connections.\" This suggests the ticket pertains to access rights. \n\nGiven that, \"Access\" seems to be the most appropriate category, but I\u2019m also considering \"Administrative rights\" if they\u2019re requesting permission escalation. Since the categories are separate, I'll go with \"Access.\" \n\nI'll output this as a JSON object accordingly.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"lost access\" suggests the person is unable to access something and wants to regain that access. Given terms like \"previously had access\" and \"add connections,\" it seems I should classify this under \"Access.\" \n\nI'm debating if \"Administrative rights\" are necessary, but classifying it as \"Access\" feels like the safest and most straightforward option. \n\nI'll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra text needed!"
