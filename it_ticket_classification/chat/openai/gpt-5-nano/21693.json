Let's ensure we categorize it correctly!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe text mentions \"new starter,\" \"form,\" and \"other information needed,\" which are key indicators. It sounds like it could fit under \"Access\" since it's about onboarding and likely relates to access provisioning. While \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if rights were specified, there's no clear mention. So, \"Access\" seems like the safest choice. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like object for the category: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and may add a brief note for clarity.**Formatting IT ticket category**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket. It seems okay to present just the JSON object as the output. The instructions specifically mention the format should be a category in a JSON schema, so I'll stick to that without adding any extra text. The final response will be straightforward: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Keeping it simple is key here, so I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s concise."
