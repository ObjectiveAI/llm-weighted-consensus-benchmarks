If it\u2019s about decommissioning hardware, then \"Hardware\" might fit. However, terms like \"migration,\" \"service name amendment,\" and \"resource creation\" suggest this is part of an \"Internal Project.\" Since the ticket discusses migration tasks and resource planning, I'll lean toward \"Internal Project.\" While \"Hardware\" is a contender, it seems like \"Internal Project\" is more appropriate due to the focus on migration and resource management.**Responding with JSON**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category value as \"Internal Project,\" based on the allowed categories. The correct format is essential, so I\u2019ll create an object like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s concise and follows the required structure without adding extra commentary. Since the instruction is clear about providing just the category, I\u2019ll focus on delivering that correctly. Let's get this done!"
