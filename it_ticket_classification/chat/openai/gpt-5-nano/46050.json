However, I think \"Purchase\" fits best. I\u2019ll output a JSON object with \"type\": \"Purchase\" to reflect that choice.**Outputting categorized JSON**\n\nI need to follow the required format for my response, which is structured as a JSON object. The schema indicates that I need to provide a category value from the given list.
