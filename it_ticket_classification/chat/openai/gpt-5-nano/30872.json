Since it involves changing the project manager and possibly updating information, I think \"HR Support\" fits if it's personnel-related. But it could also be \"Access\" if it's about permissions. The user's request about leave updates suggests a focus on administrative changes. Overall, it seems most fitting to categorize this request under \"HR Support.\"**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"project manager change\" and \"change form.\" I\u2019m considering if this request fits under \"Administrative rights,\" but that's more about granting privileges, which isn't necessary here. \"Internal Project\" seems more appropriate since it relates to changes within an internal project. Since I need to output a JSON object, I'll simply respond with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This approach aligns with the instructions and provides clarity on the categorization.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
