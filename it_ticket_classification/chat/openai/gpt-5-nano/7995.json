This seems to indicate that they\u2019re onboarding and requesting hardware provisioning. Given the mentioned terms, I\u2019d lean towards \"Hardware\" as the appropriate category for this ticket, although \"Access\" could also be relevant. It's important to ensure accurate categorization to assist the user effectively!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe user is requesting hardware provisioning for a new starter, and the most fitting category is \"Hardware.\" Although \"Purchase\" could also apply since they seem to be ordering hardware, the specific mention of mobile device provisioning leans more towards \"Hardware.\" Since they\u2019ve asked for assistance with onboarding, the primary classification should indeed be \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll respond in the required JSON format to make it ready for code parsing. Here\u2019s the output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI\u2019ve confirmed that the category is \"Hardware,\" and the schema specifies providing a category object in JSON format. The user didn't request any clarifications, just the categorization, so I\u2019ll stick to the straightforward output. \n\nThe final answer should be simply: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This way, it aligns with the required format without unnecessary details. Let\u2019s go ahead and craft the final JSON response!"
