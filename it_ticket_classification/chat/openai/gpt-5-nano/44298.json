It seems it could fit into the \"Access\" category since it involves issues accessing internal systems. However, it might also relate to \"Administrative rights\" if it's a permissions problem. The mention of \"blocked error\" due to network problems is worth considering.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions being unable to access documents due to network issues and receiving \"forbidden\" messages when trying to view the forecast. It seems the most fitting category for this issue is \"Access,\" as it relates to denied access to certain pages.
