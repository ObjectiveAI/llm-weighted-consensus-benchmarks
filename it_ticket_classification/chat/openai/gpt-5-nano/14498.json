The available categories are \u201cHardware,\u201d \u201cHR Support,\u201d \u201cAccess,\u201d \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d \u201cStorage,\u201d \u201cPurchase,\u201d \u201cInternal Project,\u201d and \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d This ticket involves server details for user access, accounts migration, credentials, and the routing of migrated users. It seems to fit under \u201cAccess\u201d or possibly \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d Given the focus on accounts migration, I think \u201cAccess\u201d is the best fit, although \u201cInternal Project\u201d could also work if it\u2019s specifically for server integration.**Understanding the Messy Text**\n\nI\u2019m looking at this messy text filled with various phrases about \"server details for integration,\" \"route next site migrated users,\" and \"accounts yet migrated.\" It seems to address credentials, permissions, and the need to grant access. It sounds like there are concerns about migration status and a backlog of accounts not yet integrated, causing some frustration. I need to clarify these issues and ensure that the right steps are taken for a smooth migration and proper access for users.**Defining the JSON Format**\n\nI\u2019ve confirmed that the ticket definitely maps to the \"Access\" category. The format for my output is a JSON-like object with a category field. The prompt specifies, \u201cCategorize this IT Ticket: [text].\u201d \n\nSo, instead of just supplying the category value, I need to follow the required schema snippet: \n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}\n\nI should provide a JSON object that conforms to this schema, like: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
