The term \u201cchange rejection\u201d relates to workflows and access \u2014 it could broadly fit under \u201cAccess\u201d or involve specific \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d The ticket seems tied to change management rather than hardware issues. Details about the \u201creject button\u201d imply that this might be more about internal processes, but it\u2019s unclear since the user mentioned that some functions do work as expected. I need to clarify.**Selecting the right category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out the best category here. \"Access\" seems fitting since it involves access to changes. However, the mention of \u201crejection details visible\u201d points to viewing those details, which complicates things. I also consider \"Administrative rights\" if rejecting changes requires specific permissions. The user mentioned that the \u201creject button for assigned tasks works alright,\u201d indicating it might be less about bugs. I think suggesting either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" as primary categories could work well. A clarifying question might help too.**Breaking down the change rejection**\n\nI\u2019m trying to parse the user's input about \u201cchange rejection.\u201d It seems to describe an issue where, when rejecting a change, the system returns to a previously accessed menu, which can be frustrating. They mention \u201corder add rejection details disabled\u201d and want to avoid trouble finding changes again. The \u201creject button assigned task works alright,\u201d but there are still visible rejection details involved. Overall, the problem seems to be related to navigating the change management process efficiently.**Categorizing the bug**\n\nIt looks like there\u2019s a bug in the Change Management system. I\u2019m considering the best category for this ticket. \"Internal Project\" could work if it\u2019s about a specific feature, but \"Miscellaneous\" might also apply as a general label. Since this isn\u2019t about hardware, storage, or admin rights, \"Access\" stands out given the mentions of \"view rejected details\" and \"reject button.\" However, \"Administrative rights\" might apply if rejecting changes requires those permissions. Ultimately, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" since this issue revolves around navigation and visibility, but \"Internal Project\" is also a strong candidate.**Determining the appropriate category**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the categories available, and \"Administrative rights\" stands out for permission issues, especially since the user mentioned the \"reject button assigned task,\" which hints at role-based permissions. It seems there\u2019s a UI bug since rejecting a change returns to a previously accessed menu with visible rejection details. The user is looking for a category, so I\u2019ll respond clearly with the JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and maybe add a brief justification about it being a UI/permission-related issue in the workflow. However, I\u2019ll stick to just the category object for clarity."
