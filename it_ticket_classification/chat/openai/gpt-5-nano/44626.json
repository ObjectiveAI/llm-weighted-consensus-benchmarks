It looks like this falls under HR-related issues. Out of the choices I have, \"HR Support\" seems to be the best fit for this ticket.**Determining the right category**\n\nThe most fitting category seems to be \"HR Support\" because the issue relates to payroll and timekeeping. There's also a chance of it being classified under \"Access\" if it's a login-related issue, or \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are required for adding time off. However, since the ticket revolves around submitting hours and work shifts, I feel confident that \"HR Support\" is the best choice. \n\nNow, I need to output this in JSON format: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
