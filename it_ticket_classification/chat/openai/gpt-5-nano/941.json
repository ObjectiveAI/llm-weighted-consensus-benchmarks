The categories I can choose from are things like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. I think \"Purchase\" fits best since it's mostly about the purchase order and receipts, though it could also relate to Hardware because of the monitor.**Outputting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket in the correct format. The system indicates there's a category schema with a single field: \"category.\" I should respond with a JSON-like object. Since I\u2019ve determined \"Purchase\" is the appropriate category, I'll format the answer as: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. I just need to ensure there's no extra commentary since the instruction is clear \u2014 only categorization is required. Let's finalize that response!"
