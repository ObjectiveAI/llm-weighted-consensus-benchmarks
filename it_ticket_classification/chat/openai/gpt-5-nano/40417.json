The ticket text is a bit messy, mentioning a power outage with phrases like \"almost a minute\" and references to a landlord and electrical issues. It seems related to hardware, given the context of a generator and battery rack. The best fit looks to be \"Hardware,\" as it pertains to power affecting IT infrastructure.**Generating JSON Response**\n\nI\u2019m working on crafting the answer by providing the category in JSON format, specifically noting that it should be \"Hardware.\" The instruction is clear: I need to respond using the category schema. So, I\u2019ll ensure I output valid JSON with the key \"category\" set to the value \"Hardware.\" I should stick to just the category without any extra text. Here\u2019s the final output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
