The ticket text is quite confusing but focuses on issues with CI/CD build triggers after a repository change, linking builds, and checking build status before merging. It seems the user is asking for help with these build issues. There's also mention of a \"wallet\" issue, which might refer to a separate wallet system. I'll have to clarify that.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket primarily deals with issues regarding a CI/CD build that triggers automatically after a repository change. They want to link the build check status before merging and mention hooks. Since this is related to a software development process, it doesn't fall under hardware, HR, storage, or purchases. Instead, it seems to fit best into \"Internal Project.\" Although \"Miscellaneous\" could work too, \"Internal Project\" is more appropriate for its technical focus. I\u2019ll create a JSON object for the category now.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
