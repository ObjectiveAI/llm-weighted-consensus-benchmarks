The mention of \"agile safe methodology\" and \"next annual leave December\" gives context. Based on predefined categories like HR Support and Access, it seems this ticket fits best under HR Support because of the focus on line management and approval rights. I'll categorize it accordingly!**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt looks like this ticket revolves around approvals in the Oracle system, particularly regarding access and permissions. The mention of \"line manager,\" \"his rights,\" and \"he currently approves\" suggests it\u2019s about access rights for management. While \"annual leave December\" hints at HR aspects, the main focus is on approval rights within Oracle. So, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Access,\" since it directly relates to accessing or approving requests within the system. I'll format it as { \"category\": \"Access\" }.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI'm considering whether to classify this IT ticket as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The focus on \"Oracle approval\" and \"line manager rights\" points to user access rights, so \"Access\" feels like the best option. While it could be \"Administrative rights\" if we were looking at rights assignment specifically, I think \"Access\" captures it more accurately. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and keep it straightforward, following the instruction to provide just the category."
