Given the content, I'm leaning towards the \"Access\" category since it's primarily about links not functioning. However, it might also fit under \"Internal Project\" or \"Storage\" if it pertains to stored information within the library. It's essential to choose the best category for resolution!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user is asking me to look into a technical problem related to access, likely for an IT ticket about a digital repository. I\u2019ll categorize this under \"Access.\" I need to output a JSON-like object as specified, so my final response will be formatted correctly. It should only contain the category without any extra text. I'll ensure it matches exactly with the value \"Access.\" So, the final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Finalizing the Category**\n\nI'm considering whether to categorize this as \"Internal Project\" because it relates to the \"bid library\" in the \"sales marketing function.\" However, it seems more fitting to simply label it as an access issue since the problem is primarily with the links. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and confirm that the best category is \"Access.\" My final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
