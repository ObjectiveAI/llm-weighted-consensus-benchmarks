The mention of assigning licenses and running scripts suggests it could fit under \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights,\" especially since it's about user management in AD. It might also be relevant for \"Internal Project\" if it relates to a specific project. I\u2019ll have to choose the category that best fits!**Classifying ticket categories**\n\nI'm exploring the categories for classifying an IT ticket in a ticketing system. The ticket mentions \"license capacity,\" \"assign license,\" and the need to \"run a script to fetch Active Directory (AD) active users.\" It seems to primarily relate to \"Access,\" which deals with permissions and AD, and \"Administrative Rights,\" since running scripts often requires those privileges. The ticket doesn't have an explicit \"License Management\" category, so I need to decide between \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights\" as the best fit.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants to categorize an IT ticket, which is mainly about Active Directory (AD) script execution and license assignment. Since this focuses on accessing AD data, \"Access\" appears to be the right category. I need to respond with a JSON object that follows the required format. The schema provided indicates I should just give the category without extra text. So, I'll reply with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's important to ensure proper formatting, so that's my plan!"
