The ticket is requesting to replace short network cables with longer ones in a meeting room, which indicates an issue related to hardware. The urgency is emphasized, highlighting its importance. Based on the options given\u2014like Hardware and Miscellaneous\u2014I think \"Hardware\" is the most accurate category. Now, I need to format this as a JSON object following the system\u2019s template. Let's make sure to get it right!**Finalizing JSON Output**\n\nI see that I need to output a JSON-like object with a \"category\" field based on the ticket content. The request is to replace short network cables with longer ones, which clearly indicates it's a hardware issue, so \"Hardware\" seems like the right choice. While \"Purchase\" might also fit since replacing cables may involve buying new ones, the main focus here is on the replacement itself. I\u2019m sticking with \"Hardware\" for clarity, and I\u2019ll deliver it as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Delivering JSON Object**\n\nI need to keep this straightforward and follow the instructions carefully. The output should simply be a JSON object without any extra quotes or explanations. Since the category is determined to be \"Hardware,\" I'll deliver it as follows: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I want to make sure it's clean and meets the requirements perfectly, so no extraneous information will be included. Let's proceed with the response as plain text."
