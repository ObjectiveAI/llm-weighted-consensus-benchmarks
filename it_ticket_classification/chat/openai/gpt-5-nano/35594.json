I think Access seems most appropriate given the context.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm figuring out how to categorize a ticket related to certificate errors impacting external clients and their connectivity. It doesn't seem to align with administrative rights; rather, it's more about access and connectivity issues. The \"Access\" category appears to be the most fitting. I'll prepare a JSON object with that category, formatted correctly as the instruction specifies. So, I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's essential to keep it straightforward!"
