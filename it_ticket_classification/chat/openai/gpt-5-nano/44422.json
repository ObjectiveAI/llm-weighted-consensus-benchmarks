I have a mapping of categories including Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The user asked me to categorize the ticket concerning a weakness observation in Outlook Web Access. I should consider which category best fits this description, likely leaning towards \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" depending on the specifics provided in the ticket text.**Analyzing IT ticket details**\n\nThe ticket describes a weakness in Outlook Web Access (OWA). It indicates that if you leave the computer unattended for a few minutes, you can still navigate through the interface. Users can't send information after clicking refresh without re-entering credentials. This issue persists even when checking on another laptop after a session timeout. Although there's a lock screen policy, it seems this could be exploited if not appropriately addressed. I need to categorize it accordingly.**Categorizing security issues**\n\nThis ticket relates to session handling and credential prompts, pointing to a security vulnerability in the web app's interface. The user wants to escalate this for attention and is asking if it can be fixed. For categorization, I\u2019m considering \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or possibly \"Internal Project.\" However, since it mainly deals with access control and session management, \"Access\" seems to be the best fit, as the key issue is about unauthorized access after session timeout.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
