The ticket seems to be about installing Trio devices in meeting rooms, ensuring they're connected properly and sound is disabled. It also mentions documenting the process with a user guide. Since this involves hardware installation, the most fitting categories appear to be \"Hardware\" or possibly \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Determining the category**\n\nI see that the available categories to choose from include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and several others. The request seems to be focused on installing devices, which clearly falls under \"Hardware.\" However, it could also be classified as \"Internal Project\" if it's tied to a specific initiative. Since the instruction emphasizes categorization for an IT ticket, the best response format is to provide a JSON object containing the category, and I'll format it like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
