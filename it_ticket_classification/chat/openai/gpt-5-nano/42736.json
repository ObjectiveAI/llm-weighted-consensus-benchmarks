The user mentioned not receiving notifications related to Oracle and that there was a previous ticket with incorrect resolution. So this looks like a perfect fit for \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll craft a response as a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I'll ensure it's valid JSON without any extra commentary!**Delivering JSON response**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so my task is to deliver that category as a single JSON object. I need to make sure everything follows the correct syntax, specifically that I use double quotes around the keys and values. It's important to keep this straightforward. I\u2019ll craft a response that looks like: {\"category\":\"[desired_category]\"} and ensure it's formatted properly for clarity and accuracy. Let's get that right!"
