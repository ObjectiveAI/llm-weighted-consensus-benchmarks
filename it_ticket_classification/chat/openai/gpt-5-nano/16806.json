It mentions a \"site to site tunnel,\" which suggests it's related to VPNs or network engineering. The ticket refers to details required and has mentions of an architect, which leans towards it being an IT project.\n\nGiven the categories available \u2014 like Hardware, HR Support, and others \u2014 I think this ticket falls under \"Internal Project\" since it's about the technical details regarding the VPN setup.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm evaluating the best category for this IT ticket, and I think \"Internal Project\" fits well because it involves setting up a site-to-site tunnel, which is part of network infrastructure. The mention of \"architect\" hints at project details, but it\u2019s not entirely clear. \n\n\"Access\" could refer to VPN user rights, yet since this is related to an internal network project, \"Internal Project\" feels the most appropriate. I can finalize this by responding with a JSON object stating the category.**Finalizing Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm considering other options for categorizing the ticket. I thought about \"Access\" since the site-to-site tunnel involves access between locations. However, this ticket is specifically asking for details about setting up a VPN, which leans more towards an \"Internal Project.\" \n\nSo, I\u2019ll stick with \"Internal Project\" as my safest choice. I\u2019ll respond with just the required JSON object, which is: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, without any extra text."
