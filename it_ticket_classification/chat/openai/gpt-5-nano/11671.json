It mentions terms like \"new starter\" and \"starter form,\" which indicates it's related to onboarding. It doesn't seem to involve hardware or access issues. I think the most fitting category is \"HR Support\" since it's about a new employee filling out forms. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" don't apply, and while \"Miscellaneous\" is an option, it seems too vague for this context.**Selecting IT ticket category**\n\nI should categorize this IT ticket as \"HR Support\" since it's about onboarding forms for a new starter. The user asked for a JSON response, so I need to format this properly. The schema specifies a category field, and I\u2019ll set it to \"HR Support.\" There's a slight chance it could relate to \"Access,\" but the text primarily concerns onboarding rather than login credentials. It's best to go with \"HR Support\" because it fits the context better!**Responding with category in JSON**\n\nI need to respond with just the category value in JSON format. The user requested a categorization of the IT ticket, specifying a plain text response, but the schema calls for a JSON-like object. So, I should output:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nIt should be straightforward\u2014no additional comments or text needed. Let's go ahead and provide that!"
