I\u2019ll go with \"Purchase\" for now.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe phrases \"new purchase po\" and \"log allocation after receive item\" indicate that this is about procurement processes. For this IT ticket, the right category seems to be \"Purchase.\" I'll prepare the output in JSON format, which the system expects. Although I could consider \"Hardware\" since it's about a Raspberry Pi, the ticket focuses more on procurement than hardware support.
