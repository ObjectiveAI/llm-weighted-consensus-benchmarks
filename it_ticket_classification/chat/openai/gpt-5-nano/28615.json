The user's request revolves around Visual Studio licenses\u2014something about management, assignment, and expiration dates. It\u2019s a bit messy, but it seems connected to who has these licenses. Given that it's about access and assignment, I think the \"Access\" category might be the most appropriate choice for this ticket.**Evaluating ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to determine the best category for this IT ticket. It seems to fall under \"Access,\" since it concerns license assignments and access to software. While \"Purchase\" could apply if it were about acquiring licenses, that doesn\u2019t fit here since the query mentions recent assignments and expirations. I want to wrap this up nicely, so I'll provide a JSON response with just the category, returning: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s important to keep it straightforward!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
