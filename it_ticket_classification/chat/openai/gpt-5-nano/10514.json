The content suggests it's related to user access and possibly mistaken inclusion in a group. Given the focus on changing someone's rights, I think the most fitting categories would be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It might also relate to \"Internal Project.\" I'll ensure the JSON reflects the chosen category accurately.**Categorizing access management task**\n\nThe user wants to remove someone from ServiceNow, indicating an access management task. The category options I have in mind are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since this is specifically about removing a user, it seems like \"Access\" is the best fit. They mention \"CAB member rights setting,\u201d which hints at managing specific rights too. Ultimately, I'll categorize this request as \"Access\" and prepare the JSON output with that as the category.**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with the correct JSON format reflecting the category selection. The prompt states, \"Categorize this IT Ticket:\" followed by the ticket content. According to the schema, I\u2019ll craft a JSON object with the key \"category\" set to \"Access.\" There's no need for extra words or details; I just want to keep it clean and straightforward. I'll make sure the output is precisely as required and deliver it effectively."
