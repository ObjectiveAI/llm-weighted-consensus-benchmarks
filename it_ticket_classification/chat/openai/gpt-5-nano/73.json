It mentions a new automatic seal tag machine and the term quarantine, which could relate to malware security. The phrases \u201cdeleted automatically after days\u201d and \u201cchange frequency\u201d might indicate it involves policies on archiving or retention. Given these clues, I think the best category to pick for this ticket would be \"Hardware,\" since it primarily concerns a machine.**Determining the correct category**\n\nThe user needs help categorizing a ticket concerning an \"automatic seal tag machine.\" I think this is likely hardware, but it might also refer to a labeling device. The terms \"PM\" and \"KB\" are ambiguous, adding to the confusion. The mention of \"quarantine\" and automated deletion hints at IT administrative tasks, possibly related to log retention policies. So, I\u2019m considering categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I need to pick the one that best suits the user\u2019s needs.**Categorizing retention policy**\n\nIf the ticket relates to system configuration regarding retention policies and localization, I might categorize it as \"Administrative rights,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Internal Project.\" Setting log retention and default locale indeed falls under administrative tasks. While \"log default locale\" pertains to system settings and \"deleted automatically after days\" aligns with retention policies, it all points to \"Administrative rights.\" I could consider \"Storage,\" but this is more about policy than actual storage. Since there's no specific project mentioned, \"Administrative rights\" seems the best fit.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
