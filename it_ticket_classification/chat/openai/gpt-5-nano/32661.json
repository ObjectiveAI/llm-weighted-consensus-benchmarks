The relevant categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nThe mention of \"dashboard maintenance work,\" \"dashboard unavailable,\" and \"notify users\" makes me think it could fall under \"Access,\" but it might also fit \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019m weighing those options carefully to make the best choice.**Classifying an IT Ticket**\n\nI need to classify this IT ticket that mentions access issues, specifically about dashboard maintenance and unavailability. It doesn't mention logins or permissions, which makes me think it doesn't fit \"Access.\" \n\n\"Internal Project\" could apply since it's a project task, but \"Miscellaneous\" is a broader option. Ultimately, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best choice, given the context that it involves notifying users and includes an attached document. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object with the chosen category.**Formatting the JSON Response**\n\nI need to return a JSON object with the category labeled as \"Internal Project.\" I want to ensure it's formatted correctly, so I'll confirm it's a single object with a \"category\" key. \n\nThe string value needs to match exactly, so that checks out. Now I just need to respond succinctly and clearly with the JSON format. I'm all set to provide the user with the appropriate response!"
