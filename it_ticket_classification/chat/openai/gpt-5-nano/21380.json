The user has repeatedly emphasized the urgency and importance of adding a folder to a new location. Their requests include creating a folder, granting rights, and mentioning links related to site library resources. I think this could fit under \"Storage,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights\" depending on the exact needs expressed.**Classifying an IT ticket**\n\nI need to classify this ticket into one category. It appears to be mainly about creating a folder and managing rights or permissions, so \"Administrative rights\" seems like a fitting choice, as it directly addresses the request for permission. \"Access\" could also work, but it doesn't capture the request's core related to rights. Since the user emphasizes granting rights and mentions linking site resources, I'll choose \"Administrative rights.\" We'll respond according to the required JSON format with the appropriate category.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
