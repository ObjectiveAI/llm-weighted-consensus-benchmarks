The instructions say the format should include a \"category\" key with specific values. Considering the user's message, the phrase \"connect without mobile id\" likely points to an access issue, potentially indicating a need to log in without multi-factor authentication.  \n\nSo, it seems appropriate to categorize this as \"Access.\"**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user's message mentions trying a cable, which hints at a possible hardware or network issue. However, the phrase \"connect without mobile id\" suggests they\u2019re looking to bypass mobile authentication, pointing more toward an access-related problem. Since they want help connecting without using mobile ID, the most fitting category seems to be \"Access.\"  \n\nFollowing the schema given, I\u2019ll form the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"} \u2014 keeping it clear and straightforward. This approach ensures I include just what\u2019s necessary without any extra commentary!"
