It also references mandatory receipts, a receipt number, and possibly a video link. This likely falls under procurement and asset management.\n\nThe provided categories from the system are: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll need to pick the most relevant category and prepare a JSON object for that.**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to pick the right category for this IT ticket, which focuses on a new device, purchase order, allocation, and processing receipts. It seems to fit either \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" The phrase \"new purchase po retrieval\" implies it's about procurement, especially since it mentions retrieving an old device. However, I think \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category since it directly relates to the purchase order and receipts. \n\nI'll respond with the required JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
