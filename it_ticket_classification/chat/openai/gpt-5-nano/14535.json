The user provides a string that seems to include details about a senior developer joining and compliance processes in Colombia. It appears to connect with \"HR Support\" or \"Internal Project\" due to the onboarding context. It's also touching on \"Administrative rights\" but without a clear request for IT admin rights.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nGiven the categories, \"Access\" is typically for access requests. The user\u2019s text is a bit messy and mentions a compliance officer and a senior developer joining. I think it best fits under \"HR Support\" due to the onboarding context and completed forms. Another option could be \"Internal Project\" if it relates to a specific project in Colombia, but it feels more HR-like. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object to fit the required schema.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nThe tool expects a specific JSON format, like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I need to ensure there\u2019s no extra text, just valid JSON that the system can parse correctly. \n\nWhile considering if \"Access\" might fit if it involves systems in Colombia, there isn\u2019t an explicit request for access. The content is mainly about onboarding and forms. So it looks like \"HR Support\" is the best choice. Here\u2019s the final output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
