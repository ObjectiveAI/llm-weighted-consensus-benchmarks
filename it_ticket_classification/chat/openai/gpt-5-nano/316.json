This seems to fit into the \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" category since they mention permissions. There\u2019s also a chance it could relate to an \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s for a specific task. However, their request is somewhat ambiguous.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user is requesting access with PM rights, implying they want the same permissions as someone else. It seems they might be looking to clone another's permissions. Since it\u2019s about access and admin rights, the best categories are \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, categorizing it simply as \"Access\" feels safer because it's a more general term. So, I'll format this as a JSON response that only includes the category field: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
