It seems the system wants a specific format: a JSON-like dictionary for parsing. I'm debating if \"Administrative rights\" is a more precise term since the context mentions roles and processes like \"head PM\" and \"new pass access.\" However, I think \"Access\" is safer to use, as it covers general access provisioning without risking confusion about admin privileges.**Categorizing access request**\n\nThe user is asking about creating a process for assigning a \"head PM\" role, which likely relates to access within a system. It doesn't seem to be about administrative rights but rather a job role assignment. So, it makes sense to categorize this as \"Access.\" I'll prepare a JSON response without extra commentary, just focusing on the required category as instructed."
