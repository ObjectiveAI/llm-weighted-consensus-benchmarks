The ticket discusses an inability to access and mentions an \"authentication failure\" when trying to connect using \"open,\" likely referring to an Open VPN or Open Access. It seems clear this is an access issue. So, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" There's no indication of administrative rights being involved. The output needs to be a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. Time to deliver this succinctly!**Formatting as JSON**\n\nI need to provide the output in JSON format as instructed. The system specifies that it should be in the structure \"category.\" So, I'll go ahead and create the JSON object as follows: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. It seems pretty straightforward! Once I\u2019ve formatted that correctly, I\u2019ll be ready to deliver. Let\u2019s proceed with this concise representation and ensure everything is in order!"
