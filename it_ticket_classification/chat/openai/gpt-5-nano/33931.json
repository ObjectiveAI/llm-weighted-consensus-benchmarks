The categories provided include Access and Administrative rights, and it seems the user's request is primarily about access control. Since they're asking to add AD groups, which relates to access rights, \"Access\" feels like the most appropriate category. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also fit, but I think \"Access\" is the best match here.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI think the ticket is primarily for a system admin to create or grant access to groups, rather than relating to hardware or storage. I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" The prompt specifies I need to provide a simple JSON object, so my output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I just want to keep it straightforward since the instructions mention avoiding special formatting. While \"Administrative rights\" is another option, adding AD groups focuses more on access control.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI'm deciding on the category for the ticket, and I'm leaning towards \"Access\" because it focuses on granting access through AD groups. While \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant for elevating privileges, it's not clearly stated in the request. Therefore, my final output will be a straightforward JSON object with just the category: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to make sure it's valid JSON with no extra text, so I'll stick to that for clarity."
