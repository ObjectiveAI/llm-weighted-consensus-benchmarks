The ticket mentions a monitoring alert about a RAM full status and a partition exceeding a threshold. It sounds related to hardware or storage, especially since it mentions \"RAM\" and \"partition.\" I\u2019m leaning towards either \"Hardware\" or \"Storage\" for categorization, but I need to decide which one fits best based on the context given.**Categorizing system monitoring ticket**\n\nThe ticket appears to be a system monitoring message about a RAM full status and a partition exceeding the threshold. Since RAM relates to hardware (memory) and the partition issue pertains to storage, I have to decide on categorization. The available categories don't include \"System.\" If the main issue is the disk partition, \"Storage\" seems appropriate. However, if it's primarily a performance issue leading to a service down, \"Hardware\" could also fit. I'll go with \"Storage\" since that aligns with the specific mention of the partition threshold.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
