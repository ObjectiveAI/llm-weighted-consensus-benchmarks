The clear mention of leave suggests it's most appropriate for the \"HR Support\" category. Although there's a hint of \"Access\" due to the approvals, it firmly aligns with HR-related matters. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and respond with a JSON response.**Outputting JSON for category**\n\nI see that I need to output a JSON object to categorize the IT ticket. The instruction is clear: it should only include the category in that format. Given that the text relates to HR, I'll select \"HR Support\" from the provided categories. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and produce the response as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and without any extra commentary, just this JSON output. Let\u2019s proceed with that!"
