They want to change the project manager to themselves. I think this involves access or administrative rights since it's about project management roles. The categories relevant here are \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project.\" However, since they're asking for a change in user permissions, it seems like \"Administrative rights\" is the more appropriate option to assign this ticket.**Deciding on category**\n\nI\u2019m considering that \"Internal Project\" could fit because it relates to a project. The request is a bit jumbled, but it clearly shows they want to set themselves as the project manager. Since this is about changing permissions or roles in the system, it aligns best with \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll output the required JSON format with the category set clearly. There won\u2019t be any extra commentary; just the JSON response is what\u2019s needed. Here's the response: \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
