It might relate to \"Administrative rights,\" especially if it involves interns. I also see there's an \"HR Support\" category, which could fit since the task is HR-related, but the user specifically asked for an IT categorization. The mention of \"starter form analysis\" seems more about HR than IT. So, I need to choose the best fitting category that aligns with the IT context.**Analyzing ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m deciding between \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"HR Support.\" The user's message is a bit jumbled but repeatedly mentions \"bulk starter form analysis internship,\" indicating a request related to new interns for onboarding. It seems clear that this is more about HR processes rather than IT tasks like hardware or storage. Since \"HR Support\" is an available category and fits the context well, I think it\u2019s the most appropriate choice here.**Choosing the category for the IT ticket**\n\nThe user specifically asked to categorize this as an IT ticket, which makes it clear that \"Administrative rights\" may not fit since there's no mention of rights. It seems best to select \"HR Support\" as the category. I need to respond using a JSON object that matches the required format. So I will create an object with the category field set to \"HR Support.\" It feels right to keep it straightforward by just outputting the JSON object without additional justification. Let's go ahead and deliver this!"
