The categories I have are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket seems jumbled but appears to concern a change request (CR) for work scheduled on Wednesday PM. Phrases like \"move switch\" and \"has approved\" suggest it's related to internal processes. I'm thinking it might best fit under \"Internal Project,\" but I'm not entirely sure.**Determining ticket categorization**\n\nThe ticket might fit into categories like \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access,\" especially with the mention of \"move switch,\" which hints at a network hardware task. Since it\u2019s about sending a notification and implementing a change, I lean toward \"Internal Project\" for the change request. The lack of a specific \"Network\" category is a bit tricky. Ultimately, categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit. I should prepare a JSON-like response for this category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
