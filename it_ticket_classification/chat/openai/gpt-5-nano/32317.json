The ticket mentions important details like \u201ccompleted,\u201d \u201cattached,\u201d and \u201caccounts accesses by today.\u201d This ticket could fit into several categories: Hardware, Access, and Administrative Rights. However, I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit because it emphasizes the new starter hardware allocation, which is a key focus here.**Deciding on Category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT Ticket. The ticket mentions \"accounts accesses by today,\" which hints at provisioning, suggesting \"Access\" might be appropriate. However, \"new starter hardware allocation\" is the main focus, pointing towards \"Hardware\" as the best option. Even considering that \"Administrative rights\" could be needed, the core context revolves around hardware. So, I\u2019m deciding to classify this ticket as \"Hardware,\" and I'll format the output as a JSON-like object accordingly.{\"category\": \"Hardware\"}"
