The main complaint seems to involve errors related to CR (change request) cloning and authorization problems. The user is requesting that the fields be editable and points out mismatches between the old and new owners in the CR list. Based on the schema, I should select a suitable category from options like \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" I'll decide which fits best.**Categorizing IT ticket issues**\n\nThe ticket discusses clone errors, specifically CR cloning, and issues with authorization and locked fields. It seems to connect to access rights and editing permissions. Given the issue revolves around editable fields for change requests, I\u2019ll need to categorize it appropriately. The options include \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" and \"Internal Project.\" Since \"Access\" seems more specific to the problem described, I\u2019ll likely choose that category before outputting the final JSON with the category field.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nThe ticket discusses issues with CR cloning, specifically mentioning locked fields and owner mismatches, which all relate to access permissions and data accuracy. Since the best category for this seems to be \"Access,\" I'll make sure to output it in the required JSON format. The instruction clearly states to categorize the IT ticket, so I'll provide the JSON object that indicates the category as \"Access\" without including the schema details. I just need to stay consistent with the formatting!**Outputting the category**\n\nI\u2019ll be outputting the category as JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Just to be safe, I will ensure it matches the required format. While the instruction only says to categorize, I think including a brief justification would be nice. However, I want to keep it concise, so I'll stick to the required JSON output. Let\u2019s go ahead and finalize it with just the category in the JSON format!"
