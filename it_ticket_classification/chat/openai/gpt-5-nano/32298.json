Once I determine the appropriate category, I'll format the output as a JSON to ensure it\u2019s clear and structured properly. This will help in handling the ticket efficiently!**Streamlining the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m dealing with a messy IT ticket that involves several issues regarding meeting room cables. The main tasks include replacing cables, managing them separately, inspecting the meeting rooms, and ensuring that devices are functioning properly. I also need to account for microphone extensions and manage redundant cables, which have caused complaints in the past. I'll ensure that the cables are neatly organized and test everything to confirm all connections are secure before refurbishing the meeting spaces.**Categorizing IT ticket for refurbishment**\n\nI'm looking at an IT ticket focused on meeting room cables and hardware management. It includes tasks related to inspecting, replacing cables, restocking adapters, and testing equipment, which feels like a blend of hardware and software concerns. However, since it's mostly about hardware and inventory management, I think the best category would be \"Hardware.\" If this ticket is part of a refurbishment project, \"Internal Project\" could also apply. Overall, it seems to fit well under Hardware.**Determining the IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m assessing how to categorize this ticket since it involves hardware items like cables, devices, and remotes, along with tasks related to inventory and purchasing, like restocking. While \"Hardware\" seems like the obvious choice, I notice that some tasks could fit under \"Internal Project\" or \"Purchase.\" However, since it's mostly about physical items and management, I believe \"Hardware\" is the most straightforward and fitting category. Now, I need to prepare the JSON output to reflect this!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
