However, it could also fit under \"Hardware\" due to the mention of the disk drive itself.**Categorizing storage ticket**\n\nI'm evaluating how to categorize this IT ticket, which seems focused on a new purchase order for a hard disk drive and installation details. While \"Storage\" could be a fit for storage devices, it looks like one category is preferred. It seems clear that \"Purchase\" is the best option given the mentions of PO, receipts, and orders. However, I also need to consider the hardware installation aspect. Ultimately, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase.\" Now, let's format this as a JSON object with \"category\" as a string.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
