It appears this is an access issue with the HR system, which makes me think they might lack the necessary permissions. This definitely falls under the \"Access\" category. I'm considering whether it also fits under \"HR Support\", but since it's focused on application access, \"Access\" is the clear choice. I should respond with the appropriate JSON format for this category.**Formatting response correctly**\n\nI need to provide just the category in the specified format. The instruction is clear: it says \"Categorize this IT Ticket:\" followed by the allowed categories. So, my response should simply be a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I won\u2019t include any extra comments this time; it\u2019s essential to keep it straightforward. Let\u2019s make sure to follow the guidelines and send the response as needed!"
