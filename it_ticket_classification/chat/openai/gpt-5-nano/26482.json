The text includes phrases that could tentatively relate to \"Administrative rights\" due to the act of adding heads, or perhaps \"Access\" because of the potential request for access. It could also fall under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\". Ultimately, clarity is lacking, which makes it tricky to categorize confidently.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize the IT ticket. The user's message talks about adding \"heads\" and \"leads,\" which might suggest they're looking to add users or manage access. The categories available include Access and Administrative rights, and it sounds like the ticket could fit under Access, since it involves adding someone. However, \"delivery heads\" probably refers to team leads, so it suggests they may want to grant access or modify a distribution list. I'll go with Access for this one.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nIt seems like the user intends for me to categorize their request about \"adding to the delivery heads.\" That could refer to either an email distribution group or a scheduling matter. While \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility, the phrase doesn't specify that. Given the context, I believe \"Access\" fits best, since it's about adding someone to a group. I should respond with a JSON object in the required format, so I'll structure it accordingly without extra text.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
