The text seems to revolve around setting up new projects in Oracle, and there's mention of creating code based on spreadsheets. It might also touch on issues regarding logging in relation to upcoming public holidays. Overall, I need to accurately place this ticket into one of the defined categories.**Interpreting IT ticket categories**\n\nI'm looking at different categories to classify an IT ticket: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket focuses on \"new projects setup\" and \"Oracle setup,\" which suggests it could fit under \"Internal Project.\" It mentions \"enclosed spreadsheets\" and \"log properly regarding upcoming public holidays,\" hinting at code creation. It might also touch on \"Access\" but doesn't explicitly mention it. \"Administrative rights\" seems less relevant, as there are no requests to elevate permissions. \"Purchase\" could apply if they need an Oracle license.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm focusing on categorizing the IT ticket. Categories like \"Storage\" and \"HR Support\" don't apply here. The phrase \"new projects setup\" points strongly to an \"Internal Project.\" So, I'll categorize it as such. The system requires a JSON-like structure, so I'll format the response precisely as instructed. The final output should look like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI just want to ensure that I follow the guidelines and use the exact keys."
