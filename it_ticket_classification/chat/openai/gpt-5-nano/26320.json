The categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Given the context, it seems most related to hardware due to mentions of an extra monitor and PC help. While \"Miscellaneous\" could apply if I'm unsure, it's likely \"Hardware,\" since the user seems to want assistance in setting up a monitor for efficiency in November.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for this IT ticket. \"Hardware\" seems most fitting, but I wonder if \"Access\" might apply if it's about gaining access. \"Internal Project\" and \"Administrative rights\" are definitely not relevant. \"Purchase\" could work if they're requesting a new monitor, but the focus on \"extra monitor\" implies they want help to set it up for better efficiency. They seem to need a hardware request or support. I need to categorize this properly and prepare a JSON object with the category field.**Parsing ticket category**\n\nI need to follow the instruction for output format, which requires a JSON object with a category string. The allowed categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Hardware\" since the ticket refers to an \"extra monitor.\" Although \"Purchase\" could fit if it's a request for a new monitor, the request isn't explicit. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware\" since it's related to a monitor and PC setup. I'll output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
