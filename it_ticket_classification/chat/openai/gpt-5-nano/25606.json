It mentions ownership transfers and editing rights, hinting at administrative rights. Since it pertains to access privileges and permissions, both \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" appear to be fitting categories. I\u2019ll weigh those options carefully.**Deciding on Category**\n\nThis ticket explicitly mentions \"ownership transfer\" and \"editing rights,\" which could lead me to think \"Administrative rights\" is the right fit. However, it might seem a bit too narrow. It looks like the focus is on granting access and ownership transfers, blending both access control and admin rights. Since \"Administrative rights\" is a specific option, I should go with that. I\u2019ll finalize my answer as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
