I'll look at the ticket details carefully, considering which category applies best based on the issue described. Getting this right will help speed up the resolution!**Organizing messy content**\n\nThe content I have is quite jumbled up! It appears to revolve around code migration related to projects and the term \"intra.\" There's a lot of mention of code needing to be moved, reminders about previous migrations, and references to old print screens. It seems like the message is a mix of requests and follow-up notes regarding those migrations, especially referencing past forecasts and wanting status updates. I need to untangle this to clarify the main points and tasks.**Categorizing code migration**\n\nThis is clearly about migrating code, possibly as part of an internal project. It doesn\u2019t seem to align with categories like Hardware, HR Support, or Storage. My best bet is that \"Internal Project\" fits best here. Although \"Administrative rights\" and \"Miscellaneous\" could be considered, they don\u2019t really capture the essence of the task. I should respond with a JSON format, specifically: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, to meet the required structure. A brief note might be nice, but the focus is on providing just the category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
