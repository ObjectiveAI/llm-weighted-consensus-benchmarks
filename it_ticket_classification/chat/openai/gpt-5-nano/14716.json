I think the best fit for this is the \"Internal Project\" category because it mentions a \"developer ext,\" possibly hinting at developer extensions. However, it could also relate to \"Access\" if it's about access rights. But mainly, it seems to be a software development task. I\u2019ll prepare the output in the required JSON format: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}.**Formatting response**\n\nI need to provide a JSON object with a \"category\" property. The guidelines suggest that I should respond with the standard format. It looks like for this task, the selected category is \"Internal Project.\" So I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and return just that. My final output will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This keeps it simple while ensuring I'm following the required format correctly!"
