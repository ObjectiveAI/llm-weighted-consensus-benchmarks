It has phrases about project codes, recreating code lines, and various requests regarding forms. It seems like it could touch on multiple categories. The schema includes options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I\u2019ll analyze the content to determine the best category and prepare a JSON object based on that decision.**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI'm looking at the ticket that mentions phrases like \"new project code,\" \"attached updated form,\" and \"save forms locally.\" It seems to focus on creating and updating code lines and forms. I think it might fit under \"Internal Project\" since it relates to a new project. \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t fit since it's not about permissions. \"Storage\" might apply with the local saving of forms, but it's not about access control. \"Miscellaneous\" could be a catch-all if needed.**Determining the Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating that \"Internal Project\" fits well since the ticket discusses a new project code, creating code lines, and updating forms. It seems to focus on internal project management tasks. The mention of \"vice president\" as the sender doesn't change the category, just confirms it's related to an internal project. So I'll format my response as a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll make sure it follows the required format for consistency!"
