It mentions logging assignments and dealing with existing assets. Looking at the available categories, it seems clear this request falls under \"Hardware,\" as it's primarily about monitor hardware. I'll confirm that the ticket fits into the Hardware category, as it relates directly to changing and managing physical equipment.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether this IT ticket should be categorized as \"Purchase\" since it mentions replacing existing monitors and adding assets. However, purchasing typically involves buying new hardware, and while they suggest adding monitors, the text isn\u2019t explicit about a purchase order. The mention of \"log assign\" leans more toward hardware asset management. So, I think the best fit is still \"Hardware.\" I'll prepare a categorized output in JSON format for clarity.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nThe prompt indicates that I need to categorize the IT ticket. I\u2019ll follow the specified structured format and output it as a JSON snippet: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It appears they might also want a brief summary, but the main requirement is to provide the category field. So, I\u2019ll ensure that the format is correct and avoid any unnecessary text. I\u2019ll stick to the essentials and deliver exactly: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
