While it could fall under \"Purchase\" since they want a new cable, it most logically fits into \"Hardware\" because it's about a physical item needing replacement. So, I'm leaning toward categorizing it as \"Hardware.\"**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the category for this IT ticket. Options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Storage\" don\u2019t quite fit. \"Miscellaneous\" is also not right. While \"Purchase\" seems valid since they're asking for a new cable, the request is really about hardware replacement. In ticketing systems, such requests usually fall under \"Hardware.\" The text clearly states \"new network cable required,\" which indicates a hardware item. Ultimately, I think \"Hardware\" is the best choice here.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
