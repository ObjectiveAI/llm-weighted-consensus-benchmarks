It mentions needing cables, an order arriving, and a resolved issue. I\u2019m noticing it could fit into several categories like \"Purchase,\" \"Hardware,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the main focus is on the cables and the order, the best fit seems to be \"Purchase.\" This seems to indicate it's about ordering cables, which makes sense!**Determining the ticket category**\n\nIt could also fit in \"Hardware,\" but since typical IT service categorization uses \"Purchase\" for orders and procurement, that feels more accurate. The phrase \"order solved\" indicates a purchase order. So, I'm deciding to categorize it as \"Purchase.\" I need to respond in a specific format, a JSON-like object. It should look like {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} based on the required schema. I\u2019ll ensure it\u2019s formatted correctly with no extra text."
