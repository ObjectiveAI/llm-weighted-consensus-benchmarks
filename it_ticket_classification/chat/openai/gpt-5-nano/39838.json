They mention issues related to a \"screen\" that has been sent multiple times and ask for assistance to avoid future problems. Given the options\u2014Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights\u2014I\u2019m leaning towards \"Hardware\" since it seems related to a screen issue. I'll proceed with that as the category.**Classifying an IT ticket**\n\nIt seems this IT ticket is about a screen being sent multiple times, possibly a monitor. The message mentions things like \"screen second time sent\" and needing assistance to avoid future issues, which makes it a bit unclear. I\u2019m considering categorizing it under \"Hardware\" since a screen is a hardware issue. While \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" could be options, they don't fit well. \"Purchase\" might be relevant if it were about ordering screens, but I think \"Hardware\" is the best choice.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
