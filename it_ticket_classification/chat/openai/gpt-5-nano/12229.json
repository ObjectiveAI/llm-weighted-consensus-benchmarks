It mentions a \"password change query,\" \"expire days change,\" and being \"locked after days.\" From this, it seems to be related to password changes and account lockouts. My best guesses for the category are \"Access\" for general access issues or possibly \"Administrative Rights,\" which could relate to requests for admin access. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too vague, so I\u2019ll focus on the first two.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket is about a password change query related to a potential lockout due to password expiration. The user mentions \"password change query,\" \"expire days,\" and being \"locked,\" which points toward access issues. I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category since it deals with login access and password management, while \"Administrative rights\" isn\u2019t applicable here since there's no clear request for it. I\u2019ll respond with a structured JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and may include a brief note as instructed.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
