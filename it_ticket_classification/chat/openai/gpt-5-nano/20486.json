The user's message appears to be a jumbled request regarding leave approvals for upcoming holidays and adjustments related to annual leave, rather than a technical issue. It sounds like something more HR Support-related; I should focus on that instead of IT hardware. It\u2019s important to clarify the user\u2019s intent!**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI'm considering where this ticket fits regarding the categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It focuses on annual leave approvals and planning \u2014 definitely leaning towards HR Support. There's some mention of administrative tasks, but it doesn't seem to request system access rights. Given it addresses leave approval workflows and mentions a second approver, I'll categorize it under HR Support. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
