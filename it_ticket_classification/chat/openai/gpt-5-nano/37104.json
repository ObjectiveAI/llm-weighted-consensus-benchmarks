So, I think I'll go with \"Miscellaneous\" for my final output, formatted correctly as a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I could also add a short rationale if needed!**Preparing ticket category output**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket, and it sounds like they want just the category. I see that I need to format it as a JSON object with the \"category\" key, so I'll make sure to keep it concise. I\u2019ll avoid adding any extra content, but I might consider including a brief note if appropriate. However, since the instruction says to output only the JSON, I\u2019ll stick to that for the final response."
