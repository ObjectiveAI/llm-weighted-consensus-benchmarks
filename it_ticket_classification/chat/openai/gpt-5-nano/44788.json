It looks like there's a logging issue related to Oracle, and they've marked it as high importance. The message is somewhat garbled, but I can see they're trying to submit an outstanding request from last week. They mention having success with the correct password previously, but now they're encountering error messages when logging in through Explorer. I should clarify what can be reset or advised regarding this issue.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like the user is facing login issues with Oracle, possibly related to password problems. They mentioned something about their password being remembered sometimes, and it seems they might be using Internet Explorer or a VPN connection. Since this is clearly a login issue, I need to categorize the ticket. Based on the provided categories, \"Access\" is the most suitable. I\u2019ll output a valid JSON object reflecting that. Here it goes:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
