The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the ticket relates to expenses but lacks a direct category for that, I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Purchase\" since it involves expenses. I want to choose the best fit!**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket related to expense reports, which are financial in nature. The closest fit among the provided categories seems to be \"Purchase,\" since expenses often relate to purchases. I considered \"Administrative rights\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" but those don't quite fit. Since I want to respond using the specified JSON format, I'll choose \"Purchase.\" So, I\u2019ll just output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} to match the requirement!"
