They say \u201chelp obtain,\u201d so it's likely a purchase request. The categories available include Hardware or Purchase, and since it's asking for help to obtain something, I think \u201cPurchase\u201d fits best. \"Internal Project\" could be a consideration, but it doesn\u2019t match well here.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm trying to figure out whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" The user\u2019s request mentions an \"extender,\" but it doesn\u2019t clearly ask to purchase one\u2014just to help obtain it. This could suggest a hardware request. IT ticket systems often separate hardware from purchase requests, but calling it \u201cPurchase\u201d might imply procurement. Given the lack of details about budget or approvals, I think classifying it as \"Hardware\" makes the most sense since it's about a hardware device.**Formatting category response**\n\nI\u2019m planning to respond with a JSON-like category object since the instruction asks for a category field. The schema specifies that \"category\" can be one of several enumerated values. So, I think I should format my response as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. The instructions say my answer should be in this JSON format without any extra text, just the object itself. That should meet the requirements perfectly! Alright, I\u2019m ready to respond with just that."
