So \u201cAccess\u201d might be the best fit.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm interpreting the keywords from the user's message about forgetting something, likely a password. This points to the need to categorize the ticket as \"Access,\" especially since they mentioned \"upcoming annual leave,\" suggesting they want to reset or access something related to their account. Since the ticket directly asks for categorization, I'll create a JSON object for the response. It should be structured like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, to align with the schema provided.**Providing category response**\n\nThe user asks for a straightforward categorization of the IT ticket. Based on what we've discussed, I just need to provide the minimal response without any extra text. So, I'll simply produce the JSON output as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Keeping it concise aligns with the instructions given!"
