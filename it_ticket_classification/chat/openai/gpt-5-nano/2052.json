They mentioned \u201cmaternity leaver access card\u201d and asked to fill out a \u201cmaternity leaver form,\u201d which sounds a bit repetitive but points clearly to access\u2014related to leaving work for maternity. This ticket could fit under two categories: Access, because it mentions an access card, and HR Support, relating to the maternity leave situation. Overall, it leans toward Access as the main category.**Categorizing an IT Ticket**\n\nIn an IT context, \"leaver\" likely refers to offboarding, which could fall under \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"HR Support.\" The user's request to \"please fill maternity leaver form\" suggests this ticket is about maternity leave, involving revoking access or returning a card. I think the best fit is the \"Access\" category since it mentions the access card. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON object: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. I'll make sure the case matches what's specified in the enum."
