The ticket mentions various tasks, like changing project names, re-setting up forms, and issues with templates. It seems to be related to internal project management. I\u2019m pondering if it fits better under \u201cInternal Project\u201d for changes or \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d if it involves permissions. It's a bit unclear since it touches on both project management and possibly access issues. I think \u201cInternal Project\u201d fits best here.**Parsing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m parsing a somewhat garbled IT ticket that mentions changing project names, resetting forms, and updating templates. Although it sounds a little jumbled, it seems to focus on internal project management issues. Based on the provided categories, \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems like the most appropriate fit. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object, setting the category to \u201cInternal Project.\u201d This keeps everything organized and follows the required structure. So, my response will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
