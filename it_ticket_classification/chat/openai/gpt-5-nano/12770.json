It also touches on employees keeping their phones after departure, which might relate to Asset Management or Access. Overall, it revolves around exports and managing mobile devices associated with employees.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The user is requesting an export schedule and an Excel template for data management, which points towards \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative\" tasks. The \"Access\" category seems relevant for user rights, especially for ex-employees. I feel like I need to choose the best fit: \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" since both seem appropriate for the automation aspect.**Choosing the right category**\n\nThe user wants to categorize this ticket accurately. While \"Administrative rights\" seems fitting due to the access and potential involvement of ex-employees, the ticket mainly focuses on data export automation. Given that it mentions exporting mobile phone data and setting up an Excel template, I think \"Internal Project\" might actually be a better choice. It's really about creating a process for biweekly exports. I\u2019ll stick with \"Internal Project\" since it aligns more with building procedures.**Preparing final output**\n\nI need to create the final answer in JSON format with \"category\": \"Internal Project.\" The instructions are clear that I should only respond with the JSON structure, without any extra text. So I'll format it like this:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}  \n\nAlright, no additional comments, just the JSON object! Let's go ahead and finalize it."
