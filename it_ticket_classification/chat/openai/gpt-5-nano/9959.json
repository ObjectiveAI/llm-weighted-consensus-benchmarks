The string describes thermal throttling during stress tests, with the CPU hitting thermal limits, and seems to mention Turbo Boost being turned off. The user's ticket is rather jumbled, but terms like \"hardware testing\" and \"Prime95\" jump out, indicating specific contexts. It sounds like an issue worth diving into for a clearer understanding!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user mentions terms like \"intel core,\" \"averaging temperatures during stress tests,\" and \"stability test.\" They want me to classify the IT ticket into one of the predefined categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the content clearly indicates issues related to cooling and thermal throttling, the appropriate category is \"Hardware.\" I'll respond with a JSON object for this classification, as specified.  \n\n{\"category\": \"Hardware\"}{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
