It could fit into \"Hardware\" for computer issues or \"Access\" for remote viewing or permissions. I'm not entirely sure, but I\u2019ll focus on these two categories.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket seems to request help for a colleague to view her computer, which likely means they need remote access or screen sharing. Hence, it fits perfectly into the \"Access\" category. Some text, like \"thank weekend kind regards,\" doesn't add value, but the key phrase about viewing her computer does indicate a need for access. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"} as instructed.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
