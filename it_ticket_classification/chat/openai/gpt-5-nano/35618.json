The user mentions a CI hook related to their build job not triggering successfully, which seems technical. Given the categories available like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" I think this falls under \"Miscellaneous\" because it doesn't directly align with hardware, HR, or access issues. It's more of a workflow-related problem, so I'll label it accordingly.**Categorizing Ticket as Internal Project**\n\nThis ticket is about a development issue, and I\u2019m considering the options provided: \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" There's no category specifically for \u201cDevOps\u201d or \u201cCI/CD,\u201d but the mention of triggering builds and errors indicates it\u2019s related to a code process, likely meaning it\u2019s an internal project issue. I don\u2019t think it fits hardware or HR. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it relates to an internal build hook failing."
