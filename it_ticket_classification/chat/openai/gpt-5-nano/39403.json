It includes multiple mentions of \"meeting room finder\" and various issues related to booking rooms and checking calendars. The categories I'm considering are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the focus is on the meeting room finder feature and booking issues, it seems like it fits best under \"Miscellaneous\" as a software feature.**Understanding the meeting room issue**\n\nThe text revolves around issues with the \"meeting room finder\" feature related to booking and calendars. It appears the user is unable to book meeting rooms or see their availability properly. They mentioned PCs functioning but want room statuses to show as open or booked. There are requests for confirmation of the problem understanding and suggestions to keep the ticket open for further resolution. It seems there's a need for clarity in how the system displays booked rooms.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI think the best category for the ticket is \"Internal Project\" since it's about implementing or updating the \"meeting room finder\" feature. While it could also fall under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" the focus is primarily on software functionality rather than hardware. The user mentioned issues with the calendar in terms of showing booked versus open rooms, which reinforces that it\u2019s more about feature development. I\u2019ll finalize my response with a JSON-like format stating the category as \"Internal Project.\"**Formatting the JSON response**\n\nI need to format my response correctly based on the required schema. The prompt is asking us to categorize the IT ticket and provides a specific structure. I\u2019ll choose \"Internal Project\" since it relates to a feature update for the room finder and booking system integration. \n\nMy response will be a JSON object that only includes the key \"category\" with the value \"Internal Project.\" Here\u2019s how it should look:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
