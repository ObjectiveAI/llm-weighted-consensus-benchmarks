Key phrases include \"time oracle december problem\" and \"submit cards,\" indicating it's likely about HR matters. Since terms like \"validation\" and \"resubmit\" connect to HR functions, I think \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category. The other options like \"Administrative rights\" don't fit as well. I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support\" for this ticket.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
