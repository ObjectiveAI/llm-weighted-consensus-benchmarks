I think it could fit under either \"Access\" for user account setup or \"HR Support,\" but I guess \"Access\" is the more relevant choice for IT.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI see the category list includes \"HR Support,\" which feels a bit unusual for an IT ticket but might fit this scenario. The user is requesting help with a starter form related to returning from maternity leave. This likely pertains to onboarding, so it could fall under \"Access\" for new user setup, or maybe \"Administrative rights.\" Since the ticket explicitly mentions the starter form, I'd lean towards categorizing this as \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights,\" ensuring it aligns best with their needs.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI understand that the \"starter form\" refers to onboarding for a new employee, and \"return maternity leave\" indicates someone is rejoining after leave and needs to fill out the necessary paperwork. It seems that \"HR Support\" fits best since it's about HR processes. The user has asked me to categorize this IT ticket clearly, so I should respond in JSON format with the category set as \"HR Support.\" This should keep it straightforward and in line with their request!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
