There\u2019s also a chance it might be about \"Administrative rights.\" Since \u201cSoftware\u201d isn\u2019t an option, I think \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best choice for now.**Finalizing the IT ticket category**\n\nAfter reviewing the options, it seems unlikely to fall under \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The mention of a filter doesn\u2019t quite fit \"Access\" either, so I think it\u2019s best to categorize this as \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll output a concise JSON object with the category field set to \"Miscellaneous\" as required by the prompt.
