The ticket states, \"mouse needed mouse needed hi mouse today forgotten mine developer ext,\" which looks like a request for a mouse. The repetition of \"mouse needed\" and the phrase \"forgotten mine\" suggests they need a laptop mouse. \"Developer ext\" might relate to the developer's extension. It seems this should be categorized under \"Hardware,\" although \"Purchase\" could apply if they are requesting a replacement. However, the best fit is \"Hardware.\"**Deciding on IT ticket categories**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize an IT ticket based on the distinction between hardware issues and purchasing devices. The phrase \"mouse needed\" suggests a request for hardware. In IT ticket classifications, requests for hardware often fall under categories like \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" However, since the text indicates they forgot their mouse, which implies a need for a replacement, I think \"Hardware\" would be the most appropriate category for this ticket.**Formatting response in JSON**\n\nI need to provide a response in the form of a JSON object containing the category. The allowed categories are defined clearly, and I'll select \"Hardware\" as the category. The required format includes a \"type\": \"object\" wrapper, so my final output should be structured correctly. Since the user asked to categorize an IT ticket, I\u2019ll respond with just the necessary JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I'll make sure not to include any extra content, just the JSON format."
