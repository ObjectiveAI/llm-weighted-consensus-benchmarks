They mention a change in the Oracle notification view, timecard calendar issues, and questions about the right side menu options for activating or deactivating scheduled absences. It seems like this fits well under \"HR Support\" because of the references to timecards and absences. I'll go with that category!**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for this IT ticket, which primarily discusses timecards, attendance, and Oracle notifications. Given the context, \"HR Support\" fits well. I also pondered whether \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights\" might apply, but \"HR Support\" clearly aligns with the topic at hand. \n\nSo, I'll prepare to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category as \"HR Support\" and provide minimal explanation, as instructed. Here goes: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
