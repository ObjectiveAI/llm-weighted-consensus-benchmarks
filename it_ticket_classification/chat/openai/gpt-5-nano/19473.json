This looks like it might involve setting up accounts or equipment. However, without more details, I'm thinking it could fall under either \"HR Support\" for processing the new starter paperwork or \"Access\" for user account creation. Since it's in an IT system, it might lean towards \"Access,\" but there's no mention of specific credentials. It could also suggest \"HR Support\" based on the form.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket is in an IT context, and the user is asking for a categorization. I\u2019m considering \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" and think it could fit as \"HR Support\" or \"Internal Project.\" The \"starter form\" is clearly an HR onboarding document, so it leans towards processing onboarding requests. However, \"Access\" could also be relevant since it pertains to provisioning system access for new starters. Since it mentions the starter form, classifying it as \"HR Support\" seems the most appropriate. I'll respond with a JSON-like object for clarity.**Creating category object**\n\nI see the instruction to provide a category object with the \"category\" field drawn from allowed categories. Basically, it looks like I need to create a JSON-like object according to the schema provided. The formats available include options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and more. Since I think \"HR Support\" fits best here, I'll output: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}.\n\nI\u2019ll stick to just delivering the JSON object and avoid complicating things with additional questions since the user just wants the categorization and not a solution."
