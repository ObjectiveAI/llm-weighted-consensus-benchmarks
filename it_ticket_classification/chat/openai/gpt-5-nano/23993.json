It seems the ticket discusses a new starter, a former intern, and a form related to HR tasks. The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given this context, it could fit into \"Administrative rights\" or possibly \"Access.\" Although it mentions HR, that category is missing from the list. Let\u2019s find the best fit!**Selecting the right category**\n\nI\u2019m determining the best fit for an IT ticket regarding a new starter. Initially, I considered \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access,\" thinking about onboarding. There\u2019s also mention of a \"starter form\" and contracts, which lean towards HR tasks. However, I now see that \"HR Support\" is indeed on the list! So, it\u2019s likely that the best category is \"HR Support\" since it relates to new starter forms and contracts. Let\u2019s go with that!**Determining the JSON output**\n\nI\u2019m leaning toward categorizing this ticket as \"HR Support\" instead of \"Access,\" since the content mentions completing forms and contracts related to HR. The task requires me to output a JSON object with the proper format. I need to make sure it\u2019s structured correctly for the category, which is specified in the format I have.\n\nI\u2019ll respond with the exact JSON object as instructed, like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Just the JSON, no extra text!"
