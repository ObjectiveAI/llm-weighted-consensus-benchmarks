It mentions an \"Oracle issue\" and an ongoing problem with submitting holiday requests. The description is a bit jumbled, but it strongly hints at an issue related to HR support system for vacation requests. I\u2019m considering options like \"HR Support,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative Rights\" for categorization. Given the context, \"HR Support\" feels like the best fit.**Analyzing IT Ticket Issue**\n\nThe content seems related to submitting holiday leave in the Oracle system. It looks like there might be a problem with the submission process, possibly due to old code. The phrase \"head forthcoming holiday\" likely refers to scheduling. In terms of categorization, \"HR Support\" feels most appropriate since it concerns leave requests. However, if access issues with Oracle are involved, \"Access\" could be relevant, but given the context, I'll stick with \"HR Support\" for this ticket.**Confirming Category Output**\n\nI've determined that the category for this ticket should be \"HR Support.\" Now, I need to format my response as a JSON object since that's what the instructions require. I\u2019ll make sure it looks like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It's essential to match the category exactly with the options provided: [\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]. So, I\u2019ll keep my response concise and clear without any extra text."
