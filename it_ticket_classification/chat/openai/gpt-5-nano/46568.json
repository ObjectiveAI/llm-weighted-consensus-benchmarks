The user mentioned terms like \"event notification\" and \"th floor back door open,\" which suggests it relates to security and access control. Since it mentions a door being open, the \"Access\" category seems to fit best. While \"Security\" could also be relevant, it\u2019s not listed as an option. So, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access.\"**Finalizing Category Output**\n\nI\u2019m considering the appropriate categorization for the ticket regarding door access notifications. \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d doesn't apply, and \u201cHardware\u201d could fit if the issue is about door hardware or sensors. However, the main focus is security related to door access. Thus, \u201cAccess\u201d is the right choice. \n\nI need to respond with a JSON object formatted correctly. I\u2019ll format it as {\"category\":\"Access\"} and ensure that there\u2019s nothing extra included in my response."
