Generally, connectivity problems are categorized as \"Access\" or perhaps \"Internal Project.\" This one requires careful consideration!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nIt looks like the phrase \"senior developer\" suggests this is from a software development context. The request implies they have an urgent access issue, so categorizing it as \"Access\" makes sense. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON format, stating `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. \n\nHowever, I need to remember that the system asks for a structured JSON object with \"type\": \"object\" too. I\u2019ll keep in mind the expected output format while ensuring I include only the necessary details!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
