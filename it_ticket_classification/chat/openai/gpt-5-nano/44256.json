They mention issues with a project and cost differences. \n\nFrom the predefined categories, it seems like this ticket fits best with \"Internal Project\" because it's about a specific project issue they're experiencing. \n\nI should then format the output into a JSON object, specifying \"category\" as \"Internal Project.\" Let's get that structured!**Classifying the IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket appears to relate to a \"new PAS project issue\" and has concerns about cost calculations and differences. It mentions details about cost calculations for an order and references internal project aspects, which rules out categories like hardware or access. Given the context, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the most fitting category. \n\nI'll respond using JSON format to specify this category. Let's make sure it's clear and properly structured!**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nI see they shared a schema specifying the format for the response, which indicates I need to return a JSON object containing the category \"Internal Project.\" \n\nThe instruction is straightforward: categorize the IT ticket without adding any extra text. Each element should comply with the provided schema, focusing solely on the \"category\" property. \n\nSince everything aligns with \"Internal Project,\" that's what I\u2019ll confirm in my JSON output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let\u2019s keep it clean and deliver that!"
