I see categories like \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d \u201cInternal Project,\u201d \u201cPurchase,\u201d and others, but there\u2019s no specific \u201cSoftware\u201d category for issues regarding Word documents, which is likely the concern here. The closest options are \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d or \u201cAccess.\u201d It seems they\u2019re seeking help from a mobility officer and want assistance promptly\u2014it\u2019s a bit jumbled, but I understand the gist!**Categorizing IT requests**\n\nI think the best fit for this situation is \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d since the request isn't clearly about hardware or software. Although there\u2019s an option for \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d that doesn\u2019t seem relevant here. \u201cInternal Project\u201d could relate to an internal issue, but it\u2019s not specific enough. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d for this general help request about image and Word document issues. The final output will just be a JSON object with that category. Let's keep it straightforward!"
