The possible categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" This ticket doesn't fit hardware, HR, storage, or purchase categories. It seems more about IT operations and could either fall under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" However, if it requires specific privileges, it might also fit \"Administrative rights.\"**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI'm considering whether this IT ticket fits under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Typically, tasks that involve setting up alerts could go under \"Administrative rights,\" but that category focuses on requests for access. However, this ticket is more about configuring a feature rather than access. It references setting up a new rule for ticket alerts, which aligns well with \"Internal Project.\" Given that the request isn\u2019t about hardware or permissions, I believe \"Internal Project\" is the best fit.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI'm considering the ticket's categorization again. \"Administrative rights\" might apply if admin rights are needed to configure the tickets, but the user hasn't mentioned any permission issues. So, I think I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" I'll format this as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} since that matches the required format. The output will focus solely on ensuring the \"category\" field is correct according to the guidelines. That\u2019s the plan!"
