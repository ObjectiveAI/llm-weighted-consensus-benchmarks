The user mentions \"end of contract\" and \"leaver form distributed,\" which suggests this is about offboarding. The keywords hint at access revocation and equipment return. \n\nLooking at the category options, \"HR Support\" seems appropriate since it relates to HR processes, but \"Access\" is relevant as well. I\u2019m leaning towards \"HR Support\" since it addresses the offboarding and related tasks effectively.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the category for this ticket. \"Administrative rights\" feels off since it\u2019s about revoking access rather than granting permissions. \"Access\" seems much more appropriate here because the user mentions offboarding tasks and equipment distribution. The note about the leaver form and hardware suggests it\u2019s tied to revoking access. Categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" don\u2019t fit. I think the best choice is \"Access,\" as it aligns with offboarding and access revocation tasks. I\u2019ll format my response accordingly.**Formulating the response**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket, and according to the required output format, I'll respond with a JSON object stating the \"category\" as \"Access.\" It's essential to keep it minimal, as the system instructions specify this.\n\nI considered whether \"HR Support\" might be a good fit since it relates to the end of the contract. However, the ticket content centers around IT processes, especially with mentions of \"mobility officer\" and hardware. Since it involves access revocation and equipment collection, \"Access\" definitely feels like the best choice.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
