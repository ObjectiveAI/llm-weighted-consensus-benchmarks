It focuses on replacing an old laptop, which suggests a hardware upgrade. Although \"Purchase\" refers to procurement, the user mentions \"hardware requested\" and \"upgrade justification,\" reinforcing it as a hardware issue. While both categories could fit, the best choice is \"Hardware\" since it mainly concerns upgrading equipment. I\u2019ll format the response as JSON with the category key set to \"Hardware.\"{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
