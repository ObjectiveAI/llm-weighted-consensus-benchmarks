I have category options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and more. This request seems to fit best under \"Purchase\" since they\u2019re asking to procure equipment. Although \"Hardware\" could also apply, \"Purchase\" seems the most appropriate, given the nature of their request for additional hardware items. It\u2019s a bit ambiguous, but I think I've got it!**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants to categorize an IT ticket. They mention needing \"additional equipment\" like an extension cord and outlet adapter, which are hardware accessories. I\u2019m thinking that this request fits the \"Purchase\" category since they're asking to initiate procurement. It seems clear we need to respond with a JSON object structured according to the provided schema. So my response will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"} \n\nNo extra commentary, just the JSON object!"
