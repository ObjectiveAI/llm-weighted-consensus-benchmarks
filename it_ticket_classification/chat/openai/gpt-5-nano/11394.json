The user\u2019s message discusses improvements to the Oracle procurement process, focusing on purchase requisition flows and invoice details. Given the emphasis on procurement process improvements, it seems like \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category. The ticket discusses implementing changes to improve efficiency, accuracy, and discrepancies, strengthening my choice.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI see that there's a request regarding a procurement system, specifically about central PO details and processes related to receipts. Given this context, I can categorize it as \"Purchase.\" The user asked me to provide a category object according to a specific format, so I need to return just the essential information. My final output will be in the required JSON format, like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. No extra explanation is needed; just the category."
