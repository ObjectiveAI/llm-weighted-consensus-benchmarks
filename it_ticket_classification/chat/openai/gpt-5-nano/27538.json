The ticket is asking for help identifying old internal links used across applications, with an emphasis on updating these links due to an upcoming migration. The user also mentions needing to identify what has been missed. I have to decide which category fits best from options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. It\u2019s all about finding the right fit!**Categorizing IT Project**\n\nThe content discusses links, applications, and migration, suggesting it's about an internal project focused on identifying and updating old links due to migration. \"Internal Project\" seems the most fitting category. While I briefly consider \"Access,\" since it relates to internal links, the project work to map and update aligns better with \"Internal Project.\" I need to return a JSON object formatted correctly, so I'll set it as: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}\u2014keeping it concise and matching the exact capitalization."
