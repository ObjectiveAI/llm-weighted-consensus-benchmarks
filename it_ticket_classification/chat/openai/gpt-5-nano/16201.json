The phrase \"pm change friday\" might refer to scheduling a change, but it's unclear. The mention of \"redesign engineering code\" suggests a software task, leaning towards categorizing it as \u201cInternal Project.\u201d While \"PM change\" could hint at project management, the ambiguity makes \"Internal Project\" the safest choice.**Presenting IT ticket rationale**\n\nI think it\u2019s important to provide a short rationale for the ticket categorization. The mention of \"redesign engineering code\" indicates a software development task, which aligns with an internal project. The user wants this categorized, so I should format my response as a JSON object. Following the required structure, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, ensuring the capitalization is exact with a capital \"I\" and \"P.\" \n\nHere we go: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
