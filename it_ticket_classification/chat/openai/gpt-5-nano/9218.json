Given the mention of a new member and user lookup, the Access category looks like the best fit, as it involves user access management and potential member code issues.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI need to think about the categories for this IT ticket, which include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the user's task is about adding a new member and relating to permissions, \"Access\" seems most appropriate. While \"Internal Project\" might work if it's project-specific, the mention of \"member code starting st\" suggests a username or employee code. The issue is that they can't find the user when searching. So, categorizing this ticket as \"Access\" makes the most sense, and I will output it as a JSON object.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
