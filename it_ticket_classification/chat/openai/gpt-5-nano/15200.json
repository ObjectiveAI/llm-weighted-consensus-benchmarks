The ticket is about actioning a missing time notification for annual leave and deals with timesheets. So, I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support.\" \n\nThe instructions specify that the response should be in JSON format, so I\u2019ll craft a response like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI'll keep it concise, without any extra text, as required."
