The request mentions switches, routers, and shipment \u2014 indicating that it likely falls under \"Hardware\" due to the devices. However, since it also includes procurement aspects, it might also fit in the \"Purchase\" category. The content is a bit ambiguous, but I'll consider it as an internal procurement request related to infrastructure.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m categorizing an IT ticket and considering the options available. The ticket discusses a request for network devices for a test environment, which suggests it might fit into either \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" However, there's also an \"Internal Project\" category that could be appropriate since it refers to a project-based request. Ultimately, the most fitting single category seems to be \"Purchase,\" as it\u2019s primarily about acquiring hardware. So, I should output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Categorizing IT Ticket Request**\n\nThe ticket content indicates a request for network devices, particularly switches and routers, for a test environment. It looks like they need assistance with procurement, pointing toward a \"Purchase\" category as being appropriate for requesting to buy hardware. Since \"Purchase\" fits the required category values, I\u2019ll output a JSON object specifying the category. Given the prompt to categorize the ticket, the response will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
