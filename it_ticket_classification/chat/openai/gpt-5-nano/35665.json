The ticket mentions a \"weird string when approving\" and suggests that a \"CR number or CR task\" should be in the top right corner. Since it addresses an issue related to approvals, it's likely linked to either \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Given that \"CR\" probably refers to Change Request, I\u2019ll decide on the best fit for the category. A JSON object with the category field is needed too!**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nI see that the ticket mentions a \"weird string letters when approving,\" which seems to indicate a UI or approval workflow issue. It might relate to something in the top right corner, possibly a CR number or task. The categories I'm considering include \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" Since it focuses on the approval process but doesn\u2019t mention login credentials, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Administrative Rights\" due to the context of permissions related to approvals and UI display.**Categorizing a UI issue**\n\nThe user mentions that a \"CR number or CR task should be there in the top right corner,\" indicating a bug in the approval screen UI. This isn't a hardware or storage issue, so I need to consider the appropriate category. It might fit under \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Internal Project\" if it's relevant to an internal feature. Given the specifics, I'll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous,\" since it pertains to an application UI issue but doesn't involve access rights or admin approvals.**Categorizing UI requirements**\n\nI'm focusing on the UI issue where a string should appear in the top right corner, rather than approval permissions. While \"Miscellaneous\" feels too generic, the user specifically mentions a \"CR number,\" likely referring to a change request in the context of an internal project. Since this is related to an internal tool, I believe it fits better under the \"Internal Project\" category. I'll respond with a JSON object indicating this choice, since it aligns perfectly with what the user expects.**Finalizing the category response**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that \u201cInternal Project\u201d is the most fitting category for this ticket. I\u2019ll provide the response in JSON format as specified: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. The user didn't request additional commentary, so I\u2019ll stick to just delivering the category in the required format. It\u2019s straightforward, and I\u2019m ready to share this JSON object now!"
