The user mentions terms like \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"help completion.\" It seems likely that this falls under \"HR Support\" since it's about onboarding. It could be considered \"Access\" if it involves access rights for the starter form, but that seems less probable. \"Administrative rights\" might be tempting, but the focus is clearly on onboarding forms, making \"HR Support\" the best fit here.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nOkay, I'm looking at the distinction between \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The reference to \"new starter\" is about onboarding, while \"starter form\" likely links to that process. Although there\u2019s a mention of \"head tax treasury,\" it\u2019s unclear. Since the focus is on new starter forms, I think \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate choice. I\u2019ll prepare a JSON-like output to categorize the ticket: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}, ensuring the capitalization is correct as per the requirements.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
