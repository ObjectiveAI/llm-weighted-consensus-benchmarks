It might be related to an HR or payroll system, possibly needing \"HR Support\" as the category. There's also a chance it's an \"Administrative rights\" issue if access is the problem.\n\nHowever, since it seems more about submitting time, I think \"HR Support\" makes the most sense. I'll propose this category in my response. JSON format could be helpful for clarity!**Generating JSON response**\n\nI need to output the category using the specified JSON format. The instruction is clear: I should respond with just the necessary JSON structure. Since \"HR Support\" is an allowed category, I\u2019ll use that. \n\nIt's essential to keep the response simple, with no extra content. So, I\u2019ll carefully craft it to look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Double-checking everything ensures I'm getting it right!"
