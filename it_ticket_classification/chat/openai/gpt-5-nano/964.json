There are no relevant categories for HR since those terms suggest something else, and \"Administrative rights\" feels too specific for this context. The required format appears to be a JSON-like object.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nThe user prompt asks me to categorize an IT ticket and respond with a JSON object indicating the category. The schema shows that I need to construct a JSON object with a \"category\" key, which has specific allowed values like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. I\u2019m going to select \"Access\" as it fits best. So, I'll respond with just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, without any additional text."
