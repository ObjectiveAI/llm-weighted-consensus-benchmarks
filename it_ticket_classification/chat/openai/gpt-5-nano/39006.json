The user\u2019s message is a bit jumbled but mainly revolves around feedback and satisfaction surveys, as well as issues with accessing survey links. It doesn\u2019t seem to fit hardware or HR, and while \u201cAccess\u201d relates to their inability to reach the survey, I\u2019m also considering \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d Since they specifically asked to categorize the ticket, I should output a JSON format with the chosen category.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm trying to determine if this ticket should be categorized as \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access.\" The user\u2019s message discusses logging an issue with a survey link and accessing feedback questions, indicating access-related problems. Considering that it mainly revolves around a software service rather than hardware, I believe \"Access\" fits better. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and categorize it as \"Access\" and prepare the JSON output with {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Formatting the JSON response**\n\nI need to format my response correctly since the tool expects a JSON object with a category field. The prompt specifically says to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" followed by a list of allowed categories. I\u2019ll ensure to output exactly: {\"category\":\"Access\"} with no extra text to meet the requirement. It\u2019s clear the user wants just the category, so I won\u2019t add any unnecessary details. I\u2019ve decided that \"Access\" is the right choice, so I\u2019ll return this final output."
