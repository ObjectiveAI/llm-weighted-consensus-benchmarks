The ticket mentions \"admin rights,\" \"add delete members,\" and permissions, which strongly indicate that it fits into the \"Administrative rights\" category. There's also the possibility of categorizing it as \"Access,\" since it relates to admin permissions. However, it seems best suited for \"Administrative rights,\" as that directly addresses the user's request. So, I'll format my output as a JSON object with the chosen category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket is requesting admin rights and mentions adding or deleting members, which indicates it's about user permissions management. The most appropriate category here is \"Administrative rights\" since that aligns directly with the request. I need to output a JSON object with the structure defined in the instructions. So, it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I\u2019ll deliver this concise response without unnecessary elaboration. Here's my final output."
