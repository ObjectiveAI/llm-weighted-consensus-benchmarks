I need to pick the best category from options like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Given the focus on incidents and corrective actions, \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems like a fitting choice, but I should consider all categories carefully to confirm.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating the categories available for the IT ticket. Unfortunately, there isn't a category for \"Security\" or \"IT Operations.\" \"Administrative rights\" relates to access, while \"Internal Project\" might fit best for tasks like implementing encryption across assets. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too broad, and \"Hardware\" doesn't apply unless hardware is mentioned. I need to provide a JSON object with the selected category.
