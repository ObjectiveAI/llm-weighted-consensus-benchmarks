It seems that the only relevant category is \"Administrative rights.\" Now, I need to confirm that I\u2019m outputting this in the right JSON format. The prompt indicates I should include the category in a specific structure, so I think I will go with: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} as the final answer. I just want to make sure my format is valid!**Categorizing access requests**\n\nThe ticket states \"make visible for our leadership,\" which indicates a need for visibility, suggesting it could fit under either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" If I have to choose, \"Administrative rights\" sounds more precise since it refers to specific privileges. However, since it's about visibility for the booking system, I might think \"Access\" fits better. But given the explicit mention of \"Administrative rights,\" I'll go ahead with that, resulting in: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
