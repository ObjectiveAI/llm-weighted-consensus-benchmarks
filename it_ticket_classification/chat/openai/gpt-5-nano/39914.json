Given the available categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and others, I notice that \"Network\" isn't an option. I\u2019m considering \"Miscellaneous\" since it covers general IT issues that don\u2019t fit into a specific category. While \"Access\" might seem related if there\u2019s a login issue, \"Miscellaneous\" appears to be the best fit overall for this situation.**Outputting IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user wrote about experiencing network issues, specifically slow connections. So, I\u2019ll categorize the ticket as \"Miscellaneous.\" According to the required format, I need to output a JSON object with a \"category\" field that includes one of the specified strings. The response should match exactly, meaning I will produce: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}\n\nI\u2019ll stick to this straightforward response without any extra commentary."
