The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It seems like the best fit for this ticket is \"Internal Project\" since it focuses on organizing and collecting various passions as part of a larger initiative. I\u2019ll return it formatted in JSON: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Categorizing the IT request**\n\nThe user\u2019s message discusses a \"passion map database,\" which suggests it relates to a project involving the collection of passions. Given the context, it seems most appropriate to categorize this as \"Internal Project,\" since it's about organizing passions under an initiative tied to a communication specialist. While \"Storage\" could fit due to the database aspect, the emphasis on the project leads me to lean towards \"Internal Project\" for the IT ticket categorization.**Concluding the categorization**\n\nI realize that while \"Storage\" is a category, \"Internal Project\" fits better based on the project nature indicated in the ticket description. The note primarily outlines an initiative related to a \"passion map.\" Since there's no action requested, it leans towards being categorized as \"Internal Project.\" So, I\u2019ll wrap it up and output the final result in JSON format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let's keep it clear and straightforward!"
