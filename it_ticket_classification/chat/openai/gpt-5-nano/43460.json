The user asked for help with a situation involving a phone that isn't available, mentions a meeting room, and requests a fix. It seems this involves hardware\u2014possibly a phone system. I might choose between \"Hardware\" or \"Administrative rights\" as the categories here. The ticket definitely revolves around phone availability, so \"Hardware\" feels like the most fitting choice!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think the best category for this IT ticket is likely \"Hardware\" because the issue relates to a phone that\u2019s not available. The mention of a phone extension might suggest access, but since it's about office phone availability, \"Hardware\" feels more accurate. The instruction clearly asks to categorize, and I believe the correct output format is a JSON object. So I\u2019ll respond with something like: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} since that fits the provided schema perfectly!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
