The string includes mentions of \"new project code oracle fusion,\" which likely references an ERP/Cloud product. It seems like the user is asking for something related to a project code. However, I'm not sure about classifying it definitively. This context makes me lean towards classifying it under \"Internal Project.\" I'll format the output in JSON with the appropriate category.**Classifying ticket details**\n\nThe text mentions \"form attached\" and \"booking forecasting client opportunity,\" which suggests it's related to an \"Internal Project.\" The phrase \"new project code\" fits well into this category. However, there\u2019s a thought about \"Administrative rights,\" which doesn\u2019t seem to apply here.\n\n\"Oracle fusion march pm\" might suggest project management software. I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" based on the context, as \"opportunity id\" and \"client engagement\" add to this interpretation. Access isn\u2019t explicitly requested, so I don't see that as fitting.**Finalizing category output**\n\nI think \"Internal Project\" is indeed the best classification for this IT ticket. I need to respond with a JSON format that specifies the category. The instructions state that I should provide only the category itself in the output, so I\u2019ll ensure to do just that without any extra commentary. \n\nAlright, I'll format the response like this:  \n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That's it! Simple and straightforward."
