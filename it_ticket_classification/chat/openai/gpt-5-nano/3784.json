The provided categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I should figure out which category best fits the user's long text. It looks like I need to form a JSON output that includes a \"category\" string enum. Let\u2019s figure out how to choose the most appropriate category for this request!**Analyzing offboarding details**\n\nThe content seems to focus on an employee offboarding process, touching on various topics like access rights, mailboxes, roaming profiles, and devices. It looks like I need to determine the best category for this. \"Access\" seems appropriate for items related to access rights, Active Directory, and mailboxes. \"Administrative rights\" could also fit for admin-related aspects. I'm not sure \"Internal Project\" applies here, and \"Storage\" might relate to inventory storage. I'll choose the category that best encapsulates these details!**Determining the right category**\n\nThe ticket mentions various aspects of an employee's offboarding process, like \"leaver form,\" \"mailbox,\" and access rights. It seems primarily focused on revoking access and collecting equipment. While \"HR Support\" could be a consideration, it feels more like an IT-related issue. Based on the details, the most fitting category is \"Access,\" as it deals with managing rights for a departing employee. I will output the JSON format as {\"category\":\"Access\"} to align with the required schema.**Outputting required JSON**\n\nThe tool expects a JSON formatted response for categorizing the IT ticket. The instruction specifically asks for the category, so I\u2019ll provide just that. I\u2019ll keep it minimal and directly output the category as \"Access.\" There's no need for extra text since the system requires a structured format. So, I'll go ahead and respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nLet\u2019s wrap this up!"
