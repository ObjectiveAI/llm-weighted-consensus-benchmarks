The ticket text is a bit jumbled up with typos but seems to involve tasks like adding names to a list and mentions \"infrastructure\" multiple times. This might relate to an internal project or possibly administrative rights, but I'm not entirely sure. I'll have to analyze the main focus more closely to determine the best fit from the categories listed.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out which category fits best for this IT ticket. It seems like \"Internal Project\" might be the right choice since it involves planning and infrastructure tasks. \"Administrative rights\" pertains more to permissions, and \"Access\" would focus on access rights. The mention of adding names to a list could lean either way, but without additional context, I think \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting due to its emphasis on infrastructure changes and scheduled tasks. I'll finalize this in a JSON-like format.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
