The predefined categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Given the confusion in the message, I should aim to assign it to the most appropriate category based on the core issue being raised. It looks like \"Internal Project\" might fit best.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket discusses moving a project between accounts and issues with importing survey contacts, which points to access and permissions. It seems to fit best under the \"Access\" category, since the focus is on account access. Although \"Internal Project\" could work too, the emphasis on moving projects makes \"Access\" more appropriate. I'll provide the categorization as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This format aligns with the required response structure.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
