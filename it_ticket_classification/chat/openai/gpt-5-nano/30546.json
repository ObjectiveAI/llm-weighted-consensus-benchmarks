It mentions \"polls change\" and \"after deploy done Tuesday,\" which suggests it\u2019s related to an internal project. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or even \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" The reference to \"links\" and \"stories\" might tie it to a Jira change request. However, change management or software doesn't fit the allowed categories, so I need to pick the best match.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm deciding on the best category for this IT ticket. It seems to be related to deployment and changes, which leans towards \"Internal Project.\" Other options like \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights\" don't fit as well since there's no mention of rights.\n\nI realize I need to output a JSON object. Based on previous tasks, the format should be straightforward, like: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. I should stick to this format without adding any extra text.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI\u2019m making sure to only provide the required JSON for the IT ticket, which discusses deployment and issues related to changes in polls. The mention of \"deploy done Tuesday\" indicates it\u2019s about internal project changes, so I\u2019m settling on \"Internal Project\" as the category.\n\nI'll format my response as: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. I need to double-check the casing and ensure it matches the enumerated set perfectly. Alright, I think I\u2019m good to finalize this!"
