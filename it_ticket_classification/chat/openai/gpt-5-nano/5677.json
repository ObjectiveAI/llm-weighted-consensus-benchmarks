This might relate to \"Hardware\" because it involves OS installation, or \"Administrative rights\" if admin access is needed. It could also link to \"Storage\" due to drive allocation. Which category fits best?**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket is about OS installation and drive allocation, so \"Storage\" seems related to storage issues. However, since it involves reinstalling the OS and partitioning, it could appropriately fall under \"Hardware\" due to the hardware setup on a laptop. The user mentions a \"senior developer mob zone,\" which suggests they might be identifying the request's context. I think \"Hardware\" fits best here. I'll respond with a JSON object in the format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Formatting Ticket Response**\n\nThe prompt clearly instructs me to categorize the IT ticket in the specified format. I need to ensure I'm outputting a JSON object where the \"category\" field contains an enumerated string. In this case, I'll use {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} as my response. I should probably keep it concise, sticking closely to the instructions. Since they require just the category object, I won't add anything extra \u2014 it needs to be straightforward and to the point!"
