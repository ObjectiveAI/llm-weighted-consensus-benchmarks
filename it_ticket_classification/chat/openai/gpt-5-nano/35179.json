They mention that the web mail server is not working, while the web server itself is functioning. There's reference to code review and a change password request. Given the options available\u2014like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others\u2014I\u2019ll have to decide which category fits best based on the core issues they've described. It's about finding the most appropriate match!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions that the \"web mail server is not working,\" along with \"change password\" and references to an application. This situation seems to involve service outages and access issues, making \"Access\" a relevant category due to the password change. However, the mention of \"code review\" and \"developer\" might suggest \"Internal Project.\" Since the main concern is access, I think I'll categorize it as \"Access\" but keep in mind that \"Internal Project\" could fit as well. I'll output the final category in JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Finalizing category output**\n\nIt looks like the ticket involves \"change password\" and mentions enabling accounts, so \"Access\" does seem to be the right category. I\u2019ll stick to providing just the category in JSON format since that\u2019s what's required. The format should be a simple JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to ensure I include the quotes correctly and avoid any extra text. Let\u2019s finalize that!"
