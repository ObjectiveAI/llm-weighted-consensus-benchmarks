It mentions a new purchase order (PO), logging allocation after receiving items, and the mandatory receipts section. It seems like it's mostly focused on purchasing, so I'm leaning towards the \"Purchase\" category. While terms like \"administrative rights\" pop up, the strongest theme is clearly about the PO, receipts, and allocation. So \"Purchase\" seems like the best fit!**Processing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user's request mentions logging allocation after receiving items, mandatory receipts, a receipt number, and a video link. It seems more focused on the procurement process rather than hardware installation. While I considered \"Administrative rights,\" it doesn't really fit here since it's not about permissions. The best match appears to be \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll format my response as a categorized JSON object, following the required structure for clarity.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
