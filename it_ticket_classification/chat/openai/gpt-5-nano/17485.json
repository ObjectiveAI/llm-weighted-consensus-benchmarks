The ticket seems to revolve around scheduled shutdowns involving hardware and maintenance. While hardware is a strong candidate due to the nature of equipment shutdowns, Administrative rights could also apply if approvals are needed. However, the category choices feel a bit limited and don\u2019t perfectly fit the content discussed.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nThe ticket is about coordinating a shutdown and managing equipment, so I'll categorize it as Hardware. I should create a concise JSON object for this, following the instruction to respond with the category only. The allowed format is clear, and I need to ensure to use the correct case, so I\u2019ll format it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI need to maintain the lowercase requirement properly, with \"Hardware\" having a capital 'H.' Alright, let's get this done!"
