Since \"Software\" isn't a category in the provided list, I\u2019m leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" for general IT issues. \"Access\" is more about permissions and login, which doesn\u2019t seem to fit here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about the ticket regarding issues like \u201cweb not working as expected\u201d and problems with document previews. It doesn't quite fit into categories like \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" Since it\u2019s about web functionality, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the best fit since there's no \"Software\" category. I could consider \"Internal Project\" if it were a project or \"Access\" if it were about permissions.
