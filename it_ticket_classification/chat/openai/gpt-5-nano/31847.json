This seems to fall under permissions or access rights. Generally, \"Administrative rights\" fits best for changing an approver's role, but it might also relate to \"Internal Project\" since it involves internal project management.\n\nHowever, since \"time cards approver\" connects more with HR/payroll, I should categorize this ticket as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it specifically involves changing the approver role, I'll choose \"Administrative rights.\"**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to determine the correct category for the request about changing the approver role. \"Administrative rights\" is specific to permissions and role changes, while \"Access\" is more general. Since the request centers on changing the approver role, I conclude it should be categorized as \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nNow, I'll present this as a JSON object. The system requires a clean format, so I\u2019ll stick to just the JSON without any extra text.\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
