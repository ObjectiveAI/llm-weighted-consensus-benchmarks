The ticket mentions disabling cards for former interns, card activations, leavers, forms, permissions, and active ad accounts. This seems to revolve around access control and user offboarding, which suggests it fits the \"Access\" category. While \"HR Support\" is a possibility because of the leaver form, it\u2019s primarily about IT\u2019s handling of access. So, \"Access\" is likely the correct choice.**Analyzing user request**\n\nThe user's message requests disabling cards for former interns and activating cards for leavers, along with mentioning the leaver form and permissions. It seems to involve managing access for offboarding and current leavers, which typically falls under IT Offboarding and Access Management. I need to focus on these elements to ensure a clear response and identify the main actions required. Overall, it's about ensuring proper access control during and after the internship.**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nIt looks like the \"Access\" category is indeed the best fit for this IT ticket. The option for \"Administrative rights\" isn\u2019t quite right, and \"Internal Project\" doesn't apply here. So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object indicating the category as \"Access.\" The prompt strictly asks for categorization, so I\u2019ll keep it simple. The final content should be just that JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll double-check that I\u2019m matching the required format exactly."
