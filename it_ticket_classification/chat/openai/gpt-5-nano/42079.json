The user mentions something about previous submissions being approved but now appearing as not submitted, which indicates an issue. \n\nLooking at the provided categories, I think this issue likely relates to \u201cAccess\u201d since it concerns submission confirmation and possibly permissions. I will output this in a JSON format, indicating that the best fit is the \"Access\" category.**Analyzing IT ticket issues**\n\nThe ticket describes a situation where previously submitted and approved items are now showing as not submitted, and it mentions needing to find the \"submit\" button. This suggests a potential UI issue or glitch affecting submission statuses and possibly leading to confusion about whether items can be resubmitted.\n\nGiven the context, I think this fits best under the \"Access\" category since it deals with permissions and submission visibility in the system. It's not strictly a login issue, but it relates to access and functionality.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm trying to find the best category for this IT ticket. \"Miscellaneous\" seems fitting since it doesn\u2019t fall under hardware, storage, purchases, or HR support. I initially thought about \"Administrative rights\" due to the submission issue, but that\u2019s more about a bug in the submission status than actual permissions. \n\nSo, \"Miscellaneous\" might work as a generic option; however, \u201cAccess\u201d could also cover it given the submission workflow problem. Still, since it\u2019s primarily a UI bug, I\u2019ll stick with \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll format this as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
