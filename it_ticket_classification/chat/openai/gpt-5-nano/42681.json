This ticket addresses an urgent pipeline issue where data isn\u2019t showing correctly, and there's a concern about data loss due to an overnight process. It could fit into \"Storage\" because of data loss or \"Internal Project\" since it pertains to a specific data pipeline. I'll probably lean towards \"Internal Project\".**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket includes terms like \"pipeline\", \"data cleared\", and \"overnight process deleting data\", which suggests it\u2019s not related to hardware, access, or administrative rights. It likely falls under \"Storage\", \"Internal Project\", or \"Miscellaneous\". I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since it concerns a pipeline tied to an internal project, but \"Storage\" could work too due to the focus on data deletion. I\u2019ll output the JSON format with the category as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Deciding the category**\n\nThe schema specifies that I need to return a JSON object with a category string from the allowed list. Based on the ticket details, I initially suggested {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, but after considering the situation\u2014it mentions urgent pipeline data loss due to an overnight deletion\u2014\"Storage\" could be a better fit. Since the focus is on deleted data, I'll go with \"Storage\". My final output will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Choosing the category**\n\nThe user mentioned \"unknown pipeline data cleared\" and an overnight process deleting data, indicating a storage-related issue with missing data. Given this, \"Storage\" seems like the most appropriate category to reflect the problem. Therefore, I\u2019ll go with \"Storage\" to highlight the data storage and retention issue. My output will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. Now, I'm ready to proceed!"
