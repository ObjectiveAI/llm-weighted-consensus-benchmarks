The ticket clearly states there's a machine not working, which indicates a hardware issue. Even though I thought about potentially categorizing it under \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" it's clear this is primarily a hardware problem. I'll finalize the response as a JSON object with the category labeled as \"Hardware,\" following the requested format.**Outputting JSON Category**\n\nI need to ensure that my output matches the required format specified. The instructions say to respond with a JSON object that has a category field. Given that the category is \"Hardware,\" the appropriate output should just be {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It's interesting because the initial guidance also included a broader JSON schema, but I need to stick to delivering just what the user requested: the category without any additional text or explanation. So, I'll keep it neat and straightforward."
