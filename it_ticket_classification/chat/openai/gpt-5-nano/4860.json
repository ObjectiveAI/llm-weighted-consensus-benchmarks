The predefined categories include \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and more. Since the content points towards managing an application and creating a template, it seems to fit well with \"Internal Project.\" However, I\u2019ll consider \"Miscellaneous\" too since it isn't entirely clear. There are no access details mentioned, so \"Access\" doesn't seem appropriate.**Deciding the ticket category**\n\nThe phrase \"application management\" isn't clearly defined in the categories, but \"Internal Project\" seems the best fit considering the user's request about creating a code template. There's no specific category for software development or code, but since it's an internal task, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" Alternatively, \"Miscellaneous\" could apply for vague requests, but I want to be as precise as possible. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object for clarity.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with the category value in JSON format, as required. The user specifically asked to categorize the IT ticket, so I\u2019ll format my answer as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It\u2019s clear that they don\u2019t want additional explanations, just the categorization itself. I'll stick to the schema provided earlier and keep it simple. So, let's go with that JSON output!"
