I\u2019ll need to categorize this under either \"Hardware\" or \"Access\" based on its ambiguity. Let's see which fits best!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis ticket seems to be about wiping devices, especially since \"unable order own tickets\" suggests trouble with ticket ordering. The repeated mention of \"wipe\" could relate to both \"Storage\" and \"Hardware,\" since wiping typically involves data management or device handling. There's also a hint of \"Access\" rights connected to this. Given the context, it seems like categorizing it under \"Storage\" is the best fit, since this involves data sanitization, but \"Hardware\" could work too.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nSince the focus is on data erasure, categorizing this IT ticket under \"Storage\" makes the most sense. The phrase \"announce ready taking regards officer\" doesn't add meaningful context, so I can confidently go with \"Storage.\" \n\nNow, I need to format my response as a JSON object per the system's requirements. I should use the structure provided and include \"Storage\" in the category field. Here\u2019s how it looks:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"} \n\nThis keeps it clean and follows the necessary syntax!"
