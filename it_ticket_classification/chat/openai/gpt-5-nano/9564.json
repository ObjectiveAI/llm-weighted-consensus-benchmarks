The ticket choices include categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given that this is specifically about completing an HR exit form, I think \"HR Support\" would be the most appropriate category for this request. Let's proceed with that choice!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis ticket relates to HR, and the category options include \"HR Support.\" Since the user mentioned needing access to a \"leaver form\" and is facing issues with links and completion, the most fitting category is clearly \"HR Support.\" I don't think it falls under access rights or administrative tasks. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll create a JSON output to categorize it, following the required schema. The response will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
