It seems the key issue is that the expense report was rejected due to restrictions around attachments. I\u2019m thinking it could fit under \"Administrative rights,\" \"Purchase,\" or perhaps \"Miscellaneous,\" focusing on the expense report workflow application.**Determining the right category**\n\nI think the ticket fits best under \"Access\" since it concerns getting into the task application and attachment issues. It seems to be more of a workflow challenge rather than a hardware or storage issue. While \"Miscellaneous\" could cover general IT problems, \"Internal Project\" might apply if it\u2019s specific to an expense system. Given the focus on permissions and the recipient's inability to attach files, the \"Access\" category seems most appropriate.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nIt looks like we should categorize this ticket as \"Access\" because it involves accessing the task application and dealing with issues related to attachments. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object, adhering to the schema provided. So, my output will simply be: \n\n{ \"category\": \"Access\" }\n\nI want to make sure I'm precise with the quotes and that there\u2019s no extra text or spaces. Delivering just the JSON is the best approach here!"
