The ticket involves a user receiving a feedback notification twice and requesting investigation. It doesn't seem to fit categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Purchase.\" I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" because it's a general IT support issue regarding notification duplication. \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it were about access control, but here, it\u2019s simply about the duplication of a notification.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on categorizing the IT ticket based on its content. \"HR Support,\" \"Purchase,\" and even \"Internal Project\" don\u2019t seem relevant here. The request is regarding a notification received twice, suggesting a bug or duplication, which leans me towards \"Miscellaneous.\" Standard categories like \"Software\" or \"Notifications\" aren\u2019t listed. Ultimately, I will produce a JSON-like object to categorize this as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I want to stick to what\u2019s required, following the specified format without extra information.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to follow the instruction for categorizing the IT ticket, which usually just requires the category itself. Based on my analysis, I\u2019ve determined the appropriate category is \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll format my output as a valid JSON string, ensuring it follows all requirements for proper escaping. The final output will be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text included, just the required JSON formatting. Let's finalize that!"
