The key phrases mention \"password change,\" \"expire days,\" and \"cannot change.\" It looks like there's a login issue related to password expiration. \n\nMy best guess is that this ticket fits into the \"Access\" category, as it\u2019s primarily about managing password access. However, it's also possible to consider \"Administrative rights\" since it's related to user permissions on a PC.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThis ticket includes mentions of \"ctrl alt delete\" and changing password settings, indicating a Windows login issue. It specifically refers to changing password expiration days and expresses frustration about outdated credentials.\n\nI think the category that fits best for this ticket is \"Access,\" which includes login credentials and password resets. It\u2019s not about requesting administrative privileges, so categorizing it as \"Access\" makes the most sense. I should prepare a succinct response in JSON format.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to output a JSON object that designates the category for the IT ticket. The schema specifies it should be in the format: {\"category\": \"string\"}. I'm pretty sure \"Access\" is the right choice since the ticket references \"password change\" and \"expire days,\" indicating it's about password policy.\n\nWhile \"Administrative rights\" could also be considered, it really seems like the core issue is related to access to user accounts. So, I will finalize the output as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
