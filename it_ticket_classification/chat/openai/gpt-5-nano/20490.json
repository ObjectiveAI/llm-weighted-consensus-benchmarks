The mention of \"Tuesday February PM\" might refer to a calendar event, indicating a timeline. The phrase \"accept decline\" hints at a decision about sharing these templates. Since the content isn't strictly IT-focused, it leans towards HR support. I'll categorize this under \"HR Support\" since it fits best within the provided categories.**Assigning ticket category**\n\nI need to determine the best category for this request, which mentions sharing job description templates. It could pertain to wanting to send attachments for a meeting scheduled on Tuesday, but it doesn't connect directly to IT. While \"Access\" might seem relevant, there's no mention of specific access rights needed. Since \"job description templates\" indicate an HR context, I'll assign the category as \"HR Support\". \n\nThe output should be a clean JSON object, specifically:  \n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}**Clarifying output format**\n\nI see that I've been provided a sample schema for the response, which indicates a specific format. The instructions indeed tell me to output in this schema, but typically, I would just provide the category as a short value. It seems I\u2019m expected to encapsulate my response in that schema, which makes it confusing since the task often just needs the category. \n\nI\u2019ll format my output as:  \n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}  \nIt feels like the straightforward way to fulfill the requirement!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
