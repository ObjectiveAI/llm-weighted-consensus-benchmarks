The user is asking for access to a shared project folder and possibly something related to \u201cmaxim.\u201d Their sentence is a bit of a mess, but it seems like it primarily involves requests for access to folders. Given the context, the best categories to consider are \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but it could also fit under \"Storage\" due to the mention of shared folder access. I'll go with \"Access\" for clarity.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nIt looks like the most suitable category for this IT ticket is either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The request mentions access to a project shared folder and possibly refers to a user named \"maxim.\" Since the focus is on granting access, I think \"Access\" is the primary choice for this case. \"Administrative rights\" seems too specific since it doesn't involve elevated privileges beyond shared folder access. I'll go with \"Access\" as it fits the general need for sharing.**Outputting IT ticket category**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to provide it in a specific JSON format. The required category is \"Access,\" which fits the user's request. I have to make sure to only include that JSON object with no extra text or notes. So, I'll structure the response like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Okay, I\u2019m ready to present just that JSON object as required."
