Given the content, this ticket could fit into \"Miscellaneous,\" as it doesn't clearly align with other categories like Hardware or HR Support. I\u2019ll go ahead and classify it!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm considering whether to categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" The phrases in the text like \"update addresses,\" \"create owner members,\" and \"delete\" suggest it might be about managing group memberships. While it could fit under \"Administrative rights,\" there seems to be a bigger focus on access control regarding group updates. Since it's primarily about adjusting membership, I feel like \"Access\" is the most fitting category. I will categorize it accordingly!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
