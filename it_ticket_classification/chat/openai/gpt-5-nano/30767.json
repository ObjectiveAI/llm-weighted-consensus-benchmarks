The ticket mentions adding a new employee to \"Wednesday PM,\" which might refer to a shift or group. The request also includes \"add wireless,\" likely indicating a need for wireless network access. Considering this, I should categorize it under \"Access\" since it involves granting access to wireless networks for a new employee.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket appears to involve adding a new employee to the Wednesday PM schedule and granting wireless access. The mention of \"lead\" could refer to the lead person, but I'm not certain. In terms of categories, \"Access\" is relevant for user accounts and permissions. This seems to fit best, considering the wireless access request too. While \"Internal Project\" came to mind, \"Access\" seems the most appropriate since it's about enabling access for an employee.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to classify an IT ticket, and I think the appropriate category is \"Access.\" It involves adding a new employee to the Wednesday PM schedule and enabling wireless access, both of which are access-related tasks. I'll prepare a concise response as a JSON object since the prompt suggests that format. Based on the category schema, my final output will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
