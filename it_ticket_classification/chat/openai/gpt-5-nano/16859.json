The text mentions \"com ownership\" and a request to move under ownership, which confuses me a bit. It sounds like they're dealing with access issues or permissions related to computer ownership or perhaps a specific process. Since the closest category here seems to fit \"Access,\" I'll respond with that in a JSON-like format, considering their request appropriately.**Evaluating IT ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket, which mentions \"cannot modify members,\" \"ownership,\" and \"move under ownership.\" This suggests it could be about \"Administrative rights\" since it seems related to permissions. But \"Access\" also feels relevant as it focuses on access control issues. I wonder which category fits best. The ticket specifies transferring ownership, pointing me toward either \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d or \u201cAccess,\u201d but \"Access\" might be more fitting overall based on their needs.**Choosing the category for IT ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"ownership\" keeps coming up, which leads me to think of categories like \"Administrative rights,\" typically used for admin rights requests. There's also \"Access\" for general access needs. The mention of \"cannot modify members\" suggests it's about group membership, which relates to access control. However, given the focus on ownership and modifying rights, \"Administrative rights\" seems like a more specialized and appropriate choice here. I'll output the JSON object: \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
