It seems to be a software or application issue, so I\u2019m considering categories like \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" However, the right terms for software issues aren't available, so I'm inclined towards \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d or perhaps \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d if it\u2019s a permissions issue. It\u2019s tricky without more information!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m reconsidering whether the ticket should be categorized under \"Internal Project,\" especially since it relates to uploading a contract. The categories available are \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" and others. The user\u2019s issue could be a software bug or an access issue since they\u2019re experiencing an error while adding a supplier. Based on the information, it seems best to categorize it as either \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I should respond in a JSON format indicating the chosen category.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI think \"Miscellaneous\" works as a safe option for a general IT issue, but since this involves an operation within the system, \"Access\" might be better if it relates to permissions. However, the user doesn't mention access denial, just an error when uploading a contract, which could be a bug. I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous\" for a broader classification. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} and keep it minimal, focusing solely on the category."
