They mention needing a new Oracle code and refer to a spreadsheet with details, which makes it tricky since it doesn\u2019t fit neatly into one category. \n\nLooking at the options, it seems like \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit because the ticket touches on various topics including coding, spreadsheets, and a pipeline. Let\u2019s go with that for now!**Determining the Right Category**\n\nI'm analyzing the user's request about needing an Oracle code and an icon. The mention of a spreadsheet implies specific details, but it\u2019s pretty vague overall. The project management term about the \"pipeline\" might connect to internal work. \n\nAfter considering the categories, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit because it aligns with creating code and icons related to internal IT tasks. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket under \"Internal Project\"!**Formatting the Response**\n\nI need to justify this request, which seems to involve developing new code or icons based on a spreadsheet and an opportunity ID. It clearly falls under an internal IT project and doesn't relate to hardware or access.\n\nNow, I need to respond with the category in a specific JSON format. The required output is straightforward: \n\n{\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}\n\nThat's the format I need to stick to, and I won't add extra notes since it\u2019s about parsing and keeping it clean. Let\u2019s go with that!{\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}"
