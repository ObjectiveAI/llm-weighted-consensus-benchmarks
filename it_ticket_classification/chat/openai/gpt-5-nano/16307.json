The content indicates they're asking for help with a \"starter form\" multiple times, which suggests onboarding. Possible categories I\u2019m considering are HR Support, Access, or Administrative rights. Since it relates to onboarding, \"HR Support\" feels like the most appropriate category here. If there\u2019s an IT ticket categorization category for onboarding, that fits perfectly.**Determining IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize an IT ticket focused on onboarding tasks. The user provided text mentions a \"starter form\" and \"new starter,\" which suggests this is related to HR functions. However, onboarding might also involve \"Access\" provisioning or \"Administrative rights.\" I need to assign a category from the allowed values: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and so forth. Given the emphasis on \"starter form\" for onboarding, \"HR Support\" seems like the most suitable choice.**Clarifying IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on categorizing an IT ticket related to onboarding. The ticket mentions a \"starter form,\" which implies the user wants help filling it out rather than needing access or administrative rights. Given its emphasis on onboarding new starters, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit. While \"Access\" could apply if the form relates to granting access, it feels more like an onboarding request. Therefore, I lean towards categorizing it as \"HR Support\" based on the specific context.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI see that the term \"starter form\" refers to an onboarding form used by HR to collect information about a new employee. The user has asked me to categorize the IT ticket, and \"HR Support\" clearly fits best. So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object for that category: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. Since the prompt specifies just to categorize, I\u2019ll provide only the JSON output without additional explanation. Let's go with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
