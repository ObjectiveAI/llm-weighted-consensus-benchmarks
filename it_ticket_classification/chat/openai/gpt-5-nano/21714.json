The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It looks like the ticket is primarily about a new purchase order, so \"Purchase\" seems to be the best fit. \"Hardware\" might also apply, but I think \"Purchase\" is more accurate given the context.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI see that the ticket is asking for the installation to be logged, which could hint at maintenance but isn't on the list. \"Hardware\" might fit since it's about installing purchased hardware, but the ticket mentions \"new purchase\" explicitly twice. So, \"Purchase\" is my best choice for categorization. The user expects a JSON output with the category field, so I'll follow the required structure and respond with this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. That aligns with the specified schema.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
