The keywords \"access\" and \"sign issue\" make me think it fits into the \"Access\" category, or potentially \"Administrative rights.\" Since access control is at play, I'll likely assign it to the \"Access\" category.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this ticket as \"Access\" since the user mentions access, not necessarily admin rights. Their phrase \"hi please cannot these thanks\" is a bit unclear, yet the main focus appears to be on accessing a sign issue for Thursday PM. I think \"Access\" fits well, but \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it's about permission to sign. I\u2019ll stick with \"Access\" for now and ensure the response is formatted in JSON for the categorization.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
