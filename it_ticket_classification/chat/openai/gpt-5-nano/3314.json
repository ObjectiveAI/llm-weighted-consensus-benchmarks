The ticket text is messy but appears to deal with upgrading user notifications, app upgrades, user AD groups, and admin rights. It seems to fit into the categories of \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" or \"Access,\" given the themes of software upgrades, admin tasks, and backlog management connected to sprints and modifications.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nThe categories I have are limited. Hardware, HR Support, and Storage don\u2019t fit. Access might relate to user upgrades and rights. Miscellaneous is too vague. I see this ticket as likely pertaining to an Internal Project due to the focus on software upgrades and project management, mentioning backlog, sprints, and subtasks, indicating a Jira project. The phrase \"Internal Project\" seems most appropriate. I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as such and prepare my answer in JSON format.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize this IT ticket from a specific list: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The required format is a JSON-like object showing the category. Given our previous analysis, the best fit is \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll keep the response concise\u2014no extra explanations are needed\u2014so I\u2019ll format my output as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let's proceed with that!"
