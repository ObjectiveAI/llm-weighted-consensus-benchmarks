They mention \"cards for approval\" and an error message related to submission. It seems like a workflow issue within an IT system. Now, looking at the ticket categories available, I need to figure out which one fits best. \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Purchase,\" or \"Internal Project\" might all be possible options for categorizing this ticket effectively.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this ticket regarding \"submitting cards for approval.\" It could relate to \"Purchase,\" especially if these cards are corporate credit cards. The mention of workflow indicates a procurement process could be involved. However, if it's a permissions issue preventing submission, \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" may be relevant as well. Yet, given the context, it seems like \"Purchase\" is the best fit for issues related to purchasing approvals.**Preparing category output**\n\nThe user noted an \"error message\" when submitting for approval, which leads me to think that the \"Purchase\" category is indeed appropriate. I need to provide a JSON-like format for this response. The system requires a specific structure for the output, so I\u2019ll say:  \n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}  \nThis format matches the required category enumerations perfectly. I want to ensure I adhere to the instructions closely by not adding any extra text. Let's move forward with this response!"
