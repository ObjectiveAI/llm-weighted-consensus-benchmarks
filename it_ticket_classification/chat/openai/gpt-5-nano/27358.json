The ticket text discusses various phrases about access rights, site ownership, and permissions. It seems that \"Access\" fits best, as it revolves around full control and permissions issues. \"Administrative rights\" might also apply, but \"Access\" appears to be the most central theme based on what's being described in the ticket.**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories available, and \"Administrative rights\" seems tied to granting admin access, which fits with the phrases like \"full control access\" and \"owner rights.\" However, this ticket also focuses on site access across different owners. It mentions \"site permissions by owners\" and tasks like \"assign phase\" and \"migrate old guidelines.\" Given the emphasis on management and access, I think \"Access\" is the best category. I'll respond with a JSON object for the category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
