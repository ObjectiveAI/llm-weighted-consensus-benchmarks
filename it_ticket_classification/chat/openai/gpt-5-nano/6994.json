The ticket discusses expense report approval, so it's more about financial processes than IT hardware. The category \"Purchase\" seems the most appropriate since it relates to expenses. Other categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" don't quite fit. Therefore, I'll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}, ensuring it meets the required format without heavy formatting.**Responding with JSON Object**\n\nThe prompt asks me to categorize an IT ticket. I've got a specific structure to follow that outlines valid channels for the response. I'll respond with a JSON object indicating the category. Based on what I\u2019ve analyzed, \u201cPurchase\u201d is the right category here. So, my response will look like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. This should fulfill the requirements without any extra text or formatting."
