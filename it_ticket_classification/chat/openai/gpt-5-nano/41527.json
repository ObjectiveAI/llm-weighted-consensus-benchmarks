The user gives me a text with the ticket content, and my task is to determine which category fits best. I want to ensure I'm choosing the most appropriate label, so I\u2019ll carefully consider the details in the ticket before making my decision. Let's get started!**Analyzing ticket details**\n\nI'm diving into a messy string filled with multiple instances of someone saying there's an issue with \"submit task details.\" They mention things like trying to resubmit due to an error displayed about needing a task for leave. It seems the user needs help sorting out these Oracle task details, and they\u2019re even pointing out that a colleague has the same issue, suggesting it might be isolated. I\u2019ll focus on these key points to address the problem effectively.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize this IT ticket, considering it might fit under Access or Internal Project. The issue seems to revolve around submitting details due to an error message. I see options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The text mentions Oracle task details and errors, suggesting it relates to access permissions. Since the user can't submit and has colleagues facing the same issue, I\u2019ll categorize it as Access. Let's go with that!**Identifying ticket issue**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether this issue is an \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" problem. It doesn\u2019t seem related to hardware, storage, purchase, or HR tasks. The mention of \"Oracle task details\" indicates a software context, likely a task management system. Since the ticket is asking for help with task submissions, this suggests a software usage issue. While \"Access\" could work for permission problems, it seems more about a submission error rather than system access. So, I might lean towards categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous.\"{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
