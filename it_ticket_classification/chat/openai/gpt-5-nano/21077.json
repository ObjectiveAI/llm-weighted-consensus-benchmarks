The most relevant category isn't directly listed, and \"Administrative rights\" doesn't fit here either. It seems like this could be related to scheduling preventive maintenance in February.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe user wants to add a station to the February PM schedule, and this is an IT ticket related to a maintenance schedule, not hardware or storage. I\u2019m considering if it fits under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It could also relate to an ongoing project, warranting the \"Internal Project\" category. However, there\u2019s no clear request for access rights. The safest bet seems to be \"Miscellaneous,\" as it\u2019s a generic request that doesn't fit perfectly anywhere else.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nThe user seems to want to add a station to a PM schedule, possibly related to maintenance management or an internal project. \"PM\" might refer to \"Project Manager,\" making this more complex. Since I need to categorize the IT ticket, I realize the response might only need a category label without extra explanation. Based on the provided options, \"Miscellaneous\" appears to be the best fit. So, I\u2019ll structure my output as JSON: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
