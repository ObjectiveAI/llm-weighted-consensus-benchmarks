It mentions ownership control, AD groups, and how members can contribute. The appropriate categories seem to be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" based on the themes of permissions, ownership, and management roles outlined. Since the ticket specifically asks about managing AD groups and membership permissions, I think \"Administrative rights\" fits well, but \"Access\" is also relevant.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
