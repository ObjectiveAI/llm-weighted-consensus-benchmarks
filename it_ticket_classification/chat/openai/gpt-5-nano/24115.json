It seems related to a ServiceNow notification issue involving queue assignments and ownership changes. The allowed categories are: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the content, it sounds like it might fit best under \"Miscellaneous\" since it covers various issues without a clear focus. I'm going to proceed with that classification!**Parsing IT ticket text**\n\nI'm parsing the user's message, and it's quite garbled. It mentions \"ServiceNow notification,\" which is a system, and suggests something has changed regarding expected behavior since yesterday. There are repeated mentions of \"assigned queue,\" \"assigned individual,\" and \"change owner,\" implying issues with case management. This could relate to categories like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It might even connect to \"Internal Project\" if it's an IT project issue. I'll tentatively categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" for clarity.**Determining right category**\n\nI'm considering the ticket details further and ruling out categories like hardware, storage, or purchase. It could be relevant to \"Access\" if it's about permissions. The \"Administrative rights\" category seems the strongest fit due to mentions of \"change owner\" and managing assignments. Since the ticket discusses case ownership and permissions in ServiceNow, \"Administrative rights\" is likely the best choice. However, \"Access\" could also be appropriate if it specifically concerns access rights. I need to finalize which category best fits!**Finalizing category selection**\n\nThe content of the ticket is focused on notifications and assignments within ServiceNow. It's not so much about granting access but rather managing ownership, like changing the owner of cases and who is assigned to the queue. I\u2019m debating between \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access.\" The ticket fits more under \"Access\" since it concerns assignment and ownership. I\u2019ll finalize the response as a JSON object format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s clear and concise; that works perfectly!"
