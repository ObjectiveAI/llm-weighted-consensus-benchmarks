The user mentioned several details regarding off-boarding a leaver, such as leave date, location, and tasks like handling mailbox and AD rights. Given the context, it seems that the most suitable category is Access, but it could also be Administrative Rights or HR Support. Overall, it looks like the main focus is on access-related tasks for the off-boarding process.**Creating JSON for IT ticket**\n\nI need to confirm the category for an IT ticket regarding the leaver off-boarding workflow. Given that it primarily involves access and potentially administrative rights, I will categorize it as Access. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object since that's what's required. The specific format will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll make sure to keep it straightforward and provide only the JSON without any extra text.
