Since it specifically talks about approval authority, it likely falls under \"Administrative rights.\" However, \"Access\" is also an option. It really sounds like the user is asking for a modification in the approval workflow.**Classifying Ticket Category**\n\nI should choose the \"Administrative rights\" category for this IT ticket since it specifically pertains to changing an approver. The user mentions \"projects\" and the date, indicating they might be requesting a different approver for that time. While there\u2019s also an \"Internal Project\" category, this seems most relevant to access or approval rights. So, I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object with the category set to \"Administrative rights.\" Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll return: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.**Outputting JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nI need to output a JSON object for categorizing the IT ticket. The instruction clearly states we should present the category in the specified format. Given that the ticket emphasizes changing an approver, I believe \"Administrative rights\" is the most fitting category, focusing on permissions. While \"Access\" could also apply, it's more about enabling accounts, which isn\u2019t the case here. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and return: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
