The content seems a bit jumbled, but it mentions aspects like screen usage, TVs, and infrastructure activities. It seems most relevant to \"Hardware\" since screens and TVs fall under that category. However, I\u2019m also considering \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" since those might fit too. For clarity and relevance, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate category for this ticket.**Finalizing category response**\n\nI've decided that the IT ticket should be categorized as \"Hardware,\" since it doesn't relate to logins or access issues. I\u2019m preparing to respond with a JSON-like category object. The required format specifies that I return just the category field with no extra commentary, so I'll stick to that. My final response will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, ensuring there\u2019s no extraneous whitespace. I think this will meet the requirements perfectly!"
