The ticket content points to problems activating the license. The available categories include Access, Purchase, and Administrative rights. Since this problem relates specifically to software license activation, the most fitting category is \"Access,\" as it clearly falls under accessing the software. So, I'll go ahead and categorize this ticket as \"Access.\"**Verifying ticket category**\n\nI'm looking at the user's text about \"idea license issues\" and it seems like they need help with license activation. The best fit for categorization would be \"Access,\" since it relates directly to software access. There's also a mention of \"free tickets,\" but the main concern appears to be the license activation. So, I'll categorize this as \"Access.\" I need to output it in the required JSON format, like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Responding with category**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket. I\u2019ll provide a simple JSON object as a response. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to ensure there\u2019s no extra commentary \u2014 just the category. It seems like the user's issue relates to accessing their IDEA license, which I think stands for IntelliJ IDEA from JetBrains. So, \"Access\" is definitely the appropriate choice for this ticket."
