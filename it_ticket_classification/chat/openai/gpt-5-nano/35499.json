The content emphasizes admin leaver access, write access, and the need to move files for updated documentation related to design testing. Since it focuses on access permissions and admin rights, it seems clear that the most fitting category would be either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I'll choose \"Access\" for this ticket.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on access permissions and admin rights here. The text mentions that \"admin leaver access cannot be removed,\" along with other terms like \"permission\" and \"write access.\" I feel like \"Access\" is the more general term, while \"Administrative rights\" is more specific. Since it's primarily about ensuring admin rights can't be removed, the precise category might be \"Administrative rights.\" However, the assignment is just to categorize, so I should format my answer as {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm looking at the text mentioning \"admin leaver access cannot be removed,\" which likely refers to preventing the deletion of admin access when an employee leaves. Since the task is to categorize the IT ticket, \"Administrative rights\" seems like the best fit. I'll produce the JSON response as {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} while ensuring it's properly formatted. I just want to make sure everything aligns with the allowed strings like \"Administrative rights,\" so I'll finalize it now."
