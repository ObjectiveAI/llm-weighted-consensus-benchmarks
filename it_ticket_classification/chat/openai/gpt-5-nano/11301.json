The available categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" My goal is to figure out which category fits best based on the content of the ticket. Once I determine the appropriate category, I\u2019ll structure it into a JSON object format for output. This should help organize the ticket properly!I'm working through the ticket content, which is quite jumbled. It appears to relate to an employee leaver form, mentioning details like the leaving date, location, ServiceNow, and various permissions such as Active Directory rights and mailbox access. There are also references to inventory storage and necessary information that needs to be addressed. To categorize this correctly, I'll need to focus on the overall theme of the ticket and clarify what information to include. This will help determine the best category for it!I'm determining how to categorize this IT ticket, which is clearly related to offboarding and user account management. The term \"leaver\" suggests it's about disabling accounts and permissions, so \"Access\" seems to fit best because it covers AD rights, mailboxes, and roaming profiles. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply, \"Access\" is more general. I just need to format my output correctly as a JSON object with the category set to \"Access.\" So, the final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
