The provided categories include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It sounds like this involves access issues since it mentions pending approvals and restrictions on viewing expense reports. So, I think the most appropriate category is \"Access,\" considering it's mostly about access to the expense report system and the inability to approve due to the queue.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that includes the category field for the IT ticket classification. The prompt clearly states to categorize the ticket, so I should format my response like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's crucial to keep it concise and direct, providing only the JSON output without any extra explanation unless specifically requested. So, I'll make sure that this is the only content in my response."
