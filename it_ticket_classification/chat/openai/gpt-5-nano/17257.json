The user's ticket is a bit confusing, mentioning \"mini required for project Friday\" and \"tower floor allocation.\" It seems \"mini\" might refer to a mini PC or perhaps a person. The request mentions a tentative period for a resolution about this allocation, but it's not entirely clear what they're asking for. Parsing through this will be a bit complex.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket using the provided categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. The content of the ticket mentions \"mini required,\" which likely refers to a mini PC or compute resource for a project on Friday. \"Tower floor allocation\" suggests it's about assigning a desktop tower to a specific floor. Since there's no explicit request for access rights or storage, I\u2019ll categorize this as Hardware. Now, I need to create a JSON object for the response.**Outputting category format**\n\nThe required format for the response is clear: I need to output a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. The instruction specifies that the category field should be a string from enumerated values including Hardware, HR Support, and others. It seems best not to add extra explanations and just provide the object as requested. So, I'll respond exclusively with {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to ensure there\u2019s no extraneous text\u2014just the JSON format as specified."
