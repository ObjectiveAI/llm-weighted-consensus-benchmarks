The ticket is about removing a report link related to feedbacks and access to a dashboard. It could fit into categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Access.\" I\u2019ll need to assess which category best aligns with the main focus of the request. It's a bit tricky, but I think I can determine the best fit with a careful look.**Assessing ticket content**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a piece of content about removing a report link related to kudos and feedback. It seems like it involves issues with accessing links and managing reports. Specific phrases about not finding a report link suggest a permissions issue. There's also mention of adding an owner and requiring guidance, which hints at needing administrative rights. Given these points, I think the ticket fits best under the \"Access\" category. It's a bit nuanced, but I\u2019m considering that the access aspect is central here.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI notice there are mentions of adding an owner, managing reports, and granting reviews, which could indicate a focus on \"Administrative rights.\" However, since the ticket primarily asks to remove a report link and discuss dashboard access, I think it fits better under \"Access.\" It\u2019s specifically about accessing a report link and granting permissions. The user expects a JSON output with the category, so I\u2019ll structure it like this: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. I\u2019ll keep it brief for clarity.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
