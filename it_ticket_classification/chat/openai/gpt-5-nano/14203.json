I wonder if we should group them by urgency, type of issue, or the affected system. Maybe I\u2019ll look into existing categorization frameworks to ensure we\u2019re aligning with best practices. Keeping everything clear and accessible will help the team respond quicker. It\u2019s all about streamlining the process for better workflow!**Deciding on category for tickets**\n\nI'm trying to categorize something that seems related to ServiceNow. The terms \"pm,\" \"related list section,\" and \"admired by\" are making it a bit unclear. I wonder if \"Internal Project\" would fit since it's about the ServiceNow configuration, but there\u2019s no explicit mention of that phrase. \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or even \"Miscellaneous\" could be options too, especially if it's more general. I really want to pick the best category that reflects the content!**Parsing IT ticket information**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a request that includes phrases like \"add related list section\" and \"satisfaction survey,\" hinting it could be related to tickets. It reads almost like a customer service chat but could also involve \"administrative rights\" since it's about adding sections in ServiceNow. \"Internal Project\" feels like a fitting category because it suggests a change request in this ITSM tool. The user wants to categorize this IT ticket, and these options all seem relevant!**Choosing the right category**\n\nI think the best category for this request is \"Internal Project\" since it relates to our internal IT system, ServiceNow. I\u2019ll format my response to fit the required JSON structure, which specifies a category object. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. The instructions are clear about needing a JSON object with the \"category\" field, so I want to make sure I\u2019m following that. I\u2019ll just go ahead and categorize this ticket accurately!**Delivering the category response**\n\nI\u2019m preparing to output the category as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} since that aligns with the request. I want to make sure I\u2019m clear, though; the schema is just a format guide, not part of the answer itself. So, I\u2019ll keep it concise and focused. I could add a brief note if needed, but my main goal is just to deliver this straightforward response. Let\u2019s go with that and finalize the output!"
