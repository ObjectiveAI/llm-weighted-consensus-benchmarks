I'm noticing references to things like auditing usage, employees, dates, and unpaid leaves. This seems to fit best into the \"Access\" category since it primarily deals with card usage and related access issues. I'll make sure to assign it correctly to streamline the processing. Let\u2019s go ahead and label it appropriately!**Analyzing access card usage**\n\nIt looks like this ticket involves detailed tracking of access card usage in an internal audit context. The text mentions different employees, their usage days, and various statuses like \"active\" or \"unpaid leave.\" There are also references to key holders and assignments tied to specific dates. I think this is primarily about auditing access card usage, so I want to categorize it correctly and ensure all pertinent details are accounted for in the processing. Let\u2019s clarify and organize the information!**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket clearly fits into the \"Access\" category. While it could potentially overlap with \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" or \"HR Support,\" the focus is on access control, particularly with phrases like \"card disabled until she returns\" and \"key holder removed.\" I\u2019ll make sure to respond with the necessary JSON category object: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. Keeping it straightforward means I\u2019ll provide no extra text, just the category as instructed. Let\u2019s get that done!"
