The words \"access,\" \"lead ext,\" and a mention of scheduling on Thursday afternoon lead me to think this might involve \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll need to figure out which of the predefined categories fits best.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nOkay, the phrase \"please owner snow commercial\" is tricky to understand, but it seems the most plausible category is \"Access.\" The mention of \"support team access\" makes me think it's about granting access to something, possibly related to Snowflake. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" \n\nI need to format the output as valid JSON, which requires a top-level object with the \"category\" field. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That's my final answer!"
