It sounds like it could relate to hardware issues given the mention of memory (RAM). However, it might also tie to \"Storage\" if it's about opening files. Ultimately, since memory usually refers to hardware in an IT context, I think it fits best under the Hardware category.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI want to emphasize that the main focus in the ticket is on \"memory,\" suggesting it should be categorized as Hardware. The mention of \"planning officer\" might imply some relevance to Access, but the core issue is about having enough memory. The phrase \"open planning officer\" could imply they need to access a specific file. Since memory clearly falls under hardware resources, I'll categorize it as Hardware and prepare a response structured as a JSON-like object accordingly.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI\u2019m aiming to ensure I format the output correctly for the IT ticket categorization. I think the best response is simply {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} since we want to stick to just providing the category value they asked for. The ticket implies issues with memory, so Hardware seems fitting. Yes, \"Access\" could be relevant due to the mention of \"open\" and \"planning officer,\" but the primary concern is still memory. So, I'll deliver the hardware category as the final response.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
