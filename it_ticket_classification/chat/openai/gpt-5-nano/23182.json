It seems more connected to ticket routing and assignment automation, leading me to think \"Internal Project\" might fit best. \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t quite match the content, so let\u2019s go with \"Internal Project.\"**Parsing ticket content**\n\nI\u2019m parsing a ticket that\u2019s a bit messy. The main point seems to be about \"automatically assigning tickets,\" which is mentioned multiple times. There are references to process changes, a review that can\u2019t be processed right now, and a request to wait until the review finishes before making changes. The ticket also mentions an annual survey and trying to get attention for the assigned queue. Overall, it sounds like there's a lot of confusion around the ticket assignment process.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the ticket as either \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" While \"Administrative rights\" is on the list, it doesn\u2019t fit directly since it's about process changes rather than permissions. \"Access,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Storage,\" \"Hardware,\" and \"HR Support\" categories are clearly not relevant. Ultimately, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best choice related to process automation. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with just the JSON:  \n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
