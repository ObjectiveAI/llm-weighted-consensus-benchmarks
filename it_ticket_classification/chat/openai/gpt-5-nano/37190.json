It seems to describe poor network conditions, problems with wireless and wired connections, and difficulty joining meetings.\n\nUnfortunately, there isn't a specific \"Network\" category. The closest options are \"Hardware\" (which might refer to network devices) or \"Access\" if it's more about login issues. \"Miscellaneous\" could also work, but I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" for this one.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"poor network\" and \"unable to join meetings,\" indicating possible network connectivity issues. I\u2019m considering \"Hardware\" as a category since that relates to networking equipment. \"Access\" could be another choice if it were about permissions, but there's no mention of login issues.\n\nI need to categorize this as requested and output it as a JSON object. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" since it aligns best with the context. The final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether \"Network\" might be the issue, but since \"Network\" isn\u2019t an option, I think \"Hardware\" fits because it includes networking hardware like wireless and wired devices. I also pondered \"Access,\" which could apply if the user can't join meetings due to permissions. Overall, I feel \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate category for this ticket. I\u2019ll go ahead and respond with that in the required JSON format."
