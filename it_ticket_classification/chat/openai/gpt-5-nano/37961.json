It seems like the request is related to missing time entries, weekly submissions for approval, and not following the proper process, which also involves notifying a manager. This could fit into categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" Since it's about timesheets and approvals, it likely aligns best with \"HR Support.\"**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nThe IT ticket appears to be about missing time submissions and timesheets. It could involve logging entries, which makes me consider \"Administrative rights,\" but that's not quite right. The mention of training materials suggests it's about logging time, which aligns with \"HR Support\" due to timesheet approvals. Given the details, I should categorize this ticket as \"HR Support.\" I also need to format the output in JSON, ensuring it matches the required schema.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
