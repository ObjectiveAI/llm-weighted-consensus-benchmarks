Since it seems to be related to hardware, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" To keep it minimal, I\u2019ll output the required JSON object: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. No extra commentary, just the straightforward output!**Delivering categorized output**\n\nI need to make sure not to use any code formatting. The instructions suggest avoiding heavy formatting, but bullet lists are okay. However, for this case, using JSON is acceptable since it\u2019s a simple object that can be parsed easily. I\u2019ll output exactly what\u2019s needed: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Keeping it straightforward is important, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ll deliver!
