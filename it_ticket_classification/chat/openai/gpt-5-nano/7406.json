The output should be a JSON object focused on the category. The prompt gives a long text that needs classification. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON format that aligns with the specified properties, setting the category to one of the provided enum strings based on the content of the ticket. It's all about choosing the best-fitting category!**Identifying IT Ticket Content**\n\nThe ticket content seems to involve the IT leaver process, mentioning various aspects related to an employee leaving, such as the leaver form, leave date, location, roaming profile, and access rights like AD rights and mailboxes. There's a focus on access revocation and inventory storage too. I\u2019ll categorize this ticket appropriately based on the specifics mentioned, as it touches on several processes associated with an employee's departure. It really highlights the need for proper documentation and access management!**Categorizing IT Ticket Access**\n\nI need to categorize the ticket, and it looks like \"Access\" is the most fitting category for the user access provisioning and deprovisioning aspects mentioned, such as AD rights and mailbox management. While I considered other categories like Administrative rights or HR Support, they don't quite fit this IT ticket. The focus on access removal during the leaver process makes \"Access\" the clear choice. So, I\u2019ll output the JSON snippet as {\"category\":\"Access\"} in the required format.**Delivering Category JSON**\n\nThe schema specifies a JSON object that includes a \"category\" property with allowed values. Since the user asked me to categorize the ticket, I\u2019ll avoid extra commentary and focus on providing the simple response. Based on my earlier assessment, I'll present the output as {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any additional details. This directly follows the schema while delivering the necessary information concisely. Let\u2019s go ahead and deliver that!"
