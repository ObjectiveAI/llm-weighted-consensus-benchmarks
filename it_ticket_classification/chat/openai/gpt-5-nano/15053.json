The ticket mentions assignments of complex tickets, which suggests it's about IT requests. I need to determine the right category, and it sounds like \"Internal Project\" might fit best.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this ticket that seems to discuss assigning complex tickets to someone. The categories available include \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" and others. \"Access\" usually involves permissions, while \"Administrative rights\" is specific to privileges. It sounds more like they are talking about structuring ServiceNow (SN) tickets, which suggests it could fall under \"Internal Project.\" I need to decide which category fits best based on these clues.**Deciding on category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out the best category for this ticket that talks about forming SN and assigning complex tickets. \"Administrative rights\" could fit if it's about permissions. \"Internal Project\" seems likely, especially if it relates to setting up the process for ticket assignments. \"Miscellaneous\" is always an option if I'm unsure, but based on the details, it looks more like a request to manage ServiceNow (SN) ticket assignments. I think \"Internal Project\" matches best for these process changes.**Analyzing responsibilities in ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"assign complex tickets him moving forward\" suggests that he will be responsible for assigning these tickets. This indicates a possible need for access or permissions in ServiceNow, which points to \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" However, it seems they're requesting to \"form SN,\" possibly meaning to create a ServiceNow form. The grammar is a bit unclear, but it looks like they're trying to set up a process to assign complex tickets, which might fit best under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Determining the category**\n\nThe phrase \"assign complex tickets him\" indicates they want to assign complex tickets to him, which might suggest \"Access.\" However, I think the best fit is \"Internal Project\" since it relates to process changes in ServiceNow about how assignments will work. It\u2019s not about hardware, HR support, storage, or purchase. So, I'll follow the required format and craft the final response as a JSON object with the category \"Internal Project.\" Here\u2019s what it will look like: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
