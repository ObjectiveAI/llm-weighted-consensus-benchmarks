However, \"Access\" might also work if the error is about submitting something that requires special permissions. I\u2019ll lean towards \"Miscellaneous\" for a broader classification.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s text mentions an \"oracle error\" related to trying to submit something possibly for timesheets. Since there\u2019s no specific \"Software\" category available, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous,\" which serves as a catch-all. I need to respond with a JSON object containing the selected category. Following the required format, I\u2019ll return:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}\n\nThis meets the schema requirements without including any extra content."
