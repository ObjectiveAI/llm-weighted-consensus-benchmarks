The user is mentioning access card issues tied to maternity leave and laptops being returned, so it's a bit tricky. There are elements that could relate to both HR concerns and access permissions. I\u2019m inclined to lean towards the \"HR Support\" category due to the mention of maternity leave, but there's definitely an access component to consider. It seems reasonable to categorize the ticket under \"Access\" since they want to disable the card during maternity leave.**Categorizing maternity leave ticket**\n\nThe user's ticket mentions \"maternity leaver access card,\" indicating a request about access related to someone on maternity leave. They want help completing a form and updating annual leave while also noting the return of a laptop and handing over a card. This ticket clearly involves HR processes but also requires IT actions, like disabling access temporarily. I think it would best fit under \"Access,\" but \"HR Support\" is also relevant due to the maternity leave aspect.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nThe user's message includes terms like \"active starting\" and \"laptop card handed over,\" suggesting it involves an asset transfer. While \"Access\" seems appropriate since the ticket primarily concerns disabling access cards, there's also mention of hardware with the laptop. It could fit under \"Hardware,\" but considering the focus on updating access status and leave forms, it leans more towards IT support tasks. The \"HR Support\" category could be a good fit because it involves maternity leave forms, but ultimately, \"Access\" feels like the best choice for this IT ticket.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
