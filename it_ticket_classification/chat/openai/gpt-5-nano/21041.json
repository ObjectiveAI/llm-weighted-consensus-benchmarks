It sounds like they\u2019re talking about a computer cooling product from Deepcool, which fits into the hardware category. The presence of terms like \"log installation\" and \"mandatory receipts\" suggests this is indeed related to a purchase. So, I\u2019ll categorize the ticket as \u201cPurchase\u201d accordingly, making sure to follow the provided category options.**Categorizing IT purchase request**\n\nThe user\u2019s request is about a hardware purchase and installation, mentioning \"new purchase,\" \"log installation,\" and \"receipts section order.\" The most fitting category seems to be \"Purchase,\" as it relates directly to a new order. I need to respond with a JSON object that contains \"category\": \"Purchase.\" The format requires me to provide only this JSON without any extra explanations. I\u2019ll also note that it could relate to \"Hardware\" due to the mention of DeepCool products.**Finalizing purchase category**\n\nI see that there's a specific \"Purchase\" category for requests related to buying items. The ticket mentions \"log installation,\" \"receipts section order,\" and references an item ordered, suggesting it's linked to logging the installation of new hardware. Categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Miscellaneous\" are not relevant here. So, I\u2019ll confirm that \"Purchase\" is the best fit. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Now, I just need to double-check if a newline is needed before delivering it."
