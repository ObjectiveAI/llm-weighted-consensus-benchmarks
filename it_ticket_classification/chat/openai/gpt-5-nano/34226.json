I'm debating whether to classify it as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since the user doesn't seem to be asking for admin rights specifically, \"Access\" feels like the most suitable choice here. So I'll go with \"Access\" for this ticket.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object categorizing the ticket as \"Access\" based on the required format. The system prompt indicates I should output a category object with \"category\" as a string. So, I\u2019ll prepare it like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nI\u2019m considering whether I should ask any clarifying questions, but since the user just asked for categorization, I think I can keep it concise. Alright, I\u2019ll just provide that JSON object without any extra commentary."
