The user provided a string that includes requests about \"confluence access\" and \"permissions.\" It seems clear that the main focus is on access to Confluence, which suggests the \"Access\" category. However, there's also mention of \"Administrative rights\" related to permissions. Since both categories are relevant, I think I'll go with \"Access\" as it captures the core concern of this ticket.**Finalizing category for IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket clearly mentions \"confluence access,\" \"permission,\" and \"view planning epics visible,\" making \"Access\" the most fitting category. While \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, based on their focus on permissions, I'll stick with \"Access\" as the primary choice. I need to format the response in JSON, ensuring it's clean and straightforward. Since the user specifically asked to categorize, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's keep it neat and to the point!**Determining appropriate category**\n\nI see this is related to access and permissions. While \"Administrative rights\" suggests admin-level permissions, the wording in the ticket seems to focus more on general access. The key phrases are \"permissions\" and \"view planning epics visible,\" which make \"Access\" a safer choice for categorization. So, I'll go ahead and respond with the JSON output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That keeps things clear and precise!"
