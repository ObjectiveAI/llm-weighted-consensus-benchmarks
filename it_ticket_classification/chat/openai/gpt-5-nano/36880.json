I should consider categories like \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Internal Project.\" It clearly doesn't relate to hardware, storage, purchases, administrative rights, or HR support. \"Access\" might be the best choice since it seems connected to accessing the Oracle feature or search functionality.**Determining ticket category**\n\nBased on the user's message, it seems like they can\u2019t enter searches, which suggests there might be an access or application issue. I need to consider the available categories like \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and a few others. The mention of \"oracle problems\" really points to it being an access issue related to the Oracle database. So, categorizing this as \"Access\" feels appropriate since it's about system access problems and the user wants an urgent fix.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
