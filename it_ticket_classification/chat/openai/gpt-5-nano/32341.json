There\u2019s a mention of access rights, but no specifics about logging in. It discusses administrative rights, but those aren't explicitly mentioned. It references HR support with a \"new starter,\" indicating onboarding, yet the ticket's content pertains to IT tasks. Onboarding might belong under administrative rights or hardware tasks, but it doesn\u2019t fit neatly into categories like internal projects or storage. The purchase request is unclear due to the \"disable\" mention.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"order\" might imply a request to acquire hardware, but it feels inconsistent with the rest of the ticket. The content indicates a strong focus on \"disable hardware allocation,\" suggesting this is about asset management related to a new starter. As it concerns disabling hardware, it aligns more closely with the \"Hardware\" category rather than \"Access.\" I'll categorize it as \"Hardware\" and create a final response in JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
