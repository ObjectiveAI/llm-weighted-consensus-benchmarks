The content mentions \"leaver forms not being forwarded\" and seems related to HR processes or access rights. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"HR Support.\" Since the ticket discusses the internal process of handling forms for employees leaving, the most fitting category appears to be \"HR Support.\" This will help ensure the ticket is routed appropriately.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the content provided. The options are \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" The user requires a JSON object to output the category. The text indicates that leaver forms should be forwarded to an approver, which makes me think it could relate to access removal or administrative rights. However, since it primarily revolves around forwarding leaver forms, I believe \"HR Support\" might be the most appropriate category to select for this ticket.**Categorizing Access Control**\n\nI\u2019m considering the category for the IT ticket, which likely revolves around access control and permissions. The categories include \"Access\" for general issues like permissions and \"HR Support\" for HR system matters. Since the ticket mentions forwarding forms to an approver, it seems to focus on access related to offboarding. I think \"Access\" is the best category here. So, I\u2019ll output the JSON object as: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text.**Ensuring Valid JSON Output**\n\nI need to make sure the output is a valid JSON object. The top-level should have the key \"category,\" and the format I've been given indicates the key details for the schema. So, I'll provide it as: {\"category\":\"Access.\"} This is straightforward. I want to keep the answer concise and clear, so that\u2019s my plan! I'll deliver it without any extra commentary."
