The issue seems to revolve around the feedback review database not responding, which suggests it could relate to Storage or possibly an Internal Project based on database-related problems.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI'm categorizing an IT ticket based on the user's description. Given the options, \"Storage\" seems the most fitting since the issue involves a database not responding. It's possible \"Internal Project\" could work too if it's project-specific, but the focus on database connectivity suggests that \"Storage\" is best. While \"Access\" could also apply, the phrasing points more towards a storage issue. I\u2019ll go with \"Storage\" and format the output as a JSON object, ensuring it's clear and follows guidelines.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to respond to the user's request for categorizing an IT ticket in the correct JSON format. The category I will choose is \"Storage.\" So, the correct JSON response should look like this: `{\"category\":\"Storage\"}`. I also need to keep in mind the specified schema, indicating that the category type is a string from an allowed enumeration. It's essential to follow these guidelines, ensuring everything aligns with the expected formatting to provide a clear and accurate response.**Responding with the correct JSON**\n\nI see that the user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket, and the proper response format should be a JSON object. The correct output for the category is `{\"category\":\"Storage\"}`. I want to make sure I spell \"Storage\" with a capital \"S\" to match the allowed categories exactly. While I could provide a brief explanation, it\u2019s best to keep the answer succinct since the user just wants a categorization. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and deliver the JSON response without extra details."
