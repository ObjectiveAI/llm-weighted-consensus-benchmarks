The user provided some incoherent text, but I see that it centers around an Outlook pop-up asking for a password due to notification issues. Since this involves a password prompt, it seems to fit best under the \"Access\" category, though \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could also be options.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI think \"Access\" is the best category for this ticket since it's about login and password issues. The other categories don't quite fit; \"Internal Project\" and \"Hardware\" feel off because it\u2019s more about software. \"Administrative rights\" isn't relevant here since it\u2019s not about permissions. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" \n\nI'll respond with a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. While the instructions just say to categorize, I wonder if adding a brief justification might help clarify my choice, but the format specifies only the JSON output.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
