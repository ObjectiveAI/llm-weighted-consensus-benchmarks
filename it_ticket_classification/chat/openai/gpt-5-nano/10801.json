However, I also see terms like \"investigate issue\" and \"application level flow,\" which complicate things a bit. I think I'll choose the HR Support category based on the primary focus of the text. Then, I\u2019ll output a JSON-like object with that category.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering if the ticket should be categorized as \"Administrative rights\" since it involves changing a job title in the system. However, it seems more relevant to HR Support because it includes contract-related matters and holiday notices. The categories do list \"HR Support,\" so that feels fitting. Even though \"Administrative rights\" crosses my mind, the focus is clearly on job titles. Since it relates to HR, I'll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and format it into a valid JSON object for output."
