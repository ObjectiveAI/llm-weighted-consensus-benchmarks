It seems like they're reporting an issue with a deployment queue that's stuck and causing problems. They mention a potential shutdown and specific dates. I think this ticket likely relates to deployment problems, so I'll map it to either \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It's definitely aligned with IT operations. I want to make sure I assign it correctly to address their concerns efficiently!**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit for this ticket since it relates to a software deployment issue. \"Miscellaneous\" could work too, but I feel it's not quite right given the specifics about \"deploys\" and \"queue pending status.\" \n\nNow, I need to format my response as a JSON snippet based on the required schema. I'll structure it properly to include the category field, making sure it's complete and compliant with the format! So, I\u2019ll output:  \n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
