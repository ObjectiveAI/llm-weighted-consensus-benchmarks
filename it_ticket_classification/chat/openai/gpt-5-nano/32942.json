Nonetheless, \"access point\" is technically hardware. Ultimately, I think classifying it as \"Access\" aligns best.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nWhen categorizing the IT ticket, I see options like \"Hardware\" for physical devices and \"Access\" for user login issues. Since the ticket specifically requests help with a wireless access point, it\u2019s mainly about network connectivity. Although \u201cSenior developer\u201d suggests the user's role, the content primarily indicates a need for assistance with a physical device. I lean towards categorizing it as \"Hardware\" rather than \"Miscellaneous\" for precision. I'll use the JSON format with the category clearly defined as \"Hardware.\"{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
