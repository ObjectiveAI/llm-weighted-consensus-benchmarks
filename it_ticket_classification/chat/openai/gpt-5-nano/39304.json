The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" After reading through the ticket content, it clearly pertains to insecure passwords, changing them, and restricting access. So, I should likely assign this ticket to the \"Access\" category, as it involves security concerns related to access control.**Deciding Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to determine the best category for an IT ticket. It could fit into either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" especially since it mentions restricting access and changing default passwords, which relates to security. Given that the content focuses on access management, it seems that \"Access\" is the more suitable category. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object with the selected category, ensuring it aligns with the requirements provided.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
