The user mentioned missing time leavers, deadlines, and submissions for approvals, indicating an HR or administrative process related to timesheet submissions and direct reports. Given that it directly relates to HR matters, I believe \u201cHR Support\u201d is the right category to choose here, rather than \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d**Creating JSON response**\n\nThe ticket is focused on HR processes and approvals for timesheets, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \u201cHR Support.\u201d I need to format my response as a structured JSON object. The required output has to match the schema outlined, with just the category field present. So, the final response should look like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI should make sure the case is exact, and I have to avoid any extra text. Just delivering that JSON format is essential!"
