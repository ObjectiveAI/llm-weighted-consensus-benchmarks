The user mentioned various things like forbidden software and file sharing. This seems to touch on policy violations, which leads me to think it could be \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or maybe even \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll output a JSON object with one of those categories. Let's determine which fits best!**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket involves \"internal audit forbidden software\" and asks for a report about colleagues using games and file sharing. This hints at issues related to accessing forbidden software, which could be categorized under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" focusing on permissions. It may also touch on a compliance issue. If none fit perfectly, maybe \"Miscellaneous\" would work. Overall, my goal is to figure out the most appropriate category for this ticket.**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nThe ticket mentions an \"internal audit\" related to forbidden software and suggests colleagues are using games and file sharing. It seems they want a reminder to enforce policies against this behavior. This points towards a need for monitoring or taking action regarding forbidden software. Choosing the right category is important; \"Access\" could fit since it's about auditing access to software, while \"Administrative rights\" focuses on permissions related to that software usage.**Determining Category for Ticket**\n\nLooking at the category options, \"Access\" seems to fit well for compliance and security issues related to software installation. While \"Storage\" pertains more to file storage, it doesn\u2019t address the policy aspect. I think \"Access\" accurately reflects the findings of the audit regarding restricted software. The output needs to be a JSON object, so I'll format it correctly with just the category included: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll keep it straightforward without any extra commentary."
