The options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I think this request might fit under \"Administrative rights,\" since it's about permissions, or perhaps \"Internal Project\" as it\u2019s related to a new project. If it doesn\u2019t neatly fit into those, \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback. It's important to choose the best category for this ticket.**Analyzing Confluence request**\n\nI\u2019m working on categorizing a request related to Confluence, which is a collaboration tool. This doesn't fall under hardware, storage, or purchase. It might fit \"Administrative rights\" since it involves permissions to create a space. However, the user specifically mentions \"create space on Confluence for project,\" suggesting it's more about \"Internal Project.\" This category often includes requests for new project spaces. If it doesn't fit anywhere neatly, \"Miscellaneous\" could be a last resort.**Categorizing the request**\n\nThe user's request to \"create space on Confluence for project\" is primarily about creating a space rather than asking for user access. It could fall under \"Administrative rights\" since admin privileges might be necessary for that action. However, they\u2019re asking IT to handle the task, not requesting access for themselves. \"Internal Project\" seems like the best match since it's about setting up a workspace. If that doesn't align, \"Miscellaneous\" is a potential fallback. I'll format the response as a JSON object for clarity.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
