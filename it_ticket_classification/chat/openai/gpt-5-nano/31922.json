Based on the user message about new starter access, it seems focused on onboarding processes, access cards, and related rights. This makes \"Access\" the most fitting choice. However, it could also fall under \"Administrative rights\" if it's about granting superuser privileges. Ultimately, I think \"Access\" is the best categorization for this ticket!**Determining Category for Ticket**\n\nI see the ticket mentions things like \"new starter access card,\" requests for starter forms, and urgency around onboarding. This suggests it's focused on enabling access and allocating seats. So, \"Access\" seems to be the most appropriate category. It doesn't fit \"HR Support\" because it's not HR-related, and while \"Administrative rights\" could be a possibility, this is more about provisioning access. I'll respond with a JSON representation for the category as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
