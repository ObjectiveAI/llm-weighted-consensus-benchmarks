Let's finalize that.**Clarifying IT ticket categories**\n\nI'm considering categorizing an IT ticket and thinking it could go under \"Miscellaneous,\" especially if I'm uncertain. Alternatively, \"Internal Project\" could fit if the ticket relates to internal polling apps. Given the user's request to categorize the ticket, I think I should suggest a category and provide a brief justification for my choice while asking for more details. The best fits seem to be \"Hardware\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" as outages across devices might indicate hardware failure. Let's clarify that!**Deciding on category for IT ticket**\n\nI'm interpreting \"polls\" as potentially referring to a \"polling\" service issue, which could fall under \"Miscellaneous\" since it covers generic IT issues. Given the ambiguity, \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the safer choice. The user asked for a categorization, so I should select one while mentioning any alternatives. The platform requires a JSON object format, so I'll respond with something like {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}. However, if \"polls down\" suggests hardware issues, \"Hardware\" could fit as well. Let's clarify this!**Classifying IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding to classify this ticket as \"Hardware\" since it mentions issues affecting multiple assets, which suggests device failures. If it were a software polling service issue instead, then \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" could apply, but \"Hardware\" feels more appropriate here. \n\nI'll respond with a JSON object formatted as {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. It\u2019s important to maintain the correct structure. A brief note could clarify, saying, \"Category: Hardware (outages affecting multiple assets).\" This keeps it compliant and informative.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
