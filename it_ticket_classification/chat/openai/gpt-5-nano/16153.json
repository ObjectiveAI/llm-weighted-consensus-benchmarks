The user\u2019s message appears to request access to folders and write permissions for a shared mailbox in Macedonia, specifically related to human resources and maternity leave, mentioning a mobility officer and colleagues. Based on the provided categories, this ticket is clearly about access to shared resources. I'll categorize it under **Access** since that aligns with the request to grant permissions for folders and shared mailboxes.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nIt seems the IT ticket falls into the \"Access\" category, but \"Administrative rights\" is another possibility because it mentions granting write permissions. I need to output a JSON-like object for the category. The text indicates the user is asking for \"write\" access to a shared mailbox, which leans more toward \"Access.\" However, since elevated privileges often get categorized as \"Administrative rights,\" I'm inclined to stick with \"Access\" as it fits the nature of the request best.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
