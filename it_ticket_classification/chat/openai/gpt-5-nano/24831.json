I need to structure a JSON object for the response with just the category included. The valid category here is \"HR Support.\" So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Finalizing IT Ticket Response**\n\nI\u2019m preparing to respond to the user's request to categorize an IT ticket. I\u2019ve determined that the proper category is \"HR Support.\" Since the user has asked for a specific format, I\u2019ll ensure to respond accurately with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It\u2019s crucial to double-check that I\u2019m providing just the category as requested, so I\u2019ll finalize with that proper structure."
