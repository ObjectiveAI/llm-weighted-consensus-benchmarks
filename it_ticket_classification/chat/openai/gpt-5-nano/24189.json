The ticket seems related to adding a link to a document but highlights issues such as not being able to add links anymore. So, I\u2019ll parse the information I have. \n\nThe categories to choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It looks like this ticket best fits the \"Access\" category since it's about link accessibility.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis IT ticket deals with a document/link feature in a document management system. I\u2019m wondering if it falls under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" The user wants to add links, suggesting it could be about permission issues. They also mention that an old option is no longer available, indicating a potential software problem. \n\nGiven the context, I think \"Access\" might be appropriate since it relates to permissions for adding links, but \"Administrative rights\" could work if it\u2019s about restrictions on link addition.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe user mentions that the option to add links is no longer available, which hints at a potential software change. I\u2019m considering categorizing this ticket as \"Internal Project\" if it involves a specific project, but it could also fall under \"Miscellaneous\" if it\u2019s a general IT issue that doesn\u2019t really fit elsewhere.\n\n\"Access\" might work if it pertains to permissions for adding links, and \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it\u2019s about feature toggles. Given the wording, I think \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" would be the best choices.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIn a typical helpdesk taxonomy, \"Access\" usually pertains to logging in and permissions, while \"Administrative rights\" involves admin controls for user accounts. Given that the user is unable to add links, it seems to be a product issue with the document feature. \n\nThey are asking for a specific category, and while \"Miscellaneous\" could work as a catch-all for unclear issues, I think \"Access\" is more fitting since it involves permissions to modify documents. \"Administrative rights\" might also be relevant, but I lean towards \"Access\" for this case.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
