The options I have are: \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since this seems related to internal maps, I lean toward categorizing it as \"Internal Project.\" It feels like the best fit!**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing this IT ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it deals with populating maps and floors for a tower \u2014 a project-specific request, for sure. The ticket is a bit ambiguous, but \"Internal Project\" fits best from the categories provided. I need to respond with a JSON object that includes this category. So, I'll format it correctly as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, making sure to keep the casing accurate. That should do the trick!**Confirming Response Instructions**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to include a brief note with my response, but the instruction is clear: I should just respond with the category. So, I think it's best to stick to that guidance and keep it simple. This means I\u2019ll move forward with only the category information and not add anything extra. Let\u2019s proceed with that approach!"
