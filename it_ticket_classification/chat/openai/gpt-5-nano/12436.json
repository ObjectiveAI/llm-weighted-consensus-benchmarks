However, it could also touch on \"Administrative rights\" if it's about access. But since there\u2019s no mention of passwords, I think \"Internal Project\" seems the most fitting category.**Determining ticket categorization**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"pm,\" which could mean \"project manager\" or \"private message.\" Within IT categorization, \"Internal Project\" works for project-related tasks, while \"Administrative rights\" pertains to permissions. The word \"lead\" could imply a person or leadership. Since it references \"change July PM,\" which aligns with project management, \"Internal Project\" seems like a safe choice. I'll output this as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Following instructions, I\u2019ll focus on just providing the category object without extra text."
