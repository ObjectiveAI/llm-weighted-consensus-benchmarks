The user mentions a problem with an app that failed to launch, and it seems related to connectivity or an issue with the software.

It seems to point to a development or testing issue, which leads me to think it fits in either \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it relates specifically to app development, \"Internal Project\" feels like the most appropriate category. \n\nI\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project,\" as it clearly pertains to development work.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
