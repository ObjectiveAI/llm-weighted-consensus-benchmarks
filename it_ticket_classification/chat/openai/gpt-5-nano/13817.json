There's no specific \"Onboarding\" category, but HR Support could cover tasks related to new employees, like creating accounts and setting start dates.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nThe phrase \"new starter bucharest pm\" clearly suggests a new employee in Bucharest for project management. It seems like \"hello please fill date\" is likely instructing someone to enter the start date. The most fitting category should be \"HR Support,\" since it involves onboarding tasks related to the new employee. While \"Access\" could apply if they're requesting access rights, the ticket content feels too short for clarity. I think \"HR Support\" is the best option, though \"Internal Project\" could work if it's more about a project context.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe phrase \"new starter bucharest pm\" likely refers to onboarding a new employee for a Project Manager role in Bucharest. The statement \"hello please fill date\" feels quite generic, leading me to categorize it as \"HR Support.\" \n\nI need to respond with a JSON-like object. Following the provided category schema, the final response should be:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to use the exact formatting with the correct string, including the space, before sending my answer."
