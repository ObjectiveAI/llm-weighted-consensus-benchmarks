The system has specific categories for this. It seems like it could fit under \"Access\" since an ID card is related to access control, or \"Administrative rights\" if it's about altering rights. Though I\u2019m considering \"Hardware\" since an ID card is a physical item, it's not strictly about hardware. I'll categorize accordingly!**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve got a user message about an ID card displaying personal data that\u2019s different from theirs. This suggests a data privacy concern. \"Access\" seems like the most fitting category since it relates to access control tied to the ID card, though \"HR Support\" could be relevant too. The required format is JSON, so I need to respond with a category field set to \"Access.\" Let\u2019s make sure to follow the instructions properly!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
