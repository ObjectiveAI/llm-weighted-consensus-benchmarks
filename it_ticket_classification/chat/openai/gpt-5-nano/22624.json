It\u2019s linked to a leaver, possibly an employee named Milos. The context suggests it\u2019s related to deactivating or managing his mobile phone and mailbox. Given these details, I\u2019m considering categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it primarily involves a leaver's situation with mobile and email, I might lean towards \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\"**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nThe ticket mentions \u201cnote mailbox receive messages,\u201d which confuses me a bit. It seems related to a leaver's mobile phone and mailbox. I\u2019m leaning towards \u201cAccess,\u201d as it pertains to email mailbox rights, but \u201cHR Support\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d also seem fitting. The term \u201cleaver\u201d implies it\u2019s about the offboarding process, possibly ensuring the mailbox can receive or forward messages. I really need to choose the best category to categorize this IT ticket correctly.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nIt might seem that \"Purchase\" could fit because of the subscription plan, but since the ticket revolves around a leaver's mobile plan, I wonder if it's about reassigning or canceling a mobile number. \"Access\" seems appropriate for email accounts, especially since \"mailbox receive messages\" suggests an email reference. The request could also lead to \"Administrative rights\" if it\u2019s about accessing resources, though there's no mention of privilege levels. \"HR Support\" is plausible for offboarding, but ultimately, I need to pick the best single category for the ticket and provide a short justification.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
