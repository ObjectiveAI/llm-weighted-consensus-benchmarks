However, \"Internal Project\" might work too if it involves internal builds. But \"Administrative rights\" and \"Hardware\" don\u2019t fit at all. I think \"Access\" is the best choice!**Categorizing the Nexus artifact issue**\n\nThe user is asking for help with using Nexus to get an artifact but is encountering an error related to SSL certificate validation. This seems to be about accessing the Nexus repository, so I could categorize it as \"Access.\" They mention issues like \"unable to find a valid certification path,\" which indicates connectivity problems. \n\nWhile \"Internal Project\" could also fit if it's related to an internal build, I'll stick with \"Access\" as it primarily involves retrieving artifacts from Nexus.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
