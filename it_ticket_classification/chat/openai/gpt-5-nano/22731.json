The user asks me to categorize it, guiding me to output a JSON-like structure. From the schema I've got, it seems the best fit for the content is \u201cPurchase,\u201d since there are multiple references to purchase orders and installations. It feels like a clear choice considering the context provided. I'll format the output correctly!**Deciding on Category**\n\nI'm considering that this IT ticket should go under the \"Purchase\" category since it talks about purchase orders, requisitions, pricing, and approvals. Even though there's mention of installation, the main focus seems to be on procurement and order status. Picking \"Administrative rights\" feels irrelevant here, and while \"Miscellaneous\" is an option, it\u2019s more accurate to categorize it as \"Purchase,\" given the numerous references to POs and suppliers. So, my output will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
