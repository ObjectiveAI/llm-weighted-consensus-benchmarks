The message is a bit jumbled but seems to focus on backups, virtual machines, and decommissioning something. Since \"backup\" is mentioned multiple times, \"Storage\" seems like a likely fit, as it relates to data management. However, there's also a chance it could fall under \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Overall, \"Storage\" feels most appropriate given the emphasis on backups.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"decommission\" and \"required delete polls,\" which doesn\u2019t seem to relate to access. This makes \"Storage\" a fitting category. Now, I need to structure the final answer as a JSON object with the category field. The requirement specifies a format that includes the property \"category\" as a string. So, I\u2019ll respond with simply: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. Since the user didn\u2019t ask for extra justification, I\u2019ll keep it minimal and straightforward. Let's deliver that!"
