It seems more focused on improving the audio/video experience, so it likely fits into \"Hardware\" due to the mention of AV equipment and cables. However, it could also be seen as \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"network audio video,\" which suggests it relates to hardware, even though there's no separate \"Networking\" category. Also, it seems to be more of a support request because of the poor AV quality. I think categorizing it as \"Hardware\" is the best option. We need to respond with a structured JSON format, specifically: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I should keep it straightforward and only provide this JSON snippet for clarity."
