The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. It seems like the user is referencing issues related to approval flows and access rights. Given the focus on approvals, rights reassignment, and potential cancellations, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this ticket under Access or Administrative Rights. It definitely needs attention!**Refining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m examining keywords from the user's request, like \"pm rights approve amounts,\" \"approver,\" and \"please reject.\" These terms suggest the ticket deals with access rights and approvals, pointing towards the category of Access. However, since \"Administrative rights\" is a distinct category, it might fit better because it refers to user privilege elevation. The focus seems to be on approval workflows rather than hardware or storage issues. I\u2019ll lean towards categorizing it as \"Administrative rights\" but will consider \"Access\" as well!{\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}"
