While \u201cinfrastructure\u201d itself isn't a category, it could relate to \u201cInternal Project,\u201d \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d or \u201cAccess.\u201d The ticket seems a bit ambiguous, with repeated mentions of \"ad export\" and details about \"users\" and \"friday march.\" So, I need to pick carefully!**Categorizing IT ticket request**\n\nThe user's request seems focused on exporting an Active Directory (AD) user list, particularly for \"Friday March.\" It connects to \u201cinfrastructure\u201d and likely maps best to the \u201cAccess\u201d category because it's about user access. There\u2019s also a chance it could relate to \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d but the content specifically mentions exporting rather than rights. I\u2019ll output JSON for the category as {\"category\":\"Access\"} since that appears most relevant. Conciseness is key here!"
