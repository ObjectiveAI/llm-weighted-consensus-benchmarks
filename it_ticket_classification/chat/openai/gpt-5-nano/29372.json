Although it might also fit under \"Internal Project\" if it pertains to a project, the phrase \"pm queue\" could suggest \"project management.\" However, since adjusting a queue name in ServiceNow is more about administrative tasks, I think the best category would be \"Administrative rights\" because it involves modifying the queue name, which typically requires admin**Categorizing the Ticket Again**\n\nThere's no clear request for access or privileges in the user's message, which is about naming a queue. It might need admin privileges to rename, and typically we would categorize this as \"Administrative rights\" if it involves permissions or admin tasks. However, I also consider \"Internal Project\" for internal tasks. Ultimately, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Administrative rights\" since it deals with changing a queue name in ServiceNow, even if it\u2019s more about configuration than user rights. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON descriptor for clarity.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
