So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Access\" and prepare the necessary JSON object.**Producing IT Ticket JSON**\n\nThe task is to categorize the IT ticket based on the prompt provided. The allowed categories are listed, and I\u2019m considering if \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" is more fitting. \n\nSince the user mentioned \"no access to local access files documents blocks,\" I feel \"Access\" is the safer, more generic choice for this issue. I\u2019ll go ahead and format this as a JSON object for output, clearly stating: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. Let's proceed with that!"
