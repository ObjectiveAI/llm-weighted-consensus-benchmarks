This fits within the \"Access\" category since it deals with permissions or notification settings. However, it might not necessarily relate to admin rights, which are more about administrative configuration. I'm leaning towards categorizing this under \"Access\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" I need to decide which is the more precise fit based on the information given!**Deciding on ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m debating between categorizing this ticket as \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it\u2019s about receiving notifications, \"Access\" seems fitting at first. But \"Access\" usually relates to system entry rather than notification preferences. If the issue were about admin rights, it could fit there, but it\u2019s not. So, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the safest choice. I\u2019ll classify it as such, with a note specifying it's about Confluence notification issues, particularly regarding watching pages.**Structuring category response**\n\nI need to categorize this ticket and provide a response in a JSON-like structure. The format requires an object with a category specified as one of the enumerated values. I\u2019m thinking of responding with: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.\n\nHowever, since the issue pertains to notifications, it could technically fit under \"Access.\" Still, \"Miscellaneous\" feels like a safer choice for more ambiguous cases, especially since it relates to a specific feature, not access to the system. I'll finalize the response with \"Miscellaneous.\""
