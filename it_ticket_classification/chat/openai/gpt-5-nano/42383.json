It looks like there are problems with approvals: even when a confirmation appears after initiating the process, nothing happens, and items remain unprocessed. Plus, it seems there are outdated entries, like former members lingering on the list. I should categorize it based on these points.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI noticed the defined categories, which include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and others. Given that this ticket is about a software bug in Oracle Fusion's time card approval process, I need to choose the best category. \"HR Support\" seems the most appropriate since the issue relates directly to HR time tracking. If uncertainty arises, I could consider \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"HR Support\" fits best here. Now, I just need to format the output as JSON for the category.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
