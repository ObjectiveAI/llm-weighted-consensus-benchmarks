The user\u2019s text mentions a \"new delivery,\" \"lite cards command lite po,\" and phrases like \"please advise\" and \"thank engineer.\" It could be referring to \"delivery of lite cards\" or possibly \"badge reader.\" However, it seems most likely that this relates to a \"Purchase\" category since it involves the delivery of items and a purchase order (PO). Let's go with that for categorization!**Categorizing delivery ticket**\n\nThe user's message mentions \"lite po,\" which might be \"late PO,\" and it's a bit tricky. The text refers to \"new delivery\" and includes \"delivery of items\" and \"PO,\" possibly indicating they want to log a new delivery. It could fit the \"Purchase\" category due to the mention of a purchase order. However, I also consider \"Hardware\" since \"lite cards\" might refer to RFID cards. Overall, I'll categorize it as \"Purchase\" because of the focus on procurement and orders.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
