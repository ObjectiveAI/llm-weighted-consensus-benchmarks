The text mentions \"new starter Friday\" which suggests onboarding, and references a test lead extension possibly due on Tuesday. The user also asks to \"fill date,\" implying they might need a form completed. Given the content, I\u2019m thinking this ticket fits best under the \"HR Support\" category, since it relates to onboarding a new employee.**Evaluating IT Ticket Category**\n\nIt looks like this ticket involves access or administrative tasks for onboarding a new starter, like account creation and access provisioning. The categories \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" both seem relevant. However, the phrase \"new starter Friday\" suggests it\u2019s more about HR onboarding, and there is an \"HR Support\" category for that. Still, since this is an IT ticket, \"Access\" seems to be the best fit, especially if it's about granting permissions or filling out a form for an extension related to a test lead.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI see there\u2019s no clear request for admin rights in this ticket. It could involve hardware for a new starter, but that\u2019s not explicit. \"Miscellaneous\" is a catch-all for anything unclear, while \"Internal Project\" and \"Purchase\" don't apply here. Since it\u2019s ambiguous, I\u2019m leaning toward \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\" Given the content about a new starter and terms like \"fill date\" and \"extension,\" \"Access\" seems most appropriate for onboarding tasks like creating user accounts and granting system access.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
