The ticket mentions notifications and backup notes, which leans toward an operational task. \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d feels too vague, and \u201cStorage\u201d relates more to file issues than upgrades. I think \u201cInternal Project\u201d is the best choice for this planned forced upgrade.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to use \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d since it could relate to needing access for the upgrade. But the user's focus is more on scheduling rather than rights. Thus, I think \u201cInternal Project\u201d is the right category. I need to provide this in a JSON-like format, so I'll output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I wonder if a brief summary could be useful, but the instructions are clear that they expect just the category in that format."
