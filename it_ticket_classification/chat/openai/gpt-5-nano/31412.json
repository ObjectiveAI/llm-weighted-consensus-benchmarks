It looks like this request is HR-related, so I\u2019m considering options like \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" The mention of \"bulk starter form\" suggests it\u2019s about onboarding, which further points to \"HR Support\" as the most fitting category. I'll go ahead and categorize it accordingly.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nThe allowed category list includes \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" The user asked to categorize an IT ticket. Since \"HR Support\" exists, I can create a JSON object for it. Given the content about onboarding forms for new interns, categorizing it as \"HR Support\" seems most fitting. I should format my answer strictly as a JSON object with \"category\": \"HR Support,\" without any extra details.**Delivering JSON for categorization**\n\nI'm considering whether to categorize this request as \"Access\" since it relates to interns, but the text doesn\u2019t mention anything about access rights or passwords. So, \"HR Support\" is the way to go. I need to stick to the correct format based on the schema provided, which requires a JSON object with a \"category\" field. The final output will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Now it's time to deliver that without any extra comments."
