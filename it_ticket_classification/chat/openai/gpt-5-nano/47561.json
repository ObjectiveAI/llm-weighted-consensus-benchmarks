The relevant categories to choose from include Storage and Administrative rights. Since it's clearly about mailbox storage, I\u2019m deciding on \"Storage\" as the most suitable category. I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format, which is: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. This keeps it concise and appropriate!**Finalizing JSON category**\n\nI need to ensure I'm providing the correct JSON output for the category. The schema indicates it should look like {\"category\": ...}, but I\u2019ll stick to what\u2019s expected: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. That aligns well with the user's request about the mailbox being almost full. I don't think multiple categories apply here, so I\u2019m confirming that Storage is the right choice. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and provide only the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}."
