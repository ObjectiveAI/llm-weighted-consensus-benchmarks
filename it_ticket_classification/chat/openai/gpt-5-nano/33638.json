The text mentions terms like \"purchase request,\" \"purchase coordinator,\" and \"urgent purchase,\" which all relate to buying something. Looking at the tool's categories, \"Purchase\" seems to fit best here. \n\nI'll format the output as a JSON object, ensuring it follows the official structure needed. My final output will be: `{\"category\": \"Purchase\"}`.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the ticket, and it clearly mentions a \u201cnew purchase request\u201d and \u201curgent purchase.\u201d This indicates it\u2019s related to purchasing rather than other categories like hardware or access. Therefore, I determine that the category should be \"Purchase.\" \n\nI\u2019ll make sure to format it as valid JSON with the required structure. So, my response will be simply: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. No extra commentary, just the essential information."
