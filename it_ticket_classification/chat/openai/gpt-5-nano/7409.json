Since this seems to involve HR-related concerns, I\u2019ll likely categorize it under \"HR Support.\" It requires careful attention to the specifics provided for accurate categorization.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm looking at the details provided in the ticket, which mentions various aspects like access rights, deprovisioning, and mobile phone subscriptions. It seems to fit the \"Access\" category since it involves removing access for a leaver. There\u2019s also a possibility it could fall under \"Administrative rights\" because of the references to AD rights. Given that it heavily focuses on deprovisioning access to mailboxes and profiles, \"Access\" seems most appropriate. Now, I need to format the categorization into a structured format as requested.**Formatting the JSON output**\n\nThe expected response here is a JSON object with the category field assigned one of the allowed values. Given that the ticket is primarily about access revocation, I'd set it as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. While \"Administrative rights\" is a possible option since it relates to admin privileges, \"Access\" captures the overall focus of deprovisioning discussions. The user is specifically asking to categorize the IT ticket, so I\u2019ll stick to that and present the JSON accordingly.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
