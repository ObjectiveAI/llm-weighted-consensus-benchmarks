The ticket is messy, mentioning the cleanup of Romanian bank branches and referencing an attached Excel file. It has phrases like \u201cchange naming\u201d and \u201cmodifications,\u201d which makes it challenging to determine the exact category. I might consider options like \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or perhaps \"Access,\" but it doesn't quite fit neatly into any category.**Categorizing based on ticket details**\n\nThe user\u2019s ticket refers to renaming bank branches in a system, which makes me think it could fit under either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" There are standard IT categories I should consider, like \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Since renaming involves updating data in a system, it may align with \"Internal Project,\" especially if it's part of a data cleanup. It's not about hardware, storage, purchasing, or HR. So, I\u2019d likely categorize it as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Delivering ticket categorization**\n\nThe ticket request involves updating the naming of bank branches, which might require administrative rights. However, it's a bit ambiguous. Since the user\u2019s instruction is to categorize the IT ticket, I need to provide a JSON format. Given that this is about cleanup and naming modifications, \"Internal Project\" seems like the safest option. If I had doubts, \"Miscellaneous\" could work too, but I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" to be clear. So, I\u2019ll craft it as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
