I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object formatted properly to reflect this category. I'll make sure to include the right structure in my response!**Formatting JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nI need to respond to the prompt by categorizing the IT ticket as \"Storage.\" Based on the response format, I should produce a JSON object that includes the category field set to \"Storage.\"\n\nThe instructions mention specific formatting rules, so I will output: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s also mention of a type wrapper, which indicates I might need to include an object schema. After double-checking, it seems the final output should indeed just focus on categorization, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do!**Delivering JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve determined that the correct category for this IT ticket is \"Storage,\" since the user mentioned an issue with their OneDrive storage quota being exceeded and is asking if it can be increased. There's no need for any additional explanation. I'll keep it simple and deliver just the necessary JSON object. \n\nSo, my response will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. That\u2019s clear and to the point!"
