The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nGiven the context, HR Support seems like the most appropriate choice since it\u2019s about leave management. Although \"Administrative rights\" could relate to permissions, the main focus here is the request for annual leave, so HR Support is the best fit.**Categorizing as HR Support**\n\nThe user is asking someone else to enter annual leave for them, which indicates they\u2019re using an HR system. Therefore, I should categorize this ticket as HR Support. I'll need to respond with a JSON object specifying the category. \n\nThe required format is straightforward: it must be `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`. I\u2019ll make sure that the output is exactly that, with no extra commentary since the user's request was just for categorization."
