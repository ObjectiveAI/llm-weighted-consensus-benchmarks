The ticket seems a bit messy, discussing tasks, forms, and codes with urgency. It feels like it could fit under \"Administrative rights\" if it's about permissions, or maybe \"Internal Project\" since it involves project code. If nothing fits well, \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option, but \"Internal Project\" seems most suitable here.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI'm leaning toward categorizing this IT ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it seems to relate to project tasks. I could also consider \"Administrative rights,\" but that doesn\u2019t feel right. Since the request asks for a specific JSON object, I need to ensure I format it correctly. The output should simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI\u2019ll stick to that without adding extra explanations unless prompted. Time to deliver!"
