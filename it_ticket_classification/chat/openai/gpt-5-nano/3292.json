The user provided a long string that mainly revolves around the leaver process, mentioning things like leave dates, filled forms, mailbox access, and inventory details. It seems clear that this is related to an exit process for someone leaving the company. I'll classify this ticket under \"HR Support\" since it involves personnel changes.**Categorizing access for leaver**\n\nThe provided details mention various elements related to access and permissions for someone leaving the company, such as leaver forms, leaving dates, roaming profiles, and mailbox access. Given that it\u2019s primarily about access removal rather than hardware, I think it fits best under the \"Access\" category. I need to return a JSON object according to the specified format, which will look like this: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. Let's go ahead and format that correctly!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
