Since the main focus is on rights and permissions, it likely falls under either the \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" categories. I need to decide between these two options for appropriate categorization, but both seem relevant to the request.**Determining Category for IT Ticket**\n\nThis ticket seems focused on Microsoft Outlook calendar permissions, specifically editing rights and switching off responses for meeting attendees. The user wants to maintain their editing rights but not receive responses. It suggests a relationship to \"administrative rights,\" although the text is a bit unclear. I think I need to categorize this ticket using a JSON format. Given the focus on permissions, \"Access\" seems fit, while \"Administrative rights\" is more specific. I need to decide which is most suitable.**Categorizing Calendar Permission Request**\n\nThe user wants to switch off accepted/declined responses for meeting attendees, which seems to relate to a calendar setting. They also want to maintain their editing rights, indicating a focus on managing calendar permissions. I need to classify this as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since this is about calendar permissions, not admin rights for a system, \"Access\" feels more appropriate. So my response will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI need to output a JSON object for the category of the IT ticket. The instruction clearly states to \"Output\" the category in a JSON-like format, specifically as a single object. Based on the previous reasoning, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" It's crucial to keep the response clean and without any extra text. So, I will simply respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nLet's go ahead and deliver that!"
