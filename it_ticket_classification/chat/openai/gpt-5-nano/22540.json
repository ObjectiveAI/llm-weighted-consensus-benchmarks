The ticket says, \"new project code for Wednesday PM; please attached code thanks.\" It seems like the user wants a new project code, meaning it could fit under either \"Internal Project\" or \"Access.\" Since it primarily revolves around a project code, I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"Internal Project.\" I will create a JSON object with this category.**Categorizing IT Ticket Again**\n\nIt seems this ticket isn\u2019t strictly a hardware or access request. I think \"Internal Project\" fits best since it relates to an internal project code. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if admin privileges were needed, that\u2019s not the case here. Although \"Access\" seems possible due to the mention of \"attached code,\" I believe categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" makes more sense since it focuses on a new project code. I'll output a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThis IT ticket should be categorized as \"Internal Project\" since it's about a new project code. The user specifically asked for the category, so I need to keep my response succinct. I\u2019ll make sure to output just the JSON object with the category. Since the prompt doesn't ask for extra text, I\u2019ll format it properly as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll avoid any additional commentary to keep it clear and straightforward. Ready to proceed!"
