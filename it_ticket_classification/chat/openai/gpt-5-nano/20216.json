It might relate to \"Access\" rights or systems since there's a category for \"Administrative rights.\" The content implies a focus on outstanding tickets, likely related to \"SN reports.\" Given the context, it could fit under \"Internal Project\" as it involves reporting and change management. However, the categorization options are limited.**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nI'm trying to categorize this IT ticket correctly. \"Internal Project\" feels a bit generic, while \"Miscellaneous\" might be safer, but I need to choose a single category. The instruction requires a JSON object, like {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I have to make sure the slug matches allowed values: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" etc. The ticket revolves around outstanding items and a daily change summary, suggesting it's more about task coordination than hardware or storage. I'll select the best fit category based on that.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit for this ticket since it involves a report and change summary. \"Administrative rights\" seems unlikely, and \"Access\" pertains to privileges, which isn\u2019t relevant here. The task is to categorize the ticket, and it looks like I should respond with just the category in JSON format. I\u2019ll prepare the output as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Keeping it straightforward, there's no need for extra text!"
