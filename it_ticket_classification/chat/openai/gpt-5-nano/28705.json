The themes involve administration and possibly access to related information. So, I'm considering the best fit for the category based on these clues.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe request is to categorize an IT ticket based on a text that repeats terms like \"administration officer\" and references a \"new graduate.\" I\u2019m contemplating whether it fits under \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" The text mixes themes of onboarding a new graduate and setting up an administration officer. Given its focus on onboarding, \"HR Support\" seems like the most appropriate category, even though the content is a bit messy.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
