The user mentions a \"room scheduling assistant\" and a \"meeting room display calendar,\" which points to an issue likely involving hardware. While there are various categories like \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access,\" they don't seem to fit here. I think the best fit is \"Hardware,\" since it specifically relates to the display device used for scheduling. \"Miscellaneous\" could work if I'm unsure.**Creating JSON for IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket requests categorization, and I need to provide a JSON-like object according to the given schema. The options include categories like \"Hardware\" and \"Administrative rights.\" For this specific case, \"Hardware\" fits best since it mentions a \"meeting room display calendar,\" likely referring to a display device. Although I considered \"Administrative rights,\" it doesn\u2019t seem relevant here. So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to keep it concise and directly aligned with the instruction."
