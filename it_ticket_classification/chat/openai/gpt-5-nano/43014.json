It seems they need specific elevated privileges in the HR system. I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing this as \"Administrative rights\" since it matches their request more precisely than just \"Access.\" The phrase \"view and maintain employee accounts\" clearly indicates that they require admin privileges. So, I\u2019ll finalize it with the category set to \"Administrative rights\" and prepare to output the JSON object.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI see that the required format is clear: it needs to be a JSON object with a \"category\" string and specific enum values. I'll create the JSON object reflecting the user's request with the category set as \"Administrative rights.\" Since the user just wants the categorization, I won't include any extra explanations or text\u2014just the straight-up JSON response. That way, it\u2019s simple and to the point. Here goes!"
