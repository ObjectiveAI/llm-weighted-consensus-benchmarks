The available categories include \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" and a few others. I think it leans towards \"HR Support\" since it revolves around interns. However, it could also touch on \"Administrative rights\" if there\u2019s a request for user accounts or access. The clarity is a bit lacking, though.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI might categorize this IT ticket as \"HR Support\" since it's focused on new interns and a bulk starter form. The user requested, \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" so I need to produce a JSON object with the category field set to one of the specified options. The expected response format looks like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. While \"Administrative rights\" could also fit if it pertains to access for interns, \"Access\" might refer to creating accounts. However, \"HR Support\" seems most fitting given the context.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"administration officer ext\" suggests that admin staff is involved. Since the ticket refers to \"new interns,\" \"starting July,\" and a \"bulk starter form,\" it seems connected to HR onboarding rather than a technical IT issue. However, since it's an IT ticket classification, \"HR Support\" is the most suitable category based on the options available. I\u2019ll respond with just the JSON object, as follows:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
