They mention topics raised on Wednesday, a proposed change, and a request for updates and progress. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Internal Project\" since it's related to changes and updates rather than hardware or HR support. I want to ensure I select the best-fitting category that matches their request to keep everything organized and clear. Let's see where it fits!**Identifying ticket category**\n\nI see the text mentions ServiceNow, change requests, updates about progress, and creating an assigned queue. It looks like it\u2019s referring to CR forms and their modifications. Based on the content, I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing this ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it focuses on change requests and process improvements. The other options like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous\" don\u2019t seem to fit as well. I want to ensure it\u2019s accurately categorized!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
