The user asked to categorize it, and I understand I must output a JSON-like object with a \"category\" field based on a provided schema. From the text, it seems like they are experiencing an issue with \"zone awards\" nominations. They can\u2019t nominate anyone due to an error message when they press submit, indicating it's a user-facing issue possibly related to the \"Miscellaneous\" category.**Categorizing the IT issue**\n\nI think the user\u2019s issue relates to \"nominate,\" \"submit,\" and an \"error message\" that occurs when trying to submit. The category options include things like Access and Miscellaneous. Since this seems like an application problem, I'm considering \"Access\" related to permissions or \"Internal Project\" if it pertains to system bugs. However, \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit, as it serves as a catch-all for issues like this. It seems \"zone awards\" is a nomination feature within an internal HR system.**Decoding the user issue**\n\nThe phrase \"zone awards\" likely refers to nominations for a specific location or category. The user's message is garbled but indicates they can\u2019t nominate for zone awards, despite some confusion about being able to nominate others. They also mention errors when attempting to submit.\n\nThis seems to indicate a feature malfunction, suggesting that \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit among the categories. \"Access\" would apply if it\u2019s about permission issues, while \"Internal Project\" could fit if related to a particular project.**Deciding on the category**\n\nSince the issue revolves around a bug in an internal nomination form, I'm leaning toward categorizing this ticket as \"Internal Project.\" It relates to the internal system called Zone Awards, which fits the typical \"Internal Project\" categorization. However, since I must choose from the enumerated categories, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a safe choice. \n\nTherefore, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}, ensuring that I'm strictly adhering to the required format. No extra notes, just the specified category."
