Among the provided categories, these two look most applicable for IT ticket categorization. The phrase doesn't clarify much, so I'll choose \"Access\" since it relates to user addition and permissions.**Determining category format**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this task and think \"Access\" is suitable since it involves adding people. The user asked for categorization, so I need to provide a JSON object with the category. The format shows I should respond with something like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019m aware that the instructions specify to adhere strictly to that JSON structure, so I should focus on just delivering that when I respond. Including an explanation might not be necessary based on that requirement.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
