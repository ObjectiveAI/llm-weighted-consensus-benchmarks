I want to ensure I follow the schema correctly!**Categorizing Access Request**\n\nThe ticket seems focused on accessing documents and mentions a \"view table under SOW VA,\" which might refer to a Statement of Work. The phrases around \"permission\" and \"adding back Teams\" indicate it's related to accessing documents. \n\nI think \"Access\" is the best category here, as \"Administrative rights\" suggests more elevated privileges, which doesn't seem necessary based on the user's request. The overall content clearly indicates a need for access, confirming our choice. So, I\u2019ll categorize the ticket as \"Access.\"**Finalizing Access Category**\n\nThe user mentions \"Teams,\" which likely refers to \"Microsoft Teams,\" and they seem to seek access to a client's contract document. The phrase \"currently view table under SOW VA\" suggests they're looking to view a specific table related to that contract. Since this is all about accessing documents, I believe the appropriate category is \"Access.\" \n\nSo, I'll format my output correctly as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, ensuring it matches the required schema. I'll double-check that I'm following the format instructions!**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI need to provide a JSON object for the category, which should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. \n\nHowever, there's a specific schema I must follow that includes a type object with properties. It states the structure should be: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}. \n\nDespite the guidelines usually allowing just the category, I\u2019ll go ahead and confirm the final output as {\"category\":\"Access\"} to stay compliant\u2014this seems like the best fit!"
