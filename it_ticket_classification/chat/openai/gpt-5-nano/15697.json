It seems like changing the approval flow might need admin rights, but that's a subset of access. Since they gave separate categories, I think the best fit here is \"Internal Project.\" \n\nSo I'll craft a JSON object stating: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. I wonder if a brief note to the user is needed, but since the prompt says to only categorize, I'll stick to that.**Providing the category**\n\nThe task says to give the category in a specific JSON format, so I just need to respond with that. I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. It's important to avoid any extra details, just keep it clean. I should double-check to see if there\u2019s any risk if the content is messy, but I think categorizing as \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant, but \"Internal Project\" feels broader."
