The user's message is somewhat garbled, but it seems to involve a request for permissions related to accounts, which could fit under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The mention of \"thursday pm\" might suggest a deadline, while \"further details please\" implies there\u2019s missing information. Overall, \"Access\" seems like the best fit for this ticket.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to pick a category for the IT ticket based on its content. It looks like it's about requesting permissions for an account, which falls under access control. If it were specifically asking for \"admin rights,\" it could fit \"Administrative rights,\" but \"permissions to accounts\" seems more like standard access. So, \"Access\" feels like a safer generic choice. I\u2019ll output the JSON with the selected category: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's finalize that without extra text."
