It refers to employees leaving, disabling AD accounts, and transferring responsibilities. Considering the content, it fits into the \"Access\" category due to provisioning and deprovisioning aspects, but it may also touch on \"Administrative rights\" if admin rights are involved. I should carefully review it to ensure accurate categorization!**Finalizing category assignment**\n\nI\u2019m considering the appropriate categories for this IT ticket. While \"leaver form validation\" often relates to HR, this ticket focuses on access management and deprovisioning, placing it in the \"Access\" category. I briefly thought about \"HR Support,\" but since this is primarily an IT process, \u201cAccess\u201d fits better. I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format, ensuring it precisely matches what's needed: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's make sure everything is clear and accurate!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
