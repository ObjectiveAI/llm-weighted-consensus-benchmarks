It mentions requisitions, hiring dates, and procurement, which likely fits into the \"Purchase\" category. However, it could also fall under \"Administrative rights\" if there are access concerns, though no specific access issues are explicitly mentioned. The content feels a bit rough, but overall, it leans toward procurement and hiring processes.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"urgent\" and \"board of directors,\" with repeated references to \"requisition,\" which suggests it is related to procurement. It could fit into the \"Purchase\" category due to the focus on requisitions and purchase orders. While \"Internal Project\" might be considered if it were a project request, it leans more strongly towards procurement. Given this, I think the correct category is \"Purchase.\" \n\nI should format my response as a JSON object, something like: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"} \n\nA brief justification could clarify my choice.**Formatting the response**\n\nThe required format for the IT ticket response is a JSON object with a \"category\" field. The instruction specifies to output the category as a string, based on the schema provided. Since I've determined the correct category is \"Purchase,\" I\u2019ll format the response as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"} \n\nI need to ensure that I keep it simple and avoid adding any extra text. Just the JSON format is needed!"
