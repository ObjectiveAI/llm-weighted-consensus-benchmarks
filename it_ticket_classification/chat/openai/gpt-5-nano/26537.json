The text mentions a \"new starter\" starting in November, possibly needing access or onboarding help. It seems like this relates to administrative rights or HR support. The keywords suggest the user is reaching out about setting up processes for a new employee, so I should map this to either \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights\" in the provided categories.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking through how to categorize this IT ticket related to onboarding a new starter. The categories available include HR Support, Access, and Administrative rights, among others. Given the context, it seems to lean towards \"Access\" for account setup or \"HR Support\" for onboarding assistance. The phrase \u201cnew starter\u201d clearly indicates the need for access provisioning. I need to output a JSON-like object with the chosen category that fits the provided enum values.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m working on categorizing this IT ticket, which includes a phrase suggesting to \"return both.\" That could imply permission for returning two items, but I think it\u2019s mostly about onboarding a new starter. It seems clear that this involves access provisioning, so \"Access\" feels like the most fitting category. While \"HR Support\" could apply to onboarding, it seems less direct here. I\u2019ll output the result in the required JSON-like format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Delivering Categorization**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize without providing extra rationale, so I\u2019ll just focus on that. I need to ensure I use the exact string \"Access,\" following the capitalization exactly as provided in the enum. The final answer should be a clean JSON-like object with just the category field, as per the instruction. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That keeps it straightforward and in line with their request!"
