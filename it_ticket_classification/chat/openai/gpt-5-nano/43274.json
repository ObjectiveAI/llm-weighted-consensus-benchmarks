It seems to fit best in the \"Access\" category instead of \"Administrative rights,\" as it's primarily about permissions. So, my final response will be structured as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Deciding on access category**\n\nI\u2019m considering categorizing this IT ticket. While \"Administrative rights\" could be an option, since it mentions a permission issue and access needs for a member, the main point here is that it's about not being able to access the server. Therefore, I believe \"Access\" is the most appropriate category. My final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll make sure there's no extra text provided."
