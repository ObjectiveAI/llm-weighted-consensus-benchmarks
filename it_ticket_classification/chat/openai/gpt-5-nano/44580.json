Given the categories provided, \"Technical issue\" might fit, but \"Miscellaneous\" could also work for generic tickets. However, if it's a hardware issue with the screen or monitor, then \"Hardware\" could be the right choice too. The \"copy genuine\" message also indicates a potential issue with Windows activation.**Interpreting IT ticket details**\n\nThe phrase \"seen message copy genuine\" likely refers to a Windows activation message. The user's description of \"Windows not working, black screen with small message\" could point to a licensing issue, which doesn't fit neatly into the provided categories. Considering the options, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit, as it\u2019s a broad category for such cases. While it might relate to licensing, \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" don\u2019t seem applicable here. The user\u2019s request to categorize the ticket suggests they're looking for a way to triage this issue properly.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
