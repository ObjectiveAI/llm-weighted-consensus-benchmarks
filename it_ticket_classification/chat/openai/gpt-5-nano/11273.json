It seems that \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could be the best options. The user might want to route the ticket based on access needs. The mention of a \"list of people with access to locations\" suggests an audit is requested, which aligns more with \"Access\" rather than \"granting rights.\" However, the context of viewing old forms and invoicing might lead to categories like \"HR Support\" or \"Internal Project.\" Still, the focus on access makes \"Access\" the likely choice for routing.**Parsing user requests**\n\nI'm analyzing the user's input. The mention of a \"list of people with access to locations\" indicates they're requesting an existing access list. The reference to \u201cthursday july pm\u201d seems to mark a time, and \"hello auditor\" might address an external auditor. The phrases like \"old invoicing breakdown\" and \"old personnel forms view\" feel a bit random, which could imply the user is testing data generation. Since access to locations is central here, the best category is \u201cAccess.\u201d \n\nI should respond with a JSON object that specifies the category as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
