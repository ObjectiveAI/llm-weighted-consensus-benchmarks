It possibly relates to board games or an event room at Tesla. Since the details are unclear, I'm wondering if it fits best under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access.\" I need to use my judgment here to choose the right category based on what's relevant.**Parsing IT Ticket Text**\n\nI'm trying to make sense of this jumbled message about board games. The phrase \"wrong location\" suggests there might be a location issue with the board games, but our categories don't include \"Facility/Location.\" The options I have are \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Access\" could work if it's about someone unable to access the event. Considering all this, I think the best category for this ticket is likely \"Miscellaneous\" or maybe \"Storage,\" as it pertains to the location and receiving of board games.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket mentions a few things like \"receiving sent started today,\" \"wrong location,\" and \"event room Tesla.\" I think the best fit would be the \"Storage\" category since it relates to inventory and location issues. So, I plan to format my response as a JSON object, like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. However, I do wonder if the user might prefer a more human-readable response. Still, based on the content, \"Storage\" really does seem to be the right choice here.**Delivering JSON Output**\n\nI see that I need to use the correct schema to provide my output as JSON. The category has to be one of the allowed enumerated values, and since \"Storage\" is included, I'm set on that. I'll format the response accordingly to make sure it aligns with what's expected. This should help ensure clarity and correctness, so let\u2019s go ahead and deliver that JSON response!"
