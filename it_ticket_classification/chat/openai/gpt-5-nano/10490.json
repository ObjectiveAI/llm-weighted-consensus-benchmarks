The ticket revolves around gaining access to the MS IT shared mailbox and mentions \"add him to Snow queue,\" likely referring to the ServiceNow queue. Since this request is focused on access rights, the most fitting category here is \"Access.\" That clarifies how to proceed!**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether \"Administrative rights\" might be the right choice since it involves granting mailbox access. However, the context suggests it\u2019s more about access rather than administrative privileges. The user mentioned access to the MS IT shared mailbox directly, so it solidifies my decision to go with \"Access.\" Now, I need to format the output in the required JSON format, which should be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll keep it clean and straightforward!**Final Review of Ticket Input**\n\nI want to clarify the input text that mentions \"MS IT shared mailbox.\" This likely refers to the internal IT team. The request is to add someone to this mailbox, but the part about \"add him to Snow queue\" seems irrelevant for categorization. So, I'll finalize my response with the JSON format, ensuring it's correct. It\u2019s essential to keep it concise and straightforward as per requirements. Now, I\u2019m ready to respond."
