The categories available are somewhat limited. The most fitting options seem to be either \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" It feels like it's leaning more toward a development or IT-related issue, especially with terms like \"script render error\" and \"notify assessment.\" So I guess \"Internal Project\" could be the best label for this ticket!**Categorizing IT Ticket Format**\n\nI think \"Internal Project\" makes the most sense for this IT ticket since it relates to internal software and scripts. If I'm unsure, I could go with \"Miscellaneous\" instead. The user has specifically asked me to categorize the ticket, so I'll need to format my response as a JSON object. The system instructions include a clear format template, which I'll need to follow precisely. So, it's important to output it correctly with the chosen category!**Identifying Ticket Details**\n\nThe ticket refers to a \"Friday pm reminder feedback\" and suggests there might be an issue with a reminder script, mentioning things like \"script render error\" and \"notify assessment.\" It seems to point toward a bug in the script, making \"Internal Project\" the best category. Even though the text is a bit messy, the underlying problem appears to be a script error affecting reminders. So, I\u2019ll format my output correctly as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}**Finalizing the Output**\n\nI just need to make sure that the content I provide is exactly:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nIt's important to be precise with this to ensure it meets the required format. I\u2019m ready to provide that now!"
