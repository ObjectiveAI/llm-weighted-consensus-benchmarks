It could relate to Administrative Rights if permissions are needed, or it might fit into Miscellaneous since there\u2019s no Software category. Given that this is about an OS issue, it seems I should lean toward Miscellaneous as a catch-all option for this ticket.**Formatting category response**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket and provided a detailed description. I need to format my response as a JSON object, specifically with the \"category\" field included. The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Since the ticket is quite general, I'll choose \"Miscellaneous.\" The response will look like: `{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}`. This ensures I follow the required format accurately!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
