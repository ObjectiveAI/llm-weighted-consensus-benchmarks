Other options could be \"Internal Project\" or \"Access,\" but \"HR Support\" feels most appropriate here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket, and it seems like \"HR Support\" is the best fit. Alternatively, \"Internal Project\" might work if it\u2019s referring to a portal. The instructions say to output a JSON-like structure for the category, so I\u2019ll follow that format.
