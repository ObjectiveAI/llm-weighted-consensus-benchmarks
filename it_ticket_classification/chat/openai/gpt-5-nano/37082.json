The user is looking to remove unnecessary files and has mentioned several aspects related to disk space and file management. Given the categories available, it seems this ticket falls under \"Storage\" primarily, though it touches a bit on \"Administrative rights\" too. Overall, I think \"Storage\" is the best fit.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe user mentioned wanting to remove necessary files, suggesting this falls under the \"Storage\" category. I need to output a JSON object with the category specified. It looks like it should be in this format: {\"category\": \"Storage\"}.\n\nI should double-check if there are any mentions of \"Administrative rights\" since that might apply, but since the main focus is on storage and the upgrade process, I'll stick with \"Storage\" for the category. I'll just provide the JSON as instructed."
