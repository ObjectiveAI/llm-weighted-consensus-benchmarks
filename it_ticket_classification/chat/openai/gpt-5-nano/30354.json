The ticket clearly revolves around enabling access for a new employee, suggesting it fits best under \"Access.\" Although it might touch on \"Administrative rights,\" since the focus is on access provisioning, \"Access\" seems like the most fitting choice.**Preparing structured JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a structured JSON object based on the instructions given. The category to select is \"Access,\" and I should format it properly. I'll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"} as the required response, ensuring there's no extra text or punctuation. I wonder if I should consider \"HR Support\" as well since the mention of \"new starter forms\" could relate. However, the overall focus is on enabling an access card, so \"Access\" is clearly the right choice.**Confirming access category**\n\nThe mention of \"access card enabling\" really makes it clear that this request is about providing access for a new starter. Therefore, I can confidently categorize this as \"Access.\" Now that I\u2019ve figured that out, I'll go ahead and deliver my response. It's all coming together nicely!"
