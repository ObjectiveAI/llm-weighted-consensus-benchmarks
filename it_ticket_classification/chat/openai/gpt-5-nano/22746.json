It looks like the user wants to create a CAPs pilot quality gate in SonarQube, which is part of an internal project. Now, I need to categorize this ticket; it could fit under \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Administration rights,\" but it seems unlikely to be related to hardware or HR.**Categorizing SonarQube Ticket**\n\nThis task revolves around a SonarQube quality gate and related code metrics, likely tied to an internal project management initiative. The category options are pretty generic, but I feel \"Internal Project\" best fits since it relates to software development. The user wants to categorize this IT ticket, and while \"Administrative rights\" might apply if access were mentioned, the ticket mainly discusses project management aspects. So, I think \"Internal Project\" is the way to go. I'll format my response accordingly!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
