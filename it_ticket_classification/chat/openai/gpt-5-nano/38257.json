The user mentioned an \"oracle error\" related to time card statuses and even attached a print screen. From the categories provided, \"HR Support\" seems suitable since it likely involves an HR system issue, particularly with timekeeping. It could also relate to access issues, but I think \"HR Support\" fits best here. Now, I'll format this as a JSON object with the selected category.**Confirming category for ticket**\n\nIt seems the error relates to time card statuses in Oracle, so \"HR Support\" is likely the right category. The ticket mentions issues with card statuses and includes a request for resolution. Following guidelines, I need to respond with a JSON format and nothing extra. I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Double-checking the category options confirms that this fits perfectly. So, I\u2019m set to output that JSON object now."
