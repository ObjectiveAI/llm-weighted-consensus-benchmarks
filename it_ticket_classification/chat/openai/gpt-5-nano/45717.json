It seems clear that this falls under the \"Hardware\" category since the user is describing a problem with the laptop's keyboard. To formalize this, I\u2019ll respond in a JSON-like format, showing the category according to the prescribed schema. I\u2019ll make sure to outline the reasoning as well. So, I'll output the category as \u201cHardware\u201d in the appropriate format.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that indicates the category for the issue, which in this case is \"Hardware.\" The required format isn\u2019t rigidly defined, but I have the schema to follow. So, I\u2019ll simply output it as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, without any extra commentary or details. The user's mention of \"ext mob en your zone\" seems unnecessary for this context, so I'll focus solely on the essential information in my response."
