The user provided a string that mentions things like a \u201cnew starter,\u201d \u201ccredentials,\u201d and different roles. Since the system has predefined categories such as \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others, I\u2019ll need to sort this ticket into one of them. Given the references to a new starter and credentials, \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" might be appropriate categories.**Parsing IT ticket content**\n\nI'm parsing the content of the ticket, which contains terms like \"new starter,\" \"credentials,\" and \"access provisioning.\" It feels like the focus is on onboarding someone and creating their credentials, which suggests the \"Access\" category is most fitting. There are also references to \"HR Support,\" but the wording leans more towards access provisioning related to accounts, like VPN. The ticket doesn't mention \"Onboarding,\" so \"Access\" seems right. I\u2019ll prepare to output this in JSON format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
