This sounds like it pertains to access or permissions, possibly needing \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" Given the details, I'm leaning toward \"Administrative rights\" since it addresses permission settings for approvals.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, which focuses on time entries approval and mentions an inactive approval button requiring line manager's input. It could fit in \"Access\" since it involves permissions, but \"Administrative rights\" seems more accurate because it specifically refers to disabled features due to rights issues. While \"Miscellaneous\" could be used if it's unclear, I think \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit. I'll format the final answer as a JSON object with that category value.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
