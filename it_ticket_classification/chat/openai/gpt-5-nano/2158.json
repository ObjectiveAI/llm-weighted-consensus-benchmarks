The options available are things like \u201cHardware,\u201d \u201cHR Support,\u201d and others. The message is a bit jumbled, mentioning a computer's availability since December and whether it\u2019s working. It seems like the ticket could possibly belong to HR given the maternity leave context, but I also wonder if this is related to hardware availability as well.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, considering categories like HR Support and Administrative rights. Given the user's request about a \"computer available\" and \"computer working,\" it likely pertains to Hardware, hinting at a status or unit purchase issue. I also see HR implications because of the maternity leave mention. So, if it\u2019s about access needed, it could fall under Access. Ultimately, I think I should choose between \"Hardware\" or \"HR Support.\"**Finalizing category for IT ticket**\n\nThe content is a bit unclear, but \"computer available\" suggests it relates to hardware assets. The mention of \"maternity leaver\" is HR-related, and it seems to be asking if a computer is available and working for that employee. Given all this, I believe the appropriate category is \"Hardware.\" \n\nSo, I'll prepare to respond with the required JSON-like object structured around this category. It will look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to fit the system's requirements.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
