The options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nI notice \"Administrative rights\" is a separate category, but the ticket seems more related to \u201cInternal Project,\u201d given it mentions opportunities closed under the pipeline and product extensions. Alternatively, it could fit under \"Purchase\" if it\u2019s about budget closures. I'm not super certain, but \u201cInternal Project\u201d feels like the best match.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket. I see some keywords like \"close opp,\" which likely refers to closing an opportunity in sales. Other phrases like \"codes next budget view period\" and \"product extension ramp\" suggest it's about internal processes. \n\nI think the \u201cInternal Project\u201d category fits best since it relates to budget and product management tasks. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object with the selected category. Let\u2019s finalize that!**Formatting category response**\n\nThe user wants a category output in JSON format. The instructions specify a \u201ccategory\u201d role, which means I need to follow the defined schema provided. \n\nAccording to this schema, the output should look like: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I realize I don\u2019t need to include \"type\": \"object\" in my response. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and craft the final output as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. While I could add a justification, I\u2019ll stick to being concise since the focus is on the categorization itself. Let's wrap this up!"
