It refers to logging the installation and mentions mandatory receipts. Given the context, it could fit under \"Purchase\" because of the purchase order and \"Hardware\" for the monitor itself. Since it also touches on installation, I might lean toward \"Purchase\" as the appropriate category here. Ultimately, I'll categorize it as \"Purchase.\"**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to decide on the best category for the IT ticket. It seems \"Purchase\" is the most appropriate since it focuses on the purchase order and receipts. While there's mention of hardware installation, the primary action is clearly about purchasing. The \"Hardware\" category could be relevant due to the monitor, but since the word \"log installation\" indicates it's secondary, sticking with \"Purchase\" feels right. So, I'll format my response as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
