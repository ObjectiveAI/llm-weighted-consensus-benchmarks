The user message seems a bit jumbled, but I can pick out key points indicating it's about onboarding a new starter. It mentions hardware (tower), testing, and changing account credentials to a permanent status. So, I'll focus on categorizing this under Hardware and possibly Internal Project, given the context of onboarding.**Analyzing IT ticket details**\n\nThe message mentions \"new starter tower,\" which likely refers to a computer tower and suggests some scheduling for a new employee. It seems they want to inform candidates about an internship program and request to change account credentials to a permanent status. This indicates the need for account access provisioning. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they're requesting admin level access, \"Access\" seems like the most fitting category since it's primarily about user account credentials.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at an IT ticket about a new starter, focusing on accounts, credentials, and permanent status. Since the ticket touches on user accounts and credential provisioning, I'd categorize it as \"Access.\" However, there\u2019s also mention of a \"new starter tower,\" indicating a need for hardware provisioning, which could fall under \"Hardware.\" The directive states to choose one category, so despite multiple aspects, I see \"Access\" as the most relevant choice for this ticket.**Finalizing the IT ticket response**\n\nI\u2019m considering that the term \"tower\" might suggest a need for hardware, but the request to \"change accounts credentials to permanent status\" is clearly focused on account management. This makes me think the ticket is about onboarding a new starter and handling access. So, I'll categorize it as \"Access,\" given that it includes key elements related to account management. I need to format the response as a JSON object and provide it exactly as needed. \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
