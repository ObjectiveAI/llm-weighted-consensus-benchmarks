It might also relate to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" if they're asking for permissions, but it's not entirely clear. The mention of adding an address might suggest \"Miscellaneous.\" Let\u2019s evaluate how to put this together!**Choosing a category**\n\nIt\u2019s a bit tricky to categorize this IT ticket, but I think \"Internal Project\" fits best since it mentions a \"new list integration platform\" and \"platform code.\" I should definitely provide a brief justification for this choice while following the structure outlined in the instructions. I\u2019ll create a JSON object featuring just the category field, which will look like: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That keeps it straightforward, just focusing on the internal project context!**Formatting the output**\n\nThe instruction specifies that I need to output a category in a JSON format. I\u2019ll format it correctly as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. However, I'm noticing a schema requirement that includes more detail, but it seems like the instruction simply wants the category value. So to follow the instructions without adding anything unnecessary, I\u2019ll ensure it\u2019s strictly the category value in that JSON structure, just focusing on: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
