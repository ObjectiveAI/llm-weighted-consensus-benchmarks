The key points include \"password\" and \"locked himself out,\" indicating he can't access his computer. Considering the options, \"Access\" seems like the most fitting category for a password reset request. I wonder if it might fall under \"Administrative rights,\" but typically, this kind of issue is categorized as \"Access.\" Let\u2019s finalize it with \"Access\" to ensure clarity.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm working on categorizing the IT ticket focused on login or access issues. Administrative rights could involve enabling privileges or a password reset that requires admin access. Since the user is asking for a category, I'll choose \"Access,\" as it fits best. The response needs to be a JSON object formatted correctly per the schema, which is: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I think it\u2019s clear and concise, though I should remember to avoid adding extra text beyond what\u2019s specified!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
