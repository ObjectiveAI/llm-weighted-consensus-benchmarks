It looks like \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category since the ticket focuses on new purchases, purchase orders, and receipts. However, \"Hardware\" could also be relevant due to the installation aspect. But ultimately, I'll classify it under \"Purchase\" for clarity. I'll respond with a JSON object in the required format.**Creating JSON Output**\n\nI need to generate a JSON object with a key \"category\" that fits the allowed categories. The instructions indicate that I should respond with just this object, specifically, the category as a JSON string. Based on the text, \"Purchase\" is definitely the best fit since it includes references to a new purchase order, receipts, and installation logging. I\u2019ll format it correctly and ensure there's no extra text. \n\nSo, the output will be: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. Let's do this!"
