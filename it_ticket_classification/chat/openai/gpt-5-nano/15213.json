This ticket mentions \"annual leave,\" \"oracle changes,\" and errors encountered while updating files. It seems most related to HR, especially with topics like leave management and policies. So, \"HR Support\" feels like the right category to choose, considering it's all about annual leave and associated changes.**Finalizing category for IT ticket**\n\nI realize that \"HR Support\" is indeed one of the provided categories. The user wants me to categorize an IT ticket about annual leave changes, Oracle updates, and errors. It definitely seems HR-related, so \"HR Support\" fits well. Although I briefly consider if it could be \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" I keep coming back to \"HR Support\" as the most fitting choice. I\u2019ll finalize the response as the required JSON format. Here goes: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
