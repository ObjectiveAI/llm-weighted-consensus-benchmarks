This will help us understand the issues better and streamline the handling process. I could consider different categories based on urgency, type of issue, or project involved. I wonder if it\u2019s worth creating a checklist for common problems so that anyone can easily identify where a ticket needs to go. Let\u2019s make sure we have a consistent system!**Categorizing user request**\n\nI received a lengthy text from the user containing various phrases related to annual leave requests and system processes. I need to categorize this message under one of the predefined categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It seems that this request is mainly about HR processes, so \"HR Support\" could be a fitting category. Let\u2019s ensure I organize this correctly for better tracking and management!**Choosing a category for IT Ticket**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket, which seems to focus on an annual leave workflow. The ticket mentions adding requests, reviewing leave, approvals, and handling messages. It leans towards being HR-related, so \u201cHR Support\u201d seems like the most suitable category from the list. However, since there are aspects of access and permissions, like authorizing requests, I could also consider \"Administrative rights.\" I'll go with \"HR Support\" for clarity in managing leave-related issues!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
