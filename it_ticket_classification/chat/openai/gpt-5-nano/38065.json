It seems to discuss notification delays and payment issues due to approval processes. The user mentions \"sent Friday re conf urgent bird\" multiple times, hinting at urgency. The available categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The best fit seems to be \"Purchase\" because it's centered on payment delays, although \"Miscellaneous\" could also work. I'm considering the context carefully!**Categorizing payment delays**\n\nThe ticket is focused on delays caused by having more approvers, which is impacting payments and notifications. This definitely points to an IT operations issue. I\u2019m considering whether to label it as \"Internal Project\" or \"Purchase,\" since it relates to payments. The user emphasizes urgency by repeating the word \"urgent.\" I think \"Purchase\" is the best fit here because it directly addresses payment concerns, but it also touches on the notification aspect. It's a bit tricky!**Parsing mixed text**\n\nI'm trying to parse the text that mixes Romanian and English. It starts with \"no notifications,\" asking someone to check the situation regarding delays caused by more approvers, leading to payment issues. The word \"urgent\" appears repeatedly, suggesting it's a pressing matter. I notice mentions like \"specialist,\" \"sent Friday,\" and \"architecture,\" but the context is somewhat muddled. Overall, it involves payment delays due to approvals, and there's a strong emphasis on urgency. It's a bit chaotic!**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt looks like the ticket involves \"notifications,\" possibly regarding \"emails about approvals\" and mentions of \"pro forma,\" \"pass,\" and even \"safari,\" which might refer to browsers. The categories to choose from include \"Miscellaneous\" and \"Internal Project.\" \"Internal Project\" seems fitting due to references to \"architecture\" and \"public\" but there's significant focus on payment delays, which leans toward \"Purchase.\" Since I need to categorize, I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous\" for the output. I should format it as a JSON-like object!**Choosing the ticket category**\n\nThis ticket is about IT processes where approvals are causing payment delays. I considered \"Administrative rights,\" but that's more about permissions and not relevant here. The mention of payments suggests \"Purchase,\" especially since it overlaps with procurement and purchase orders. The repeated use of \"urgent\" and \"bird\" hints at internal coding but doesn\u2019t indicate hardware involvement. So, I believe \"Purchase\" is the best fit. I\u2019ll respond simply with the category in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
