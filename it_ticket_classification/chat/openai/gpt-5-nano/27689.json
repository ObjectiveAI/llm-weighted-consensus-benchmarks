It does feel quite chaotic! The instruction states to categorize it, and there\u2019s a JSON schema for the categories available: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights\". I\u2019ll figure out which one fits best based on the provided information.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI need to analyze the content regarding access issues related to a confluence user, mentioning things like lockouts due to failed login attempts and a generic user ID. The primary theme here revolves around access problems, specifically confluence login and user lockouts. It clearly falls under the \"Access\" category. I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object as per the required format: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}} and include \"Access\" as the category."
