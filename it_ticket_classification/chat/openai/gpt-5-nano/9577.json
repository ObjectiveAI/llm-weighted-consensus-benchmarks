The request involves assistance with completing this form, so I\u2019m considering the best category. It could fit into \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights,\" since it\u2019s related to onboarding. I also wonder if it qualifies as \"Miscellaneous\" or perhaps even \"Internal Project\" if it relates to building a starter form. The specific categories provided make it a bit tricky!**Categorizing Onboarding Forms**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to categorize the onboarding forms. It seems like \"HR Support\" is the best fit since the message is about a new starter and induction. \"Administrative rights\" could apply because it relates to user access, but the focus is on completing the starter form. There\u2019s also a mention of a \"return form,\" which indicates they want to send completed forms back. However, since there's no clear request for access, I\u2019ll stick with \"HR Support.\"**Outputting JSON Category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the ticket as \"HR Support.\" Now, I need to make sure I\u2019m formatting my response as a JSON object, which should look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. The system expects me to follow the schema provided, so I\u2019ll ensure to use the correct structure with just the \"category\" key. I double-checked that there aren\u2019t any extra instructions about multiple categories, so I\u2019ll keep it simple. The final output will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
