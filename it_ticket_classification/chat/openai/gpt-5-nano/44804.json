The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket mentions issues with leaver form links, specifically about updating them. \n\nSince \"IT Support\" isn't listed, I might consider it as either \"Access\" or \"Internal Project.\" However, the ticket doesn't strictly relate to access rights, so it may lean more toward \"Miscellaneous\" due to its general nature. I\u2019ll decide on the best fit.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize an IT ticket about a leaver form, and \"HR Support\" seems to fit well since it relates to HR processes. The ticket mentions issues with leaver form links pointing to old ones, indicating there's a need to open an incident for updates. While \"Access\" might cover link issues, it's usually for user access rights. So, I\u2019m leaning towards classifying it as \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll finalize it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI need to format my output as a JSON object based on the system instructions. The schema specifies a \"category\" field, and the allowed values include \"HR Support,\" which is the best fit for the ticket. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll construct the output as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} without any extra quotes or text. It's essential to stick to just this information because the instructions emphasize providing the category only. I've double-checked the capitalization and spacing to ensure accuracy."
