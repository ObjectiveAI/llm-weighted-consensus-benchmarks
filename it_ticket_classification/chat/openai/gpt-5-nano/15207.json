Given this context, it appears best suited for the \"HR Support\" category, as it involves HR-related access to the timecard system.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe request seems to involve permission to delete timecards, and the user is asking, \"how proceed,\" which indicates they need steps to resolve their situation. The mention of a \"wrong option\" suggests they clicked something incorrect and need assistance with deletion, pointing towards HR-related access rights. Given that the issue centers around timecard management, I think the best fit for this ticket is \"HR Support,\" as it relates to HR and payroll processes.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
