The text is quite messy and mentions \"sow panel\" repeatedly, possibly referring to a \"Statement of Work\" panel or \"SOW approval panel.\" There's also talk of contracts, approvals, and upcoming holidays. The ticket needs careful reading to identify the right category based on the context provided.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI need to determine where this ticket fits within the categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It appears to be related to contracts and SOW approvals, so I wonder if it should go under \"Purchase\" or \"Internal Project.\" \"Administrative rights\" doesn't seem fitting. Considering it mentions upcoming holidays and locations, it leans more towards project management. So, \"Internal Project\" could be the best category to use here.**Determining JSON format**\n\nThe categories include \"Purchase,\" and since the ticket seems related to SOW (Statement of Work) which is part of a procurement process, it makes sense to categorize it as \"Purchase.\" I need to format my response as a JSON object with the required structure, which includes a type and properties. I\u2019ll ensure I\u2019m sticking exactly to the specified schema to respond properly. I\u2019ll output it like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Let's go with that!"
