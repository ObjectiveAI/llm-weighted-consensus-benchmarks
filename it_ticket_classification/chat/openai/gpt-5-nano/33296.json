It seems likely to fall under the Access category since it involves needing a password and connection details. I'll consider phrases like \"need password\" and \"authentication\" to support that classification.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at access credentials and authentication here, so I\u2019d categorize this ticket as Access. Although there\u2019s a mention of \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d it seems they primarily need a password for connecting to a mobile app. Since the user asks me to categorize the IT ticket, I\u2019ll respond with a structured JSON format, ensuring it has the category object with the property \u201ccategory\u201d set to \u201cAccess.\u201d I\u2019ll keep it straightforward without extra commentary."
