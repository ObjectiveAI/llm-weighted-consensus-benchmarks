Phrases like \"copy users directory\" and \"ad questions\" suggest it's an access-related task. This seems more about administrative rights since it involves managing user accounts. So, I think the best categories would be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" focusing on the internal process of adding users to Active Directory effectively.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI'm considering that \"Access\" is likely the primary category for this ticket. However, there's also \"Administrative rights,\" which specifically relates to admin tasks. Since the ticket is about copying users into Active Directory, which requires administrative rights, I should lean toward \"Access\" primarily because it's about provisioning access. The text is a bit jumbled, but the core request is clear. So, I'll provide the category in JSON format as requested.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
