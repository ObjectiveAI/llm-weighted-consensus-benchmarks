The phrase \"need more space\" points towards storage, suggesting they might be requesting more storage space. The other parts of the message don't clarify their intent too much. I could also see how \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" could be relevant, but it looks like \"Storage\" fits best. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and assign \"Storage\" as the category needed.**Producing JSON Response**\n\nI think the agent should respond by providing a simple JSON-like object. I'll create it as {\"category\":\"Storage\"} since that's the best fit for the ticket. The instructions suggest only categorizing the IT ticket, so I won't add extra explanations or text. I wonder if it might be helpful to ask clarifying questions, but it seems best to stick strictly to what\u2019s asked. So, let's keep it straightforward with just the category."
