It seems \"Access\" fits best, as it deals with managing user rights and permissions. However, I'm also considering \"Administrative rights\" since it relates to system access management. I'll have to weigh those options carefully.**Determining category for audit**\n\nI'm thinking about the focus here\u2014it's primarily on deactivating accounts and managing licenses, which leans more toward access control than administrative rights. The \"Administrative rights\" category relates to granting or revoking admin privileges, but this ticket really centers on user audits and cleanup. Therefore, \"Access\" is the best choice. \n\nI need to respond with a JSON object formatted correctly:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThe schema specifies a category string enum, so this output aligns perfectly.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
