The text has a bit of mixed language, possibly Romanian, which adds some confusion. However, it seems clear that this is about access to specific roles. Since it involves enabling roles, the most appropriate category would be \"Access,\" though \"Administrative rights\" might also fit. I need to decide between those two!**Determining the Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket seems to be primarily about granting roles to users, which aligns best with the \"Access\" category. While \"Administrative rights\" could be considered, it's more about elevated privileges rather than just access to roles like \"buyer\" and \"preparer.\" Since the user specifically asked about enabling these roles for managers, I think \"Access\" is the way to go. Now, I\u2019ll prepare to output the JSON format as instructed, so it will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
