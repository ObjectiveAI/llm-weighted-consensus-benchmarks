If it\u2019s really about creating a new PM for July, that gets tricky. Typical IT ticket categories include Hardware, HR Support, and Access among others. I think my best guess would be \"Internal Project,\" but I should seek clarification from the user for confirmation and recommended fields for future use.**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm deciding to categorize the ticket as \"Internal Project.\" It references creating a new \"July PM,\" which likely links to project management for July. If they truly meant \"Access,\" we can adjust later after getting clarification. So, I'll propose \"Internal Project\" and explain my reasoning: it seems to relate to creating something for a project. To help them further, I\u2019ll ask if they are provisioning a user, creating a project, or granting permissions. Lastly, I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object, as required.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
