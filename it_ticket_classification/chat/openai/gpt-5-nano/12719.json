It mentions an \u201capprover code\u201d and \u201cattached form,\u201d which suggests it\u2019s related to an internal project, possibly involving approval processes. While it could hint at \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d it feels more fitting for the \u201cInternal Project\u201d category since it\u2019s primarily about creating a project code and obtaining necessary approvals. Let\u2019s go with that!**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket. It references an \u201capprover code\u201d and mentions attaching a form, which leans towards \u201cInternal Project\u201d since it\u2019s about creating project codes. Although it could fit into \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d if there were specific access requests, the focus here is on project management. Since its primary purpose seems to be related to project code creation, I\u2019ll categorize it as \u201cInternal Project.\u201d Now, let\u2019s format the response in JSON, including a brief justification.**Formatting IT Ticket Response**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize the IT ticket, so I think I should focus on providing just the category in the requested JSON format. While the instructions don\u2019t explicitly state that I need to wrap my response in JSON, the schema suggests this is the way to go. I\u2019ll go ahead and respond with the category only, so here\u2019s the output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nI could give reasoning, but keeping it concise seems best according to the instruction.
