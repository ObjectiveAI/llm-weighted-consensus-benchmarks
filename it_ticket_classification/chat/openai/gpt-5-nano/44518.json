It seems to be a software-related issue, specifically with the Maven setup or path. The user indicates that this is a high-priority request since the final build is due today. Looking at the provided categories, this ticket likely falls under \"Internal Project,\" as it relates to configuring software in a development environment.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m noticing there isn\u2019t a specific category for \"Software\" or \"Development,\" but the closest fit seems to be \"Internal Project,\" since it relates to a build for a project. While \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if they need permission to install Maven, it looks more like a project environment issue. I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project\" and make sure to output the JSON correctly formatted, like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Confirming IT ticket category**\n\nI think \"Internal Project\" is the most precise category here. The user mentions a \"final build\" due today, linking it to an internal project. The issue with \"maven not found\" relates to the software environment, although it could be \"Access\" if there are permissions issues. However, it seems more related to build infrastructure. Therefore, I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" and respond with the required JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
