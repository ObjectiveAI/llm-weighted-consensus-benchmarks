I'm noting phrases like \"new purchase PO\" and \"log installation.\" This hints that it relates to hardware, since it's about a ceiling mount for a TV. I\u2019m considering the categories available: \"Purchase\" and \"Hardware.\" Since both seem relevant, I think the \"Purchase\" category might be the most appropriate choice here.**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI see there's a clear \"Purchase\" category that fits the user's ticket about a new purchase order. The ticket mentions \"new purchase po\" and the installation of TV ceiling supports, indicating that they want to log installation. I doubt it would fall under \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it clearly relates to hardware and the purchasing process, I think \"Purchase\" is the best fit here. I should present my answer in JSON format for clarity.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nThe system indicates I need to return a JSON object with a category field. The instructions specify that I should provide a category string based on the available categories. Here, the most fitting option is \"Purchase.\" \n\nI should focus on providing a concise response with no extra text, just the required JSON. So my final answer will simply be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. That clearly follows the user's request to categorize the IT ticket."
