It looks a bit jumbled, but key phrases stand out: \"critical alert,\" \"status active,\" and \"operation failed.\" This suggests a problem with a data source operation, possibly related to backup points. The phrase about \"last recovery points created\" and \"operation failed for because data source available\" indicates that the failure might be due to the data source being available, but I\u2019m still figuring it out.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket into one of these categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. The ticket mentions critical alerts, data sources, recovery points, and failed operations. This strongly suggests it belongs in the \"Storage\" category due to the references to recovery points. Although it could be considered \"Miscellaneous\" or even \"Hardware\" if it involves a computer issue, \"Storage\" feels more accurate. So I'll respond with a JSON-like structure indicating this.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
