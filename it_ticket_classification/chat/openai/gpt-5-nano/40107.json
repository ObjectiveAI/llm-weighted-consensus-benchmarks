The possible categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context, this ticket could fit best into \"Storage\" or \"Access,\" considering the critical nature of the issue and that it involves file uploads. \"Miscellaneous\" might also work, but I think \"Storage\" is more fitting here.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the ticket based on the issue described. \"Storage\" seems like the right choice since it is about uploading files. However, \"Access\" could also be relevant if permissions are an issue, but there\u2019s no mention of that. Given the details, I'll categorize it as \"Storage\" and justify that it affects file handling. I\u2019ll format my response in a JSON-like object to meet the requirements, making sure to include only the necessary category field.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
