I might lean toward categories like \"Access,\" related to access control, or \"Administrative rights\" if it pertains to admin privileges. It\u2019s a bit tricky with the wording!**Categorizing security requests**\n\nThis user's request is about blocking domains, which relates to security or network policies. While there's no specific \"Security\" category, \"Access\" fits since it involves permissions and blocking access. The mention of \"please add blacklist gob\" suggests they might be referring to a domain, possibly something like gob.com. Given the context, I think categorizing it as \"Access\" is best. I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Formatting the response**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to respond with a category in a specific JSON format. The schema requires the category field to be a string from a predefined set. Since the user asked to categorize the IT ticket, I\u2019ll focus on giving just the necessary JSON object. Based on the context, I will output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll avoid any extra commentary to stick to the request."
