The options for categorization include options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context around reseller programs and orders, \"Purchase\" seems like the best fit. However, it might also relate to \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll confirm the most appropriate category.**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe content focuses on reseller business and procurement, and I need to categorize it for ticket routing. \"Purchase\" seems like the best fit due to topics covered like orders, licenses, discounts, and reseller programs. While \"Internal Project\" could be a consideration because of the merger between brands like Avast and AVG, it's more about collaboration than an internal project. Therefore, I'll confirm the category as \"Purchase\" and respond with the JSON object: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
