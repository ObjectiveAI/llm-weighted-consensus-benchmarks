It seems to center on hardware, specifically the mouse replacement process. It could fit under \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase\" since it hints at obtaining a new mouse. I'll likely categorize it as \"Hardware\" based on the context of hardware replacement.**Categorizing IT Ticket in JSON**\n\nThe text mentions \"new mouse for laptop resolved,\" which indicates that the issue was addressed. It includes details about sending and receiving a new mouse after returning a faulty one, confirming it\u2019s a hardware replacement. So, categorizing it as \"Hardware\" seems correct. I need to respond with a JSON object, just like the prompt outlines. The final output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} with no additional commentary since that\u2019s what the user requested. Let\u2019s go ahead and do that!**Finalizing Hardware Category**\n\nThe input mentions \"new mouse for laptop resolved,\" which clearly indicates that the issue was dealt with. Therefore, the appropriate category for this is \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll go ahead and deliver that response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This keeps it straightforward and follows the request perfectly. Now, I\u2019m ready to send that!"
