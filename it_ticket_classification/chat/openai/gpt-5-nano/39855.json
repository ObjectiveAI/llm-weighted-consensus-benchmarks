The ticket mentions issues related to \"oracle fusion notifications\" and unsolved tasks. It seems like they want to define how these tasks interact with completed ones. I have a list of categories to choose from: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Now I just need to pick the category that fits best!**Categorizing an IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket revolves around Oracle Fusion notifications and updating task counts, which makes it an IT-related issue concerning software rather than hardware. Unfortunately, the available categories don't include \"Software\" or \"Applications.\" The closest options seem to be \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since this is not strictly about access or rights and more of a software issue, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit for this ticket!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
