I considered if it might fit under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" but it doesn\u2019t. It doesn't belong in \"HR Support,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Storage.\" So, it's best to classify it as \"Purchase\" because \"PO invoice\" points to that choice. I'll output the JSON object correctly: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Outputting the category**\n\nI see that the schema at the top indicates a JSON format, but it seems like the typical response should just be a category string. Still, the instructions state that the response needs to adhere to the enumerated categories. To keep things consistent with similar tasks, I believe I should respond with: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to output just that JSON object without any extra text. Let's go ahead and do that!"
