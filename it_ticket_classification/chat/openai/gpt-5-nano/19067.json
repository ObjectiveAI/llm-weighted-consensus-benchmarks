It mentions an access request for a library and write permissions, which is essential context. Notably, it discusses central storage and collaboration too. Based on the provided categories, this seems to fall under \"Access\" since it's primarily about getting access rights to that library. Keeping things neat helps me provide clear information to the team later. Let's confirm this categorization.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI need to determine whether to classify the ticket under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The text suggests it's related to permissions, mentioning \"write permissions.\" Since the user explicitly notes \"access request,\" it leans towards \"Access.\" However, granting write permissions can indicate elevated privileges, which relates to \"Administrative rights.\"\n\nAfter considering all this, I think \"Access\" fits best. So, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This should comply with the required formatting!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
