The ticket mentions various elements related to maternity and paternity leave, access card disabling, and HR forms. \n\nIt seems like it's primarily about managing access due to maternity/paternity leave. So, I\u2019m leaning towards the \"Access\" category. However, it could also fit under \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it discusses disabling an access card, \"Access\" feels like the best choice. Let's categorize it!**Creating JSON response**\n\nI need to craft a JSON-like object to categorize an IT ticket. The system specifies a \"category\" with a type object containing a string enum. Based on the content, I'll output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nAlthough it includes nuances related to HR processes, since this is about an IT ticket for disabling an access card due to maternity leave, I believe \"Access\" is the appropriate category. I'll ensure that my response is concise and just includes the JSON object, without any extra text."
