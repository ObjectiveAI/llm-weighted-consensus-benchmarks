The ticket mentions a new starter, requesting help with a starter form and advice about work location. It seems to fit into \"HR Support\" since this is about employee onboarding. However, I wonder if \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" would also work, especially if the new employee requires system access. Still, \"HR Support\" feels like the best category overall.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe request states, \"please help by filling out starter form please advise about work location.\" It could relate to remote or office location access, but I can't assume. I need to categorize this ticket among options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" etc. Since it\u2019s about onboarding, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit. I plan to respond in the required JSON format, outputting just: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Delivering JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m focused on delivering just the JSON object as a response. The ticket mentions a \"new starter\" needing help with a starter form and advice about work location. This suggests it fits best in the \"HR Support\" category, although \"Access\" could also apply since it might concern resources. However, considering the available categories, \"HR Support\" is definitely the most appropriate choice. So, I'll respond succinctly with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
