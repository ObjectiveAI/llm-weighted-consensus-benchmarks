It mentions \"new purchases\" and \"subscription contract,\" as well as \"tempered glass\" accessories and \"installation logs.\" There's also a lot of admin-related jargon, like references to receipts and phone communications. Since the ticket mostly revolves around purchases and needs, I should likely put it under the \"Purchase\" category. I want to make sure I categorize it accurately!**Formatting JSON for Ticket**\n\nThe ticket seems to be about purchasing, installation, and receipts for devices or accessories, so the most fitting category is \"Purchase.\" I need to format this in JSON, specifically as a type object with a category field noting \"Purchase.\" The system requires a specific schema, which I should follow closely. So, it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll make sure no extra text is added and just present the JSON object correctly!"
