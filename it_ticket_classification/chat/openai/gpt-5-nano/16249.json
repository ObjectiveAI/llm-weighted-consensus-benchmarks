I think we should categorize this as \"Access\" since it relates to access control and badge credentials. While \"HR Support\" could apply for personal data changes, it feels more appropriate to use \"Access\" here given the focus on the access card. I'll make sure to respond with the JSON category object accordingly!**Formatting response as JSON**\n\nI'm looking at how to respond with the correct format for the user, who asked me to categorize an IT ticket. The response needs to be in JSON format, with the structure outlined in the provided instructions. It clearly indicates to categorize it under \"Access,\" as that fits best. While I considered if \"Hardware\" might apply since it mentions a card, \"Access\" is more relevant to the name change request. I\u2019ll ensure my output is just the JSON format with the category."
