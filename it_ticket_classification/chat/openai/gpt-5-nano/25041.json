My goal is to sort it into one of these categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. I need to closely analyze the text to determine what the specific issue is and find the right fit for that category. Let\u2019s figure this out together!**Analyzing access request**\n\nThe message seems quite jumbled, but it looks like it\u2019s focused on an access issue. Key phrases include \"added approver,\" \"please log,\" \"add member,\" and \"approve.\" There's also mention of training, which suggests importance for getting things done. I\u2019m thinking this likely falls into the \"Access\" category. The mention of \"bypass\" might hint at needing a bypass account or something similar. I\u2019ll need to clarify these points for a precise categorization!{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
