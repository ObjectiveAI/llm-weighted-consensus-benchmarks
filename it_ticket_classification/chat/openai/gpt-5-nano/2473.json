The possible categories from the list include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Since the ticket relates to accessing signatures, it seems to fit best under \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" It looks like it\u2019s about accessing a feature related to signatures.**Categorizing access requests**\n\nWhen someone wants access to signature capabilities, they definitely need the right permissions. The phrase could indicate two requests: one for accessing a signature feature, likely for signing documents, and the other related to approving or declining signature requests, which generally falls under workflow approvals. In this case, since the user asked for a category, it seems that \"Access\" is the best fit based on their main action of wanting access to signatures. I'll categorize it as \"Access.\"**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI should respond in the correct JSON format for the category. The user specifically asked to categorize the IT ticket, so I'll format it as a JSON object with a \"category\" property. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to make sure the casing is precise, exactly as it appears in the list. Since they used \"Access\" in their query, that's the category I'm using. I'll keep it straightforward, without any extra text."
