Given it focuses on approving tasks and requisitions, \"Purchase\" seems like the best category. However, \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access\" could possibly fit too, but I think \"Purchase\" is the most suitable.**Responding with JSON**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that categorizes the IT ticket. The category field will be set to \"Purchase,\" following the required format for the system. So, I\u2019ll create a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. \n\nIt's essential not to include any extra text or commentary. While the schema is defined with additional properties, the task seems to require just the category value in my response. Therefore, I will output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
