It mentions managers being notified if submissions aren't done by Wednesday, indicating it relates to administrative procedures. The user wants a category, and I can choose from options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and so on. It seems the closest categories are \"Administrative rights,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll make a decision!**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions a \"weekly basis\" and notes about time submissions needing approval. This points to an HR-related issue, possibly concerning missing time reporting and process compliance. Based on the provided categories, \"HR Support\" appears to be the most suitable choice since it covers timesheets and approval workflows. Despite no direct IT or hardware relevance, HR Support would be general practice for such inquiries. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the selected category.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
