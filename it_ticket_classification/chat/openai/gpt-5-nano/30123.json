I need to categorize it properly into one of the specified categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the content, I think it best fits under \"Access\" due to the request for folder access. I'll respond with a JSON object: { \"category\": \"Access\" }.**Parsing the IT Ticket**\n\nI need to sort through the user\u2019s messy ticket about accessing a \"kick off\" folder for Tuesday PM. They're asking to \"fix quickly\" and refer to \"storage\" and \"subfolders,\" which likely indicates issues with files. The main theme is about needing access to this folder, so the best category seems to be \"Access.\" It could also fit \"Storage,\" but given the focus on access, I'll categorize this IT ticket as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
