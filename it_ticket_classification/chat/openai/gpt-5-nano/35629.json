However, there\u2019s also a mention of ordering toner, which could fit into the Purchase category. Since the ticket emphasizes investigating the situation and notification processes, I think it mainly falls under Hardware.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI need to classify the IT ticket based on given categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. The ticket is about toner replacement, which is definitely hardware-related.
