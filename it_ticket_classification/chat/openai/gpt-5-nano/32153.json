It seems connected to software, and I'm considering categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Access.\" It doesn't seem to fit \"Hardware.\" I think it might be best to classify it as \"Internal Project\" since the user might be asking for help with internal hosting for that app on Android.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m weighing the category options for the IT ticket, and it looks like \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" fits best. It\u2019s definitely not about access rights, hardware, storage, or purchase, and it doesn\u2019t involve HR support. The phrase \"provide steps host code\" seems to hint at deployment steps, so \"Internal Project\" is likely the right fit since it's about internal development tasks. If I'm unsure, I might default to \"Miscellaneous,\" but I'll go with \"Internal Project\" for clarity. I'll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
