The user's message is quite messy, mentioning a missing leaver form and a request for confirmation of the leave date. Looking at the categories provided, it feels like \"HR Support\" is the best fit since this is directly related to HR processes. I\u2019ll go with that for categorization!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket is about a \"leaver form,\" which likely means an employee is exiting, and it's tied to HR processes. The user wants to categorize this IT ticket, and I see \"HR Support\" is explicitly listed as a category. That feels appropriate given the context. I briefly considered \"Access,\" but there's no mention of access deactivation. So, I confirm that \"HR Support\" is indeed the best fit for this ticket!**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that follows the specified \"category\" schema. The instruction is to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" and then I should simply provide the category in the JSON format. Given that the category is \"HR Support,\" I\u2019ll format it like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll deliver that without any extra explanation since the desired verbosity is low. Let's get this done!"
