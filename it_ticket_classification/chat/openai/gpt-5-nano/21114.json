I'll respond strictly in the required JSON format, focusing on the category schema provided. The instruction clearly states to output just a JSON object like {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, without additional text. I'm also considering if \"Internal Project\" might work, but it seems less fitting. The main focus here is on server decommissioning tasks and associated duplicates.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to classify this as \"Internal Project\" since it involves project management tasks. However, since the focus is on \"server decommissioning,\" which is hardware-related, I think the category should definitely be \"Hardware.\" The decommissioning procedure is more about the process but falls under the hardware lifecycle. So ultimately, I\u2019ll go with the safe option: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Time to deliver this!"
