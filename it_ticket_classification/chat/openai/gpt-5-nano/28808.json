The categories I can choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nGiven that it\u2019s clearly about a purchase order for hardware, I plan to classify this ticket under \"Hardware\" and will format it as a JSON object with the appropriate category.**Determining the right category**\n\nIt looks like this ticket is connected to a hardware purchase\u2014specifically a mouse\u2014and also involves logging the installation and receipts. I\u2019m trying to decide between categorizing it as \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" However, since the ticket emphasizes a new purchase order and mentions processing receipts, it would fit best under the \"Purchase\" category. \n\nThe user wants this task categorized, so I\u2019ll format my response as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}**Outputting the category**\n\nThe format I need to provide for the user requires only a JSON object. According to the system's schema, I\u2019ll output just the category without any extra commentary. So, I\u2019ll present it as an object containing \"category\" with the value \"Purchase.\" \n\nI\u2019ll stick to the instructions which clearly state to respond this way. Here\u2019s the final response:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
