It talks about terms like \"maternity leave card,\" \"maternity leaver form,\" and \"administration officer ext.\" Since this is clearly related to HR forms, the best fit seems to be \"HR Support.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could be considered, it's not about system access, so it doesn't apply here. I'll provide the answer in JSON format with \"HR Support\" as the category.**Responding with JSON**\n\nI need to provide a JSON response for the user's request to categorize an IT ticket. I\u2019ll structure the response as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It\u2019s essential to ensure that the string matches the enum exactly, which it does. While I could add a brief note, the instructions specify that the output must strictly be the category object. So, I\u2019ll keep it simple and respond solely with the JSON, without any extra explanations."
