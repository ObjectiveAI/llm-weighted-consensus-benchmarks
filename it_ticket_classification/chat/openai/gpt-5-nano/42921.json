The user mentioned an issue accessing a meeting on Google Meet, which hints at possible access problems. Among the categories listed, \"Access\" seems to be the most appropriate choice given the context. There\u2019s also mention of security concerns related to attempts at data theft, but the core issue remains the inability to access the meeting. Overall, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket under \"Access.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket Issue**\n\nI'm analyzing the provided IT ticket content, noting that it mentions various error messages and security concerns, like possible information theft and access issues. The issue is clearly about accessing a meeting, making \"Access\" the appropriate category. Although there are security elements, they're secondary to the access problem. I'll format my output as a JSON object to meet the specified schema. So, the final JSON will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
