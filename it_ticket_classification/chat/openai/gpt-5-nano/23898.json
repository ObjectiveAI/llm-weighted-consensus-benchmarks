The categories I have to work with include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket mentions a \"new starter\" and related forms, indicating it's likely about onboarding. I think \"HR Support\" seems most fitting for this ticket, as it deals with completing a new starter form, but it could also relate to \"Access\" if access provisioning is involved.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe text mentions \"new starter\" and requests to fill out a form, so this likely falls under \"HR Support,\" which is part of the available categories. Even though there\u2019s no specific category for \"Onboarding\" or \"HR,\" \"HR Support\" works well for this context. The request is clear, as it\u2019s about an updated starter form. I think it\u2019s best to categorize it as \"HR Support.\" Finally, I need to output this as a structured category object: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket carefully, with the allowed categories being \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the text clearly relates to a \"new starter\" and mentions an \"updated form,\" \"HR Support\" fits best. I'll respond with the exact JSON object format required: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It\u2019s important to provide this without extra commentary, and I've confirmed that it aligns perfectly with the allowed values."
