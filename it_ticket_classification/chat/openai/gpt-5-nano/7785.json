It's a bit messy, but phrases like \"report needed\" and \"employees discipline\" suggest it may pertain to HR. The text indicates something about HR disciplinary reports, particularly with \"importance high.\" Given the context, the most fitting category seems to be \"HR Support\", as it relates directly to employee matters, even though it falls under IT categories.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"report needed,\" which seems to relate to extracting employee discipline reports. This could potentially fit under \"Administrative rights\" if it\u2019s about report access, but I'm not entirely sure. \"Internal Project\" doesn't apply here, and \"Access\" might be relevant for getting reports, although there\u2019s no mention of logging in. \n\nSince \"Miscellaneous\" feels a bit too generic, I believe the best fit is \"HR Support\" due to its clear connection to employee discipline. I'll need to output the category in JSON format.**Formatting the response**\n\nThe system prompt is clear: I need to respond with just the category in the specified JSON format. The format should look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I have to avoid adding any extra explanations or details, just stick to the required output. So, I\u2019ll ensure that my final response consists solely of the category object, no frills, just the essentials. Let's go ahead and proceed with that!"
