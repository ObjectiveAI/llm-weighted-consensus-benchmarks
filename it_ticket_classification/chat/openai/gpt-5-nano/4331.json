The user mentions their computer has slowed down and daily tasks have become harder.\n\nWe'll need to choose from categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Given the description, it seems most fitting to categorize this under \"Hardware.\" \n\nFinally, I'll format the output as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Interpreting the IT ticket**\n\nI'm trying to understand the user's message about their Windows clean install. It sounds like they\u2019re reporting that after upgrading, their computer is running slower, making everyday tasks harder. They mention \"clean install\" multiple times, indicating it's crucial to their situation.\n\nSince the problem seems to be related to system performance, I\u2019m considering categories like Hardware and Administrative Rights. Ultimately, I believe the best fit is \"Hardware,\" as the slow performance signifies a potential issue with the hardware itself, rather than just software.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nLooking at the provided categories, \"Software\" isn't listed, which is a bit limiting. \"Hardware\" seems appropriate for addressing performance issues. The phrase \"windows clean install\" suggests it deals with OS reinstallation, so \"Hardware\" could serve as the default for PC-related matters. \n\n\"Storage\" pertains to disk issues, while categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" don\u2019t fit this case. Given everything, I'll choose \"Hardware\" as the best category, since it's truly about the machine's performance. \n\nSo, my output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
