The categories include \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" and others. Parsing the request shows it's asking for camera availability for remote presentations, suggesting it's primarily a hardware request. However, since it's also about procurement, it might fall under \u201cPurchase.\u201d I think I'll settle on \"Hardware\" since it's primarily about the webcam needed for this purpose.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the user's request for a webcam for remote presentations. The primary category to consider is \"Hardware,\" as it directly relates to a hardware device. Since the system expects the output in a JSON-like format, I'll ensure to structure it correctly with the required category from the provided list. It seems clear that \"Hardware\" is the right choice here for the ticket classification.**Formulating JSON response**\n\nI see that I need to follow a specific format for my response, which has to be in JSON. The schema suggests it should be structured like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Given that the request is indeed for a web camera, categorizing it as \"Hardware\" makes sense since it's asking for a device. There's a chance it could be \"Purchase,\" but \"Hardware\" feels safer here since it's primarily about the request for the webcam itself. I\u2019ll go with that.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
