Since the request clearly involves hardware changes, the most fitting category seems to be \"Hardware.\" Although \"Purchase\" could be considered since they might want to acquire new equipment, the ticket focuses on changing what's already in use. Administrative rights or access categories don't apply, so \u201cHardware\u201d is the best choice here.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Purchase\" since it could hint at replacing hardware. But \"Hardware\" seems to fit best, given the mention of a monitor and keyboard related to a height-adjustable requirement. This points to an ergonomic concern, but still, it\u2019s about hardware changes. So, I\u2019ll conclude to categorize it as \"Hardware\" and present the response in the required JSON format. Here it is: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
