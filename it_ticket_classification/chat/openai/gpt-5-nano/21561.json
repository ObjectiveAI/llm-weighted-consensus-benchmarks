However, it might also fit under \"Access\" since it could involve providing access for the new starter.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s message about \"help by filling out starter form\" suggests that IT may need to assist with onboarding tasks for a new employee. These tasks could fall under \"HR Support.\" Generally, related tasks like creating an email account would be categorized as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since the text specifically mentions \"starter form\" and doesn't detail access requests, the most appropriate category seems to be \"HR Support,\" despite the possibility of relating to \"Administrative rights.\" \"Internal Project\" doesn't fit here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI believe \"HR Support\" is the best category since this is about onboarding a new starter, which falls under HR's domain. While it's a bit unusual for an IT ticket, the helpdesk does include \"HR Support\" as an option. The message clearly relates to onboarding, making \"HR Support\" the right choice. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the required property, keeping it simple since the user just wants the category. Here we go!"
