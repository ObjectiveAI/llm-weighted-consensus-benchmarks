It makes sense to classify it under the \"Storage\" category, as it directly relates to tape backups. So, I'll categorize it as \"Storage\" and prepare to output it in JSON format.**Outputting JSON Format**\n\nThe prompt specifies that I need to provide a category in a JSON format with a certain structure. I see that the category for this IT ticket should be \"Storage.\" However, the provided schema indicates I should output a structured object. Since the instructions ask for the category alone, it seems I can just return {\"category\":\"Storage\"} without the full schema. I want to ensure I\u2019m clear and aligned with what is needed for this task!**Deciding on JSON Output**\n\nThe format requires that I output the category in a \"type object\" representation. While it might seem that I should provide a schema with {\"category\":\"Storage\"}, that feels like overcomplicating things. The instruction is clear: categorize this IT ticket. I\u2019ll just stick to the essential output. I\u2019m going to simplify it and confidently go with {\"category\":\"Storage\"} as the clean and direct response. That captures what\u2019s needed without adding unnecessary complexity!"
