It mentions things like \"new purchase,\" \"patch cord,\" and \"log installation.\" \n\nThis seems to fit into the \"Purchase\" category, since it's mainly about procuring patch cords. However, there's also a mention of \"log installation,\" which could suggest \"Internal Project\" or \"Hardware.\" Since the purpose here is just categorization, I'd lean towards \"Purchase\" for procurement requests.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe text has repetitive elements mentioning \"new purchase\" and \"purchase,\" indicating it's likely a request to log installation. It's possible that \"log installation\" connects to \"Internal Project,\" but the focus seems more on purchasing patch cords. I think it\u2019s best to categorize this as \"Purchase\" because of the emphasis on the purchase order language. I should reply with a response in the required JSON format. Although \"Hardware\" could fit too, \"Purchase\" feels more appropriate here."
