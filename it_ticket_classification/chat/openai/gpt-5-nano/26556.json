The ticket text is confusing, as it repeatedly mentions \"card\" and \"pm\" alongside months and \"internship.\" It might relate to card access or credentials, possibly fitting in the \"Access\" category. There's also a chance it could tie to \"Hardware\" if it's about a card reader. However, since \"internship\" is mentioned, I wonder if it relates to \"HR Support,\" but overall, it's tricky!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe content reads, \"card de wednesday november pm re card card internship card october pm card card card.\" It's a bit mixed, and I wonder if it\u2019s in Spanish or French. Given the frequent mention of \"card,\" categorizing it as \"Access\" seems most appropriate since it likely relates to badge access. I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"} while ensuring it matches the specified categories precisely and keeping it concise without any extra text."
