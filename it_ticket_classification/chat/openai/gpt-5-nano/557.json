The ticket text is quite garbled, but it seems the user is requesting to create work location abilities in Seattle, Washington. This likely relates to \"Access\" or possibly \"Administrative rights,\" so I'll go with that classification.**Evaluating categories for IT ticket**\n\nIt seems the ticket is about adding a location, possibly falling under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project.\" The request to \"create work location\" suggests an administrative change in the system. It could relate to granting someone rights associated with this new location. \"Work location addition\" implies setting up a new location in the system, which leans toward \"Administrative rights.\" However, it could also fit \"Internal Project\" if that\u2019s the context. Still, I think \"Administrative rights\" is the closest match.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket isn't related to hardware, storage, or purchasing. While \"HR Support\" could seem relevant since it involves adding a work location, this is primarily an IT ticket. The request for \"create work location ability hire Seattle Washington\" suggests it's about granting access or permissions. Given that it requires administrative oversight, \"Administrative rights\" fits best. I'll respond with the category in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. Let's finalize that!"
