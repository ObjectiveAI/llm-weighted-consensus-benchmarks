It mentions \"not working,\" and seems to express urgency about access issues. It sounds like there were problems in the past, and now the user needs help quickly. Given these details, it seems most appropriate to fit this ticket into the \"Access\" category. That way, I can address the issue properly and ensure the user gets the assistance they need!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe text indicates the user is \"unable to use\" something and mentions a \"blocker,\" suggesting access issues, possibly a login problem. While \"Administrative rights\" might be relevant, it\u2019s not explicitly mentioned. The repeated requests to resolve the problem and join client calls imply urgency. Considering all this, I think the best category for this ticket is \"Access.\" It directly relates to their need for system access to facilitate their work.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
