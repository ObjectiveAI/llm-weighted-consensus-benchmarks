The ticket mentions they are experiencing an error with creating an expense items spreadsheet and need urgent help to restore it. Given the categories, it might be related to \"Access\" if the issue is about permissions. \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, but \"Access\" seems like the best fit since it suggests they're unable to create or edit the spreadsheet.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe user mentions needing a file restored urgently, which makes me consider if it's about storage. Since it's specifically about a spreadsheet, I wonder if \"Storage\" could apply if they can't find the file. However, if they lack the rights to create or access the file, \"Administrative rights\" might work too, but they haven't explicitly mentioned permissions. They might also fit into \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" It's essential to choose the category that best reflects their situation.**Categorizing IT ticket type**\n\nI need to think about how to categorize this IT ticket. The categories correspond to routing, with \"Access\" for login issues and \"Administrative rights\" for admin requests. The user mentions an \"expense items spreadsheet,\" which suggests a file stored somewhere, maybe in Google Drive or SharePoint. The mention of \"restore\" signals it's a file restoration issue typical of storage. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit if they needed permissions, I don\u2019t see that request. Therefore, I'll categorize it as \"Storage.\" If unsure, I might consider \"Miscellaneous.\"{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
