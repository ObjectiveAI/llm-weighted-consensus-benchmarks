This might link to procurement, and the mention of \"rejected sheet\" raises a few flags. However, it doesn\u2019t fit categories like hardware or access. I\u2019m leaning toward \"Purchase\" as the best category since it aligns with the procurement context.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI see there\u2019s also the \"Internal Project\" category, but the ticket mentions \"hello help find out rejected sheet thanks senior engineer.\" It seems to suggest a request for information about an RFI that got rejected. That doesn't fit \"Internal Project.\" \n\nThe best option appears to be \"Purchase,\" since it involves a request for information linked to a vendor quote sheet. Alternatively, \"Miscellaneous\" could be used, but given it's procurement-related, \"Purchase\" fits best. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
