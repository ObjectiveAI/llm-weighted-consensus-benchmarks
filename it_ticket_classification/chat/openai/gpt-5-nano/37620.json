I'll propose \"Storage\" since uploading files relates to that. Alternatively, \"Miscellaneous\" could work too because the information feels ambiguous. I need to ensure I follow the policies, and since they only want the category, I should provide a JSON-like object as the response. My final output will be a JSON object with \"category\": \"Storage\".**Categorizing File Upload Issues**\n\nI need to categorize the user's issue regarding a \"file uploading failure.\" It could relate to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but the text doesn't mention permissions, so it feels like \"Storage\" is more appropriate since it's about uploading files. I think I should confirm this with the user. The instructions specify that I should format the response as a JSON object, and the safest approach is to provide: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I won\u2019t add any extra text.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI see the instruction suggests avoiding heavily formatted elements, so it's best to keep it simple by providing just the JSON object. I'll go with: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. It seems clear and direct. I wonder if I should add a short note, but since the final answer must be the category, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and stick to just the JSON output. Alright, I\u2019m ready to proceed with that!"
