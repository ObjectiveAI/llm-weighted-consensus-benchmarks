The text mentions \"bidirectional access to resources,\" \"cal issues,\" and \"relocated tower.\" Based on these terms, it seems to touch on access control and potential hardware issues. However, since the ticket emphasizes access, I think \"Access\" is the best fit. Although \u201cHardware\u201d could also apply due to the relocated tower, prioritizing access aligns more closely with the primary intent of the request.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like this ticket focuses on access to resources, particularly with phrases like \"bidirectional access\" and \"calendar issues,\" which likely refer to a calendar extension. There's also a mention of \"host name file order,\" suggesting network access and configuration. The most suitable category seems to be \"Access,\" as it pertains to logging in and gaining access to resources. While \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant, it's not explicitly stated, so I'll go with \"Access\" for the category. I'll include a JSON response format too: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
