The user mentions issues like increasing space on a drive, having low disk space, and difficulties with volume management. The keywords suggest it\u2019s primarily about storage and partition management, so the most fitting category seems to be \"Storage.\" While \"Hardware\" might seem relevant, the focus is more on OS-level storage issues. I should respond with a structured JSON object for clarity.**Outputting JSON object**\n\nI need to provide a JSON object with the category field. The allowed categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the ticket relates to storage management, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I\u2019ll keep it simple and stick to the required format without extra text. Even though there\u2019s a mention of \"software tester,\" it still focuses on storage, so I\u2019ll just provide the JSON. Let's proceed!"
