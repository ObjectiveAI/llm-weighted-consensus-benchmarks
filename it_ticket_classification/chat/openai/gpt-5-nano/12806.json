It seems like \"Access\" would be the right choice since we need to disable systems for the employee leaving. This also aligns with de-provisioning and updating mobile device details. While \"HR Support\" sounds fitting because it's about an employee leaving, \"Access\" is the more specific category for this ticket. Let's go with \"Access.\"**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nI initially considered categories like \"Internal Project\" and \"Administrative rights,\" but those aren't quite right. Based on the task, \u201cAccess\u201d is the correct category. Now, I just need to format my response as a JSON object, as required by the prompt. It\u2019s clear that the response should be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I could add a brief note, but since the instructions specify to respond with just the category, I\u2019ll stick to that format. Let's finalize it!"
