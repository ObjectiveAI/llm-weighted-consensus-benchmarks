The ticket mentions various issues but seems quite garbled and unclear. It involves a request for assistance with approval problems related to employee information changes. I\u2019m trying to determine if this falls under \"HR Support\" due to the employee-related aspects or if it\u2019s more miscellaneous, considering the confusion. Overall, it\u2019s a tricky task to pinpoint!**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket content, which discusses issues like inability to approve requests and changes to employee information. Since it mentions these approval problems, it could relate to \"Access\" because it\u2019s about permissions. It also references \"Oracle,\" likely pointing to project management. I\u2019m weighing between the categories \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" since both could fit. Ultimately, the ticket seems to center on access control issues, so \"Access\" would likely be the best choice.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
