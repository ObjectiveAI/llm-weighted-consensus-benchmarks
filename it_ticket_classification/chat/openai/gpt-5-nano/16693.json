                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the user\u2019s provided sentence about changing PM for approvals on Wednesday. It\u2019s a bit messy, but it seems to involve changing the project manager or possibly the permission manager. The relevant categories are \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" but I'm feeling uncertain since the text isn't clear. I'll have to use my best judgment to decide which category fits best.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nIn this IT ticket, \"PM\" could refer to \"privilege manager,\" \"permission,\" or \"project manager.\" The mention of \"approvals\" suggests it relates to workflow approvals. It seems they want help changing the PM for approvals, which could fit under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" since it involves adjusting permissions. Given that \"approvals\" indicates workflow control, it's likely best categorized as \"Access\" for making those changes or \"Administrative rights\" for permission adjustments.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket, which requires a JSON-like output. The output format specifies that I need to choose one of the enumerated values for the category. Given the focus on changing PM for approvals, \"Access\" seems appropriate since it addresses who can approve things. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also fit, as it relates to changing permissions. Ultimately, I think \"Access\" is the best option because it encompasses the essence of the request.**Formatting the response**\n\nSince the ticket is about \"changing PM for approvals,\" it sounds like the user wants to modify access for approvals. I'll confidently choose \"Access\" as the category. So, the output should be formatted as a JSON-like object: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. I know from previous tasks that the instruction only requires the category string itself, not extra schema details. I\u2019ll ensure I provide a clean and concise response, just like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
