The mention of \"card suspended\" and \"status cards\" suggests it's primarily an access issue. However, since it also involves maternity leave, it could fit under \"HR Support.\" Given that it's about user access and card status, it seems most appropriate to categorize it under \"Access,\" though I should keep \"HR Support\" in mind as a possible alternative.**Formatting JSON Object**\n\nI've got the description highlighting the need to check the status of a card that\u2019s been suspended due to maternity leave. This clearly points toward categorizing it as \"Access\" since it relates to badge access. \n\nI need to format my response as a JSON object. The correct structure should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The guidance mentions needing a specific object format, but I think I can simplify it by providing the necessary category directly. I'll make sure it's clear and aligned with what\u2019s required.**Providing JSON Structure**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket, and the expected answer seems to be simply {\"category\":\"Access\"}. But just to be thorough, I want to ensure I'm following the required structure closely. The instructions emphasize that the full JSON format may be necessary, including both type and properties.\n\nSo, I'll stick to the essential content and deliver exactly the JSON without any additional text. I\u2019ll confirm the response as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s important to be precise!"
