I see \"HR Support\" in the category list, which fits since leaver forms are typically HR tasks. While \"Access\" also stands out \u2014 considering it relates to offboarding access \u2014 \"HR Support\" feels like the best fit overall. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"HR Support.\"**Creating JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m aiming to create a concise JSON object to categorize the ticket. The needed format shows that it should contain a \"category\" key, and the acceptable values include \"HR Support.\" Since I've determined that \"HR Support\" is the appropriate category, I'll format my response as {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. It\u2019s essential to keep it clean, with just this JSON and no additional text. I\u2019m ready to deliver!"
