It mentions various terms like \"AD rights\" and \"access,\" but ultimately, it fits best under the \"Access\" category since that's the main theme here. The user asked to categorize it, so I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object that labels it as \u201cAccess.\u201d \n\nI'll make sure the format is exact, so my response will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI'm pondering whether \"HR Support\" might be more suitable for this ticket since it involves a leaver and associated forms. However, the ticket's focus on de-provisioning and IT tasks suggests \"Access\" fits better, especially since it's an IT ticket. Given the terms like \"service now\" and \"leaver form,\" I've decided on \"Access\" as the category. \n\nNow I'll ensure the response is a JSON object, with no extra commentary:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
