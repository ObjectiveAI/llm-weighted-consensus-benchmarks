The user\u2019s text clearly mentions \"access control units,\" which indicates it's about access. Since it talks about an outage and involves hardware used for security, it seems that \"Access\" would be the most suitable choice. However, \"Hardware\" could also fit, considering those units are physical devices. Overall, \"Access\" seems to be the best category, specifically for access control issues.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket. Given the user's mention of \"access control units\" and \"log ticket assign his queue,\" it clearly relates to access control devices. This appears to involve a network or hardware issue due to the outage mentioned. The most fitting category is \"Access,\" as it's specifically about access control systems. Therefore, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"} following the correct format without any additional text.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
