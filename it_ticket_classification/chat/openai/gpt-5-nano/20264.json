The string mentions multiple aspects related to monitors, like \"monitors request steps,\" and includes phrases about ordering monitors with specific adjustments. This likely falls under the categories of Hardware or Purchase. I have to decide which category fits best. Given the focus on monitors and ordering, I think Hardware is the primary category here, but Purchase could also apply.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}**Analyzing ticket category**\n\nI need to check the nuances here. It could be categorized as \"Purchase\" since it\u2019s about ordering monitors. The ticket mentions things like \"add order monitors model\" and \"request steps,\" which sound like procedural guidance for procurement. It also includes details about \"monitors,\" suggesting that it\u2019s related to hardware specifications. However, since this ticket is focused on asking for steps to order monitors, the best fit for categorization seems to be \"Purchase.\"{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
