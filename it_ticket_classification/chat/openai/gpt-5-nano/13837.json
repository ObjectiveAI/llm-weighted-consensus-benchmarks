It seems focused on onboarding and possibly involves access or administrative rights. The user mentioned several keywords like \"new starter,\" \"joiner,\" and \"officer.\" I should likely categorize it under \"HR Support\" for onboarding or \"Access\" for new user setup. The IT ticket taxonomy has various categories to consider, so I'll ensure to pick the most relevant one based on the message details.**Classifying IT access request**\n\nIn the IT context, \"Access\" usually relates to account provisioning like email and VPN, while \"Administrative rights\" involves granting admin privileges. The message mentions a new starter in Belgrade, which strongly indicates it\u2019s about onboarding. Although it doesn't explicitly reference hardware or software, the presence of \"attached\" may suggest there are additional details included. Given the ticket's context, I should categorize it as \"Access\" since that better aligns with onboarding tasks like setting up user accounts.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nI need to respond to categorize the IT ticket in the specified JSON format. The instruction clearly states to categorize with an emphasis on presenting it as a JSON object. Based on my previous analysis, \u201cAccess\u201d is the most appropriate category for this ticket. So, I'll output exactly what\u2019s needed without any added text. It's straightforward, and here it goes:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
