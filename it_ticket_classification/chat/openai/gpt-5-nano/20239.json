Given that it refers to checking accounts and changing group memberships, the category seems to fit best as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll consider if these should be distinct categories or unified. Ultimately, it looks like it leans towards \"Access.\"**Deciding category for ticket**\n\nThe ticket is clearly about deactivating accounts for leavers and managing group memberships, so I\u2019m deciding on \"Access\" as the primary category. It seems more fitting since \"Administrative rights\" typically refers to granting or revoking admin privileges, while this ticket is specifically about access control for leavers. Since the core action involves disabling accounts too, I\u2019ll stick with \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format the response correctly as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
