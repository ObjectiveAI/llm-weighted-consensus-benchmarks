They used phrases like \"please upload\" and \"load survey,\" so it seems this involves some sort of data handling. I\u2019m considering options such as \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Access.\" However, without clearer context, \"Miscellaneous\" might be a safer choice to classify it. I need to make sure I'm choosing the most appropriate category.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this ticket based on the user\u2019s request about uploading a spreadsheet. It might fit under \"Internal Project\" if it's part of a project, but there's no clear mention of access or hardware. \"Administrative rights\" seems less likely since rights weren't specified. \"Storage\" could be suitable since it involves uploading a file. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as a fallback, but \"Storage\" feels like the best option since the user requested uploading a spreadsheet.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the instruction to \"load survey.\" It seems related to uploading a spreadsheet into a tool, which likely points to a file operation. While it might fit under \"Access,\" there\u2019s no mention of access rights, so that doesn't seem right. I'm leaning towards \"Storage\" since it directly relates to uploading a file. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object, specifying the category as \"Storage\" to keep it concise and to the point."
