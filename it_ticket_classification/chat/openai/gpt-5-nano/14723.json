The request to \"replace\" implies that there might be a device needing attention, especially since the user mentioned \"annual leave,\" suggesting they may be unavailable soon. So, my best guess is to categorize it as a hardware issue.**Evaluating Ticket Categories**\n\nI'm trying to determine the right category for the ticket. The mention of \"random noises\" suggests a hardware issue with the device, likely the Fuji one, which could be causing serious communication problems. HR Support, Access, and Internal Project categories don\u2019t apply here. While \"Purchase\" might fit because the user requests a replacement, it sounds more like a hardware issue causing the noise and disruption. So, my best guess is to categorize it under Hardware, since there seem to be issues with the device itself.**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nI think \"Fuji\" refers to a brand or name of a device, so categorizing it under \"Hardware\" seems appropriate. I need to prepare a clear response indicating this. The rationale is that the device is making random noises affecting communications, and the user is requesting a replacement due to an upcoming leave. To follow the instructions, I\u2019ll produce a JSON object with the category. So, the output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"} \n\nThis should match the required format without any extra text!"
