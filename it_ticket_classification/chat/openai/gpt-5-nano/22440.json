The user described issues with the submission process and included a picture regarding the status after submission. The allowed categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" This ticket doesn't clearly fit into any one category. I think the closest fit might be \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d or \u201cInternal Project,\u201d but I\u2019m uncertain.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket relates to an \"expense report\" in the Oracle application, but there\u2019s no specific \"Software\" category available. I\u2019m considering \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" since it might pertain to an internal application issue. \"Administrative rights\" may apply if submission permissions are denied, while \"Access\" could fit if there are login issues. The submission is stuck in \"progress,\" indicating a software bug. Given the context, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the best option since no direct software category is available.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user mentions \"oracle friday expense report,\" which could pertain to their Oracle ERP product. I need to categorize this IT ticket and it seems \"Internal Project\" is more for development issues. Since this is a software bug that doesn\u2019t clearly fit into other categories, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Miscellaneous.\" Alternatively, \"Access\" was an option if they couldn\u2019t submit, but they are just stuck. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" and prepare to output a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
