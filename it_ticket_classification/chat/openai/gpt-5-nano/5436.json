The request is unclear, but it includes phrases like \"received broken\" and \"second hand,\" which suggest it might pertain to hardware issues. Given the categories available \u2014 Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights \u2014 it seems best to classify this ticket under \"Hardware\" due to the context of a broken item.**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt looks like the user might be reporting a hardware issue since terms like \"received broken\" suggest a faulty device. The phrase \"second hand\" hints at it being a used device. Given the context, I think classifying this ticket as \"Hardware\" makes the most sense. While \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" might be considered, they seem less likely. I will respond with the JSON-like object confirming the category as follows: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
