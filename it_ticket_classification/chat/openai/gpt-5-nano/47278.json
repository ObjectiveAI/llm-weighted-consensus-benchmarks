It mentions screens restarting and requests advice. While it seems related to hardware since it involves the laptop and monitor, it\u2019s also software-related with the video driver. So, I'd lean towards \u201cHardware\u201d for the best fit.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI need to troubleshoot a video driver crash, which clearly falls under IT support. While \"Miscellaneous\" could apply to less formal issues, the best choice would be \"Hardware\" since it's related to the laptop and display. Categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights\" don\u2019t fit. Although video drivers are software, they\u2019re tied to hardware in this context, so \"Hardware\" works best. I should respond with a JSON object, like {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, to meet the requirement of the format specified.**Providing category JSON**\n\nI need to respond with the category name, but the system specifically expects a JSON format. Based on the prompt, it should be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll double-check the capitalization to ensure it matches the provided options. While including a brief note could be helpful, the directive asks for the category only. Since the user wants a clear categorization, I'll keep the response straightforward and just provide: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This aligns perfectly with the request!"
