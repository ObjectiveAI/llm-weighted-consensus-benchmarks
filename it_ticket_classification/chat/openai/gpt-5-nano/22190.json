The content discusses access requests, uploading links, and rights at a specific location. It appears quite garbled but suggests this is mainly about gaining access to profiles. Based on the context, I think the \"Access\" category is the most appropriate choice for this ticket. Let's go with that!**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering whether the ticket could also fall under \"Internal Project\" if it's related to a profile template. However, the main focus is on access rights, such as viewing profiles, uploading links, and assigning access. Therefore, I\u2019ve settled on the \"Access\" category. The system expects a JSON object, so I will respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Although the schema indicates a more complex structure, it seems they\u2019re primarily looking for that simple category string.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
