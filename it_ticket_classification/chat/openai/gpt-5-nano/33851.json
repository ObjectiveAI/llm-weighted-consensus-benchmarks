The user asked for categorization, and the text repeatedly mentions \"purchase,\" leading me to conclude that it fits best under the \"Purchase\" category. Although there are mentions of installation, they come after the purchase, confirming it's a purchase request. I'll respond with a JSON object for the category.**Creating JSON response**\n\nThe instruction outlines a specific \"category\" schema, and I need to output a JSON object that matches that format. Based on the messy content, the main focus is the \"purchase request,\" so I'll categorize it as \"Purchase.\" My response should be in the format: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. I need to focus on this structured response, avoiding any extraneous information. So I'll make sure my final answer is just that JSON. Let's go ahead and deliver that!"
