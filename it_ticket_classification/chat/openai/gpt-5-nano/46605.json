The terms \u201cAccess\u201d and \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d come to mind. The ticket mentions permissions, changes to access, and sensitive information, so I think \u201cAccess\u201d captures the primary issue well. While \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d might specify admin privileges, it seems like we\u2019re dealing with broader user access concerns due to permission misconfigurations. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
