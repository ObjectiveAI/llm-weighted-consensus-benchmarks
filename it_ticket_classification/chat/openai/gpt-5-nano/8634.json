It doesn\u2019t fit into categories like hardware, HR support, or purchases. \"Access\" seems relevant since it's about addresses, but they're not technically access rights. Maybe \"Miscellaneous\" could work as a catch-all since it's allowed as a category. If the user is looking for admin-level information on addresses, then \"Administrative rights\" might be appropriate. I should clarify what the user needs!**Categorizing Addresses in IT Tickets**\n\nIt seems the user is asking for office addresses, which is more of a facility or information request rather than an IT issue. However, in IT triage, \"Addresses\" could refer to \"Contact addresses\" or office addresses for VPNs or deployments. There isn\u2019t a specific \"Address\" category, and \"Administrative rights\" isn\u2019t applicable here. So, I think the best option is to categorize it as \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
