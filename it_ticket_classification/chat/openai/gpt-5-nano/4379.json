The keywords mention various aspects like forms, leave dates, mailbox access, and necessary approvals. \n\nLooking at the categories available, I think the best fits are HR Support for anything related to the leaver process and possibly Access for mailbox and systems rights. Storage could be relevant too, depending on the context. Let me finalize this decision!**Categorizing ticket as Access**\n\nI believe we should categorize this IT ticket as \"Access\" due to references to leaver forms, leave dates, AD rights, and mailbox access. The prompt clearly states that the output needs to be in a JSON format.\n\nI'll formulate the response as a JSON object containing the category field, ensuring not to include any extra text. The final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
