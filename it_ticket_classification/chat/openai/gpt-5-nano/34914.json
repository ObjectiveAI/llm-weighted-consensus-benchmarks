The ticket's message is a bit difficult to read but seems to focus on an \"offboarding form\" related to a leaver and some issues with submitting it. Since it relates to HR processes, it could fit under \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but I'm wondering if the system prefers a specific category. It's definitely a bit confusing!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket. I have to create a JSON object with a \"category\" field based on available categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. The ticket mentions a \"leaver form,\" possibly for offboarding, and some issues with submitting it after switching laptops. Since this relates to HR processes, I think it should be categorized as \"HR Support.\" I'll make sure I'm following the correct format for the JSON output!**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nIt seems there might be blockers preventing the submission of the offboarding form due to system issues, possibly related to access or permissions. The user is asking about the leaver form, which relates to the HR offboarding process. I think it should fall under \"HR Support\" since it's an HR-related task, but \"Access\" could work if the issue is about accessing the form portal. There's also a mention of switching laptops, which might complicate access. Ultimately, I feel \"HR Support\" is the best category.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
