The term \u201cstarter form\u201d hints at needing to grant access to systems, which could fall under \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" However, since \u201cnew starter\u201d relates directly to onboarding, I think the best fit is \"HR Support.\" That makes the classification feel clear!**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI'm considering if other categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous\" might fit, but those don't seem suitable. \"Access\" could work if it\u2019s about granting permissions, but it still feels more related to HR Support due to onboarding. The user asked to categorize this IT ticket, so I\u2019ll provide the response in the required JSON format. I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} as that best captures the intent without needing additional explanation.**Confirming category capitalization**\n\nI need to make sure I match the capitalization correctly for the category names from the enum: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" etc. The proper string for the category is \"HR Support\" with the uppercase H, R, and S. Since the user asked me to categorize this IT ticket, I\u2019ll keep my response minimal and just provide the necessary JSON output. So, I\u2019ll deliver: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Let's get this right!"
