The content mentions a \"new starter\" and an \"oracle re starter form,\" which suggests it relates to HR onboarding. It seems like \"HR Support\" could fit best. However, there's also mention of \"Access,\" possibly for the Oracle HR system, or \"Administrative rights\" for form filling. I'll weigh these categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It leans towards HR Support!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis ticket appears to focus on HR onboarding forms, and while \"HR Onboarding\" isn't a category, \"HR Support\" fits quite well. \"Access\" might concern system access, but it's primarily asking to fill out a form and note a date, making it more HR-related. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" The response should be a JSON object structured accordingly. So, I'll provide: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} without much further explanation since the instruction is clear!"
