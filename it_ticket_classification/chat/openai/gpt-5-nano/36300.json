The text describes an issue with a tape library, indicating a tape failure and needing access to monitoring tasks and alert details. \n\nIt seems this could fall into \"Storage\" since the tape library is a storage unit. However, it could also be considered \"Hardware\" because it's a hardware component. I think \"Storage\" might be the best fit since it specifically relates to storage issues.**Categorizing IT Issue**\n\nThe ticket description refers to a \"tape library\" and mentions reviewing alert details, indicating a potential storage hardware issue. My best guess is to categorize it as \"Storage\" since it focuses on storage devices. The mention of \"tape failed\" suggests a hardware failure, but considering the context, \"Storage\" seems more appropriate. I think it\u2019s about the tape and the library, so that specificity is key. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object indicating the category as \"Storage.\"**Returning JSON Object**\n\nI need to output a JSON-like object with the category field, which will be \"Storage.\" The instructions specify that I should respond with just that category in the required format. So I\u2019ll format it exactly as {\"category\":\"Storage\"} without any extra notes. \n\nI think that simplicity is key here, just delivering what's needed without adding anything unnecessary. Alright, let\u2019s go ahead and do that."
