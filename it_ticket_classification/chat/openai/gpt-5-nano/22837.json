They need a category from \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nGiven the content, it looks like they want to modify site links. That could point to \"Administrative rights,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or maybe \"Internal Project.\" I need to choose the best fit for this IT ticket categorization.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the potential categories for this IT ticket. \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Storage\" aren't relevant. \"Access\" could fit, as it might involve rights for editing links. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too generic, and \"Purchase\" isn't applicable. \"Internal Project\" could be a possibility, but the mention of \"administrative rights\" stands out.\n\nAs the user is asking about editing promoted links, it likely requires admin privileges. I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d since it directly involves who can modify those links.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI see that there's no explicit mention of rights in the request. The user asks more of a \"how-to\" about promoted links, which could suggest categories like \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" Since it involves editing site content, \"Internal Project\" might fit if it's about an internal site.\n\nHowever, typical ticket triage leads me to think this fits \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context, I believe \"Administrative rights\" is most appropriate. I\u2019ll present it as: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
