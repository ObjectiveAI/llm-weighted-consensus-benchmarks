The sentence suggests they're having trouble accessing a stable environment, possibly due to a proxy issue. Since they\u2019re mentioning a project, it could fit under \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cInternal Project.\u201d However, I\u2019m leaning towards \u201cAccess\u201d as the most relevant category for their issue with network access. It's best to keep it straightforward for clarity.**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nThe terms \"project\" and \"stable environment\" likely indicate an issue related to accessing the environment, possibly due to a proxy change. It makes sense to categorize this ticket as \"Access,\" since it centers around login or access issues. So, I\u2019m planning to respond with a JSON object formatted like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to stick to the required format without extra text, just delivering the JSON for clarity. Here it goes: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
