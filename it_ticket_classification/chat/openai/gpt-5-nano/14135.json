The user's request is about oracle time cards with approval needed and mentions card status. It seems like it could fit under \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"HR Support.\" I need to determine which category aligns best with the issues being reported.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the category options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The user\u2019s request is about time cards and needing approval. This leans more towards HR Support since they\u2019re asking for time card approval. While \"Access\" could be relevant if it\u2019s about permissions, the emphasis on approval definitely suggests it falls under HR Support. So, I\u2019ll categorize this IT ticket as HR Support.**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket provided by the user, focusing on time cards and payroll approvals related to an employee who has left. The user asked for the category in a JSON object format, specifically saying \"Categorize this IT Ticket.\" The correct response is to stick to the required format with no extra explanation beyond the necessary details. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond simply as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} to match the required schema, ensuring I use the exact capitalization. Let's go ahead with that."
