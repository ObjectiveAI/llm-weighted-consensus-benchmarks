The content mentions \"mail from library notification,\" which seems to indicate an issue with receiving too many notification emails, possibly spam. Based on the allowed categories, this issue could fit under \"Miscellaneous\" since it doesn\u2019t clearly match the others. The user is specifically asking for assistance with the email flood, so that's the direction I'll go in for categorization.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering categorizing the IT ticket issue, which is likely about excessive email notifications. Given the available categories, \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d seems to be the best fit since \"Email issues\" or \"Email notification flood\" aren\u2019t options. I\u2019ve ruled out \"Access,\" \"Hardware,\" and others. I'll respond with a JSON-like object that matches the required schema. The response will be {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I want to make sure it\u2019s concise and clear before delivering this.**Confirming IT ticket category**\n\nThe message from the IT ticket mentions \"library notification\" repeatedly, which makes it a bit unclear, but it clearly refers to an email flood. The phrase \"coming around per minute\" indicates there's a lot of notifications. Since it falls into a category that doesn't match the others available, it fits best under \"Miscellaneous.\" Therefore, I\u2019ll format the response as {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Now, I\u2019ll proceed with delivering this categorization."
