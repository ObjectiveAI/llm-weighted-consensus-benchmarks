It seems they\u2019re asking for assistance, possibly to create accounts or grant access. The content is a bit unclear, but since it involves administrative aspects, I think it fits best in the \"Access\" category. This categorization aligns with the user's intent and ensures proper handling of the request.**Categorizing IT ticket for onboarding**\n\nIt seems that the mention of \"new member\" likely indicates an onboarding request, which relates to either Access, HR, or Administrative rights. Typically, onboarding falls under \"Access\" for granting permissions to systems. The phrase \"please help write developer member\" is a bit ambiguous, but it leans toward needing access for the new member, especially in the context of Project Management. While \"Internal Project\" could fit if it\u2019s related to a specific PM project, I believe \"Access\" is the most appropriate category here.**Categorizing IT ticket for onboarding**\n\nThe phrase \"please help write developer member\" suggests they might want help drafting something, potentially indicating onboarding for a new member in the Project Management team. The text lacks punctuation, which adds to the confusion, but since it revolves around adding a new member, it seems best categorized under \"Access\" due to the need for access provisioning. I\u2019ll output the category in a JSON format as required, ensuring clarity for the ticket categorization.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
