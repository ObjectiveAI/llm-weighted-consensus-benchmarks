The ticket text suggests it's a request for a hardware quote related to TVs and stands. \"Purchase\" fits since they want a quote, but \"Hardware\" also applies. The mention of \"install\" makes me consider \"Internal Project\", but it seems more like procurement with installation details.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe best category for this ticket is \"Purchase\" since it's about getting quotes for hardware. \"Hardware\" could also apply, but the focus here is on purchasing equipment. The ticket's phrasing seems a bit messy, but it's clear they're requesting quotes for TVs and stands. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object that contains the \"category\" key set to \"Purchase\". The format to use is as follows:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nThis matches the required JSON schema."
