It seems to be related to HR processes, possibly around time reporting, but it might also touch on administrative rights. I\u2019ll carefully choose the best fitting category.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket doesn't specifically mention access to systems or hardware, but it does refer to \"Oracle,\" which is a system. The \"HR Support\" category feels most appropriate because the content focuses on time reporting, contracts, and related processes. While \"Administrative rights\" could relate to permissions needed for time reporting, it doesn't explicitly mention access rights. Given that the ticket discusses direct reports and submission approvals, I'll go with \"HR Support\" as the best fit.**Formatting Response in JSON**\n\nThe instruction asks for a category in a specific format, which is JSON with a type object and a property for the category string. I\u2019ll structure my response simply as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It seems clear that minimal explanation is needed here, so I won\u2019t add any extra text. I\u2019ll stick to just providing the object as requested. This should be straightforward!"
