They mentioned \"cord request\" which might refer to electrical cords or power cords. The details about \"multiple plugs located floor near kitchen\" make me think this could fit under \"Hardware.\" However, I'm not entirely sure without more clarification on what they mean by \"joiner.\" Overall, it sounds like a hardware request related to power supplies.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt seems the user's request is about hardware, particularly related to \"cord request\" and \"plugs\" near the kitchen. I'm considering if \"joiner\" refers to a \"jack\" or a \"power strip.\" Since the main focus is on cords and plugs, categorizing this under \"Hardware\" feels appropriate. While \"Access\" could apply if it involves permissions, it seems less likely. I think I'll prepare a JSON-like object with the category set as \"Hardware,\" since that aligns best with the user's message.**Finalizing category response**\n\nI\u2019ll respond with the category as JSON: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} since the user\u2019s message clearly indicates a request related to cords and plugs near the kitchen. Although there\u2019s a mention of \"joiner,\" which makes things a bit unclear, it still aligns best with hardware. It doesn't seem to fit as \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The instruction was to categorize the IT ticket, so I\u2019ll keep the output strictly focused on the category without additional notes.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nAccording to the prompt's format section, I need to return a JSON object that includes the specified category. Since I\u2019ve determined that the user\u2019s request falls under \"Hardware,\" the required response will simply be {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I won\u2019t add any extra text or information beyond that. I believe this aligns perfectly with the instructions, so I\u2019ll go ahead and respond accordingly with that specific JSON format."
