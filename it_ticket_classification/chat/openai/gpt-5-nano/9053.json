Their text mentions issues with the keyboard, such as letters not working and evidence of it being detached. This definitely points to a \"Hardware\" issue, so that's likely the best category. I could consider \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Hardware\" fits better since it's specifically about the keyboard. I'll format the final output as a JSON-like object with the appropriate category.**Outputting category as JSON**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the instruction to provide a JSON object for the category. It specifies that I should choose from the given options. Based on the user's text regarding laptop keyboard problems, it seems clear the issue is related to hardware. Even with references to a detached keyboard, the root issue still points to hardware. Therefore, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I need to make sure I follow the instruction precisely!"
