The user mentions that an auditor wants to monitor these sensors and provide a report by tomorrow morning. It seems like it's related to hardware since sensors are involved. However, it could also fall under Internal Project if monitoring is part of a bigger project. Administrative rights and Access don\u2019t seem relevant here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket based on the user\u2019s input. It seems the ticket revolves around monitoring sensors, which implies a focus on hardware. While it might be an internal project with the sensor implementation, I feel the hardware aspect fits best. Since I need to respond in JSON format, the final output for this categorization will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That seems clear and aligned with what the user needs!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
