The ticket mentions card verification for a newcomer employee, which sounds related to access control. There's a reference to an officer on annual leave, which suggests this is about tasks regarding verification. It seems like the best fit for this would be the \"Access\" category, as it focuses on access control for the newcomer\u2019s ID card verification.**Finalizing category for IT ticket**\n\nI need to decide on the best category for this IT ticket. It seems that \u201cAccess\u201d fits best since it deals with card verification and the process for a newcomer employee. Although \u201cHR Support\u201d was a consideration, it\u2019s not strictly about onboarding or administrative rights. Since they want to know who to contact for verification tasks due to someone being on leave, I believe the appropriate output is a JSON object with the category set to \u201cAccess.\u201d{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
