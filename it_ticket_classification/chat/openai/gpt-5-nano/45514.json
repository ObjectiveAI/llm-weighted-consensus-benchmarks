The categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The text mentions being unable to close changes, possibly pointing towards \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It seems \"Snow\" could refer to ServiceNow, implying these changes might relate to Change Management tickets. I'll sort it into the appropriate category based on this understanding.**Classifying the ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking to categorize an IT ticket related to closing changes in Snow, probably referring to ServiceNow. The message includes terms like \"fault,\" \"log,\" and \"advise,\" suggesting a Change Management issue. However, the categories I have are Internal Project, Administrative rights, Access, Hardware, Storage, Purchase, Miscellaneous, and HR Support. Based on the context, \"Access\" seems fitting if it's about permissions, but \"Administrative rights\" also seems relevant for issues with required permissions in Snow. I think I'll go with \"Administrative rights.\"{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
