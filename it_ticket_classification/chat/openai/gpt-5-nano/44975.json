                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket. The categories at my disposal include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The content is about an Oracle submission issue where the user hasn't received approvals and they're trying to modify codes for a weekly order. It seems like an IT issue related to application access or administrative rights. It might even fit under Miscellaneous or Internal Project given the context around approvals and orders.**Assessing IT ticket categories**\n\nThe categories I have are somewhat limited. This ticket deals with an Oracle system workflow about submission and approval statuses with notification issues. It might fit under \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d \u201cInternal Project,\u201d or \u201cPurchase\u201d since it mentions codes and week orders, possibly referring to purchase orders. \n\nWhile \u201cAdministrative Rights\u201d could apply if they need to reject and modify codes, it seems more like a notification status issue. I think \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is the best fit unless it\u2019s more of an internal system project.**Creating JSON output for category**\n\nI need to clarify the use of \"Internal Project\" as a category. It seems relevant since the ticket is about an internal Oracle project. I must return a JSON object that follows a specific schema, which includes a \"category\" field with allowed categories.\n\nSo the correct output should be {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} based on what fits best. But I\u2019m aware of the schema specifics and the need for a top-level object. I\u2019ll ensure it matches the format requirements while keeping it simple. Now, I just need a brief justification for the choice.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe user has requested that I categorize this IT ticket with just the JSON output. I\u2019m considering whether to classify it as \u201cPurchase\u201d because it involves codes and potentially purchase orders. The ticket mentions modifying codes and approvals, which aligns with purchase order workflows. \n\nWhile \u201cInternal Project\u201d could fit since it's about an Oracle application, I think \u201cPurchase\u201d is the most accurate designation due to its mention of orders and codes. So, I should format the output simply as the JSON object without any extra text.**Determining the IT ticket category**\n\nThe user is asking for help investigating whether they need to reject codes for a week order, which suggests it's about an order cycle. \"Purchase\" seems to be the right category since it relates to order submissions. While \"Internal Project\" could apply to software projects, the context here is about an Oracle form for orders. \n\n\"Administrative Rights\" might be relevant if they need permissions to modify codes, but that\u2019s not the main focus of the request. I believe \"Purchase\" is the best fit, so the output should be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
