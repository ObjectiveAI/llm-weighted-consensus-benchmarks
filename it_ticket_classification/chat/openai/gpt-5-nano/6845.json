It feels like these terms don't fit perfectly in any main categories like Hardware or Purchase. \"Miscellaneous\" might be the catch-all here, but \"Internal Project\" could work if there\u2019s a specific project in mind. Given the uncertainty, I'll choose \"Miscellaneous\" as it seems to be the best fit for this ticket.**Choosing a category**\n\nThe allowed categories are fixed, and I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as a generic option. But I wonder if there's a better fit since \"incident notifications\" suggests it relates to IT. Maybe \"Internal Project,\" since it seems to describe a feature request. However, the mention of actions like \"close,\" \"reopen,\" and \"cancel\" doesn't clearly indicate a specific category. \"Administrative rights\" seems off too. So, categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" appears to be the safest choice. Now, I'll format the output as a JSON object.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
