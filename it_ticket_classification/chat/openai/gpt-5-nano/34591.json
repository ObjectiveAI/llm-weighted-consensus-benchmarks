The ticket mentions a \u201csubmit button\u201d issue with submitting a form, which leads me to think this is likely a software issue. It could fit under \"Access\" if it's a permissions issue or possibly \"Miscellaneous\" since there isn't a direct \"Software\" category. \"Administrative rights\" might also apply if the user lacks submission permissions.**Categorizing an IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m dealing with an IT ticket that mentions a button issue in a form that the user filled out last week. It sounds like it might be a UI bug blocking the submit button. Given the available categories, \"Miscellaneous\" seems fitting since there's no specific software category. \"Internal Project\" could also apply if it pertains to a project task, but the user didn't clarify that. I need to categorize this correctly and format it as a JSON object.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
