The user mentions a new purchase order for a monitor and requests installation logging and consideration of mandatory receipts. This content leads me to think the ticket fits into either the \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware\" categories. It's about acquiring a monitor and related installation, so I\u2019ll lean towards \"Purchase\" as the most appropriate category since that's the focus.**Finalizing the Category**\n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing the ticket as \"Purchase\" because it specifically mentions a new purchase order and related items like receipts. While \"Hardware\" could apply since it's a monitor, the focus here is on procurement. The user's request is clear: they want one category. So, I\u2019ll choose \"Purchase.\" To adhere to the expected format, I need to output a JSON object with the category. I'll create it like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. No extra text\u2014just the JSON is needed!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
