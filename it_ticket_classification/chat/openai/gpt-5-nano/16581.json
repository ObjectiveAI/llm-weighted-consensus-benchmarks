Given the context, this seems linked to either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it implies providing user permissions, I think the best category choice would be \"Access\" or possibly \"Administrative rights,\" depending on the nature of the request.**Classifying the ticket**\n\nI need to classify the user's request, but they didn't specify which system they're referring to. The best fit seems to be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" particularly since the phrase \"add user\" suggests it's about granting access. The ticket mentions adding a user to \"Friday PM,\" which likely relates to permissions or a group. Since it's not about hardware or storage, I'll lean towards \"Access.\" However, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d is more specific, so I\u2019ll choose based on context. I'll prepare a JSON object with the category as \"Access.\"**Outputting the ticket classification**\n\nThe user's ticket says, \"add user to Friday PM\" repeatedly mentioning \"add user.\" Since there's no explicit permission level indicated, \"Access\" seems like a safe choice. I'll format the output according to the required JSON structure, making sure it matches the specifications given. Although I could ask for clarification, since the user specifically asked for a category, I'll keep it straightforward. Therefore, I\u2019ll respond with the plain JSON as follows: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
