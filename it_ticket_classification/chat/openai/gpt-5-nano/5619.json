They tried to delete these files and are asking for help. It seems this request relates to file management, which might fit in the \"Storage\" category, but since deletion requires permissions, it could also be \"Administrative rights.\" Additionally, I wonder if it might overlap with \"Access\" since they\u2019re seeking help. I'll categorize it as \"Storage\" for clarity.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at two main categories for this IT ticket: \"Storage\" and \"Access.\" Since the user is asking for help deleting two highlighted contract files, \"Storage\" seems most fitting because it\u2019s an IT operation related to managing files. They didn\u2019t mention needing permission, which would have pointed me to \"Access,\" but still, \"Administrative rights\" makes me wonder if permissions are necessary for deletion. Ultimately, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Storage\" and provide the response in the correct JSON format: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to format my response as a JSON object. The schema specifies that I should include the category type, and based on the context, the appropriate category for this IT ticket is \"Storage.\" The instruction is clear that I should focus on the category alone in the output. So I\u2019ll present it as {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.\n\nI might consider things like adding a brief note, but the priority here is to keep it concise and straightforward. So, I think I\u2019m ready to present the final response!"
