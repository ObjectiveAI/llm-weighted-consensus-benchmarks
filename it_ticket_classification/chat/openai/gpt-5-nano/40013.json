The requisition is a purchase-related workflow, so I\u2019ll go with \u201cPurchase\u201d as the category. \n\nI\u2019ll respond with a JSON object like: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Creating JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m preparing to output a JSON object that contains the \"category\" property set to \"Purchase.\" The instructions clearly state that I should categorize the IT ticket. Since only the final output is needed, I\u2019ll focus on that, even though a brief rationale could be useful.\n\nIt\u2019s important to ensure the JSON is formatted correctly, with \"category\" as one of the allowed values. So, my final response will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
