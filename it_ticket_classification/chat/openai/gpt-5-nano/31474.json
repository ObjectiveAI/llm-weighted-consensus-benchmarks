It seems likely that this request relates to an HR issue, particularly given the mention of \"head PM,\" which might refer to a project manager. I\u2019ll lean towards categorizing this as \"HR Support,\" since it appears to address organizational staffing changes.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI think \u201chead pm\u201d likely refers to \u201chead PM,\u201d meaning project manager. This might indicate a request to change the line management structure, which falls under HR. Therefore, I should categorize this as \"HR Support.\" The user asked for a specific format, so I need to create a JSON-like object with a \"category\" field. Following the correct formatting, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} and keep explanations minimal since that's what the instructions suggest."
