The main points seem to be that the application is working, but they can only send emails using Internet Explorer on a mobile device. That\u2019s a bit confusing. I think it fits under software issues, but the categories seem limited. It's probably not about access rights since it pertains to sending emails. It might slot into \"Miscellaneous\" unless there's a better fit.**Choosing a Category**\n\nI need to pick the best category for an IT ticket. The options are \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Access.\" \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the most fitting since it covers issues not listed elsewhere. They mentioned they can only send emails through Internet Explorer on a mobile device, suggesting it might relate to a device issue. However, there's no category for \"Software\" or \"Mobile,\" making it tricky. Since it doesn't pertain to \"Hardware,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Storage,\" I conclude that \"Miscellaneous\" is indeed the best choice.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
