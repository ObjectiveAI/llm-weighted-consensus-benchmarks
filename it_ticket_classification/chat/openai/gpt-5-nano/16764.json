Looking at the categories provided like Hardware, HR Support, and Access, I think it relates mostly to system administration and maintenance. It could fit into \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Given the context of updates, I've got to choose which option makes the most sense based on its specifics.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm sorting through the IT ticket and realize it doesn't fit into hardware, storage, purchase, HR, or access, although access might be impacted. \"Administrative rights\" could apply if admin privileges are needed to deploy updates. However, it seems more appropriate to categorize it as \"Internal Project\" since it's about maintenance and patch management for scheduled updates on production servers. I\u2019ll prepare a JSON output stating the category as \"Internal Project\" since that fits best."
