It mentions annual leave requests and waiting for line manager approval, which makes it seem related to HR matters rather than IT hardware. The category that fits best is \"HR Support,\" as it pertains to leave requests. However, this is an IT ticket system, so I want to ensure I'm categorizing it correctly while focusing on the needs expressed in the request.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI'm evaluating the best category for this IT ticket regarding leave request approvals. Initially, I considered \"Administrative rights,\" but that's more about permissions rather than the user's request. Since it's primarily about leave requests and workflow concerning HR matters, \"HR Support\" seems to fit best. We need to respond with a JSON object to categorize it properly, so I'll format it as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This is concise and directly meets the user's request!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
