The user talks about a password reset, destination address, and something about migrating zones. From the allowed categories, I think it best fits under \"Access\" since it\u2019s related to login and password issues. Although \"Administrative rights\" could also apply for elevating privileges, the focus here is clearly on the password reset. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Access\" and prepare to respond with structured information.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI see that I need to create a JSON object based on a specific schema to categorize the IT ticket. The required format includes a \"category\" field, and I've settled on \"Access\" as the appropriate category. It's essential to ensure proper capitalization according to the schema, which lists the values clearly. The final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I could consider adding a brief rationale, but since the instruction focuses on categorization, I think just providing the JSON object is the best approach. So, here we go!"
