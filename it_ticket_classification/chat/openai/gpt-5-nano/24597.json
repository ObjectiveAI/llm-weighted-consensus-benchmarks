The system specifies that the output must follow a certain format, and I see that it should just include the category as a value. I\u2019ve decided on a category of \"HR Support.\" I could think about adding justification, but the instructions say just the category, so I\u2019ll stick with that.**Responding with category**\n\nI need to keep my response focused and stick to the instructions. So, I\u2019ll provide just the category as specified in the schema. The final output will be a JSON object formatted like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I want to make sure I'm following the requirements precisely, without adding any extra information. Let's go ahead and do that!"
