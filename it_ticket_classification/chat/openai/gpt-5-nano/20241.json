Options to consider are \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It looks like the user wants to participate in a planning session and potentially manage their availability. This could mean they're looking for access to a scheduling tool or calendar related to planning.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI have a list of categories to choose from: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the context, \"Access\" seems to fit best. The phrase \"access to planning\" indicates they need access to a resource rather than administrative rights. I\u2019ll prepare a response in the required JSON format: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. It seems like the user is only looking for the category, so I\u2019ll make sure to match the schema exactly for their IT ticket.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
