The user asked for help categorizing a ticket about Outlook issues after a password change, preventing access even via the web. It appears to be specifically about Access since it's related to login and account problems. While it could be \"Administrative rights,\" it seems more fitting to categorize it as Access since the main issue is inability to access the account.**Outputting IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user wants to categorize an IT ticket, and it should follow a JSON-like format. The ticket needs to be classified as \"Access\" because the user can't access Outlook after a password change. Following the instructions closely, I will respond simply with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nI need to keep my response focused and avoid any extra text. The guidelines emphasize providing only the necessary category object, so I\u2019ll stick to that format!"
