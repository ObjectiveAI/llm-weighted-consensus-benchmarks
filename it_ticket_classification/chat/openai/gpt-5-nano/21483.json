The phrase \"replacement for february pm\" and \"which has more memory\" suggest a focus on hardware. They want to order parts, so \"Purchase\" might apply too. However, since the primary subject is about hardware and memory, it seems best to assign it to the \"Hardware\" category, while acknowledging that it could also involve a purchase aspect.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"which has more memory\" strongly suggests that this ticket is about hardware specs, while \"please order\" indicates a procurement request. I believe \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate category, as it aligns with the focus on memory and replacement needs. If it were solely about purchasing, I'd lean toward \"Purchase.\" But since memory relates to hardware, I'll go with \"Hardware.\" I'll output the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
