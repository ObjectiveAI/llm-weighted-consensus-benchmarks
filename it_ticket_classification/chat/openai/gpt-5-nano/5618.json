They mention an \u201cupgrade\u201d multiple times, which might indicate a hardware upgrade. The recurring term \u201ccaps\u201d could refer to either \u201ccaps lock\u201d or some product named \u201ccaps.\u201d Given the context, it seems like the most fitting category could be \"Hardware.\" I just need to confirm that \u201ccaps\u201d refers to hardware-related items before finalizing this.**Classifying Ticket Properly**\n\nIn classifying the ticket, I see \"hardware\" is suitable for hardware upgrades. If purchasing is necessary, then \"purchase\" would be applicable, and if it's tied to a project, \"internal project\" fits. The user's message is unclear and mentions needing the \"least blockers,\" which might imply they want minimal downtime. Given the repeated mention of upgrades, I'll likely categorize it as \"hardware.\" I\u2019ll format my response in JSON as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} or a similar structure.**Determining Category for Ticket**\n\nThe user provided a schema for the category, and I need to respond with a JSON object. It seems the appropriate category is possibly \"Hardware\" since they mention an upgrade. However, if purchasing parts is necessary, it could also fit under \"Purchase,\" though the text doesn't explicitly say that. The phrase \"least blocker\" indicates they want minimal downtime. Given the context, the safest option is to categorize it as \"Hardware.\" My response will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
