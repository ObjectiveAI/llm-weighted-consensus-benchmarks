The rejection details link to the Change Management process, so categorizing it under \"Internal Project\" makes sense. It might also be wise to ask for clarification, but I think I'll go with \"Internal Project\" for now.**Outputting JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket in a specific JSON format. I need to provide just the category string, which should fit in the allowed values like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Internal Project.\" Based on the ticket's CAB rejection and CR form details, \"Internal Project\" seems most appropriate, although \"Miscellaneous\" could work too. Ultimately, I'll go with the response: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} to ensure it's clear and follows the format.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
