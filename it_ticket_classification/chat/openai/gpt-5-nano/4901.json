I'm considering options like \"HR Support\" since that seems to fit best. However, \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, but HR might be the most appropriate choice here.**Categorizing onboarding tasks**\n\nI'm working on categorizing an IT ticket for onboarding a new starter. The message indicates tasks like account provisioning and access but isn\u2019t exactly clear. The terms \"new starter\" and \"date\" suggest it might relate to HR or onboarding processes. I should categorize it as \"HR Support,\" since that fits best, but I also think about \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" based on the mention of tasks. Ultimately, \"HR Support\" seems like the safest bet.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
