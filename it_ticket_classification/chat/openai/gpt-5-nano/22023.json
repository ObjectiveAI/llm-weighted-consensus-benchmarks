They mentioned a \u201cnew purchase\u201d and specific terms like \u201cpurchase order,\u201d \u201ctouch bar,\u201d and \u201cinstallation.\u201d It looks like this relates to hardware, specifically something like a MacBook Pro 13-inch Touch Bar. Since it\u2019s focused on a purchase and installation, I\u2019ll classify this ticket under \"Purchase.\" Additionally, there's a mention of necessary receipts, which can tie into this categorization.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nThis ticket is about the purchase and installation of hardware, so I need to pick the right category. It mentions terms like \"new purchase,\" \"purchase order,\" and \"log installation,\" hinting that \"Purchase\" is a fitting choice since it relates to acquiring new hardware. While \"Hardware\" is also relevant because of the installation aspect, the best primary category is \"Purchase.\u201d I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object to reflect this category format for the response.**Finalizing the response**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to respond with a JSON object containing `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. The instructions are clear that the message should only include the categorization without any extra text. While there\u2019s some thought about whether it could also fit under \"Hardware,\" the mention of \"new purchase PO\" strongly suggests that \"Purchase\" is the right category since it reflects procurement. So, I\u2019ll stick to the plan and output just the JSON object as instructed."
