Since it's primarily about access, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" Now, I\u2019ll output it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Formatting output correctly**\n\nI need to ensure that I match the exact capitalization of \"Access.\" The instructions specify that I should provide a JSON object without any extra commentary. So, I\u2019ll just focus on the output. It\u2019ll be {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s clear that this format is what\u2019s expected, and I\u2019ll follow through with it, keeping everything neat and tidy. Alright, let\u2019s go ahead and provide just that JSON object!"
