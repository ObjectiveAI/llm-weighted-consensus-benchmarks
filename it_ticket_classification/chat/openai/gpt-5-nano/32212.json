It sounds like they\u2019re reporting an error after logging into Oracle, probably related to a new employee's access. I see categories like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" that might fit. The mention of a location could suggest specific administrative actions needed. I'll need to determine which of these categories best aligns with the issue presented. It's definitely a bit of a challenge!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the IT ticket and think that the error mentioned after logging in likely indicates an access issue. The user mentioned \"new starter\" and \"Oracle,\" which ties directly to onboarding and the application. Since it\u2019s primarily a login issue, \"Access\" seems to fit best. I\u2019ll follow up with a JSON response, as instructed, just stating the category: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This keeps things straightforward without adding unnecessary details.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
