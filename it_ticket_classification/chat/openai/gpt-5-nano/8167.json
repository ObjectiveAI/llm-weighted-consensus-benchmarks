The text is somewhat unclear, but it includes \"cooler needed\", which suggests a cooler device might be needed. It could fit into either \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase\" categories since it seems like the user is asking to order a cooler. Given the mention of \"order,\" I think labeling it as \"Purchase\" makes the most sense!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the IT ticket request. It mentions a cooler, which fits into the \"Hardware\" category since it's a device. However, given the term \"order,\" it leans towards the \"Purchase\" category, which usually refers to procurement. The phrases \"cooler needed\" and \"order\" indicate that the user likely wants to order a cooler. So, I'll categorize it as \"Purchase\" and respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Let's keep it straightforward!"
