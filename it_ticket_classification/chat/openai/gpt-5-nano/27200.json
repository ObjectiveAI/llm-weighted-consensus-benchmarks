The details involve executors, node caps, and labels. I'm trying to find the best fit from the categories provided: Internal Project, Miscellaneous, Administrative rights, Access, etc. It could lean towards Internal Project since it\u2019s related to a CI/CD infrastructure. \"Administrative rights\" might apply if it relates to software installation, but that isn't explicitly mentioned. So, I'll lean towards Internal Project.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nFor this IT ticket, \"Internal Project\" appears to be the most appropriate category due to the infrastructure changes mentioned. However, I\u2019m also considering \"Miscellaneous\" if I'm not entirely confident. The mention of \"please let install\" could suggest a need for \"Access,\" but there\u2019s no explicit reference to access rights or credentials. The \"Administrative rights\" category might apply since the ticket implies a need for admin rights to install. Ultimately, I need to format a JSON-like object with the selected category.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nThe ticket mentions adding a slave node in a cloud environment with various labels, suggesting it's about a Jenkins slave node configuration. Since this involves internal project infrastructure, I'll categorize it under \"Internal Project.\" My task is to create a JSON object that includes the category. I see that the format requires the category property specifically to hold the value. So, I'll produce a JSON object that correctly reflects the required classification."
