It doesn\u2019t seem related to hardware or storage, so I\u2019m considering \"Miscellaneous\" as a catch-all. There\u2019s a slight chance it could be related to \"Purchase\" if prizes imply rewards. However, since there\u2019s no clear IT issue, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Miscellaneous.\"**Providing the JSON response**\n\nI need to output a JSON object with a category field as a string. The content is unclear and seems like random words, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous.\" However, I wonder if it might be helpful to ask for clarification first. The instruction emphasizes providing JSON without any extra text, which is essential for parsing. So, I\u2019ll respond with exactly this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} and ensure there are no extraneous spaces. Let\u2019s proceed!"
