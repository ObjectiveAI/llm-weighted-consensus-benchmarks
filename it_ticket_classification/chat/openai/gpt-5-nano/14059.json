It seems to discuss discrepancies between physical cards and records, mentioning \"OMS,\" which might refer to an access management system. This ticket relates to access control and possibly administrative rights, so the relevant categories could be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I need to decide which category fits best.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis ticket seems to be about visitor cards, access control, and security. It appears to fit the \"Access\" category since it involves correcting discrepancies in the records regarding physical card possession. While \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, it typically refers to granting elevated privileges in IT systems rather than handling visitor card management. So, I think \"Access\" is the most suitable choice. I need to respond with a JSON structure: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll make sure to follow the required format!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
