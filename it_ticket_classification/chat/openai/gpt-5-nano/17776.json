The ticket is quite messy, mentioning something about a bulk leaver form for interns, likely related to HR. It seems to involve an offboarding process, so I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Access\" if it pertains to system access. However, it could also connect to \"Administrative rights\" for access removal, but the focus on the leaver form suggests it's mainly HR-related.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm figuring out how to classify an IT ticket, considering categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Access.\" The user wants to categorize a ticket related to a \"bulk leaver form for interns.\" Since this involves offboarding and likely entails removing access, \"Access\" seems the most fitting. While there's some HR component, it's primarily about IT processes, so I think \"Access\" is the best choice rather than \"HR Support.\"**Finalizing ticket classification**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the IT ticket as \"Access\" since it involves completing a leaver form that likely disables access. The ticket mentions \"bulk leaver form\" several times, reinforcing this choice. I need to output this in the correct JSON format according to the instructions, without adding extra text or whitespace. So, I\u2019ll provide the response as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThat should be clear and meet the required format!"
