The available categories are hardware, HR support, access, miscellaneous, storage, purchase, internal project, and administrative rights. I want to ensure that the user's information fits into one of these categories accurately. It\u2019s important to choose the right category to address their issue effectively, so I\u2019ll review the text carefully to pinpoint the best fit.**Understanding user connection issues**\n\nI need to analyze the user's message about their connection issues with a computer. It seems they're facing problems like needing to manually connect each morning and the device not remembering previous connections. They also mention disconnections when the screen turns off, which sounds frustrating. Additionally, it appears they want to log a ticket for this issue. There\u2019s a reference to a senior engineer and a specific date in December, which might be crucial to address their concerns.**Categorizing the user's ticket**\n\nThe user talks about needing to create a ticket for connectivity issues, which makes me think it fits best in the \"Access\" category since it's all about connecting to a network and remembering credentials. There's also the option of categorizing it as \"Hardware\" if it's more about the computer itself, but \"Access\" seems more fitting, especially since they mention manual connections. I should consider mentioning \"Administrative rights\" if they need any toggles for settings, but for now, I'll classify it as \"Access.\" I'll finalize the response in a JSON format with the category set appropriately.**Outputting the ticket category**\n\nI need to format my response as a valid JSON object to categorize the IT ticket. Based on the provided schema, I just have to include the \"category\" property. Since the user has described the issue, I\u2019m categorizing it as \"Access.\" I don\u2019t need to include any additional explanations, as they specifically asked for a categorization. So my final output will simply be {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra formatting or text."
