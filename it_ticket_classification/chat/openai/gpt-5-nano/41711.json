It seems relevant to \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d under \u201cAccess,\u201d but \u201cAccess\u201d fits better since it relates to user access to the system. The \"submission error\" part is a bit unclear, maybe fitting in \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d \n\nFrom the message, someone joined last week, and it sounds like they were only assigned their task last Wednesday instead of the previous Monday. It looks like they\u2019re looking for help to resolve this issue.**Determining the right category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether this task relates to \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d or \u201cAccess\u201d to the system for submissions. The term \"submission error\" could indicate issues with form submission permissions or account creation. The mention of someone who \"joined last week\" likely refers to a new employee. They\u2019re interested in resolving a ticket assignment issue, where it seems they should have been assigned last Monday. Overall, \"Access\" appears to be the best category choice, so I\u2019ll respond with a simple JSON object: {\"category\": \"Access\"}."
