The issue seems to be related to an inability to add an annual leave request, which is HR-related. I'm thinking it could fit into either \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" However, since this is about creating a request in an HR system, \"HR Support\" definitely seems like the best fit. The category is included in the options, so I'll go with that!**Formatting response**\n\nI need to make sure I\u2019m following the instructions and responding with the required JSON format for the category. The schema specifically asks for a \"category\" field, so I\u2019ll keep it simple and provide just that: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`. Being concise is key here, so I won\u2019t add any extra text or details\u2014just the JSON object as instructed. Let\u2019s get this final response ready!"
