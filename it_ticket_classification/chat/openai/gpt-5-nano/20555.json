The ticket text is quite messy, but it sounds like the user is requesting modifications to a costs report, including adding fields and investigating certain details. It seems to fit best under the category of an Internal Project, rather than Administrative Rights or Access. That seems like the right choice!**Determining the right category**\n\nThis ticket is clearly about report modification, so \"Internal Project\" seems like the best category. While \"Miscellaneous\" could work, it doesn\u2019t capture the task's essence as well as \"Internal Project.\" The other categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Storage\" aren't appropriate either. I need to output the category in JSON format as instructed. Based on the options, I\u2019ll use:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI just need to make sure I don't add any extra text."
