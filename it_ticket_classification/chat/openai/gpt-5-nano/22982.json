The ticket is about annual leave requests, approvals, and vacation balances, making it HR-related. Among the available options, \"HR Support\" seems to fit best since it involves an application for processing these requests. It could potentially also be classified as \"Administrative rights\" if it involved more on authorizations, but that doesn\u2019t seem to apply here. So, I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support\" as the category.**Preparing the JSON response**\n\nAlright, I need to provide the JSON object with the category \"HR Support,\" ensuring there's a space as specified. The instruction is clear: I should output just the JSON object without any additional text. So, the response will be formatted correctly, showing the category field as required. I'll keep it simple and direct, just like this:  \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
