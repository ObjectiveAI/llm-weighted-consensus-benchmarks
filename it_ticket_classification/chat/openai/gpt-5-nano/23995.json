The user mentions things like \"drive almost full,\" \"attach occupied,\" and \"upcoming leaves,\" along with several references to files and reinstalling something. I think it could be related to managing storage or possibly reinstalling the OS due to the mention of the \"install date.\" There's a lot to unpack, but it seems like the primary issue is the storage space on the drive.**Choosing a category for IT ticket**\n\nI have a list of categories to choose from, like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the ticket talks about a \"drive almost full,\" files, and reinstalling, it sounds like it fits best in the Storage category. It seems like it relates to managing space on the disk, especially with the references to deleting files and reinstalling. I'll respond with the category in the required JSON format. \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}**Responding with category**\n\nThe system instructs me to respond solely with the category. Since the IT ticket relates to storage issues, I\u2019ll return the required category in the specified JSON format. It's essential to keep it concise, so I won't include any extra text\u2014just the valid JSON. Alright, here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
