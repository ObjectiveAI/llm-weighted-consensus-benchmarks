It\u2019s a bit confusing, but they clearly need operational assistance with deleting tasks. I think \"Internal Project\" fits well, but there's also a possibility of needing \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are involved, although that isn\u2019t directly stated.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out which category fits best for this IT ticket. \"Internal Project\" seems suitable for issues regarding project management tools. On the other hand, \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" could refer to permissions, especially since they want to delete tasks and mentioned an error. As there\u2019s an issue with the Oracle project management tool, \"Internal Project\" feels like the right choice. \n\nI'll format the response as a JSON object to categorize it. So, my output will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}**Returning Categorized Object**\n\nI\u2019m focused on returning just the categorized JSON object for this ticket. The content mentions \"Oracle,\" which likely refers to software for project tasks, and there\u2019s mention of an error grid. The request is for assistance in deleting tasks. Given all this, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fitting category since it relates to an internal project management tool. \n\nWhile \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant for permissions, the user didn\u2019t explicitly mention permission issues, so I\u2019ll go with: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
