The possible categories are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I'm considering \"Internal Project\" because it involves an upgrade and planning, but \"Hardware\" could apply due to phone considerations. Ultimately, \"Internal Project\" feels like a better fit for this ticket.**Formatting the category object**\n\nI need to produce a JSON-like category object based on the user's IT ticket regarding their phone system upgrade. The instruction specifies a valid format: {\"category\":\"...\"}, with possible categories including Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. Since the ticket focuses on upgrading the phone system and related communications, \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. It could technically align with \"Hardware,\" but the focus is mainly on the upgrade process. So my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
