Instead, it's someone wanting to take charge of holiday requests, indicated by phrases like \"please appoint myself instead\" and \"let requests stop coming.\" They're expressing a desire to have administrative rights for approving holiday requests, suggesting that they want access to the approvals workflow. The mention of \"Administrative rights\" reinforces this need, as it's part of their request to handle holiday approvals.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize the ticket, not draft a response. They provided the text along with a request: \"Categorize this IT Ticket.\" I should return a JSON object with the category field based on the given schema. Their request about being appointed for holiday approvals indicates a need for administrative rights, which likely falls under the category of \"Administrative rights.\" So, my output should be {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.**Determining the right category**\n\nThe phrase \"requests stop coming\" indicates there might be numerous requests for holiday approvals, suggesting the user wants to act as the approver. The focus here is on granting administrative rights to approve time off. Alternatively, if they were simply asking for access to a system, the \"Access\" category could fit. However, since it\u2019s specifically about permissions to approve, \"Administrative rights\" is the best category. So, the output should be: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
