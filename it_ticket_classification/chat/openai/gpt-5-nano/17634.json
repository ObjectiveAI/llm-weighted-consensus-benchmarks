It looks like they want to create a project for Friday PM, along with adding members, templates, and owners. There are also legal disclaimers regarding confidentiality included. Since the user specifically asks me to categorize the ticket, I\u2019ll review the options available: like \u201cInternal Project,\u201d \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d or another category. I need to choose the most fitting one.**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket text is clear about creating a new project with owners and templates. I\u2019m considering whether it fits best into the \u201cInternal Project\u201d category or if \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d is more suitable since it involves permissions. \"Internal Project\" seems like a perfect match because they're asking for a project setup. If the focus is more on ownership and access, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could be the right choice. I need to decide and respond with the correct JSON format.**Finalizing Category Decision**\n\nThis ticket is about implementing a project and assigning owners, so \"Internal Project\" really seems like the best fit. I want to keep it straightforward and stick to the JSON format for the category. I've confirmed that \"Internal Project\" is correctly capitalized to match the required enumeration. While I noticed some mentions of confidentiality, the provided categories don\u2019t include \"Legal\" or \"Security.\" Therefore, I\u2019ll proceed with the category as \"Internal Project.\""
