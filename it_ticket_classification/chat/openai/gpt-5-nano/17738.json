The categories to choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since it's about OS installation, I lean towards \"Hardware\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" While it's not an access issue, it feels more like a generic request and doesn\u2019t fit neatly into any category. Ultimately, \"Miscellaneous\" seems the most appropriate choice here.**Categorizing Windows Installation Request**\n\nThe user seems to request a Windows installation for Friday based on the message. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights\" since installing Windows usually requires admin rights. However, the ticket doesn't specifically mention needing those rights. It feels safer to categorize it as \"Miscellaneous,\" given that it doesn't fit neatly into other categories. I\u2019ll prepare a structured JSON output for this, ensuring the category is one of the specified options.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
