The user seems to be asking for help categorizing this IT ticket rather than solving it. \"Administrative rights\" likely refers to access requests, so we need a suitable category. \"Miscellaneous\" could work, but \"Access\" may fit better if they seek permissions or if the ticket pertains to an \"Internal Project.\" I must decide which category is the best fit.**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nThe content provided is a bit unclear, so the safest choice for categorization seems to be \"Miscellaneous\" or perhaps \"Internal Project.\" The phrase \"notification oracle fusion works Wednesday October\" likely references the Oracle Fusion product, which points to a technical issue. Given the ambiguity, I'll settle on \"Miscellaneous\" for the category. Now, I'll format my final response as a JSON object, ensuring it contains just what\u2019s necessary: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
