It mentions \u201capproval,\u201d \u201cexpense row,\u201d and \u201ctester,\u201d which makes me think it ties to purchases or internal projects. The phrase about \u201cexpense\u201d suggests a concern with purchasing, and \u201capproval\u201d might indicate it's about that process. I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing this ticket as \u201cPurchase\u201d due to the emphasis on expenses, but \u201cInternal Project\u201d could also fit if there\u2019s a testing aspect involved.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI\u2019m categorizing an IT ticket, and it looks like \"Purchase\" is the best fit based on the user's references to expenses and approvals. \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" and \"Miscellaneous\" don't seem relevant here. The phrases like \"approval Friday PM\" and \"expense row\" reinforce that it pertains to expenses or procurement. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object formatted like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} to classify the ticket correctly. This aligns with the intent behind the user's request!"
