It's a bit jumbled, mentioning \"new starter,\" \"additional infos required,\" and \"please fill date.\" It seems to primarily relate to onboarding, which could fit under HR Support or perhaps Administrative rights. I'll consider options like Access or Miscellaneous too. Ultimately, I want to classify this into the best category, so I'll output it in JSON format accordingly.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket regarding onboarding a new starter. It could fit \"Access\" for granting accounts and tools, or \"HR Support\" since it's related to onboarding processes. The message mentions needing \"additional infos required\" and a date, suggesting it might involve scheduling. \"Mob zone\" could refer to a mobile aspect. Overall, I think \"HR Support\" is the most suitable category, as it concerns the new starter\u2019s onboarding process.**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nThe content isn\u2019t entirely clear, but I think the \"Access\" category is a strong fit. The mention of a \"new starter\" suggests they would need access to accounts, email, and network setup. The phrase \"attached additional infos required\" hints at information necessary for provisioning access. While \"Administrative rights\" might be too specific, \"Access\" seems the most relevant here. I\u2019ll format the output in JSON as required: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's deliver that!"
