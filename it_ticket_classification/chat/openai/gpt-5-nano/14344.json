This ticket seems to request creating a source type specifically for chat, including logging incidents through chat. The user wants it to be automatically filled and grayed out to prevent changes. Since this involves configuring ServiceNow or automating incident logging, it leans more towards an \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" due to the UI permissions aspect involved.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm considering categorizing an IT ticket and think it fits best under \"Internal Project\" since it's about implementing a new chat-based source type for logging incidents in ServiceNow. The ticket requests features like automatic filling and graying out fields to prevent changes. Okay, the categories are a bit coarse and could overlap with \"Administrative rights,\" but I believe \"Internal Project\" captures the essence better. So, I'll respond with the JSON-like format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Finalizing category response**\n\nI see that I have to determine if I should categorize this IT ticket under \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since the core of the request pertains to implementing a new feature, I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project.\" The output requires a specific JSON format just containing the category. So, the final response will only include the essential JSON object without any extra text. I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
