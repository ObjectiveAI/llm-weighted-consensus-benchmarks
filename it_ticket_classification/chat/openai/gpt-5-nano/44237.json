Since the issue relates to hardware, my output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe content of the ticket revolves around hardware issues, specifically mentioning components like monitors, sockets, fuses, and cables. Therefore, the appropriate category is Hardware. It's not related to HR or Access, and while there could be nuances in the text, it predominantly fits under the Hardware category. \n\nI'll format my final output as a JSON object strictly adhering to the required schema: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.
