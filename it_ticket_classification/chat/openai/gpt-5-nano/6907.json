The repeated mentions suggest it's related to hardware, specifically the phone's back cover. While \"Purchase\" and \"Administrative rights\" came to mind, they don't seem to fit. \"Internal Project,\" \"Storage,\" and \"HR Support\" are also out. \"Access\" isn't applicable either, which leaves me considering \"Miscellaneous,\" but I'm leaning more towards \"Hardware.\"**Determining hardware category**\n\nI'm looking at a user request about logging a hardware supply related to a back cover tempered glass for a mobile phone. It seems clear that this fits under the \"Hardware\" category. The instructions specify I need to respond in a JSON format. I should return this as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It\u2019s straightforward; they want to categorize the IT ticket, and my response matches the required structure exactly. So I'll provide just that without any extra text."
