Multiple fatal errors mentioned could indicate ongoing issues. I think it would be best to ask clarifying questions since it\u2019s ambiguous, but it may end up as \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\"**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI see I need to decide between \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" for this IT ticket. The phrase \"change fatal error values\" seems to repeat a lot and could relate to changing surveys, but it's not all coherent. So, \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the best fit for ambiguous requests since it doesn't specify hardware or access.\n\nFor the response, I need to format it as a JSON object with the category property: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I'll ensure to keep it concise and straightforward!"
