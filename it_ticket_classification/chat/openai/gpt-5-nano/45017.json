The user says something about \"over days not showing correctly,\" which suggests a UI or software issue. \"Inca\" means \"again\" in Romanian, but the rest isn't entirely clear. This sounds like a bug with the display of \"over days,\" possibly meaning it's related to software. Considering the available categories, it might fall under \"Miscellaneous,\" but I'm unsure about \"Admin rights\" as well.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI'm evaluating the appropriate category for this IT ticket. \"Software\" would be ideal, but that\u2019s not an option. \"Miscellaneous\" seems suitable for this ambiguous bug. \"Internal Project\" could apply if it's for a specific project. The content is about a UI issue related to \"over days\" not displaying correctly. After considering the available options, I'd lean toward \"Miscellaneous,\" unless more clarification indicates it belongs to an internal project. Perhaps I could suggest a couple of options to the user?**Formatting the category output**\n\nThe prompt specifically asks me to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" so I need to respond using a required format\u2014a JSON-like object with a \"category\" property. According to the schema provided, the options include categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. Given the context, \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit since it relates to a UI bug. If the content indicated an internal project, I might consider \"Internal Project,\" but it doesn't mention one. Thus, I'll stick with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
