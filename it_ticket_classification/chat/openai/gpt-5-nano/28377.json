The user\u2019s message is confusing but seems focused on \"PM\" and mentions \"annual leave.\" \u201cPM\u201d might mean Project Manager or something related to Access changes. Given the context, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it under Administrative rights, but I\u2019m still unsure due to the ambiguity.**Determining the appropriate category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize this IT ticket as HR Support since it mentions annual leave, which typically falls under HR. However, it could also be asking for an IT task to review or change something related to \"PM.\" It\u2019s a bit of a puzzle, but since this involves permissions and possible changes, I think Administrative rights might be a fit too. Ultimately, I need to choose the best fitting category from the options provided and format it correctly in JSON.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
