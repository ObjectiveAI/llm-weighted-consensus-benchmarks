The ticket mentions \"mice backpacks rack ext black\" and seems to ask for assistance. It's unclear if \"mice\" refers to computer mice or something else, and whether it's about purchasing racks or something different. The system instructions tell me to use a specific JSON-like category format, so I\u2019ll need to determine the right category from the provided options.**Parsing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user has asked for assistance with a ticket that mentions \"mice backpacks rack ext black.\" I think they're trying to raise a request for some items. It could refer to racks designed for mice or backpacks. Looking at the available categories, it seems to fit best in \"Purchase\" as it sounds like they want to procure hardware. However, if this is about storage equipment, \"Storage\" might also be a relevant choice. It's a bit unclear!**Finalizing category for IT ticket**\n\nThe user's request mentions \"rack,\" which could relate to storage or even a server rack extension. However, I think the best bet is to categorize this request as \"Purchase\" since they appear to be asking for assistance in acquiring items like mice and backpacks. While \"Hardware\" covers physical devices, \"Purchase\" works as a broader category. I'll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. It might also be good to ask for clarification, just in case!**Delivering category JSON**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to classify the ticket without asking follow-up questions. It appears the request is for the procurement of items like mice and backpacks, fitting under \"Purchase.\" However, I must stick to the required format of a single JSON object without any additional notes. I\u2019ll respond with exactly: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll ensure the format is correct, with proper quotes and no extra text. Let's deliver this!"
