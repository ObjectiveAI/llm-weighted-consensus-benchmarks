Overall, I feel \"Administrative rights\" is the best category since it captures the essence of the request. I\u2019ll structure my response accordingly.**Determining the category**\n\nI'm thinking about how to categorize this ticket in the system. It seems most appropriate to use \"Administrative rights\" since the request involves granting specific privileges to create purchase orders. The instruction is clear: I need to provide the category in a JSON format without any extra commentary. So I\u2019ll make sure my response is strictly that JSON object, ensuring it includes the correct categorization. I\u2019ll prepare it as: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
