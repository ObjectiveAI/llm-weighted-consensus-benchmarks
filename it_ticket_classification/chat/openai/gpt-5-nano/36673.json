It looks like they\u2019re struggling with filtering transactions by date properly. They\u2019ve specifically asked for a ticket to be raised, which helps narrow down the category. Given that it relates to the PO report, \u201cPurchase\u201d seems like the most appropriate category. I briefly considered \u201cInternal Project,\u201d but \u201cPurchase\u201d fits better since PO stands for Purchase Order.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe user is experiencing a bug related to filtering by date in their purchase order (PO) report. To respond appropriately, I need to provide a JSON object that categorizes the ticket. The valid categories include \"Purchase,\" so I'll stick with that. The response should look like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s properly formatted and capitalized. It doesn't seem necessary to consider any other categories, as this clearly relates to a purchase report."
