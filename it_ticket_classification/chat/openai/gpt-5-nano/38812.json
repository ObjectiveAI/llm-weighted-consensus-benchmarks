Since there's no \"Performance\" category in the allowed options, I\u2019m considering alternatives. It could fit under \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s for an internal app, or maybe \"Miscellaneous\". \"Hardware\" might also work, but that feels less relevant. Let\u2019s find the best fit!**Classifying App Performance Issue**\n\nI see that this ticket is about an app performance issue that seems related to lagging after a few minutes, which could hint at a memory leak or CPU problem. Given the limited categories, it might fit under \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s an internal IT ticket. However, I\u2019m also considering \"Miscellaneous\" for a broader application. \"Hardware\", \"Storage\", \"Administrative rights\", \"Access\", and \"Purchase\" don\u2019t seem applicable. I\u2019ll decide on the best category to classify it accurately!**Formatting Category Response**\n\nI need to provide a JSON-like response for the category. According to the schema, I should return an object with a \"category\" property that fits one of the specified options. Given the context of this IT ticket about app performance, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the best fit since it's not really related to hardware or access. \"Internal Project\" could work, too, but \"Miscellaneous\" is safer. So, I'll format the final output as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Delivering Category Response**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about whether to add a brief note along with the category response. However, the instructions specifically say to categorize, and the format is a category object, which means I should focus on just delivering the JSON without any additional notes. Keeping it concise is probably the best approach since it aligns with what\u2019s required. So I\u2019ll just deliver the category object as specified. Let's proceed!"
