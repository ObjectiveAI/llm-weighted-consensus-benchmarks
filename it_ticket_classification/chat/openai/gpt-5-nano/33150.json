The content mentions access card enabling, required hardware, updates, and issues with a starter form, which suggests it relates to access or hardware. As I parse through it, I'll focus on identifying the primary topic to decide if it falls under Hardware, HR Support, Access, or one of the other categories. Let's aim for clarity to help resolve the ticket effectively!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket seems focused on provisioning access cards for a new starter, mentioning \"access card enabling,\" \"new starter,\" and \"required hardware.\" I see it includes both access-related terms and hardware aspects, but the primary focus is on enabling access. While some might consider \"Administrative rights,\" the main intent here is access control rather than administration. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and provide the final answer in the specified JSON format. Let's do that!**Considering User Requirements**\n\nI realize the user may want more than just the category, but the specified format is indeed JSON. I should ensure I'm providing exactly what they need within those constraints. Since clarity is important, I\u2019ll focus on presenting the category in that format while being ready to assist with any further information the user might want. Let's stick to the guidelines and make sure my response meets their expectations!"
