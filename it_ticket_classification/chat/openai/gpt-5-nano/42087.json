I need to ensure that inbound port traffic is either blocked or at least limited. There\u2019s concern about self-propagating worms affecting roaming workstations and specific ports allowing unwanted connections. It's crucial to address firewall rules for public networks and determine if any adjustments can be made to close down those unsafe ports for security compliance.**Categorizing request**\n\nI see the request needs to be categorized, and it involves IT security policies, particularly around blocking inbound traffic on public networks and setting firewall rules. It could fit under \u201cAccess,\u201d since it\u2019s focused on controlling access, or \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d as changing firewall rules needs admin privileges. \n\nHowever, I think \u201cAccess\u201d is the most appropriate category since the goal is to block unauthorized inbound traffic. I\u2019ll finalize the JSON output with that category designated. \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
