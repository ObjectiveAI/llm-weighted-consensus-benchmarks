The mention of \"Oracle\" could relate to Oracle software, making this potentially about HR support or access during their leave. It sounds like they might be asking about their absence management or system access while on maternity leave. The best fitting category seems to be either HR Support or Access, but I\u2019m considering all category options.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis ticket is about maternity leave, so it\u2019s clear it's not related to hardware, storage, purchase, or internal projects. It seems HR-related, but \"Access\" could apply if they need to access something while on leave. Still, the main content points toward HR matters, making \"HR Support\" the closest category. Thankfully, \"HR Support\" is listed among the allowed categories. I'll categorize it as \"HR Support,\" returning it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Verifying JSON format**\n\nI need to make sure the JSON keys match the required format for the category. The API expects a JSON object with a \"category\" key and a string value that\u2019s among the enumerated options like \"HR Support.\" The prompt defines a schema, indicating we should just provide the category in that structure. Since the instruction says to output a JSON object with \"category\": \"HR Support,\" I\u2019ll go ahead and format it correctly.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
