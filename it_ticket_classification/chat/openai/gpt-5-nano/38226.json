They\u2019re not directly asking about permissions, but there's a category for \"Administrative rights\" for related issues. Duplicates might indicate a software bug rather than permission problems. However, since they are a senior manager asking for help, I consider if they might need admin rights to delete recurring entries. \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d could work for this broader problem, but I\u2019m weighing my options carefully.**Categorizing user request**\n\nI'm working on how to categorize the user's request regarding deleting duplicate meetings. Even though it could involve access, the user is asking for deletion steps, which feels more like a \"Miscellaneous\" issue. I need to create a JSON object with the category. The format specifies that it should be a nested category object with the property. So, my final response will be tidy and straightforward: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. No extra commentary is needed, just a clear response!"
