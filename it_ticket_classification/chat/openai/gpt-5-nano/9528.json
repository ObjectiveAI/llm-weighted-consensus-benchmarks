This seems like a hardware request, possibly falling under \u201cPurchase\u201d for new cables or a monitor. I see the categories of Hardware versus Purchase, where many tickets are classified as Hardware for equipment. Since this user is looking for additional equipment, it clearly qualifies as a hardware issue or request.**Categorizing as JSON**\n\nI'm thinking about the appropriate category for the IT ticket request. Since the user mentioned needing an extended monitor and cable, it fits best under \"Hardware.\" There\u2019s no need for subcategories, as the allowed categories are simply listed. I should format the response as a JSON object, which will look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I want to ensure I don\u2019t include extra text outside the JSON format since the instructions clearly state to provide just the category.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
