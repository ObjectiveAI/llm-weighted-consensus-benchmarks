They've mentioned a \"new starter form\" for a contractor and requested help with it. This seems related to onboarding, which would typically fall under \"HR Support.\" Although there\u2019s also a mention of \"cost centre,\" the focus is clearly on the contractor form. So, I'm concluding that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category for this ticket.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nSince the user's request revolves around completing a starter form for a contractor, I feel it's best categorized as \"HR Support.\" Although there's a mention of access rights, they didn\u2019t explicitly request access, so \"HR Support\" fits better for onboarding purposes. I need to respond in a JSON format, only including the category value. Therefore, I'll present it as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} while ensuring it's in the correct JSON format without anything else included.**Delivering the JSON output**\n\nI\u2019ve decided the best category for this ticket is \"HR Support,\" and I\u2019ll keep it simple by formatting my answer as valid JSON. I'll just output {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} without any extra text or disclaimers. I briefly considered \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d because of the cost center mention, but it doesn't quite fit since the focus is on onboarding. So, I'm confirming that \"HR Support\" is the right choice, and proceeding with it!"
