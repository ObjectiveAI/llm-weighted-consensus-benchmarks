The ticket mentions issues with Oracle time cards, like errors in submission related to public holidays. It looks like it aligns closely with \"HR Support\" since it's about a human resources system. My conclusion is that we should go with \"HR Support\" and respond with {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nThe instructions specify that I need to provide a JSON response, particularly with a category field. The schema indicates that it should contain specific enumerated values. Based on the ticket's content regarding Oracle time cards and submission errors, it definitely fits the \"HR Support\" category. Therefore, my final answer will be concise, just: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to avoid any unnecessary text. Let\u2019s proceed with that."
