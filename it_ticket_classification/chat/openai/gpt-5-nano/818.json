The keywords like \"new purchase,\" \"PO,\" \"keyboard,\" and \"receipts section\" point towards procurement. I\u2019m thinking the main category could be \"Purchase\" since it directly involves that process, but \"Hardware\" is also relevant because we're talking about a physical item like a keyboard. However, since categories are mutually exclusive, I\u2019ll lean towards \"Purchase\" for this ticket.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI'm trying to decide whether to categorize this IT ticket under \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" The user's request highlights procurement details, including \"new purchase,\" \"PO,\" and mentions of receipts and allocation. Given this focus, \"Purchase\" seems like the most fitting category. I need to format the output as a JSON object with the category specified. The final format should look like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. This ensures it meets the requirements properly!**Confirming response format**\n\nI need to ensure I\u2019m using the correct format for the output, which should be a JSON object as specified in the schema. The categories to choose from are clear, and I\u2019ve already determined that \"Purchase\" is the most suitable option for this IT ticket. Other categories like \"Administrative rights\" and \"HR Support\" don\u2019t fit, and the context leans heavily towards procurement. I just have to output the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. That's straightforward!"
