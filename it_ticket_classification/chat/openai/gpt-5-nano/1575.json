It's important to parse the ticket content carefully to assign it correctly. Each category has its own specific needs, so I want to ensure I'm making the right choice. Let\u2019s get this sorted accurately to streamline the process!**Reviewing network change request**\n\nIt seems like I'm dealing with a request to extend the network for Bucharest. There are notes to check about changing the range and scheduling a meeting to discuss the issues and the impact of this change, especially after the holidays. I need to look into bandwidth concerns, guest addresses, and the density of devices. This appears to be an internal IT project focusing on wireless infrastructure and associated challenges. I'll gather all relevant details and prepare accordingly!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket seems to fit best in the \"Internal Project\" category. Although \"Hardware\" might apply due to the wireless components, it's clear that \"Internal Project\" is separate and more suitable here. The output should be a JSON-like object specifying the category. The allowed values are clearly listed: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Therefore, my output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI debated \"Access\" as a potential option, but the focus is primarily on network extension.**Deciding on category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that the best category for this ticket is \"Internal Project.\" It seems to align well with the details provided, so I\u2019ll ensure to respond accordingly. It's important that I categorize it correctly to maintain organization and clarity within our IT system. Let's go ahead and finalize the response based on this conclusion to keep everything streamlined!"
