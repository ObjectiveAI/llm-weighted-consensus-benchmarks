It seems like it relates to hardware issues impacting the network connectivity, even though it might be specifically network-related. I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\"**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI'm working on categorizing a network issue with the user's laptop, which could fall under \"Hardware.\" They mentioned reattaching the antenna, suggesting a hardware-related problem. While \"Access\" and \"Miscellaneous\" crossed my mind, \"Hardware\" seems the most suitable. I'll output the category in JSON format as required.
