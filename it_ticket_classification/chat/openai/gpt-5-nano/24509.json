My best guess is to categorize it as \"Internal Project\" since it pertains to improving navigation within the platform, though \"Miscellaneous\" could also fit. Administrative rights don't seem relevant here.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI thought about using \"Software,\" but that's not an option. The best fit is \"Internal Project.\" This ticket is a request for navigation improvements, site structure, and breadcrumbs, so it clearly relates to internal project work. The output needs to be in JSON format according to the specified schema. I'll create a JSON object as follows: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That should meet the requirements without any extra text, just delivering the specified format!"
