It mentions \"new starter\" and \"Confluence,\" suggesting this might be related to onboarding, specifically setting up access. The relevant categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, and a few others. Since it involves administrative tasks for a new starter and access provisioning for Confluence, I'll classify this ticket under \"Access.\" That seems to fit best according to the context.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe text I\u2019m working with is pretty garbled, but it includes phrases like \"new starter\" and \"Confluence,\" which hints at onboarding. I think I'll categorize this as \"Access\" since it seems to involve user access provisioning for Confluence. Although it could also fit under \"HR Support,\" the IT context makes \"Access\" the better choice. I just need to provide a JSON object with the category. So, I'll respond with this JSON output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
