The ticket text is a bit messy, talking about a Windows reinstall and an allocation request. It mentions needing drive storage creation and fresh OS installs. It highlights aspects like reallocating drive space and fulfilling storage needs. So, the main points seem to revolve around storage allocation and the Windows reinstall scheduled for Thursday PM.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing an IT request that seems centered around storage allocation, drive management, and an OS install. For categorization, it could fit under \"Storage\" since it mentions drive space. There\u2019s also a reference to an administrator, which might suggest \"Administrative Rights,\" but that\u2019s not very clear. The Windows reinstall aspect points to \"Hardware,\" although it is technically software related to hardware. Ultimately, I think the best fit here is \"Storage\" since that's the primary concern.**Formatting Response as JSON**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object to categorize the IT ticket properly. The required format includes specifying the \"category\" field with values like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and so on. Based on my analysis, the best category is \"Storage.\" The schema indicates I'll need to output an object; however, the essential portion is just the category itself. So, I'll respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}\n\nI think adding a justification isn\u2019t necessary since the user just asked for categorization."
