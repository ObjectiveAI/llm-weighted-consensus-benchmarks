It sounds like this ticket falls under \"Internal Project,\" given the references to system updates and governance objectives. I'll finalize that categorization!**Evaluating IT ticket categorization**\n\nAlright, I need to categorize this ticket based on the user's detailed request regarding changes for the discipline site. It mentions a high-importance change, link modifications, and a need for updated links post-implementation. Given the nature of these changes, it could be \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, it seems most fitting as an \"Internal Project\" since it focuses on updating the IT service management system. I'll go with that!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ve determined that the best category for this ticket is \"Internal Project\" since it focuses on changes to an internal site, including governance, templates, and processes. While \"Administrative rights\" could work if rights changes were explicitly requested, it\u2019s not clear here. \"Access\" might be relevant due to link changes, but it\u2019s not about permissions. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object as required. \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
