Given the options provided, \"Storage\" is definitely a fitting category due to the mention of drive capacity. However, it might also touch on \"Hardware,\" depending on the specifics.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT Ticket, and it clearly relates to disk space and copying files, so \"Storage\" is the appropriate category. The output needs to be in a specific JSON format with a \"category\" field that corresponds to the allowed categories. I\u2019ll simply produce the response as `{\"category\":\"Storage\"}` without any extra commentary, since that's what the instructions specify. Keeping it concise is key here!"
