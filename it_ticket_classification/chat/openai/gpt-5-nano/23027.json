Let\u2019s narrow it down further!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user mentions wanting to \"make owner agile,\" \"site migrate old agile materials,\" and needing \"site administrators.\" This relates to access rights and administrative permissions. Categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" are relevant, but given the focus on provisioning admins and site ownership, \"Administrative rights\" seems most appropriate. There\u2019s also an aspect of \"Internal Project\" due to the agile practice context. Overall, I'll categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" and format my response as a JSON object."
