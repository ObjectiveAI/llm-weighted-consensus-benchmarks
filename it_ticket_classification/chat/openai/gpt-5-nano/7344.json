The ticket talks about HR-related issues like timecards and absence leave. Considering the categories available, \"HR Support\" seems to be the most fitting since it directly relates to timecard submission and leave queries. Although \"Administrative rights\" could play a role regarding access, I'm leaning more towards \"HR Support\" to match the nature of the request.**Deciding Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering the ticket about submitting timecards, which seems to primarily relate to HR issues. The user mentions not being able to submit for a week, which leans towards \"HR Support.\" There\u2019s also some mention of access or administrative rights, but the core issue is about timecard submission and leave, so \"HR Support\" fits best. I\u2019ll format this into a JSON object confirming the category, which is allowed, as follows:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
