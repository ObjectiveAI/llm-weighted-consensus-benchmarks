It seems clear that the main focus is around folder creation, which relates to file management. Since it mentions uploading files and additional information, I believe the best fit would be the \"Storage\" category. There could be a consideration for \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are involved, but \u201cStorage\u201d feels like the most appropriate choice.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object specifying the category as \"Storage\" for the IT ticket. The instruction suggests that I only need to provide the category field in the specified format. The schema expects an object with a field containing the category string. So, I\u2019ll output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}\n\nI could think about including a brief justification, but I'll stick to the instruction to keep it strictly to the category. No extra text needed!"
