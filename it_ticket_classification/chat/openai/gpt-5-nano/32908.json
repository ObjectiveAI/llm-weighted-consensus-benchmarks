After analyzing, it seems not to fit categories like hardware or access. \"Administrative rights\" could be appropriate since it involves approvals. I\u2019ll go with that classification!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket to categorize it properly. It mentions \"approve time entries,\" which seems to fit under \"Internal Project,\" as this aligns with project management. The text talks about actions related to time entries, making it clear that this isn\u2019t about hardware, HR support, access, or storage. While \"Administrative rights\" could be considered if it involved permissions, the focus here is on time entries. So, I'll categorize this as \"Internal Project\" and format the output as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
