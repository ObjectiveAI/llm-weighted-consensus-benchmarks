I think it fits into \"Administrative rights\" since changing an approver often requires admin privileges. It might also relate to \"Access,\" but \"Administrative rights\" is more accurate as it specifically involves permissions and authorization related to who approves actions. The user mentions \"please replace PM code\" and that changes have been performed, which further emphasizes the administrative aspect.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering definitions in IT ticketing categories: Access requests, Administrative rights for admin privileges, Internal Project, Miscellaneous for general requests, and Security/compliance. The user mentions \"compliance ext,\" but it's not a recognized category. Since the task involves changing an approver in a workflow, this falls under \"Administrative rights.\" I should provide the response in a JSON-like format, so I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"} and make sure to justify the choice briefly. Let\u2019s finalize this!"
