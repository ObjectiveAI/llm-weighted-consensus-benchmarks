Since those elements point to access issues, that seems like the best fit here. I'll format the JSON accordingly!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions vulnerability and disabling access to the device, along with terms like \"disable feature\" and \"engineer ext.\" I'm thinking it should be categorized as \"Access\" because it clearly concerns disabling access due to vulnerability. While \"Security\" could fit, it\u2019s not an option here. Other categories like \"Internal Project\" and \"Administrative rights\" don\u2019t apply. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format for the category as follows: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
