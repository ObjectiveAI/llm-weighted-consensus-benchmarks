The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since there isn\u2019t a specific category for \"Security\" or \"Spam,\" I'll go with \"Miscellaneous\" as the best fit.**Determining Email Category**\n\nI'm evaluating a suspicious email that's possibly related to security but doesn't fit neatly into any specific category. The closest option seems to be \"Miscellaneous\" since it doesn\u2019t align with hardware, storage, etc. There's a chance it could relate to \"Administrative rights\" but since there's no explicit mention of access issues, I'll lean towards \"Miscellaneous.\" I need to respond in a JSON format, so I\u2019ll provide: `{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}` as the final output.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
