The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the context, it seems that \"Storage\" is the best choice since the ticket involves increasing storage limits. The request seems related to multiple requests for storage capacity. I will format my output as a JSON object with the selected category and reasoning included.**Formatting the IT ticket response**\n\nI need to provide a JSON-like object for the IT ticket categorization, specifically indicating \"Storage.\" The required format is straightforward, simply stating {\"category\":\"Storage\"} without any extra commentary.\n\nIt's essential to focus on just the category, but I can still think about reasoning. \"Storage\" is the right choice because increasing the limit pertains directly to storage quotas. However, there's a slight possibility that it could relate to \"Administrative rights\" if requesting permission levels. Still, I'll stick with \"Storage\" for clarity.**Deciding on the category**\n\nI'm considering the phrase \"due to nature role numerous requests,\" which might refer to requests from different roles. There's also the mention of infrastructure and an upcoming holiday, which feels somewhat vague. The primary focus seems to be on increasing a limit, likely storage. The mention of \"environment print\" could relate to printing in an environmental context, but that doesn't fit any category. Thus, the best choice remains \"Storage,\" so I'll output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
