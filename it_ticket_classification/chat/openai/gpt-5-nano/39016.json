The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since this ticket seems to involve line manager approval for leave, it falls under HR support rather than IT. Administrative rights and Access don't apply here, so I'm leaning toward categorizing it as HR Support because it's about leave approvals.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI see that \"HR Support\" is an appropriate category for the ticket provided by the user, which mentions a line manager and approval for annual leave. It doesn't seem to fit under \"Administrative rights\" as it\u2019s not about granting access. Since the user requested a categorization, I should respond with a JSON object that includes the category. It should adhere to the specified schema, structured as: `{\"category\": \"HR Support\"}`. I'll prepare that output now!**Outputting the Category**\n\nI need to output a JSON object that includes the category field, which should be one of the allowed values. The user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, and I'm settling on \"HR Support\" since it refers to an HR process involving leave approval from a line manager. Even if there's a bit of mixed language in the text, it still falls under HR. So the final output will be: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`. Let's deliver that!"
