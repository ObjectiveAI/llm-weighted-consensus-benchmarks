There's mention of a mobile Galaxy phone and related accessories. I\u2019ll focus on clarifying this as a purchase request based on the content provided. Let's go ahead and classify it!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s IT ticket is focused on a purchase request, with mentions of a Galaxy mobile phone and associated items like screen and back covers. It\u2019s clear this relates to purchasing hardware, so I\u2019ll categorize it under \"Purchase.\" Since the instruction indicates the need for a JSON object with a specific format, I\u2019ll ensure my output matches that requirement exactly. The final response will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"} \n\nI think that neatly covers everything!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
