The ticket clearly indicates an issue with the cable being too short, so it's a request related to cabling. Looking over the provided categories, it seems like the best fit is \"Hardware\" since it's about the cable itself. However, it could also potentially be categorized as \"Purchase\" if they need to buy a longer cable.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket is about a cable being too short, which means we need to extend or replace it with a longer one. Looking at the categories, \"Hardware\" seems the best fit since it's a physical item. Although \"Miscellaneous\" could apply as a general category, categorizing it as \"Hardware\" is more accurate. \n\nNow, I need to present this as a JSON object. So the output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Finalizing category**\n\nI want to make sure the category string value matches the enumeration exactly, so it needs to be \"Hardware\" with a capital \"H.\" I\u2019m confident about this classification. \n\nWhile \"Access\" could be a consideration\u2014since it's on the second floor\u2014the cable is primarily a hardware issue related to the TV. So, I\u2019ll stick with \"Hardware.\" \n\nThe final answer will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
