The ticket talks about various leaver processes, like de-provisioning access, mailbox management, and AD rights. It seems like the best fit would be the \"Access\" category because there are so many elements related to access rights and profiles. However, since there are some references to specific administrative rights, I also need to consider that. But \"Access\" feels like the strongest choice here!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions various elements like \"leaver,\" \"approver,\" and \"token.\" Since the user asked to categorize it, the reasonable choice seems to be \"Access.\" I need to ensure my response goes in a strict JSON format as per the provided schema. I'll output the category directly as required:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nI'll make sure to keep it simple and clear, without any additional text, for easy parsing!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
