Since there isn\u2019t a specific category for \u201cSoftware\u201d or \"IT Support,\" I think \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d might be the best fit, as it's not related to any hardware or storage issues.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe access in this ticket seems to refer more to a search functionality issue within Outlook rather than feature access rights. \"Miscellaneous\" is likely the best fit since it\u2019s a generic IT problem. While \"Administrative rights\" could factor in if settings needed adjusting, it doesn't seem relevant here. So, I'll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" and respond with a JSON-like object that indicates this, formatted according to the specified schema for the category.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
