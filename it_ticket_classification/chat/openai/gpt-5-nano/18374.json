There are details about a leaver form, mailbox access, user rights, and various approvals needed. It seems to be mostly about HR support and administrative access, with some emphasis on storage and inventory.**Analyzing offboarding ticket**\n\nThe ticket includes terms like \"roaming profile,\" \"AD rights,\" \"personal mailbox,\" and \"mobile phone subscription,\" which clearly indicate it's related to offboarding. I need to categorize it from the choices: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The best fit seems to be \"Access\" since it deals with user rights and mailbox access. There's also a mention of \"Storage,\" but that's not the main focus. Overall, \"Access\" captures the essence of offboarding and revoking access effectively.**Structuring JSON response**\n\nI'm finalizing the output for the IT ticket category. Since the prompt specifies to categorize it as a JSON object, I know I need to ensure that the \"category\" field accurately reflects the appropriate classification. Based on my reasoning, I'll set the category to \"Access.\" This matches the expected format and values. So my response will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI'll make sure it's clean JSON, with no extra details\u2014just what the system requires!"
