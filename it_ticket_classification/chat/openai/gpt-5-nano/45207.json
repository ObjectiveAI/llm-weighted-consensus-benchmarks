The categories available include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" The ticket addresses issues with visibility of annual leave days and notifications related to absences and leave requests. Since this involves HR system functionality, \"HR Support\" is likely the most suitable category. While \"Access\" might seem relevant, it really pertains to HR leave management, so I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support\" for my response.**Producing JSON Output**\n\nThe prompt is asking me to categorize an IT ticket using the provided schema. I know I need to format my response correctly in JSON. The appropriate category for this ticket is \"HR Support,\" so I will write it as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I don't need to include any analysis details in my final output\u2014just the category will suffice. I\u2019m ready to deliver this!"
