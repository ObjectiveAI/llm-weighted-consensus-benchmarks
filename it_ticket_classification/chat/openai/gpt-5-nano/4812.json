The user text is quite garbled and mentions \"caps,\" which makes me think of \"caps lock.\" It looks like they\u2019re possibly asking about changes related to caps and how they operate during certain hours. Since the message is unclear, I'll need to determine the best category based on what I can interpret.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m interpreting the content mentioning \"caps pilot,\" which might refer to \"Caps Lock\" or even some project involving \"CAPS.\" The phrase \"how are started during hours\" suggests it could be about processes running during certain times. It\u2019s unclear, making it tricky to categorize. I\u2019m considering \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" but since the message is garbled, I think \"Miscellaneous\" might be the safest bet until I get clearer information on its intent.**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize a ticket. From what I\u2019m seeing, it seems related to \"caps pilot\" and \"updates.\" This could suggest it\u2019s an \"Internal Project\" if it involves a pilot project for the \"CAPS\" system. Terms like \"automatically\" and \"during hours\" hint at schedule automation. Since there\u2019s a bit of ambiguity, the safest choice is \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll summarize by saying the category is \"Internal Project,\" noting that it references the \"caps pilot\" and automation updates.**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize a ticket, and I should respond with a JSON object based on the specified format. The category I've chosen is \"Internal Project.\" According to the instructions, I\u2019ll structure my output as a JSON object with a category field. So, I\u2019ll provide: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019m considering whether to include a brief reasoning, but since the requirement is to follow the schema, I\u2019ll stick with just the JSON output. Let's go with that!"
