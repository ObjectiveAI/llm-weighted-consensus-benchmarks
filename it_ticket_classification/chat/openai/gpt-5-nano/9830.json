Since the predefined categories offer \"Purchase,\" this fits perfectly. \n\nSo, I'll respond with a JSON object designating that category as the appropriate classification for this ticket.**Confirming category classification**\n\nI\u2019m determining that the appropriate category for this ticket is \"Purchase.\" While it could potentially fall under \"Hardware,\" the focus is definitely on purchasing a \"professional backpack.\" Since the request clearly indicates a \"new purchase,\" I'll confidently choose \"Purchase\" as the category. \n\nI\u2019ll output a neat JSON object to match the specified format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there are no extra words, just the straightforward response. Let\u2019s deliver that now!"
