This seems to relate to a backup or recovery issue. Looking at the available categories, \u201cStorage\u201d appears to be the best fit since it covers backup and recovery points. Other categories like \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d or \u201cAccess\u201d don\u2019t seem relevant here. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and classify this ticket as \u201cStorage.\u201d**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to craft a response in JSON format for the category of the IT ticket. The instructions specify I should provide a structured output that includes a category field. The expected format is an object with the property \u201ccategory.\u201d \n\nI realize it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. However, to align with the schema, I must return the entire structure including the type. So I\u2019ll make sure to format the response correctly, sticking to the required schema specifications.**Finalizing JSON Output**\n\nThe user wants the content formatted as {\"category\":\"Storage\"}, and I need to stick to that standard without adding any extra explanation. It\u2019s clear and straightforward. I\u2019ll make sure the final answer is just the necessary JSON. So, I\u2019m ready to provide: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} without any additional text. Keeping it simple is the goal here, so let\u2019s go ahead and present it in the correct structure."
