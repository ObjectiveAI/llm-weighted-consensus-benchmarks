The available categories are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nNext, I\u2019ll analyze the content of the user's message to find the best-fitting category. It seems to relate to HR or Administrative rights, but I want to be sure before I choose. I'll format my response as a JSON object with the selected category.**Interpreting IT ticket request**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a text from an IT ticket where the user mentions a \u201cproject space for graduates\u201d and requests to create a graduates program and add training exercises. It seems like they're looking for something related to setting up an internal project. The category \"Internal Project\" seems most fitting, but there's some ambiguity about access rights. If they need administrative rights, \"Administrative rights\" could work too. I\u2019ll choose the best fit based on this information.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nThe ticket mentions \u201cadministrator training exercises\u201d but doesn't explicitly request access rights. It mainly focuses on creating a project space and those exercises. Given that, \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems like the best category. I want to ensure I format my output correctly as a JSON object.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll return: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It's important to follow the correct syntax and deliver this in a clear and succinct way!"
