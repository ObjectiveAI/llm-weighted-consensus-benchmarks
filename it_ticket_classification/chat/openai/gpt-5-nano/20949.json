The text includes mentions of \"new headphones,\" a request to \"please provide headphones,\" and that the issue involves the \"old ones going off.\" It seems clear that this is about requesting new headphones. So, I should lean towards the \"Hardware\" category since it involves equipment, but the \"Purchase\" category is also relevant as they are requesting new ones. I'll select \"Hardware.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nI need to figure out how to categorize this IT ticket. It mentions \"new headphones\" and \"please provide headphones.\" If we're distinguishing between requesting hardware and a purchase, \"Purchase\" could fit since it's about procurement. However, since it's clearly about providing new headphones instead of just buying, it seems like a hardware request. I'd opt for \"Hardware\" because it\u2019s an equipment issue related to asset assignment. I'll prepare a JSON response with the category specified.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
