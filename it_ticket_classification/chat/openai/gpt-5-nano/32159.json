The terms like \"people management,\" \"approvers,\" and \"delegates\" suggest it might relate to IT security or HR workflows. Since the content indicates a link to approvals in Oracle HCM, the best categories to consider here could be \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" due to the context of managing approval notifications.**Interpreting Oracle approval notifications**\n\nI\u2019m parsing a request about whether it's possible to stop receiving approval tasks that have already been approved within Oracle. This involves filtering notifications related to \"approvers\" and \"delegates.\" It seems they want to avoid receiving notifications for tasks that are no longer relevant. The appropriate categories to consider might be \"Access,\" related to permissions and workflows, but \"Administrative rights\" might not fit here since it\u2019s more focused on notification management rather than privilege granting. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too vague, so I'll skip that.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m deciding to categorize this ticket as \"Access\" since it relates to approvals and delegates, which are tied to access and permissions. The mention of \"people management\" hints at HR, but the focus is clearly on how approvals work in Oracle. I'll prepare my final response in a JSON format to fit the requirements. The user asked to categorize the ticket, so I\u2019ll just provide the necessary category object without extra commentary. Here it is:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nIt seems the platform sometimes requires plain text for responses. The instruction indicates that my output needs to be in a format that can be parsed by code, specifically as a JSON object. So, I\u2019ll focus on just providing the necessary category information in that structure. Therefore, I\u2019m responding with:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}  \n\nThat keeps it simple and in the right format!"
