The ticket mentions \"folder issues\" and \"privilege,\" which leads me to think it could fit under categories like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Storage.\" \n\nThe user hasn't been specific, so it's a bit tricky. Since there are clear references to folder permissions and actions required, I'll lean towards categorizing it as \"Access\" since that seems most fitting.**Interpreting ticket details**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the text: \"dear help locally folder making privilege certain action done person thank.\" It seems like the user might be referring to a local folder permission issue where they need privileges to perform certain actions. This definitely relates to access control. \n\nThe categories to consider include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since they mention needing privileges for certain actions, \"Administrative rights\" seems most appropriate. So, I'll go with that as the best fit.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
