The text is quite noisy with repeated phrases like \"decommissioning\" and \"order decommission.\" Since this seems related to an IT device or service decommissioning process, I\u2019m considering categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or maybe even \"Access.\" If it\u2019s specifically about a server, then \"Hardware\" might be the best fit. Overall, I think \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" are the closest matches.**Categorizing decommissioning request**\n\nThe user provided phrases that suggest they want to decommission something, possibly a server or asset, and are asking about the decommission schedule. I need to find the right category for this ticket. \"Internal Project\" comes to mind as it relates to IT tasks. \"Administrative rights\" doesn't fit here. I could consider \"Hardware\" if it refers to decommissioning specific hardware assets. However, since it\u2019s primarily about the decommissioning process, \"Internal Project\" seems like the safest choice.**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object for the category based on the user's IT ticket. The available categories are listed in the prompt, and it seems the most fitting one is \"Internal Project.\" I'll format my response like this: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. \n\nWhile I consider if \"Miscellaneous\" might be safer, the repeated mention of \"decommission\" clearly relates to a project, so \"Internal Project\" feels right. Lastly, I\u2019ll stick to the required format without additional justification, even though they sometimes ask for more details."
