The issue involves a laptop RAM memory upgrade related to performance when running multiple programs. Since it's mainly about hardware, particularly RAM upgrades, I'll classify it under \"Hardware.\" However, if it implies requesting a purchase for more RAM, it could also fall under \"Purchase.\" Given the context, it seems most appropriate to go with \"Hardware\" for this categorization.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this ticket for routing to the right team. The mention of \"RAM memory upgrade\" clearly points to hardware. If it were a request for new hardware, then \"Purchase\" would apply, but I think it fits best in \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll create a JSON object with the \"category\" field formatted as per the required structure and clarify that the correct category is indeed \"Hardware.\" The final output will just be the JSON without extra text.**Confirming JSON structure**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize the IT ticket. I need to provide a JSON output with just the category. It should be formatted as: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. Even though there's a specified schema for validation, it seems safe to exclude the extra wrappers and just go with the essential JSON. So I'll stick to the brief answer without any additional commentary and confirm the category as \"Hardware.\""
