Since they're requesting a physical cable, it seems most fitting to classify it under Hardware because it's directly related to a hardware item. However, it could also fit into Purchase since they require the cable to be supplied. I'll choose the Hardware category for clarity.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIt looks like I'm figuring out how to categorize an IT ticket. The user mentions a request for an \"additional cable for monitor,\" which seems more like a hardware request rather than software-related. While there's a mention of \"programming needs,\" it's likely just a misinterpretation. I think the best fit for this ticket is \"Hardware,\" since it directly pertains to cables and monitors. So, I\u2019ll create a JSON object with the category set to \"Hardware.\"{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
