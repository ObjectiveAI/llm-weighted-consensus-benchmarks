The provided categories list eight options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The content of the ticket seems a bit jumbled, mentioning contracts, user rights, and the need for additional information. I\u2019ll sort this ticket into one of these categories, but the content is pretty messy!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThis IT ticket is about contracts, user rights, and extracting contract types, along with a summary sheet and various requests for additional information. I'm trying to determine which category fits best. It could align with \"Access\" since the user is asking for help concerning their rights related to the contracts system, possibly under module billing. While \"Administrative rights\" is another option, I think \"Access\" makes the most sense due to the emphasis on user rights.**Preparing the JSON response**\n\nI need to provide a short justification for the category selection in the response, which must be in a JSON format. The category property has to be a string from the listed options. For this IT ticket, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" based on the user's request regarding user rights. The final output will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nSince the instructions tell me to avoid extra commentary, I'll stick to just this category in the response."
