However, \"Hardware\" might also fit since the items mentioned are hardware. I\u2019ll lean towards \"Purchase\" since the emphasis seems on the order details and logging installation.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nIt seems the user is asking to categorize a purchase order and record installation details. Given that \u201cPurchase\u201d is separate from \u201cHardware,\u201d it fits well with the purchase context in the message. The ticket asks for a specific categorization, so I need to respond in a JSON-like format, specifically, `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. The guidelines indicate I should provide just this category object, focusing on clarity in my response.**Providing the category response**\n\nThe user expects a straightforward response formatted like this: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. I need to confirm that this fits well since the ticket is undoubtedly centered on new purchases, including a headset, mouse, and backpack, along with installation details and receipts. The primary category here is clearly \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll respond simply with `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}` and avoid any extra commentary to keep it clear and concise."
