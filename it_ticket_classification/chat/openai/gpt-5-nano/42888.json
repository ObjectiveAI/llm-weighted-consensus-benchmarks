They mentioned terms like \"leaver ad,\" \"two leavers,\" and \"terminated,\" which clearly relates to HR issues. It seems best suited for the \"HR Support\" category since it deals with ex-employees and potentially involves access to accounts. Although it could also fit in \"Access,\" given the context of disabling access for terminated employees, \"HR Support\" seems to be the most appropriate choice here.**Categorizing access issues**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the offboarding process related to access deprovisioning. Based on the user\u2019s message, I\u2019m torn between categorizing it under \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\" Since it focuses on deprovisioning access, \"Access\" seems more precise, yet there are HR elements involved like \"forms for two leavers\" and \"terminated.\" However, as this is an IT ticket, \"Access\" fits best for access control issues. So, I\u2019ll output the category as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
