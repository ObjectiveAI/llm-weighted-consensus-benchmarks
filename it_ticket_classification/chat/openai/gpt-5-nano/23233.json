The ticket describes a new purchase involving an Android Nexus device and mentions installation and receipts. \n\nIt seems the best fit is \"Purchase,\" since it's specifically about procurement. I briefly considered \"Hardware\" because it's a device, but \"Purchase\" captures the core of the request the best. Logging installation doesn't warrant categorizing it as \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project.\"**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing a ticket that mentions a new purchase of an Android Nexus device, along with details about installation and the need for receipts. The focus on purchase orders and receipts makes me think it best fits the \u201cPurchase\u201d category.\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object, ensuring it has the right structure. So, I\u2019ll simply produce: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It\u2019s straightforward, and I\u2019m ensuring everything aligns with the required format!"
