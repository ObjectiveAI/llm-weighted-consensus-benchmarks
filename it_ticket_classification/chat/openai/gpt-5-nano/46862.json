It seems like the ticket discusses a change process that's incomplete, the automated line change process, and an access link for line manager change requests. Additionally, there's a mention of contacting someone if there are difficulties. The text is jumbled, but it revolves around these key ideas, which could help in accurately categorizing it for further action.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIn this IT ticket, there's mention of a \"line change process,\" \"change request,\" and an \"access link,\" which suggests it relates primarily to access rights or administrative tasks. The text is quite garbled, but the references to line manager change requests and the need for assistance hint at a request for modification rather than anything related to hardware. Given all these details, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nIt seems the ticket pertains to \"Access\" related to change requests since it discusses how to access a link for a line manager to submit those requests. If it's more about granting rights to perform changes, it could be \"Administrative rights.\" However, given the mention of an \"access link\" and the focus on the change request process, I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"Access.\" \"Miscellaneous\" would be a backup option. I\u2019ll format this in a JSON-like object for clarity, indicating \"category\": \"Access.\"{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Access\"}}"
