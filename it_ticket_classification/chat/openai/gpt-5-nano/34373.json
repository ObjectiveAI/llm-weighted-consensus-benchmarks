It seems like the user is asking for help to find a workstation developer. The phrase \u201ccare sa se find\u201d translates roughly to \"what to find\" or \"help to find.\" The content suggests that something is not working, probably related to the workstation. So the ticket should be categorized under \"technical support\" or \"workstation issues.\"**Mapping IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the content provided. The phrases \"not working\" and \"working\" suggest a hardware issue, possibly related to a workstation for a developer. The Romanian phrase \"care sa se find\" implies asking about a workstation, which reinforces the idea of malfunction. \n\nWhile it could fit into \"Access\" if the user is looking for help, the best classification for this ticket seems to be under the \"Hardware\" category due to the mention of a workstation issue.**Providing JSON category tag**\n\nI know I need to provide a JSON category tag specifically labeled \"Hardware.\" The format requires me to follow a schema that includes a wrapper, but it seems the essential output is just the category itself. \n\nWhile I could consider \"Internal Project\" due to the mention of \"workstation developer,\" the clearer choice remains \"Hardware.\" To keep it concise and avoid unnecessary text, I'll return just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
