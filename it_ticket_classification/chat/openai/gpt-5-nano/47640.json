So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and maybe provide a brief justification based on the user's request.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that includes a category field. The provided schema outlines that I should use the category value of \"HR Support\" based on the context given in the ticket, like \"check people manager oracle\" and \"manager change.\"\n\nThis clearly relates to HR management. So, I'll format my response as JSON: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I'll ensure that it's precisely structured, without any heavy formatting or additional commentary, so it matches the expected schema perfectly."
