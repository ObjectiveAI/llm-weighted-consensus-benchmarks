The request involves allowing changes to meetings in a calendar or booking system. This seems to fit either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given that it focuses on granting permissions to modify meeting schedules, I think \"Administrative rights\" is the more appropriate category for this ticket.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket involves granting modify rights for booking meetings in specific rooms\u2014Thames and Danube. While both \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" apply, \"Administrative rights\" is more precise since it directly refers to permissions for modifying events. The user wants the ability to change meetings for these two rooms specifically, making \"Administrative rights\" the better fit. I'll categorize this ticket as \"Administrative rights\" and respond with a JSON-like structure for clarity.**Formatting the Response**\n\nThe system requires a specific JSON format for the response. It looks like I need to provide just the category string in a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. The prompt explicitly asks to categorize the IT ticket, and since we've determined \"Administrative rights\" is the right category, I\u2019ll follow the schema closely. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text and that the quotes are properly formatted for clear consumption by the system."
