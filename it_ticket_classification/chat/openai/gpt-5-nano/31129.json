The user's message is about importing contacts to Active Directory (AD), which implies a need for assistance. It could fit several categories like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or possibly \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll parse the text carefully to make the best categorization choice. There's a lot here, so I want to ensure I get it right!**Categorizing the IT request**\n\nThe user wants to import contacts into Active Directory (AD), which points me toward specific categories. It could be \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project,\" depending on how the taxonomy works. Since modifying AD typically requires administrative rights, I need to keep that in mind. The ticket indicates a request for access, but there\u2019s no explicit tag for AD in the categories listed. I\u2019ll decide between \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" based on the context.**Determining the appropriate category**\n\nThe task involves importing contacts into Active Directory (AD), which indicates a likely category of \"Access\" related to user provisioning and account changes. While \"Administrative rights\" suggests administrative access, the focus is on the import task itself. I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category in this case. I also need to ensure I respond correctly in JSON format, as per the specified output structure for the IT ticket categorization.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
