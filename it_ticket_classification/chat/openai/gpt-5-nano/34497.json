It mentions phrases like \"Windows phone activation request,\" \"password reset,\" and \"template.\" \n\nConsidering the specified categories, I think the best fit might be \"Access\" since the ticket primarily concerns account access issues related to activation and password resetting. The details seem scattered, but the focus on accessing tools suggests Access is the right choice. I'll go with that!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket clearly revolves around \"password reset,\" \"activation,\" and \"templates,\" likely referring to Snow (ServiceNow) templates. Since it mentions \"password reset,\" I think it's primarily an access-related issue. The proper category could be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but there's no clear request for admin rights. So, \"Access\" makes the most sense here. \n\nI'll format the response as JSON, like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra text needed!**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019ve concluded that this ticket is focused on a password reset rather than administrative rights. While there\u2019s a mention of \"HR Support,\" that isn't relevant here. So, \"Access\" is definitely the right category. \n\nI need to respond with simple JSON formatting. The instruction is clear about categorizing the IT ticket, so I'll just return the JSON without any extra formatting. Here it goes: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
