The user seems to need help setting it up, which leads me to think \"Miscellaneous\" is a fitting choice since it doesn't strictly fit the other categories like \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\" If it had referenced specific projects, \"Internal Project\" could work too, but since it didn\u2019t, I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll craft a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
