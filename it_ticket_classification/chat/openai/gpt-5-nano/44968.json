The phrases \"issue adding user\" and \"she helped resolve issue with adding projects\" suggest it relates to user access or administrative rights. The \"Access\" category fits nicely, covering logins and user additions. Alternatively, \"Administrative rights\" might apply if they're requesting admin privileges. There's also mention of projects, pointing to \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll weigh these options carefully!**Categorizing ticket concisely**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"she helped resolve issue with adding projects,\" which is a bit jumbled. The best category for \"issue adding user\" seems to be \"Access,\" as it relates directly to user management and access control. \"Administrative rights\" might apply if it were about granting permissions, but since the focus is on adding users and projects, I think \"Access\" is the right fit. I\u2019ll respond with a simple JSON format like `{\"category\":\"Access\"}` to meet the requirements!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
