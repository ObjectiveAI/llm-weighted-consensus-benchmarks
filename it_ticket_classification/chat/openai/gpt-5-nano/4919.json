Alternatively, \"Administrative rights\" could work if it involves access to contract mapping. But overall, I think \"Purchase\" is the right fit. I\u2019ll need to respond with a JSON object specifying the category. The prompt is asking for a straightforward categorization, so I should keep it clear and simple. Here's what I'll output: `{\"type\":\"category\",\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`.**Outputting category in JSON format**\n\nI need to respond to the instruction about valid channel content by providing the required \"category\" as a JSON object. The most straightforward response is to state the category as \"Purchase.\" While I could add reasoning, the instructions clearly indicate that I should stick to just the categorization. Following the schema provided, I'll deliver it in the exact format specified. So, I'll output: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}` as the response."
