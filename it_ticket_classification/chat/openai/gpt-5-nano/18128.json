also finally done confirmation about resolution found looking link help troubleshooting automatic problems environments after has succeed workload also partially transferred highest cpu memory usage occur again primary instance shown captures memory enough paging occurs compensate partially by allocated disk necessities additional effort cpu handle requests more less performance definitely

capture best regards technical consultant wednesday march task has assigned hi please advised queue best regards engineer wednesday march task has assigned please advised record number has assigned please review details take appropriate action description tuesday march pm re prod secondary replica worked expected hi again additional information during step re index import process founded logs thanks tuesday march pm prod secondary replica worked expected hi went down due issues morning far poll running primary node status down issues related directly needed please investigate highlighted issue assumption secondary replica worked expected caused prod application down app restart helped fix issue attached log file relevant logs warn secure entity error closing invalid object closed error rest integrations configuration status core entity error database found error rest integrations configuration status error getting thread warn issue index error indexing issue dropping folded core entity unable establish database unable database because replica role resolving which allow operation again later caused by unable database because replica role resolving which allow operation again later further assistance please let sorry thanks engineer summary prod secondary replica worked expected number priority low assignment location center ref msg"
