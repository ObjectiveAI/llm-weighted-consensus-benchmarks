I think \"Miscellaneous\" is a safe choice since it covers various topics without clear categorization. The content revolves around task imports and updates, which doesn't point specifically to hardware or access issues. Given these factors, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the best option.**Preparing category output**\n\nI'm thinking that the category should be \"Miscellaneous.\" I need to create a JSON-like output according to the specified format. The instruction requires that I respond with a category object that includes allowed values. It seems I should output something like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. \n\nI want to make sure the formatting is perfect because the application expects it that way. There\u2019s no need for the \"type\":\"object\" wrapper. So, I\u2019ll just provide: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
