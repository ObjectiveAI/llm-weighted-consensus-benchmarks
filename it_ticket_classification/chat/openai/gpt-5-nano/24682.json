The user is asking for write/upload permissions related to updating files and folder layouts. This suggests the category should be \"Access\" since it's about permission control. It could potentially fall under \"Administrative rights,\" but unless it's specifically about those rights, \"Access\" seems more accurate. So, I'll categorize this ticket under \"Access,\" considering the request for write/upload permissions is the main focus.**Outputting category schema**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on the content asking for \"write upload permissions.\" There's a bit of confusion about \"December PM,\" but it seems to relate to permissions for files, folders, layouts, and forms, so it indicates access control. Given the required schema, I'll create a JSON object with \"Access\" as the category. The output should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll ensure it meets the format while following the system's requirements for plain text.**Confirming JSON output**\n\nThe spec indicates I need to output a JSON object for the category, which should just be a string enumerating options. The valid channels require it in plain text, so since the user wants to categorize, I\u2019ll stick to the format provided. According to the earlier tasks, it should be structured as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I just need to make sure I respond in the designated \"final\" channel without any extra text or whitespace. So, I'll confirm the output as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
