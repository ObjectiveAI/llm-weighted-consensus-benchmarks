This might involve altering access to survey results or determining who has the ability to change respondent information. It seems like a crucial factor when managing data securely. I'll need to clarify what permissions might be necessary for those actions to maintain privacy and integrity. It\u2019s important to get this right!**Identifying issue category**\n\nI need to analyze the text to determine its context. It seems that the discussion revolves around changes to respondents, with various requests and references to a survey related to an internal project, not necessarily a hardware or administrative rights issue. Given the mention of dates and surveys, it fits under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I want to make sure I'm categorizing this correctly so I can assist effectively!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve determined that the context is tied to an \"Internal Project,\" focusing on survey management. So, when categorizing this IT ticket, I\u2019ll stick with \"Internal Project.\" I know I need to format this as a JSON object with the required categories. The schema I have shows the category field needs to be defined, so I'll respond with the properly structured JSON while ensuring \u201cInternal Project\u201d is highlighted. Here\u2019s what it looks like:\n\n{\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}**Outputting JSON category**\n\nIt looks like the required output is indeed a JSON object with just the chosen category. The prompt specifically asks to categorize the IT ticket, and based on previous tasks, I've seen that returning only the category value suffices. Since I need to reflect that structure, I'll go ahead and format it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nThat fulfills the requirement, and I\u2019ll be sure to provide just this JSON object without any extra text."
