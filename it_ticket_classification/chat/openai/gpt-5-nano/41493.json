It seems most related to \"Purchase\" since it's about procuring frames and involves cost discussions, but I\u2019m considering \"Hardware\" as well since frames could be seen as hardware.**Finalizing category output**\n\nI'm working on categorizing a procurement process. The available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The ticket refers to \"aluminum frames,\" suggesting it\u2019s related to purchasing hardware items. Since there seems to be an issue with purchase requisitions and approvals, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Purchase.\" Now I need to create the final output as a valid JSON object: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nThis keeps everything clear without any extra text!**Deciding on category**\n\nI need to provide a minimal answer for the category, and if I'm uncertain, I could consider \"Miscellaneous.\" However, I think \"Purchase\" fits better because the issue is about procurement and requisition codes. So, I'll stick with \"Purchase\" for clarity and accuracy. It seems to be the most relevant choice for categorizing this ticket. Now, I just need to finalize and respond!"
