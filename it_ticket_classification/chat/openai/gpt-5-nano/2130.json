I want to determine the best fit for this ticket, weighing the clues to see where they most logically belong.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI've got to figure out how to categorize the IT ticket based on the given options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. It seems the best fit is \"Access,\" especially since it relates to a new client's network access and possibly IP addresses. \"Administrative Rights\" doesn't quite fit since the ticket doesn\u2019t mention specific permissions. To keep it straightforward, I\u2019ll respond with the required category format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
