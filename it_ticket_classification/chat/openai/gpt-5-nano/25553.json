Since the request is ambiguous, I could lean towards \"Hardware\" or maybe even \"Miscellaneous\" if I can't clarify what they mean. I should consider asking the user for more details.**Deciding on a ticket category**\n\nThe user's message \"Tray out hi guys tray room please everything supposed\" is unclear but might suggest something related to a tray in a room. The expression \"everything supposed\" could indicate a reset request. I think the most logical categorization would be \"Hardware\" since \"tray\" implies it's about a device component, possibly a printer tray. Due to the ambiguity, \"Miscellaneous\" could also be an option, but I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" to stay safe.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
