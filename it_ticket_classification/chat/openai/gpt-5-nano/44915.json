I must ensure that I'm accurately matching the ticket's issue with the appropriate category for efficient handling. Let\u2019s proceed with the categorization!**Analyzing messy ticket text**\n\nI've got a very messy ticket to analyze. It mentions missing timesheets for direct reports, the need to submit them weekly, and some notes about absence like maternity leave. This seems to fit an HR or administrative process, particularly covering timesheet submissions and following the required procedures. I\u2019ll need to carefully categorize this ticket to ensure it gets addressed properly since it involves important employee records and compliance issues. Let's categorize it accurately!**Determining the correct category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize this ticket appropriately. It seems to fit best under \"HR Support\" because it discusses timesheets, weekly submissions, approvals, and direct reports related to HR processes. So, I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support\" for the category. \n\nNow, I need to return this as a JSON object. The right format is {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Although the schema outlines some details, I just need to present the object itself without the wrapper. So let's finalize that output!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
