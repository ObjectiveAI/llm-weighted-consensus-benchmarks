This clearly falls under the category of hardware. Other categories like Access or Purchase could apply, but given the context, it\u2019s definitely more suitable as Hardware. The ticket specifically mentions the need for hardware equipment during November. So, I'll classify this ticket under Hardware, since that's the most fitting choice based on their request.**Outputting JSON for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering that the request is specifically for a \"temporary mouse and charger.\" Since this clearly relates to hardware, it aligns with the appropriate category. In the context of the IT ticket, it's best to use the expected JSON format. So, I\u2019ll present the response strictly as a JSON object with \"category\" set to \"Hardware.\" There\u2019s no need for any extra text, just the clear and concise output as specified. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
