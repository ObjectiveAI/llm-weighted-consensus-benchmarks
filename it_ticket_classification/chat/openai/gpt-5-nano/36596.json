Given the keywords, this might fit under the \"Access\" category since it likely involves contact management or permissions in a system like Active Directory. I\u2019m considering \"Administrative rights\" too, but I'm not entirely sure.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI believe \"Access\" is the most suitable category for the ticket, as it pertains to permissions for adding contacts. The ticket mentions \"unable to add external contacts,\" indicating a functional issue. While \"Administrative rights\" relates to admin permissions specifically, \"Connect\" seems to imply connectivity concerns. Given the context, I'm deciding on \"Access\" since it aligns with the ability to add external contacts. I'll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Preparing response for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m settling on the category \"Access\" for the IT ticket. Since the instructions specify to categorize the ticket without adding extra details, I'll simply provide the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nIt seems like the UI expects just a straightforward response in either plain text or JSON, so I won\u2019t include any clarifying questions this time. Keeping it simple is the goal, so I'm ready to respond directly with just that category."
