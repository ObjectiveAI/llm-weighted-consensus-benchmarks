If the ticket is specifically asking for admin rights, then \"Administrative rights\" would be accurate. However, since it mainly wants permission for accessing something, categorizing it as \"Access\" feels safer. I'll return a JSON-format object with the appropriate category.**Outputting IT category**\n\nThe category schema provided is clear: I'm required to respond with a JSON object. The user's request indeed implies they want permission related to \"zone awards\" but isn't necessarily asking for elevated admin rights. Given the ungrammatical nature of the request, it indicates a general permission request rather than specific hardware or storage needs. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \u201cAccess.\u201d My response will be a straightforward JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to follow the format without any extra text."
