The message is about adding people to a project code and assigning them permissions, which suggests it\u2019s mainly about access management. Thus, the likely categories are \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" Considering that it mentions adding people to a project code, the most suitable category seems to be \"Access\" since it deals directly with granting access to the project.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI've decided that the best category for this ticket is \"Access.\" While it could involve \"Administrative rights\" since adding people to a project code might grant them those rights, the focus is clearly on granting access. \"Internal Project\" could be a consideration too, but the request primarily revolves around adding users to a project code. However, \"Access\" remains the simplest and most accurate choice, as it encapsulates the main intent of the request.**Selecting category for IT ticket**\n\nThe request to \"add people to project code\" and \"assign code\" suggests that access may be necessary, even if it doesn\u2019t explicitly mention admin rights. Although the exact meaning of \"assign code\" isn't entirely clear, the focus is on categorizing the ticket. Therefore, I'll select \"Access\" as the category. Then, I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object following the spec, ensuring it looks like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
