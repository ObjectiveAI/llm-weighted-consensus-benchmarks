The categories available include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket mentions \"project code\" and \"forms attached,\" which suggests it could fit into \"Internal Project.\" However, if it\u2019s about access rights, \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could be appropriate, especially with the mention of \u201cpre code.\u201d So, I'm weighing these options to decide on the best category.**Deciding on category classification**\n\nSince the ticket content is ambiguous, I might consider asking for clarification. However, I can categorize it as \"Internal Project\" because it references a project and related forms. \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant, but there's no clear indication that access rights are involved. If it's unclear, I could consider \"Miscellaneous.\" Ultimately, I\u2019ll classify the ticket as \"Internal Project\" due to mentions of \"project code\" and \"forms attached.\" I could suggest a subcategory of \"Project management,\" but I just need to confirm the main category.**Formatting the output correctly**\n\nI need to output a JSON-like category object as specified in the prompt. The request is to categorize the IT Ticket and the allowed categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the context, I will return the following:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to deliver just that JSON without any extra text or explanation. It's about following the instructions precisely!"
