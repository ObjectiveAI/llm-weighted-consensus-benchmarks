The text is a bit jumbled, but they clearly mention needing help with a monitor that won't turn on and refer to previous issues. I see they want to categorize this ticket from a list. Given that the primary concern is about the monitor, it definitely falls under the Hardware category. So, I'll categorize it as Hardware.I'm considering whether to categorize the IT ticket as \"Purchase\" since the user is requesting a monitor replacement. They mention needing a monitor and refer to their old one that they\u2019ve had for years. However, it seems their main issue is that the monitor won\u2019t turn on, which suggests it belongs in the \"Hardware\" category. According to the instructions, I should respond with a succinct JSON object, so I\u2019ll format it as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Let's keep this simple!"
