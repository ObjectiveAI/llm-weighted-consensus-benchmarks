I\u2019ll need to format my response as a JSON object with the category field. It's all about sticking to the provided categories, so I'll keep it straightforward in my final output!**Inferring ticket category**\n\nI need to determine the category for the ticket based on the user's message. It mentions a \"password reset,\" which usually falls under the \"Access\" category. There's also a mention of \"Administrative rights,\" but that's for granting admin privileges. Since the message focuses mainly on access issues, I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category. Other details about sick leave and chores just add extra noise but aren't relevant to categorization. So, I'll go with \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
