The user's ticket is messy, mentioning \"MS dashboard\" and issues like \"multiple trends showing\" and \"empty trend.\" It seems to revolve around data visualization, likely indicating a data quality issue. I\u2019m thinking it could fit under Internal Project, though Access might also apply. I should clarify further with the user if needed!**Classifying the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user is asking about issues related to trends and empty data in their dashboard, which points toward \"Internal Project.\" This ticket seems to focus on dashboard data in ServiceNow, so the categories of Hardware, HR Support, or Storage don't fit. I\u2019m thinking \u201cInternal Project\u201d is the best choice since it's about a development or reporting task. I should respond with a JSON object specifying the category as \"Internal Project\": {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let\u2019s make sure to format the JSON correctly!**Formatting the JSON Output**\n\nThe system requires a specific JSON format for categorizing the IT ticket. The format includes a `\"type\":\"object\"` and a `\"properties\"` field with the `\"category\"`. Since I've determined the category is \"Internal Project,\" I need to present this in the correct JSON structure. The final answer will simply be {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll ensure the output is clean and contains no extra text, just the raw JSON object reflecting the chosen category. Let's confirm that \"Internal Project\" is indeed included in the category list!**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s mention of \"MS dashboard ServiceNow\" suggests it's about data investigation rather than a service outage. I\u2019m deciding to classify it under \"Internal Project\" because it deals with a dashboard data issue relevant to an internal project. While I could provide a justification if necessary, the instruction clearly asks just to categorize. So, I\u2019ll prepare to respond with the appropriate JSON format to deliver this classification. Let\u2019s get it done!"
