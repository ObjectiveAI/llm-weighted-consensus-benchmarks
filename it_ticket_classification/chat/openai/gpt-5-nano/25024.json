The mention of \"activate\" and \"infrastructure\" makes me think that it's likely to do with access or permissions. Let\u2019s determine which fits best!**Selecting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m sorting through category options: \"HR Support\" for HR issues or \"Internal Project\" for project tasks. I need to pick the best fit for the ticket, which mentions re-enabling, re-activating, policies, and infrastructure. \n\n\"Enable\" and \"activate\" suggest it\u2019s related to access rights or policies. Considering this, \"Access\" seems to be the most suitable category. Even though \"Infrastructure\" is included, it all points towards user access.
