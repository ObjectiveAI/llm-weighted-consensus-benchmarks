The text focuses on accessing building control and requests to disable and issue a new card. This directly relates to the \"Access\" category of tickets. I briefly considered \"Administrative rights,\" but since this is primarily about access control, \"Access\" is definitely the right choice. I'll prepare a response structured like a JSON object for clarity.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket and output a JSON object. The schema specifies a single category, so I\u2019ll categorize this as \u201cAccess.\u201d The user asked for a specific categorization, and since only one category is needed, I\u2019ll construct the response simply as `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I should be careful to ensure it's valid according to the schema provided. Let\u2019s finalize it and prepare the response!"
