The ticket is about submitting expense reports, per diem, and accounts payable, which relates best to \"Purchase.\" I don't think it's Hardware or Access, and \"Administrative rights\" doesn't fit either. \"Miscellaneous\" is too generic. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Purchase\" as the most relevant category for this ticket.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI believe \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category for this IT ticket because it deals with expenses and per diem reimbursements. The content mentions submitting expense reports, accounts payable, and receipts, which aligns more with finance than IT. Still, we need to categorize it as an IT ticket. So, I'll respond in the required format with a JSON object indicating the category. To keep things straightforward, it\u2019ll look like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
