The instruction indicates that it should be categorized as \"Access,\" primarily because it mentions disabling user access. While \"HR Support\" might be relevant due to the HR process, since this is an IT ticket, it fits better in the IT category. I\u2019ll respond with the appropriate JSON format, like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's make sure we get this right!**Confirming IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket discusses a leaver form and contract issues, emphasizing the need to disable the user account when the contract ends. It clearly fits into the \"Access\" category. While I\u2019m considering whether to label it as \"HR Support\" due to the HR process, it ultimately remains an IT ticket focused on disabling the account. Therefore, I\u2019ll present the final answer as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's keep it straightforward and deliver only the necessary information!"
