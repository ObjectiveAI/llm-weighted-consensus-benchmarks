The options I have are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the request is about leave, \"HR Support\" seems like the right fit. \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t apply here, so I'll go with \"HR Support\" for the category. Now I need to format that in JSON with the appropriate structure.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe user's phrasing is a bit odd, but it looks like they're requesting a half-day or leave. I think \"HR Support\" is the right category, but \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t apply here. I need to respond with a JSON object that includes just the \"category\" field as a string. The correct output should simply be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll double-check there are no extra instructions and ensure I provide only the essential JSON format with no additional text."
