It could fit under \"Development/Software,\" but there are multiple categories like \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The user seems to have issues with adding a member and project codes in Oracle. The request for help indicates it might belong in the \"Access\" category. However, the mention of \"Administrative rights\" suggests it might also relate to permission management. I need to clarify this before deciding.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing how to categorize this IT ticket. The user is having trouble adding a member, which points to access or permissions issues, suggesting \"Administrative rights\" could be a good fit. But they mentioned \"oracle issue\" and \"project code,\" indicating it may also relate to an internal project. The user's input isn't entirely clear, so I need to choose the best category. According to typical IT classifications, I\u2019ll decide between \"Access\" and \"Internal Project\" for this ticket.**Choosing the appropriate category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking \"Access\" really fits since adding a member to a project requires access rights. The user\u2019s error messages suggest they are trying to make changes, like adding a member or project code, which aligns with access issues. However, \"Administrative rights\" could be even more precise regarding permission problems. The user's input indicates they\u2019re struggling with permissions when trying to add a member. I need to select the best category from \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
