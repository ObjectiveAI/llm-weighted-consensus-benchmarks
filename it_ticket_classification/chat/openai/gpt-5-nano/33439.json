The ticket text is somewhat garbled, but mentions \"notification,\" \"migrate,\" and \"forms attached.\" The phrase \"slave forms\" could possibly mean \"Salesforce,\" but it's unclear. So, I\u2019m considering options like \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Access,\" especially since it might involve permissions. Choosing the best category is challenging, but I\u2019m thinking \"Internal Project\" fits for the migration context.**Selecting ticket category**\n\nFor this migration task, it seems like it might fall under \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it involves changing permissions. The phrase \"slave forms\" is confusing; it might mean something related to data migration. Given the mention of \"migrate,\" \"forms attached,\" and timing details, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. While \"Access\" could apply if it\u2019s about accessing forms, it\u2019s not explicitly clear. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" as the most specific choice and prepare a JSON format for the category string.**Formatting the category output**\n\nThe prompt asks me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to provide a JSON object that specifies the category. I'll use \"Internal Project\" since it\u2019s included in the allowed categories. I want to ensure my output matches the expected format, which should be a single key string. It means I\u2019ll provide no extra text \u2014 just the JSON object with the category. So, my final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
