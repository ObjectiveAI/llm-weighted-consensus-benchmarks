The user\u2019s request seems garbled, possibly about a map and some months. There's confusion in the phrasing, making it tough to understand the exact intent, so maybe \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit. However, \"Internal Project\" could be relevant too. Ultimately, I need to classify this ticket clearly while recognizing the ambiguity in the request.**Determining category format**\n\nI'm looking at the required response format, which guides me to create a JSON object specifying a category. The user\u2019s request is a bit unclear, possibly surrounding a \"map\" feature and asking for help. I wonder if that fits better under \"Miscellaneous\" since it's vague? There\u2019s also \"Access\" for permission issues, including \"Administrative rights,\" but this doesn\u2019t seem to fit here. Overall, it seems best to classify it as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Categorizing ticket as Miscellaneous**\n\nIt seems I just need to categorize the ticket instead of justifying it. The user's request is quite vague, making \"Miscellaneous\" a safe option. Although \"Access\" might seem relevant, the text doesn't actually discuss access rights. Therefore, I'll stick with \"Miscellaneous\" and format it correctly as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. \n\nI just need to ensure that I output it accurately in the required JSON format without any extra commentary. Let's deliver that straightforwardly!"
