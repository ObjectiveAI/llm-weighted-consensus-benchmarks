So, I\u2019ll create a JSON-like object with \"Hardware\" as the category. Let\u2019s make sure to format that correctly!**Formatting category object**\n\nI need to create a category object, specifically with the field \"category\" containing one of the enumerated strings. So my response will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. The UI might expect this JSON-like structure, so I want to make sure I'm following that correctly. The ticket mentions \"extra monitor,\" which strongly suggests it's a hardware issue. While \"Purchase\" could fit if there's a request to buy a monitor, \"Hardware\" is the safe choice here, as it directly relates to the user's mention of extra monitors.**Deciding on category**\n\nI think for this ticket, \"Hardware\" seems like the right option since the user mentioned \"extra monitor\" and \"display.\" They didn't indicate anything about purchasing, so there\u2019s no need to go with \"Purchase\" in this case. I\u2019ll stick with \"Hardware\" for clarity and direct relevance. My response will just be the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. No extra commentary needed, just a straightforward categorization!"
