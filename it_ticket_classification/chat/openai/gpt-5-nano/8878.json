The relevant categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since this ticket discusses hardware tokens related to authentication, I think it might fit best under \"Access\" given its focus on authentication management. However, there's also a strong link to \"Hardware,\" making it a bit tricky to choose. I'll clarify that in my output.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe term \"leaver\" indicates an ex-employee, and the ticket is about recovering a hardware authentication token. This suggests that the main focus is on access management rather than administrative rights. Given those details, I think the most suitable category for this ticket is \"Access.\" I'll respond with a concise JSON object as per the schema, including just the category field. So, the output will be { \"category\": \"Access\" }.**Finalizing IT ticket response**\n\nI\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. While I briefly considered \"Hardware\" because it's a hardware authentication token, this ticket is really focused on access management related to recovering and reassigning tokens for an ex-employee. Most tickets like this get categorized as \"Access,\" rather than \"Hardware\" which is more for physical hardware issues. So, \"Access\" definitely fits best here! I'll confirm my response as the simple JSON."
