Looking at the predefined categories, I think the best fit is \"Purchase,\" since the message clearly revolves around procurement and mandatory receipts. It could partially relate to \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" but \"Purchase\" seems most relevant. So, I\u2019ll output a JSON with the category field as \"Purchase.\"**Finalizing category response**\n\nI'm ready to respond with the correct format. I'll output the JSON as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}, ensuring it matches the required structure and sticks to the allowed values. I'm not adding extra text since that's what the instructions say. The ticket text is a bit confusing, but it clearly relates to a new purchase order and installation logging. I confirm that the best category here is indeed \"Purchase,\" so I'll proceed with that."
