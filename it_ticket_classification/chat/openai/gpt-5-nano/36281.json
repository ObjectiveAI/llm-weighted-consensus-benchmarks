We're looking at categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" It seems like it's primarily about investigations into these outages. Since there\u2019s no clear hardware fault mentioned and given the context, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the best fit as there's no specific \"IT Operations\" or \"Network\" category available. I\u2019m working on identifying the right category!**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket. The user\u2019s text mentions server outages, but it doesn't seem related to access rights or hardware issues. Given that it's mainly about investigating outages, \"Miscellaneous\" fits best. The instructions say to respond with a JSON object, so I\u2019ll format it correctly. I think I\u2019ll create the JSON like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. It\u2019s straightforward, and I\u2019ll stick to the schema provided without adding extra explanations.**Creating JSON response**\n\nThe instructions say to provide a JSON-like object for the category, so I\u2019ll format it correctly. I think the response should be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I'll ensure it follows the proper JSON formatting and that \"Miscellaneous\" is correctly capitalized as specified. It's a straightforward task, and I want to make sure it\u2019s delivered properly! Let's go ahead and finalize this!"
