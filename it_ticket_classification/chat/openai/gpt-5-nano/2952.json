It seems this ticket is likely related to changing PM access or editing user privileges.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for the IT ticket. \"Administrative rights\" seems most suitable for changing user permissions because it specifically targets admin privileges. However, \"Access\" is also relevant since it relates to permissions. The text indicates a change for PM users, potentially meaning modifying access rights. While \"Administrative rights\" is more specific, if it relates to a project management queue, \"Internal Project\" could fit too. I need to choose the category that best aligns with the request and provide a justification.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket. I realize I need to respond with a JSON object that includes one of the approved categories. Given the ticket mentions tasks like \"change pm\" and \"assign her queue,\" it seems closely tied to access-related tasks. I think \"Access\" is a fitting choice since it's broad, while \"Administrative rights\" could also apply. I'll go with \"Access\" and format my response as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
