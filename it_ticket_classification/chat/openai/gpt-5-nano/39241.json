The user mentions they can\u2019t view images directly but can download them. I need to choose a category from the options provided, which include \"Access,\" among others. The situation likely indicates a permissions issue, so \"Access\" feels like the right choice since it relates to their inability to view the content without downloading. \"Storage\" could fit too, but \"Access\" makes most sense here.**Outputting JSON Category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket properly. I\u2019ve ruled out several categories such as \"Administrative rights\", \"Internal Project\", \"Purchase\", \"Hardware\", \"HR Support,\" and even \"Miscellaneous\". It seems most fitting to go with \"Access\" since it relates directly to the user's issue. I should respond with a JSON object based on the schema provided. So, the output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra commentary, just the JSON object!"
