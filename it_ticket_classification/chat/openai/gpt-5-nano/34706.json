I'm considering categories like \"Miscellaneous\" since there's no \"Software\" option. \"Hardware\" could be relevant too, but it's ultimately a software issue. \"Miscellaneous\" seems the most suitable, as it covers technical issues without a specific category for software.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm considering that the ticket about \"AMP high CPU usage\" could relate to hardware since high CPU usage involves hardware resources. However, since it's primarily a software issue, the right category might be \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d The system requires the output in a JSON format, specifying a category field. I\u2019m thinking of outputting {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. But sometimes they might lean towards \u201cHardware\u201d due to the nature of high CPU usage. It\u2019s tricky with terms like \"AMP,\" which might refer to different software!**Categorizing user ticket**\n\nThe user's message about \"AMP high CPU usage\" suggests it's from someone potentially experienced, like a senior software developer. Their concern about \"AMP\" using too much CPU indicates a software issue affecting their computer's performance. Given this context, categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a safe choice. I should respond with a clear JSON format according to the specified schema: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. However, I\u2019m unsure about the specifics of the \"type\" field; I need to ensure I understand that correctly.**Finalizing output format**\n\nI need to follow the system's \"category\" schema, which specifies that my response should be a JSON object with a \"category\" property set as a string. The allowed categories include various options, but for this case, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the right choice. It\u2019s important to keep the response concise, so I will only return the JSON without any additional text. I'll format it correctly as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. No extra explanations needed!"
