It looks like it's pertaining to a new purchase order and mentions receipts and processing details. The categories I can choose from include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Given the content mentioning \"new purchase po\" and \"mandatory receipts section,\" it makes sense to assign it to the \"Purchase\" category. I'll then format the output as JSON with the category field for clarity.**Providing category in JSON**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket as requested by the user. The proper output format is a JSON object containing a category field based on the system's specifications. The category options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Given the text emphasizes a \"new purchase,\" I think it fits perfectly into the \"Purchase\" category. So, I\u2019ll produce just the required JSON object as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} since the instruction specifies no extra text is needed."
