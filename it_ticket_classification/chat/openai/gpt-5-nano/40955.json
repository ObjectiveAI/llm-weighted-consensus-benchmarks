The ticket references things like \"incident resolved\" and investigating why the code can't be seen. Considering the content, it seems to fall under an \"Access\" issue since it involves permissions and visibility of a project code. Other potential categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" were also considered, but \"Access\" appears to be the most relevant choice.**Finalizing IT Ticket Classification**\n\nI\u2019ve considered categorizing the IT ticket, and while \"Internal Project\" could apply since it involves project code, the main issue is about viewing access. The message clearly indicates an access issue, so I think it's best to categorize it as \"Access.\" I need to respond in the required JSON format as instructed, using the schema provided. So my output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra commentary. That's straightforward!**Confirming Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket mentions that the \"project code cannot be seen,\" which seems to indicate an internal project issue. However, I need to categorize it correctly. The main problem is about visibility and permissions, so it fits best under the \"Access\" category. If it had specified \"Internal Project,\" that might have been suitable, but since it focuses on viewing the code, \"Access\" is definitely the right choice. I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}"
