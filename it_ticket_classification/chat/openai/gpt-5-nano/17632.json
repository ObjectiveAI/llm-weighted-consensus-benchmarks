I need to look closely at the content of the ticket to determine the most appropriate category. This should help streamline the support process, but I want to make sure I'm choosing wisely based on the details provided in the ticket. Let's get started!**Decoding access restrictions**\n\nI'm looking at some garbled text that mentions phrases like \"active users issue,\" \"restrict floor,\" and \"physical control.\" It seems to be discussing restricting access for users on specific floors, along with details about documentation, personnel, and groups. There are mentions of doors and stairwells too, which suggests it's related to access control at a physical location. I need to clarify the context and specifics to address any issues about user access and necessary changes in the personnel spreadsheet.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like this IT ticket is related to access control. Based on the content, \"Access\" seems to be the most fitting category, especially since it's discussing physical control and floor access. There's a potential for \"Administrative rights\" if user rights are involved, but it's primarily about access procedures. The user requested a categorization, and the output format is clear: I need to respond with JSON. So, I\u2019ll go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
