Given the context, \"Access\" is the most appropriate category, as it covers requests related to access privileges.**Formatting JSON for category**\n\nI need to output a JSON object with the category based on the schema, which requires a \"category\" string. I'll respond with {\"category\":\"Access.\"} The ticket suggests access to reports or forms, but \"Access\" is still the appropriate classification. While \"Administrative rights\" could be another option if it\u2019s about specific privileges, since the request is more general, \"Access\" fits best. I'll be careful to keep the response clean without any extra words.**Outputting JSON format**\n\nThe system allows bullet lists, but since the user specifically asked to categorize, I need to stick to the required format, which is a JSON object. I\u2019ll ensure I respond with precisely that. It's key to follow the instructions closely, so I\u2019ll make sure there's nothing extra and just output the clean JSON as the user expects. This keeps everything clear and straightforward for the user, just as they requested!"
