The options are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It's important to select the right category to ensure the ticket gets to the appropriate person or team. Let's see which category fits best based on the ticket details. I'll carefully consider each option before making a choice.**Analyzing requisition details**\n\nI need to address a ticket regarding a requisition for mobile devices that was rejected. It includes details about the correction process, assigned tasks, expiration dates, and the requisition amount considering nonrecoverable tax. The devices are meant for projects requiring testing across various mobile platforms. I will review the suggested supplier, requester's information, line items, and any comments made on the ticket. It seems I should explore the requisition lines for a complete overview, especially since this involves potential corrections and approvals.**Classifying requisition category**\n\nThe issue at hand is a rejected requisition that needs correction regarding terms, pricing, and supplier codes. Since it's about a requisition involving price and supplier details, I think the best category would be \"Purchase.\" It could also fit \"Internal Project,\" but since those are separate categories, \u201cPurchase\u201d makes more sense here. I'll respond with a JSON-like format where the category value is set as \"Purchase.\" So, my output will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
