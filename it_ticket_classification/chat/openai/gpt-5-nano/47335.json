I'll need to ensure clarity in my categorization to facilitate timely resolution.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThis issue seems related to \"Access.\" The mention of the \"approve button\" likely refers to permissions necessary for approving contracts. Based on the provided categories, this could fit under either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" Since the user's unable to approve contracts because the button isn't working, it seems I need to escalate this to IT for a software fix. The best classification would be \"Access,\" as it pertains to functionality requiring appropriate permissions. So, I\u2019ll go with that!**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nAlright, I need to respond with a structured JSON format for the category. The instruction is clear: I should provide the category as {\"category\": \"Access\"}. This needs to be precise, so I\u2019ll follow the specified format closely. Keeping it simple is essential. I\u2019m going to produce the output now as defined: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let\u2019s ensure it\u2019s exactly what\u2019s required!"
