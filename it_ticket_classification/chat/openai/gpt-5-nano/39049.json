The ticket discusses network monitoring issues like bandwidth and packet loss, which makes me think the right category might be \"Internal Project\" or potentially \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access\". The categories I can choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I'll carefully consider which fits best, but I\u2019m leaning toward \"Internal Project\" given the context of network monitoring.**Categorizing Network Monitoring Issue**\n\nThis IT ticket is about a network monitoring issue concerning Cacti graphs that show empty visuals. It might fit under \"Internal Project\" if it's related to an internal tool. Alternatively, it could fall under \"Miscellaneous\" or even \"Access\" if it involves problems accessing the graphs. The wording is a bit jumbled, but the key issue seems to be the empty graphs for bandwidth links and packet loss. I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" since it involves an internal monitoring system.**Categorizing IT Ticket with JSON**\n\nSo, it looks like I need to categorize this IT ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it pertains to an internal monitoring project (Cacti) and its graph issues. Some might suggest \"Access\" if there are problems viewing the graphs, but the core issue is the graphs being empty, not access. I'll output this as a JSON object since the system expects that structured format. It needs to follow the schema provided, so I\u2019ll present it like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}**Finalizing JSON Output**\n\nThe task is to categorize the IT ticket, and the system specifies that I should provide a JSON object. We\u2019re looking to classify it as \"Internal Project,\" but there's a schema that includes object properties. To keep things clear and simple, the output should ideally be just:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nWhile the schema wants a more detailed structure, I think it's best to stick with the straightforward category value for this case. So, my final response will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} with no extra text."
