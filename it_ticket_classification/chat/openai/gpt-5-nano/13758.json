The snippet talks about \"decommissioning polls\" that need to be removed and mentions identifying removed polls and monitoring. It seems to suggest a process focused on decommissioning, which likely fits as an \"Internal Project.\" While \"Access\" is mentioned, it doesn't seem like the main focus here. Therefore, my best guess for the category would be \"Internal Project.\"**Outputting JSON for categorization**\n\nI'm analyzing the context of the phrase \"lead ext,\" which may refer to an extension. The overall message hints at project tasks related to decommissioning, likely pointing to an internal project. While \"Administrative rights\" was a consideration, it doesn't fit quite right. The best category, given the circumstances, seems to be \"Internal Project.\" So, I need to output a JSON object structured correctly as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, ensuring only the JSON is included without any additional commentary.**Deciding on the category**\n\nOkay, the content refers to \"polls,\" which might mean \"decommissioning polls,\" possibly referring to products or assets. However, \"polls\" could also imply polling processes. Despite this ambiguity, the focus remains on decommissioning. My best choice for categorization is \"Internal Project.\" So, I'm ready to finalize my response with that category in mind."
