They need to assign one category from provided options like \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since the content leans toward scheduling and annual leave, \"HR Support\" seems to be the most fitting category here.**Selecting category for ticket**\n\nI need to categorize the user's IT ticket that references \"annual leave\" and the request to \"change date.\" This indicates it's not related to hardware or storage, but rather falls under administrative or HR topics. The categories provided include \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights,\" but here, \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate since it relates to leave. The user's message isn't perfectly clear, but it seems to confirm the need for a date change for leave.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nIt seems the user is looking to reschedule a date due to annual leave, making this an HR-related request. The most fitting category here is \"HR Support.\" To meet the requirement, I\u2019ll respond in the specified JSON-like format with just the category object. So, I\u2019ll format my answer as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This ensures I\u2019m providing exactly what the user needs without extra explanations since they only want the category."
