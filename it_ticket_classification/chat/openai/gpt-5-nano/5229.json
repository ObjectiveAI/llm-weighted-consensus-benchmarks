It mentions an administration officer and could fit into categories like HR Support, Access, or Miscellaneous. I\u2019ll consider how best to classify this to reflect its content accurately!**Choosing the right category**\n\nThe ticket appears related to HR onboarding and scheduling for a new starter, so it could be classified under \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" However, since it's mostly about setting a start date for onboarding, it fits better under \"HR Support.\" It involves details like a new employee's start date and the administration officer's role.
