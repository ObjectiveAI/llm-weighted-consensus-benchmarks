But given how it's framed, I think \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate choice here.**Categorizing as Hardware**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the ticket as \"Hardware\" because it specifically requests an adapter. The format for the output should be a JSON object: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. The guidelines clearly state that we only need to provide the category object without additional text. \n\nSome might consider \"Purchase\" since it involves procuring an adapter, but the request emphasizes the need for an adapter urgently, which aligns more with IT hardware support. So, \"Hardware\" feels like the best fit!**Outputting JSON for Hardware**\n\nIt seems the user wants an adapter by tomorrow, which definitely qualifies as a \"Hardware\" request. So, I'm confident in categorizing it under \"Hardware.\" I'll format the output as valid JSON, making sure to use double quotes around both the keys and values.\n\nThe proper output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nThat should clearly convey the category in the required structure!"
