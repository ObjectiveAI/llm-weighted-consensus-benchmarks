I think \"Purchase\" fits best here since it explicitly references a \"new purchase\" and the importance of mandatory receipts. I\u2019m considering if it could also relate to hardware, but \"Purchase\" seems the most appropriate category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket related to a DeepCool cooler. It mentions hardware installation, but since the main focus is on the new purchase and tracking receipts, \"Purchase\" seems like a suitable category.

I'll go ahead and respond with the JSON: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} to keep it straightforward and concise.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
