The user is asking about disabling accounts for employees who have left, and it mentions terms like \"disable accounts,\" \"active accounts,\" and \"leavers.\" This indicates that it pertains to access management. So, the most appropriate category seems to be 'Access,' rather than 'Administrative rights' since it's primarily focused on access control. Therefore, I'll classify this ticket as Access.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to output the required JSON format for categorizing an IT ticket. The instruction tells me to categorize, and the format requires just the category value. While I'll normally wrap it in the specified schema, it looks like I should simply return the category object like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Technically, it should comply with the schema demanding a \"type\" and properties, but responding with just the object containing \"category\" is what past tasks have needed. So, the final response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Outputting the category**\n\nI need to produce the output as {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text. I'm considering whether the mention of \"internal audit\" might relate more to \"Administrative rights,\" but since the focus is on disabling accounts, it clearly relates to access control. Therefore, categorizing it as \"Access\" is the right choice. I'll stick to this straightforward response and just provide the necessary output. So, my final answer remains: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
