The message is really messy but clearly relates to a keyboard request. This suggests the category should be Hardware, since it involves hardware equipment. It could also fit under Purchase if it implies acquiring a keyboard. I'm leaning toward Hardware as it feels more general and appropriate for this ticket.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nIn categorizing an IT ticket, I\u2019m weighing the options between \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" The content mentions \"keyboard request,\" suggesting it fits either category. The text is chaotic, but it clearly indicates a request for a keyboard. Choosing \"Hardware\" seems safe since it covers devices like keyboards, while \"Purchase\" relates to procurement. I think I'll go for \"Hardware\" as it feels more straightforward. I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format, setting the category as \"Hardware.\"**Formatting JSON output**\n\nThe required format is a JSON object with a \"category\" field, which should be one of the enumerated strings. So, I'll output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI need to follow the exact structure, keeping the \"category\" property as a string. It sounds like only the category field is needed, but I want to ensure it matches the schema. The instructions are pretty clear on that. Alright, let\u2019s stick with just this, as it seems to be what\u2019s expected!"
