It\u2019s a bit messy, but they mention \"laptop allocation,\" \"device,\" \"allocate,\" and \"consultant,\" which likely indicates that it's about hardware provisioning. My best guess is to place this in the Hardware category. Although it could relate to Purchase if it were strictly about procuring a laptop, it seems more focused on allocating hardware to someone, so Hardware feels right. I'll respond with the category in JSON format.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket and provide the response in JSON format. The category seems to be \"Hardware\" based on the content of the ticket. I have to ensure the schema is correct, so I'm focusing on including the category value properly. Since the instructions specify that I should deliver just the JSON object without extra commentary, I'll format it like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I'll go ahead and deliver it in that clean, straightforward way!"
