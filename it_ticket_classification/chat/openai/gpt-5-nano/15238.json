The user provided a jumbled text that seems to mention several topics, including servers, storage, and developers' needs. I\u2019m considering possible categories like \"Hardware\", \"Storage,\" or \"Miscellaneous\". I need to choose the best fit since the request isn\u2019t straightforward. It seems to revolve around storage and accessing files through a server. Let\u2019s find the right category!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe content mentions several key points about server setup, including Apache, file transfers via Git, and storage for files, images, and sensitive information. The phrase \"without own dedicated right\" suggests it might relate to access or permissions. This leads me to consider potential categories like \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" or even \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket appears to revolve around server planning and the need for secure storage and user permissions. I need to pick the category that best fits!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m trying to determine the best category for this IT ticket, which seems to deal with various aspects like servers, admin rights, and storage. Although the text is unclear, it hints at a project involving internal storage and access rights. I think \"Access\" may be the most fitting category since it mentions letting developers load sites and refers to permissions. So, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" and get ready to format the response in JSON per the system requirements!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
