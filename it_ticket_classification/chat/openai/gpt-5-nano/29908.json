Although \"Administrative rights\" might seem relevant, the focus is clearly on access. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" for categorization.**Formatting Category Response**\n\nI want to categorize the ticket as \"Access.\" The ticket could potentially relate to an \"Internal Project,\" but it really seems focused on access. I need to respond with a JSON object, specifically formatted so it just contains the category. Based on the instructions, the final output should be: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. Looks like I\u2019ve got it right without needing any extra commentary. I\u2019ll keep it simple and get that output!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
