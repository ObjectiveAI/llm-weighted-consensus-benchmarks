I\u2019m thinking this could fall under categories like \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" or even \"Purchase.\" It\u2019s a bit tricky, but I\u2019ll figure it out!**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing phrases like \"both rights,\" \"upload,\" \"download,\" and \"share\" related to securing a location for source code. It\u2019s about allowing upload, download, and sharing with clients, which could fit into categories like \"Storage,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project.\" Given the context, \"Storage\" is the best match since it focuses on the secure storage of source code and related rights.
