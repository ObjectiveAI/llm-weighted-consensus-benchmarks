It mentions requesting functionalities, which leads me to think it's an internal project. There are several potential categories to choose from, including Internal Project, Access, and Administrative Rights. Given that there's a focus on functionality and development work, I believe \"Internal Project\" is the most appropriate choice for this particular ticket.**Clarifying ticket categorization**\n\nThe user\u2019s mention of a \"reference number\" and \"waiting application\" makes me think it could fall under either \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since they asked me to categorize the IT ticket, I should consider asking for clarification to ensure I'm selecting the right category.\n\nThe typical output for this would be a structured JSON object specifying the category. Based on my assessment, it seems best to output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nHowever, if it involves access functionalities, perhaps \"Access\" might be appropriate too.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI'm analyzing the phrase \"which requested waiting application,\" and I think it might mean \"waiting for application.\" It's challenging to interpret the full context from the user's text. Phrases like \"add functionalities\" point to a typical development task. \n\nGiven all this, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing the ticket as \"Internal Project.\" The final output should just be the JSON object without any extra explanation. So, I'll respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nI'm confident that fits!"
