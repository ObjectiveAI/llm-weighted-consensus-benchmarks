The content suggests it's a software issue, which might fit into categories like \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access.\" However, it doesn\u2019t seem to involve hardware, storage, purchases, or login issues. So, I'll probably go with \"Miscellaneous,\" as it's a bug in the dashboard software without specific mention of other issues.**Determining IT category**\n\nI see that the available categories don\u2019t include \"Software,\" \"Application,\" or \"Bug,\" which complicates things a bit. The closest options are \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the ticket mentions a bug in the dashboard, \"Internal Project\" seems appropriate if that\u2019s part of an ongoing project. Otherwise, I could go with \"Miscellaneous.\" Based on the context, I\u2019ll choose \"Internal Project\" and format it as a JSON-like object with the required category string.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
