It mentions interns, rights given, and different roles like product owner and analyst. Given the context, it seems to fall under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" because it\u2019s about permissions for the interns. The phrases about rights and boards indicate this is likely an Access issue, specifically regarding granting permissions to interns for the board setup. I'll go with Access.**Clarifying category choice**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize the ticket as \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" The text mainly discusses access rights and mentions \"rights\" numerous times, so it might lean toward \"Access.\" However, there is a specific category for \"Administrative rights,\" which refers to admin privileges. If the issue is about granting admin rights, it should be \"Administrative rights.\" But since it seems more about granting access to interns and analysts, \"Access\" feels more appropriate. I'll go with \"Access.\"**Analyzing the ticket content**\n\nLet's take a closer look at the text: it seems garbled but suggests that it's about a board for interns and rights related to an internship program. The user may be requesting access rights for interns, masters, and analysts, which indicates it primarily revolves around getting access to this board. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit, I think the more relevant category here is \"Access,\" since it\u2019s specifically about granting rights to interns for using the board.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
