The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the messy text, it seems like an \"Access\" issue fits best since it's primarily about authentication failures. I could consider \"Administrative rights,\" but since the problem revolves around access, I'll go ahead and categorize it as \"Access.\" I'll prepare a JSON object for that.**Delivering the response**\n\nThe instruction clearly asks me to categorize the IT ticket using a JSON schema with a \"category\" field. My task is to return just the JSON object without any extra text or explanations. So, I need to keep it straightforward and simply output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to follow the format exactly as required. Let\u2019s deliver that now!"
