It looks like it could relate to onboarding, so \"HR Support\" seems to fit well since it covers joining forms and associated administrative details. \"Access\" might also apply if it involves access provisioning for the new starter. I\u2019ll lean towards classifying it under \"HR Support.\"**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nThe mention of \"administration officer,\" \"joining form,\" and \"new starter\" strongly suggests this ticket is related to HR tasks or onboarding. Among the categories available, \"HR Support\" fits well for addressing onboarding forms and helping new starters. The phrase \"Access\" implies system privileges, which doesn\u2019t seem to match this request. There\u2019s also a potential event scheduling note with \"new starter Bogota Tuesday PM,\" but overall, classifying it under \"HR Support\" feels most appropriate.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, likely for triage. For tasks related to onboarding forms, \"HR Support\" seems like the right category. The phrases \"new starter,\" \"attached,\" and \"completed form\" all hint at this being related to employee onboarding. I\u2019ll stick with \"HR Support.\" The prompt also mentions that I need to respond in JSON format, so I\u2019ll present the result as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} to keep it clear and simple without extra text.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to double-check if there are other category possibilities. \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if it were about provisioning access for a new starter, but the phrase \"complete form joining\" doesn\u2019t reference systems or rights. Without clear evidence leaning toward that, \"HR Support\" remains the safest option. I\u2019ll go ahead and return the information in the required JSON format, ensuring that I stick with the chosen category this time."
