It seems a new starter, who was previously an intern, is requesting to change their status to permanent. The message is a bit garbled, but it indicates they're transitioning to a role that seems to involve engineering\u2014maybe \"site engineer,\" \"staff engineer,\" or something similar. Overall, it looks like they want to formalize their position as a permanent employee quite urgently.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m sorting through category options for this IT ticket. It's about changing an intern's status to permanent, which definitely relates to HR. I see two potential categories: \"HR Support,\" which seems the most fitting since it involves employment status, and \"Administrative rights,\" which could apply if it involved account access. However, since the ticket primarily requests an update in the HR system, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" It aligns best with what they need!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
