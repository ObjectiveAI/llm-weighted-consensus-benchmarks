The user mentions needing a price quotation from a supplier for some items and raising licenses for deploying a network architecture. Terms like \u201cupgrade switches\u201d and \u201cperpetual catalyst port\u201d suggest it involves purchasing hardware and licenses. From the categories available, I think \u201cPurchase\u201d fits best, as it covers requests related to hardware and licenses. This seems clear, and I\u2019ll proceed accordingly!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the best category for this IT ticket. \"Purchase\" seems most appropriate since it's focused on requesting price quotations and processing purchase orders. While it could also fit under \"Hardware\" due to references to switches and model numbers, the main action revolves around procuring licenses and obtaining quotes. Therefore, I'll go with \"Purchase\" as the best option. \n\nNow, I need to format this as a JSON-like object: { \"category\": \"Purchase\" }.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
