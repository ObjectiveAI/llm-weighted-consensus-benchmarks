The message mentions \"memory run out\" and a need for a \"bigger hard drive.\" This makes me think it could relate to both hardware and storage, as \"memory run out\" suggests a RAM issue, while the \"bigger hard drive\" pertains to storage hardware. However, it could also be a \"Purchase\" if it requires buying new equipment. I need to figure out the best fit!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user message talks about \"memory run out\" and needing a \"bigger hard drive,\" which relates to both hardware resources, like RAM, and storage. If I had to pick one category, I might lean toward \"Storage,\" since a \"bigger hard drive\" implies a storage upgrade. However, \"memory has run out\" could suggest a RAM issue too. The mention of \"best chief officer\" seems irrelevant, so considering the context, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Storage,\" which covers disk space and upgrades.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
