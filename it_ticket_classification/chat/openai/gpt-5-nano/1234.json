The user provided a confusing text about \"add assets,\" \"recently received batch assets,\" and \"wired addresses.\" It seems related to asset management, which might fit under \"Hardware\" or \"Storage.\" The ticket appears to be requesting help with adding assets, so I\u2019ll consider that when deciding which category to place it in.**Determining asset management category**\n\nI think the ticket is asking for help with asset management and possibly wiring addresses. The mention of \"wired addresses\" could suggest network-related aspects, making \"Hardware\" a fitting category. While \"Access\" was a consideration, the content doesn't clearly address access issues. It could relate to an \"Internal Project\" due to the mention of a \"design lead.\" However, given my focus on IT ticket triage, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" \n\nI should respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Finalizing category response**\n\nThe user\u2019s phrase about \"adding assets\" is a bit messy, but the repeated mention of \"assets\" points to asset management. I could categorize it as \"Storage,\" but I think \"Hardware\" is safer and more straightforward. Given the instruction to provide just the category, I\u2019ll stick with that. \n\nSo my final response will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
