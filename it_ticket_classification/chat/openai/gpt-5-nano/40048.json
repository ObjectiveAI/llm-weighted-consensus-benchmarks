The issue involves network connection problems, with mentions of loose cables and wireless connections that work intermittently. Considering the options, \"Hardware\" seems to fit best due to potential network hardware issues. While \"Access\" could relate to login problems, the focus is on connectivity here. \"Internal Project\" and \"Administrative Rights\" don\u2019t apply, so \"Miscellaneous\" isn't a strong contender. Let's assign \"Hardware.\"**Finalizing the IT ticket category**\n\nI'm determining the right category for this IT ticket, and \"Hardware\" seems to be the best fit due to the references to cable connections, wireless hardware, and remote workstations. While \"Access\" might seem relevant, it\u2019s primarily about network connectivity, not permissions. Given the context of loose cable connections and wireless issues, it's clear this relates to hardware. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware\" and provide the JSON response: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
