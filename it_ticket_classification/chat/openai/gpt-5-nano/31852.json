The system has specific categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The prompt requires me to format my output as a JSON object, including the category selected from the allowed options. Essentially, I need to classify this ticket appropriately before outputting it!**Parsing a Garbled IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a messy sentence that seems to touch on a Tuesday PM presentation, mentioning a location, clients, updated templates, and links. It\u2019s unclear, but it could fit as either an \"Internal Project\" since it involves a presentation, or perhaps \"Access\" due to the mention of needing to provide a location. Other categories like \"Administrative rights\" don\u2019t seem applicable here. Overall, I need to classify this ticket based on its context!**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nIt seems the best fit for this ticket is \"Internal Project,\" as it discusses a presentation and an updated link. The ticket is messy, but if it doesn't clearly match, \"Miscellaneous\" could be another option. There's a requirement for a location for the Tuesday PM presentation, which hints towards \"Access\" or maybe \"Administrative rights,\" but those don\u2019t fit perfectly. Overall, since this relates to an internal presentation for clients, \"Internal Project\" feels like the most appropriate category!**Finalizing Category Output**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it relates to the presentation. I need to format this as a JSON object, according to the schema that specifies a \"category\" string with enumerated values. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll comply and format the output like this:  \n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}  \n\nThis is concise and meets the user's request to categorize the ticket without any unnecessary details or restatements of the schema. Let's finalize that!"
