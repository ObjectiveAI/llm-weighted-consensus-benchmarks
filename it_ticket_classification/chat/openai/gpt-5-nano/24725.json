Their text is a bit jumbled but mentions wanting a second monitor during their stay and provides details about the location. Since the request focuses on hardware, it seems to fit best in the \"Hardware\" category. It doesn't relate to HR or access issues, making \"Hardware\" the most appropriate choice.**Deciding on category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to classify this IT ticket as \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" The request is about providing a second monitor temporarily, which seems more aligned with \"Hardware.\" I ruled out \"Storage,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights,\" so \"Hardware\" really does feel like the right choice. Even though there's some mention of \"shared senior accountant ext,\" the primary focus remains on the monitor. Since it's a temporary requirement, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware\" and respond with the appropriate JSON format.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to return a JSON object indicating the category as \"Hardware.\" The required format specifies using a JSON schema, but in past tasks, I\u2019ve simply provided a JSON object with the category value. The category field is clearly defined in the schema with its allowed values. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nWhile adding a brief justification might help, the instructions emphasize just categorization. So, I\u2019ll stick to the minimal output for clarity. Let's deliver this!"
