It involves a question about switching workstations and connecting to virtual machines remotely, which mentions tools and test environments. I\u2019m considering the categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The focus on installing tools and remote access makes \"Access\" a likely category, but it could also fit under \"Internal Project\" or \"Hardware.\"**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"workstation\" and \"switch workstation,\" which might suggest hardware, but it primarily focuses on processes for accessing tools and test environments. The user doesn't seem to be asking to purchase hardware. Given the context and key phrases like \"remotely connect\" and \"test environments,\" the most fitting category appears to be \"Access.\" I plan to respond with the category formatted in JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's confirm that this aligns with the requirements!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
