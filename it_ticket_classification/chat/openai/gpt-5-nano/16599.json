Since this ticket relates to onboarding, it seems HR-related. I\u2019m considering whether \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" is more suitable, but given that it primarily discusses completing a starter form, \"HR Support\" looks like the best fit here. I\u2019ll suggest that category.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket could potentially fall under \"Administrative rights,\" but that\u2019s not exactly clear. It specifically mentions \"new starter form\" and asks for help completing it. In IT ticket triage, I see options like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or even \"Internal Project.\" Given \"cost center\" and \"joining contractor\" references, it seems more HR-related rather than technical. Since they specifically request assistance with the form, categorizing it as \"HR Support\" feels like the best choice.**Formatting the JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON category object. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. The format needs to be precise, as the system requires a category object with a \"category\" key. The instructions specify that I should respond with a category object, and the schema confirms that \"HR Support\" is an acceptable value. Since the request is straightforward, I\u2019ll just output the JSON without any extra notes to keep it clear."
