There's an urgent need to address this by tomorrow morning. Given these elements, the most suitable category appears to be \"Access,\" as it's dealing with access management regarding the cards. I'll prepare a response in JSON format, indicating the chosen category. This makes sense, especially with the focus on access.**Preparing category response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that includes the category. Based on the analysis, I've determined that \"Access\" is the most fitting category. The system message indicates to keep it simple, so I\u2019ll just provide the category without any additional explanations. The required format is straightforward: I\u2019ll output {\"category\":\"Access\"} and ensure it fits the system's requirements. Keeping it clean and direct is the best approach here."
