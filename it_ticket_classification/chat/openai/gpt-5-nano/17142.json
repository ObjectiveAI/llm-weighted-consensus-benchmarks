Based on the system-defined categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and others, this ticket relates to onboarding and handling attachments. Given that it discusses the starter form and some access issues, I'm leaning towards categorizing it as either \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" This might be a bit tricky, but I think that's the right way to go!**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing an IT ticket that\u2019s related to onboarding a new starter, and I'm considering the best category for it.
