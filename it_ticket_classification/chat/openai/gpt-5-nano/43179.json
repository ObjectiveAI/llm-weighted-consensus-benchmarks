The ticket mentions a mailbox being almost full and requests help with backing up and reducing the mailbox size. It seems clear that this relates to mailbox storage limits. While I consider categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" they don't fit as well. So, I\u2019m confident the correct category here is \u201cStorage,\u201d focusing on storage capacity rather than access permissions.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object to categorize an IT ticket. The instructions specify that I must use a schema which includes a category field. Given the ticket relates to mailbox storage, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Storage.\" The final JSON must look like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I\u2019ll follow the schema carefully and make sure to capitalize the category correctly. I won\u2019t include any extra text\u2014just the JSON response as directed. Let's go with this!"
