The user's message is a bit jumbled, likely due to transcription errors. It seems to address PC problems, suggesting issues like the screen going black or freezing, requiring a restart multiple times a week. I'll make sure to categorize this ticket accurately based on the identified problems related to the user's need for automation testing.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's ticket describes slow performance, difficulty navigating tabs, and frequent crashes, which suggest hardware problems. Potential causes might be performance issues related to either hardware or software. However, since it specifically concerns the PC\u2019s performance, \"Hardware\" seems to be the most fitting category. While \"Internal Project\" might apply due to their role as automation testers, it\u2019s not listed as an option. I'll respond with a JSON-like object categorizing the ticket as hardware issues: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Finalizing category response**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to respond in JSON format with a category field. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. However, considering the mention of \"Automation tester,\" I wondered if \"Internal Project\" might fit since it relates to automation testing. Still, the categories listed don't include \"Software\" or \"IT Support,\" making \"Hardware\" the most straightforward choice for PC performance issues. As the answer should only be one of the enumerated options, I\u2019ll stick with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
