The text seems a bit corrupted but mentions a \"frozen task notification,\" and the user is asking for further investigation.\n\nLooking at the predefined categories, it might fit with \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" due to the context. However, since it refers to notifications and possibly access, \"Administrative rights\" could also make sense. I\u2019ll weigh those options carefully before making a decision.**Clarifying IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe text is pretty unclear, especially with parts like \"able open notification task\" and \"submitted by one his direct reports.\" It looks like it might be referencing a task from direct reports, but I think I need to ask for clarification. The goal is to categorize the IT ticket.\n\nFor this, I have categories like \"Internal Project\" for development tasks, \"Miscellaneous\" for general issues, and \"Access\" for permissions. Since it involves a \"frozen task notification,\" it suggests a software issue. I\u2019m leaning toward \"Internal Project,\" but \"Miscellaneous\" could also work for its generality. I need to decide!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI need to choose a category for the ticket. I think I\u2019d pick \"Internal Project\" since it appears to link to tasks within an internal framework. Other categories like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"HR Support\" don't seem relevant, and while \"Hardware\" is an option, it doesn\u2019t fit here.\n\nI\u2019ll format the response as a JSON-like object. Based on the content mentioning a \"frozen task notification,\" \"Internal Project\" seems the most accurate, given its focus on internal task notifications.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
