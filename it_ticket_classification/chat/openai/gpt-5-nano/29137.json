Since this seems more related to a project, \"Internal Project\" might fit best, given it involves testing as part of that. However, it's also unclear enough that \"Miscellaneous\" could work.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nLooking at the request to \"add to testing Thursday PM\" and \"please add testing,\" it seems like a scheduling task. The best category might be \"Internal Project\" since it's related to testing in a project context. But if I'm unsure, I could also label it as \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\nIn cases where requests are ambiguous, \"Miscellaneous\" can be used until clarified. The user asked to categorize this IT ticket, so I\u2019ll respond with the appropriate JSON format. I think it should be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
