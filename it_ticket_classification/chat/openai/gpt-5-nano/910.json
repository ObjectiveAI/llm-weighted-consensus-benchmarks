It\u2019s messy, but it sounds like it may relate to \"Purchase\" since it involves renewing the license. Alternatively, if it's more about installing, \"Administrative rights\" might work, but \"Miscellaneous\" could fit if it doesn\u2019t seem to belong anywhere else. I'll pick the best category based on that.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm looking to categorize a ticket about an expiring software license. The \"Purchase\" category seems relevant since the user may need to obtain a new license. However, the user also requests help with the installation process, which complicates things a bit. \n\nI\u2019ve ruled out several categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Storage,\" \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Access.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could apply due to potential installation needs, it seems fitting to lean towards \"Purchase\" due to the license's expiration being the main concern. I\u2019ll finalize my choice based on that.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
