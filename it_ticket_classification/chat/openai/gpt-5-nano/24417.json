We have categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and more to choose from. The ticket's content suggests it's about migrating processes and link updates, making \"Internal Project\" seem appropriate. Though \"Administrative rights\" could apply if access is needed, it seems to fall under \"Internal Project\" since it clearly states that\u2019s what it involves.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that includes a category field. The prompt asks me to categorize an IT ticket, so a structured output is expected. The correct format includes specifying the category as a string. \n\nSince I've determined the category is \"Internal Project,\" I'll format the JSON response accordingly. While the instructions hint at a broader schema, I can keep it simple by responding with just: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This should meet the requirements clearly."
