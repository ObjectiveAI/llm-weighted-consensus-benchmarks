The relevant categories are \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Access,\" as onboarding typically involves these elements. Since the user is requesting help to fill out a starter form, it seems most appropriate to classify it under \"HR Support.\" I'll prepare a JSON object to return with the chosen category field.**Structuring category response**\n\nI need to format a response as a JSON object that specifies the category type for the IT ticket. The user's message is about a new starter and requesting help with a starter form, which directly ties into the HR onboarding process. Given that \"starter form\" relates to HR paperwork, \"HR Support\" seems to be the most fitting category. This aligns with the intent of the request, so I'll ensure the JSON object reflects that appropriately.**Defining the category response**\n\nI\u2019m deciding how to categorize the IT ticket about onboarding based on the user\u2019s message. \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t seem relevant, and while \"Access\" could apply, the message is too general to specify a system. Therefore, \u201cHR Support\u201d fits best. I\u2019ll create a JSON object with the category clearly defined as \"HR Support.\" The format is straightforward, so I\u2019ll present it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nNo extra text needed. This will work perfectly!"
