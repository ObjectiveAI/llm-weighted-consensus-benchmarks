The ticket seems urgent and relates to onboarding, which could fit into \"HR Support.\" The ticket doesn\u2019t have an exact category for \"Onboarding,\" so I\u2019m weighing options like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" Parsing through the details, it looks like I should classify it under \"HR Support\" for onboarding assistance.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket, which could fit under \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since this is an onboarding request, it might also relate to creating an IT account and access for the new starter, leaning towards the \"Access\" category instead. The request to fill a date is unclear, but it refers to user access provisioning such as email or VPN. So, I think \"Access\" is the best fit here!**Choosing the IT ticket category**\n\nI'm deciding to categorize this ticket as \"Access\" since it involves access provisioning for a new starter, and it's marked as urgent in Bucharest. The message doesn't clearly relate to hardware or procurement, so \"Access\" feels right. I need to respond with a specific JSON-like format, providing just the category object. The final output will be formatted as {\"category\": \"Access\"} \u2014 I\u2019ll make sure to use the exact string in the enum with the uppercase A!"
