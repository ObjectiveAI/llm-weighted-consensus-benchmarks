It seems to fit several categories, including \"Access,\" which seems most relevant for access control issues. I think I'll go with \"Access\" as the primary category since it addresses these concerns.**Producing category JSON**\n\nI wonder if \"Administrative rights\" could fit due to the focus on user rights. However, since the ticket mentions auditors and requests information about who has access to the application, database, and shared drives, it clearly relates to user rights. Therefore, the \"Access\" category seems the most appropriate. I need to respond in JSON format as specified, presenting the required category object without any extra commentary. Here\u2019s the JSON:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
