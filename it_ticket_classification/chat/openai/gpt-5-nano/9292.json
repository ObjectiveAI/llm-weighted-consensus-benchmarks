I think \"Access\" is the most suitable category. I\u2019ll respond in JSON format with the appropriate category.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for the IT ticket. It could be under \"Administrative rights,\" but the text mentions \"permission\" and \"access\", which leads me to think it's more about access permissions. The phrase about \"deleting after days\" suggests it relates to logging changes. However, since the main focus seems to be access rights, I conclude that \"Access\" is the most fitting category. I\u2019ll respond in JSON format like this: {\"category\": \"Access\"}."
