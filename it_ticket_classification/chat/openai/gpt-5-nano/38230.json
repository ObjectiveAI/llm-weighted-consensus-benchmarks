The ticket describes issues with duplicating lines at the purchase order level and includes a request for investigation into potential rules prohibiting this action. It sounds like this falls under the purchase category due to the purchasing system issues mentioned, specifically related to duplication and modification requests.**Categorizing IT ticket issues**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether this ticket falls under \"Administrative rights\" due to mentions of modifying information and possible rules that prohibit certain actions. It seems like the user is having trouble duplicating lines in a purchasing order system, which might relate to permissions managed by user roles. While \u201cPurchase\u201d could also fit since it concerns purchasing order lines, the focus on permissions suggests that \u201cAdministrative Rights\u201d might be more accurate here. I\u2019ll weigh both categories in my decision.**Evaluating ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m considering how best to categorize this ticket. It may not be an \"Internal Project\" since it's likely about a system issue. Although \"Administrative rights\" relates to permissions, the user isn't strictly asking for rights but questions if there\u2019s a rule in place. The ticket focuses on purchase orders, making \"Purchase\" a fitting category. Yet, since compliance and policy are mentioned, \u201cAdministrative Rights\u201d could also apply. I need to assign the most appropriate category based on these factors.**Breaking down the issue**\n\nI\u2019m parsing the details of this ticket. It mentions problems with duplicating lines in purchase orders and references an error message. The user requests to modify specific information at the PO level and is asking if there\u2019s a rule against these actions, indicating a policy concern. While \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could apply due to permission constraints, the primary focus seems to be on purchase orders. Therefore, \u201cPurchase\u201d is likely the best category for this issue in a corporate IT system.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
