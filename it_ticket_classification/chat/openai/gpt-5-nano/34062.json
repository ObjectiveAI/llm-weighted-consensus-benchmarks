The user\u2019s message is a bit messy but seems to revolve around server hard drives, specifically hot-swappable drives, redundancy, and spare parts. Their inquiry is primarily about storage hardware, so I could categorize this ticket as \"Storage\" or \"Purchase,\" depending on the main focus of their request.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI see that this IT ticket involves both Storage and Purchase aspects, but \"Storage\" fits better since it\u2019s about storage hardware, drive replacement, and hot-swap drives. The user is asking for spare parts, SN numbers, and disk types, which relate to hardware maintenance, but primarily focus on storage. They also bring up a web interface issue for a broken drive, but it still revolves around hardware storage. So, I'll categorize this as \"Storage\" and prepare the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI think it's essential to note that the mention of \"dual port hot swap hard drives spare part number\" definitely implies that this is a hardware storage issue. I want to keep it concise without extra explanations. So, the final answer will simply be a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I\u2019ll make sure the formatting is correct, focusing on having \"category\" as the key. That's it!"
