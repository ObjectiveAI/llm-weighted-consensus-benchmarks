Maybe \u201csn friday\u201d is about someone seen on Friday? The mention of \u201che has left\u201d could imply an employee departing, so possibly it relates to access removal or admin rights. I'm weighing if it fits in \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Deciding IT ticket categorization**\n\nI need to categorize a ticket that mentions someone who has left. The phrase \"he has left\" likely indicates that an employee has departed, meaning access should be revoked. The request to \"please add\" could imply they want to add someone else after this departure. The ticket has some unclear parts, but my best guess is it primarily relates to access removal, fitting into the \"Access\" category or possibly \"Administrative rights\" if it involves permissions.**Determining access category for the ticket**\n\nThe ticket states \"please add,\" which likely means they want to add someone else, but it also mentions someone having left. Without more context, I think \"Access\" fits best since it focuses on access control. While \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant, it's narrower. The category \u201cHR Support\u201d doesn\u2019t directly apply here. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object formatted correctly to indicate the chosen category: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. A brief explanation could also be useful!**Preparing final response for IT ticket category**\n\nThe user's instruction is clear: I need to categorize this IT ticket, and the output must be in a specific JSON format. So, I'll provide exactly {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to make sure it\u2019s a valid JSON string and has proper formatting. I\u2019m ready to deliver this in the required channel, ensuring everything is correct. Alright, let's go ahead and deliver just the JSON object."
