The relevant categories include HR Support or Access. In this IT context, a \"new starter\" usually means a new employee, so I\u2019m thinking HR Support makes the most sense for this ticket.**Determining the best category**\n\nI\u2019m assessing categories for the IT ticket mentioned: \"HR Support\" would fit HR processes, while \"Access\" relates to user access provisioning. Since it involves a new starter form, it\u2019s likely an IT request for setting up access accounts. After considering the context, \"Access\" seems like the most appropriate category, as a new starter typically requires account, email, and system access. Given the user's prompt to categorize, I'll format my response like a JSON object for clarity.**Producing the response in JSON format**\n\nThe prompt specifies a schema for category format, so I need to respond with a JSON object like this: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. This is straightforward, as the instruction indicates I should include only the category. While \"Miscellaneous\" could fit if there's uncertainty, I believe \"Access\" is the best choice here. I'll just provide the response without any extra text to keep it clear and to the point. Here\u2019s the output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
