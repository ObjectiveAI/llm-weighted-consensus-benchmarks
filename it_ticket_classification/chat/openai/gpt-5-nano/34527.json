There's also reference to a faulty script and a previous issue. I\u2019ll need to parse this information accurately for proper categorization.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nI\u2019m looking at this ticket about hardware issues with machines that won't start or are unresponsive. While there's mention of a potentially faulty script, the main concern appears to be hardware-related, so I should categorize it as \u201cHardware.\u201d Even though \u201cInternal Project\u201d could fit due to the script, the priority is hardware. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object with the category key. My final output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
