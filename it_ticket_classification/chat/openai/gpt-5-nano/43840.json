The ticket states the certificate has expired, causing an access problem. The available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, and a few others. Since this issue is related to access due to the certificate expiration and not permissions, I think the best fit is the \"Access\" category, even though it might also fit under \"Miscellaneous.\"**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nThe best category for the ticket is \"Access\" since it concerns system access being blocked. I'll format the answer as a JSON object to fulfill the requirement: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The prompt asks me to categorize the IT ticket, so I'll only include the required JSON object without any extra content. This way, I can deliver the information clearly and properly formatted. So the final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
