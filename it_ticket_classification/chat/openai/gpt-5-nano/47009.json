They want guidance on this. The system requires a JSON-like output with a \"category\" field, and I should map the issue to the most appropriate category. Given the context, it seems like this fits best under \"Internal Project\" due to the application malfunction and approvals involved.**Determining the IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm evaluating potential categories for the IT ticket, which could be \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The issues described involve an inability to approve nominations and needing higher-level approvals, hinting toward \"Access.\" While \"Administrative rights\" might seem relevant, the user isn't explicitly requesting admin rights but is facing an interface issue. Since it's primarily about a malfunction in the company's \"zone awards\" feature, I think the best fit is \"Internal Project.\"**Choosing the Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for this IT ticket. It could fall under \"Internal Project,\" especially since it involves the \"zone awards\" feature, which is related to internal development. The text mentions escalating to an engineering lead, reinforcing that context. While \"Access\" might seem plausible due to interface issues, it\u2019s really about a malfunction rather than access rights. Since \"Internal Project\" fits within allowed values, I\u2019ll confirm that as the chosen category in the output.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
