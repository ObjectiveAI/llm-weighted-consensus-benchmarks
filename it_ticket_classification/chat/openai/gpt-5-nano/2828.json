Since it appears to be a hardware issue involving printers and scanners, the best fit is the \"Hardware\" category. I'll respond with a JSON object indicating \"Hardware.\"**Outputting JSON Format**\n\nThe task is to categorize an IT ticket based on the given prompt. The format required is a JSON object that specifies the category, including the allowed categories like \"Hardware\" and others. I see that I need to respond solely with {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} based on the analysis. It\u2019s clear I shouldn't add any extra commentary, just stick to the formatting strictly as instructed. So, I\u2019ll provide that JSON object directly without any fluff.**Confirming Hardware Category**\n\nI need to double-check the details from the ticket, which mentions various issues like device recovery reports, printer alerts, and duplex settings. The focus seems to be on hardware, specifically related to printers, scanners, and copiers. Based on this information, categorizing it under \"Hardware\" is definitely the right choice. Now, I just need to respond with that category result clearly and straightforwardly."
