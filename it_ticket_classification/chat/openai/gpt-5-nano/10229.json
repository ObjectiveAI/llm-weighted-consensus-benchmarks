The user input seems to be about onboarding a new starter, mentioning a starter form and job title. I see it involves forms and access, so the best categories to consider are \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" It\u2019s definitely not about hardware, storage, or purchases. Given all this, \"HR Support\" feels like the right choice!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for the IT ticket. \"HR Support\" seems fitting since it involves onboarding tasks like \"new starter\" and \"starter form.\" There\u2019s also the \"Administrative rights\" category, but everything mentioned relates to HR rather than granting admin rights. The content revolves around onboarding paperwork, and while \"Access\" could apply if it referenced system access, it doesn\u2019t clearly do so. So I\u2019ll go ahead and produce the JSON object with \"HR Support\" as the category."
