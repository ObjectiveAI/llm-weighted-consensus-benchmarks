It's not about hardware or HR support, and since there's no \"Software\" category, I might have to use \"Miscellaneous.\" There's a chance it could fit \"Access,\" but it's primarily about a saving error. So, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the best fit.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on its content. The categories at my disposal include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. Since the ticket talks about an Oracle error and issues with saving a report, it feels like it relates to a software issue. However, there\u2019s no specific \"Software\" category, so \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the best fit. I'll output the category in JSON format as {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} and might consider adding a short explanation, too.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
