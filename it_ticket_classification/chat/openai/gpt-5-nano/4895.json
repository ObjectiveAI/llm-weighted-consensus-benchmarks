The ticket includes some garbled text, but it seems like the user is asking for an adapter. Since an adapter is generally considered hardware, the most fitting category would be \"Hardware.\" However, there's a slight possibility it could fall under \"Purchase\" if they're looking to buy one. Overall, \"Hardware\" seems to be the safest choice here.**Categorizing the IT request**\n\nI'm looking at the ticket text: \"to adapter adapter dear please provide adapter best regards senior tester id image.\" It seems like a Senior Tester is requesting an adapter, possibly a USB-C to HDMI one. The \"id image\" part is a bit unclear, but as far as categorization goes, I believe \"Hardware\" is the best fit. I\u2019ll provide the response simply as a JSON object without extra commentary. Here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
