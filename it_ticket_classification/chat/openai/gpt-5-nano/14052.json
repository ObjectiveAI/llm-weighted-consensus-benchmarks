The ticket description is quite messy and hard to follow. It talks about changing notification schedules and mentions various issues that have been resolved or persist. I'll sift through that chaotic text to find clues about the appropriate category. It seems to relate to scheduling problems, so perhaps it falls under Administrative rights or Miscellaneous. Let's see!**Categorizing ticket requests**\n\nThe user is requesting changes to the ticket notifications schedule for weekends, mentioning issues that have been resolved. This seems to relate to modifying the notification system, which could fall under Administrative rights due to its connection with configuration settings and permissions. Still, it might also fit into Miscellaneous as it's a general IT request. So, I'll need to decide if it aligns better with Administrative rights or if it\u2019s just a typical ticket under Miscellaneous.**Selecting the right category**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize a ticket, and I need to choose the best fit from the allowed categories. \"Administrative rights\" seems to be the most appropriate since it relates to changing the notification schedule, which involves system settings. Alternatively, I could consider \"Internal Project\" if it were linked to a project, but that\u2019s not clear here. Since the request doesn't fit into hardware, HR, or access categories, I'm leaning towards Administrative rights or possibly Miscellaneous.**Analyzing the ticket content**\n\nLet's break down this mixed-up text. It looks like the user is logging a ticket regarding updates to the notification schedule for weekends, mentioning resolved issues and requesting assistance. Given that it's about changing settings or configurations, the best category for this ticket is \"Administrative rights.\" Now, I need to ensure I'm responding in the required JSON format to provide the system with the right information. The category format I need is: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
