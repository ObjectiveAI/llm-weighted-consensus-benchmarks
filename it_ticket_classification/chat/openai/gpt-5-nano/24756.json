It mentions things like \"guideline thresholds\" and \"organization client.\" Considering all this, it's likely related to financial matters, so the \"Purchase\" category seems like the best fit, while \"Miscellaneous\" might be a second option.**Categorizing IT Ticket Again**\n\nI see there's no specific \"Finance\" category available. However, \"Purchase\" seems to fit because the ticket discusses costs and bookings, mentioning things like \"move attached costs.\" The text highlights scheduling terms like \"re book,\" which suggests it could relate to financial scheduling. The ticket is messy, but the best fit does feel like \"Purchase\" since it connects to costs and budgets. I should return just the category in a JSON format as instructed.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
