The user provided a long text mentioning issues with dropped sessions and possible access problems. \"Access\" seems appropriate for login issues while \"Miscellaneous\" works for anything unknown. If it pertains to devices, it'll go under \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll output a JSON format with the chosen category based on my assessment of the ticket details.**Choosing the appropriate category**\n\nThe prompt includes a schema for categorizing IT tickets, which I need to follow. The ticket mentions issues with dropped sessions and connectivity, suggesting it could be related to access or a general IT problem. While \"Access\" typically involves login permissions, it may not fully encapsulate this issue. \"Miscellaneous\" seems fitting since it serves as a catch-all for general IT problems. I\u2019ll lean towards \"Miscellaneous\" but remain unsure if \"Access\" might also apply due to the session drops.**Finalizing category output**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project,\" but it doesn\u2019t really fit since it's not project-specific. It mainly discusses session issues, so \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the best choice here. The instructions specify I should respond with a JSON object. So, I\u2019ll make sure to output valid JSON without extra commentary. It will be structured like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} to keep it clear and concise."
