The ticket mentions adding \"PM\" to Oracle on Friday PM. There\u2019s some ambiguity here, as \"PM\" might refer to permissions or a project manager. In IT, \"PM\" often relates to user permissions. I\u2019ll need to clarify if the user needs specific privileges or if they\u2019re referring to a project manager in Oracle.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe request seems to suggest granting a \"PM\" role in Oracle, but it's quite ambiguous. \"Add PM to Oracle\" might mean permissions or possibly even project management. The categories suggest that \"Access\" fits best if it's about permission changes, while \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they're asking for privileges. Based on the context, I'm inclined to categorize it as \"Access\" since it relates to user permissions in the Oracle database.**Classifying Ticket Category**\n\nThe term \"pm\" likely refers to \"permission\" or \"privilege,\" but without further context, I think \"Access\" is the safer choice. According to the category schema provided, I\u2019ll need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category. I can confirm that it could be either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" depending on whether it\u2019s about general permission or specific admin rights. Given the context, I\u2019ll choose \"Access\" as the best fit for the request.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
