There\u2019s a list of tags detailing requests to add domains to a block list. The categories I have to consider are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It looks like this ticket pertains to security and updating blacklists. This might fall under Administrative rights or Internal Project. I\u2019ll examine the categories more closely.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the ticket to categorize it properly. It involves adding domains to a blocklist, which suggests an administrative task related to managing security settings. The categories I\u2019m considering include Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since it\u2019s about modifying access controls, I think the best fit is \"Administrative Rights.\" If I\u2019m ever unsure between two categories, I\u2019ll go with the more specific option like Administrative rights here.**Creating response in JSON format**\n\nI need to craft a JSON response indicating the category for the IT ticket. It\u2019s clear that the category is \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll format the output according to the required specifications. The system expects a simple JSON object with the category property. So, I\u2019ll produce it like this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and avoid any extra commentary since the user just wants the categorization. Let\u2019s finalize this response!"
