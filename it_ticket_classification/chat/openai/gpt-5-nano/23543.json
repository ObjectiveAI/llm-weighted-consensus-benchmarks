I might lean towards \"Internal Project\" since it revolves around process tooling and planning for a Wednesday PM meeting.**Parsing ticket description**\n\nI'm analyzing the phrase: \"wants to share appendix process tooling with wednesday pm.\" It could mean sharing with someone named \"Wednesday PM\" or indicates a time. The phrase \"accept decline\" hints at needing approval for this sharing. \n\nWhile it doesn't fit categories like hardware, HR, or storage, it might touch on \"Access\" since sharing tools suggests access. However, the \"Internal Project\" category feels most suitable because it's about sharing a process related to internal projects, making it the best match.**Classifying IT ticket category**\n\nThe user is likely asking to share an appendix process tooling with a stakeholder. Since this request doesn't fit hardware or storage categories, I should categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" \n\nTo keep everything clear, I'll format the response as JSON with the category field as \"Internal Project.\" It's important to ensure this matches the allowed values. The user specifically asked for a classification, so I won't add any extra explanation unless they ask for it. Here's how the output will look: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
