The user provided a long text about security issues with access to folders, which indicates it's likely about access control. \n\nI'm leaning toward categorizing it as \"Access\" since it focuses on who can access folders, while \"Administrative rights\" pertains more to privileged access. The ticket clearly relates to access management, so \"Access\" seems most appropriate!**Delivering JSON for category**\n\nI think the category \"Access\" is more appropriate since it broadly covers the access management issues mentioned in the ticket. Even though \"Administrative rights\" could work if it was strictly about admin rights, \"Access\" fits better for the content provided.\n\nI need to respond with a straightforward JSON object. The expected output should just state the category without any extra text. I'll deliver the response as follows:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nThat's it! Nice and simple!"
