It's important to organize them in a way that makes sense, but I\u2019m considering the criteria we should use. Should it be based on urgency, type of issue, or perhaps the department involved? There\u2019s a lot to think about and I want to ensure that I make it as user-friendly as possible. Let\u2019s clarify the categories we need!**Categorizing IT ticket for licenses**\n\nI'm working on categorizing this IT ticket related to licenses. The user's asking about different types, like \"Idea licenses\" or \"IntelliJ IDEA.\" I need to determine which category fits best from options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Purchase,\" and others. Since the ticket is about license management\u2014replenishment, activation, and usage trends\u2014I think \"Purchase\" or \"Access\" might be the most appropriate categories. I'll have to decide carefully!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
