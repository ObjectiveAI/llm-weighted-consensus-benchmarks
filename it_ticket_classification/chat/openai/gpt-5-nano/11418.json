I think the best category here is \"Hardware,\" but it could also fit under \"Purchase\" if they mean to buy RAM. Since it's primarily about acquiring RAM, I'll lean towards \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate category.**Choosing the appropriate category**\n\nLooking at the categories available \u2014 Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights \u2014 I think \"Hardware\" is the most fitting one since this is related to RAM. While \"Purchase\" could work, the phrasing suggests they might want to specify a RAM model. Ultimately, I'll settle on \"Hardware.\" Following the instructions, I\u2019ll structure my output as JSON: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That\u2019s exactly what the system expects!"
