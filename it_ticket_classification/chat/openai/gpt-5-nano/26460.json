The user prompted me with a messy text about a \"cube report issue.\u201d It seems to revolve around reporting, possibly hinting at a data or report issue. \n\nSince it doesn\u2019t mention hardware, HR, or access, I\u2019m thinking it might fit into categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Let\u2019s determine the best category based on this context!**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nAmong the given categories, \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems like a good fit for a report issue. The ticket requests assistance with a \u201ccube report,\u201d which hints it could be linked to an internal project deliverable. Alternatively, it could be related to \"Access\" if it's about getting permission to a report or \"Administrative rights\" if elevated access is needed. There\u2019s also a vague possibility it\u2019s \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d However, I'll lean toward \u201cInternal Project\u201d as the most appropriate choice for this ticket.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object for the ticket, specifically with a \"category\" field. Given the content, which mentions a \"cube report issue,\" it strongly suggests there's a problem with a report rather than hardware, so \"Internal Project\" seems appropriate. While \"Miscellaneous\" might be a fallback for unclear content, this request is clear enough to categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" Therefore, I'll structure it like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
