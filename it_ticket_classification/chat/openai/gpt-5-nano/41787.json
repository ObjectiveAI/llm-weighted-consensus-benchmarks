The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Since the issue relates to candidate referrals, it looks like \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category. I\u2019ll create a JSON object with the key \"category\" set to \"HR Support.\" This seems appropriate given the context of the request!**Finalizing category for ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering categorizing the ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it relates to a system issue. However, the message emphasizes \u201creferral system issue\u201d and \u201ccandidate referral,\u201d which suggests it\u2019s more of an HR issue. So, I think \u201cHR Support\u201d is the best choice. I\u2019ll produce the final output as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}, even though the instructions imply plain text might be acceptable too. It's all about making sure I get this right!**Providing the category output**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to format the output for the ticket category. While typical tasks may just need a string, the schema suggests they want a JSON object. I should follow that and provide the category accordingly. To comply, I\u2019ll just output the JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I want to keep it straightforward, so I\u2019ll avoid any extra text and make sure this is clear and to the point!"
