The user\u2019s message indicates an issue with Oracle project tasks not being visible when trying to submit a project code, and they also request to change the start date. This suggests it might relate to Access or Internal Project since it deals with visibility and permissions in the Oracle system.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the possibility of categorizing this IT ticket under \"Administrative rights\" because it seems the user may need permissions to access or view tasks. They mention changing the start date and enabling card submissions, which adds some confusion. The core issue appears to be project tasks not visible, indicating an access or permissions problem within Oracle. So, it might fit best under the \"Access\" category, but \"Administrative rights\" could also apply since they are requesting permissions.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m weighing the options between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" If this ticket is about granting permissions to view tasks, it fits Access; but if it\u2019s about changing system permissions, it might be Administrative rights. The request to change the start date suggests it falls under \"Internal Project,\" as it involves project management. Since the user refers to project codes and enabling submissions, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit here. So, let's categorize it as \"Internal Project.\"**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nI see the user has asked to categorize the IT ticket in a specific JSON-like format. The required structure has a top-level JSON object with the \"category\" property. I need to choose a value from the given options. Based on earlier discussion, I think \"Internal Project\" fits best. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll format my response as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nThis matches the schema, and it\u2019s clear and straightforward. I'll ensure it's structured correctly when I provide it!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
