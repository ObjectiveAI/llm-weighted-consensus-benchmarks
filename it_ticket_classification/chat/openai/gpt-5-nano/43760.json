They mention problems saving within a shared library and checking documents in/out. It sounds like a permission issue where users may lack rights to update the compliance library. Since both \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" are relevant, I need to determine which one is the better fit for their situation.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI think I\u2019ll choose \"Access\" since the issue revolves around accessing shared documents and checking them out. However, \"Administrative rights\" could fit if it's more about permission levels. I noticed some unclear phrasing regarding the document sharing process. The task is to categorize this IT ticket, which needs a JSON-like format. Since the user can only save personal copies, it really seems to be an access issue. I\u2019ll go ahead and output a JSON object with \"Access\" as the category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
