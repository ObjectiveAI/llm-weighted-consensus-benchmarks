Since it\u2019s about CI/CD, \"Internal Project\" seems the most fitting, as it relates to builds for internal projects.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for an IT ticket related to CI/CD issues. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too broad and the other categories like \"Admin rights,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Hardware\" don\u2019t fit either. \"Internal Project\" seems like the right choice, as it relates to development issues. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and prepare to respond with a JSON object matching the specified schema.
