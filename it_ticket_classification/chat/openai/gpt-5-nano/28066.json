The ticket seems to deal with a new starter asking for assistance with a return form related to an Oracle system. It might fit into \"HR Support\" since it's about onboarding, but I must consider if it could also be labeled as \"Access\" for account provisioning or perhaps \"Administrative rights.\" Since the ticket is primarily about onboarding, \"HR Support\" feels like the most appropriate category.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe text from the ticket mentions assisting with a form for a new starter, which makes me think we\u2019re looking at either \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" The categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since it refers to onboarding and mentions Oracle, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" because it relates to provisioning for a new starter. However, the phrase about the attached form suggests it could also fit under \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll need to decide which best fits this context before categorizing it in JSON format.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out how to categorize this ticket. The phrase \u201cnew starter oracle october pm starter\u201d suggests an employee onboarding process, where \u201coracle\u201d indicates access to the Oracle system and \u201cpm\u201d might hint at project management. The request for assistance with an attached form implies it\u2019s about completing procedures for the new starter\u2019s Oracle access. Generally, such requests fall under \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" Given it\u2019s about enabling access, I think \"Access\" is the safest choice.**Confirming Ticket Category**\n\nThe user didn\u2019t explicitly mention granting access to Oracle, but it seems reasonable to infer that from their request. While \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant for admin access, I think \"Access\" is the best fit here because the new starter needs access to Oracle and is asking for help with a form. Given that, I\u2019ll categorize the ticket as \"Access\" and respond in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
