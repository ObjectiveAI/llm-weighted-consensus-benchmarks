They mention \"adding servers to be accessible\" and \"accessible via\u2026,\" which suggests it's about access to servers and permissions. I'm looking at the categories: \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" seems like a fit. Since it's focused on enabling access, I'll likely go with \"Access\" for the categorization, as it's typically used for requests regarding permissions. It\u2019s definitely a bit tricky, but I think I'm on the right track!**Categorizing IT ticket request**\n\nThe user asked about \"configured purposes accessible,\" which is a bit unclear. It seems I should categorize this IT ticket under \"Access.\" The system likely requires a specific format, so I'll respond with a JSON object to fulfill that need. The expected output should include the category, so I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I briefly considered \"Internal Project\" as an option since it mentions servers, but \"Access\" fits better based on the request's emphasis. So, I\u2019ll stick with that!**Finalizing the category output**\n\nI need to make sure I follow the instruction to provide only the category object. A brief note could be useful, but the key is to stick to what\u2019s required and ensure clarity. So, I\u2019ll deliver just the category as a JSON object. This keeps things safe and straightforward, avoiding any unnecessary details that could complicate the response. It's important to be concise here, so let's just provide it clearly."
