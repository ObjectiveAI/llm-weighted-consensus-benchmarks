The user's message seems a bit jumbled, but it looks like it's about a new purchase order on Friday. There are phrases indicating it's related to purchasing and receipts, which strongly points to the \"Purchase\" category. While it could potentially fit \"Internal Project,\" the focus is clearly on purchase orders. So, I'll classify it as \"Purchase\" and return that in a JSON format.**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket using the allowed categories like Hardware, HR Support, or Purchase. It seems clear the category is \"Purchase\" based on phrases indicating a new purchase order. While I should output just the JSON object with the \"category\" property, I want to make sure it's absolutely clear. The phrases strongly point to this classification, so I\u2019ll deliver the response as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. No extra commentary needed!"
