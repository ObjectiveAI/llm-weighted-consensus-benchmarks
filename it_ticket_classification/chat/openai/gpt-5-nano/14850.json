There's also a reference to \"spark setup,\" likely touching on hardware as well. They\u2019re asking to log into Teams, which is a collaboration tool, but the category should be one of the options provided. I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit since it's focused on equipment issues. So, I'll craft a response as a JSON object with the category set to \"Hardware.\"**Finalizing category output**\n\nIn previous tasks, I learned that I should generally output just the object with \"category\": \"...\". The instruction requests the categorization of the IT ticket, and I think the expected format is a JSON object with \"category\": \"Hardware.\" To be precise, I'll output just the minimal: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. The schema suggests it may need to be a complete object format, but to follow the instruction clearly, I\u2019ll stick to outputting just the category."
