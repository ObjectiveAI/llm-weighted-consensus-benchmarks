It mentions being a \"new starter\" and seems to indicate issues with access or working properly. So, I\u2019ll deduce the appropriate category from the provided list, which includes options like \"Access,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context, it feels like \"Access\" might be the right choice. I\u2019ll prepare the output in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Interpreting garbled text**\n\nThe text is quite garbled: it mentions a \"new starter\" and possibly \"AD kingdom,\" which I interpret as relating to Active Directory. The mention of \"starter\" suggests it's about access rights for new accounts, specifically \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" With hints like \"head\" possibly referring to a help desk, I need to decide between those categories. Overall, it feels like \"Access\" would be the best fit for this context.**Categorizing access rights**\n\nThe text clearly mentions \"new starter\" and \"AD,\" which indicates it's about gaining access or access rights, so I lean towards categorizing it as \"Access.\" The user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, so I should respond with just the category in the required format. Although \"Administrative rights\" might also fit if it involves granting admin permissions, it seems more appropriate to go with \"Access\" for a general access request related to onboarding a new starter in Active Directory.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
