It's not entirely clear what the user means. I have a list of categories to choose from, including Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the confusion in the ticket, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a safer choice, but I might also consider \"Administrative rights\" depending on interpretation.**Categorizing ambiguous notes**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize a message that includes unclear notes like \"Thursday March PM,\" \"hello hi,\" and \"March hello entities.\" I\u2019m considering options like \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access,\" but there are no specific mentions of hardware or HR. The part about scheduling might point toward \"Internal Project.\" However, since it's largely unclear, I'll opt for \"Miscellaneous\" as the safest choice. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
