The inclusion of \"defect\" suggests there's an issue, which could indicate it's a hardware problem, like a defective card reader. The repeated mention of \"card\" makes me think it could relate to Access or Administrative rights as well. Time to classify this properly!**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nSince the ticket mentions \"card\" and \"defect,\" it's likely indicating a hardware issue with something like a magnetic stripe or access card. The category that fits best is \"Hardware.\" The system appears to expect a response in a specific JSON format. I need to provide this as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It seems that following the instructions and returning a JSON object with the category string inside is the correct approach for this task, so that's what I'll do!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
