The ticket discusses topics related to forecasting, project management, and digital automation, which suggests it could fit under \"Internal Project.\" Despite being a bit messy, I believe categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" makes sense. I\u2019ll prepare to respond with the JSON format: { \"category\": \"Internal Project\" }.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to format the output correctly for the IT ticket categorization. It should be a simple JSON object with a single field \"category\" that holds one of the specified values. So, the correct format is: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll avoid any extra commentary to keep it concise and focus only on delivering what\u2019s necessary. This way, I ensure clarity and compliance with the requirements."
