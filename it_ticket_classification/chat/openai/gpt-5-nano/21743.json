The ticket talks about a purchase related to devices and mentions adding an installation, which suggests a focus on hardware. The best category seems to be \"Purchase\" for the order and potentially \"Hardware\" for the devices. However, since we need a single category, I think \"Purchase\" is the most fitting choice overall for this ticket.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket, and I'm leaning towards \"Purchase\" since it mentions \"new purchase po,\" \"purchased,\" and \"installing device.\" Although \"Hardware\" feels relevant because of the devices involved, the core action seems to focus on creating a purchase order. Since I can only choose one category, \"Purchase\" is the best fit based on the ticket's content. I just need to ensure the response is in the correct JSON format for submission.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
