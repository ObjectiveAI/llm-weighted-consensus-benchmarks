It seems like an internal support task. \"Administrative rights,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" don't fit. \"Miscellaneous\" is too vague, so the best fit seems to be \"Internal Project,\" since it involves a dashboard feature.**Finalizing category response**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d fits since it could relate to user access, but the text focuses on setting up a weekly complaint report and creating a dashboard. The issues mentioned don\u2019t really connect to access rights. This all suggests it\u2019s more about a reporting feature, making \u201cInternal Project\u201d the best category. I need to respond precisely as requested in JSON format without any additional text. \n\nSo, the final response should just be:  \n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
