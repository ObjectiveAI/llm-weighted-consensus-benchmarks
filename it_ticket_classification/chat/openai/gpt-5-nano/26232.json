It includes phrases like \"new purchase,\" \"po\" (purchase order), and \"log installation,\" which suggest it\u2019s about purchasing and installing new equipment, as well as handling receipts. I\u2019m considering the right category. It could fit under \"Purchase\" since it mentions an order, but \"Hardware\" is another possibility due to the equipment aspect. The phrase about logging installation is a key clue too.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm examining an IT ticket and considering the most fitting category from a set that includes Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. This ticket clearly involves procurement, so \"Purchase\" seems appropriate. However, since it mentions \"new purchase\" and \"po\" (purchase order), along with a request to \"log installation\" and receipts, it might also connect to \"Hardware.\" Ultimately, I\u2019ll classify it as \"Purchase\" and prepare the response in the required JSON format.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
