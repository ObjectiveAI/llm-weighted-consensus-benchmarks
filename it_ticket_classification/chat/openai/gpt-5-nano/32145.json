The user\u2019s message is quite messy and mentions removing something from AM team notifications and refers to ServiceNow. It\u2019s unclear which category it fits into\u2014it could relate to \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", or even \"Internal Project\", but it's not straightforward. I'll need to assess this further.**Parsing user request**\n\nI\u2019m looking at this content where the user seems to want to remove \"com\" from AM team notifications in ServiceNow. It looks like there\u2019s a lot going on, and it could potentially relate to \"Access\", \"Administrative rights\", or even \"Miscellaneous\". The request might involve a configuration change, rather than user access. There isn't a clear \u201cNotification\u201d category, which makes this tricky. I think \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" could be reasonable fits based on the context.**Categorizing system notifications**\n\nThe request here is about modifying system notifications. I could consider it \"Miscellaneous\", but if I have to choose a specific category, \"Administrative rights\" might fit since it's about changing notification recipients and access control. However, that isn't quite about user rights. Alternatively, since \"Access\" is included in the categories, it seems more appropriate given that the user wants to adjust notification recipients. So I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" and respond with a JSON object in the required format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
