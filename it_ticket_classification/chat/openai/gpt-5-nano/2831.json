The categories to choose from are hardware, HR support, access, miscellaneous, storage, purchase, internal project, and administrative rights. Since the request doesn\u2019t specifically mention any of the hardware or storage aspects, it could fit into \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access,\" especially if it relates to access control. I'll need to decide from there!**Categorizing IT requests**\n\nI\u2019m considering the phrase \u201ceel reports\u201d and wondering if it\u2019s garbled. It looks like the user is asking for reports about locations per floor. In terms of categorization, \"Internal Project\" could work if it's a feature request related to reporting. \"Miscellaneous\" is too vague. The \"Access\" category focuses on permissions and control issues, but that doesn't seem to apply here. I think \"Internal Project\" might be the best fit for their request!**Deciding on category assignment**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT request. While \"Miscellaneous\" is an option for unclear requests, I need to provide a single category in a JSON-like format. Since the user is asking for reports about locations per floor, it might fit best under \"Internal Project,\" as it pertains to reporting tasks. However, I could also label it \"Miscellaneous.\" The mention of \"engineer\" suggests it's directed to someone in that role, and \"eel reports\" could just be a duplication. I'll go with \"Internal Project.\"{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
