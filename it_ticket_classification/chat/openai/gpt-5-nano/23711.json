I can sense a focus on coverage and timing across different teams and locations mentioned, which might help me find the right category.**Classifying coverage hour requests**\n\nThis request seems to revolve around adjusting coverage hours at various sites. \"Administrative rights\" probably isn't relevant here, while \"Access\" might be fitting since it deals with changes to coverage hours. It could also be \"Internal Project\" if it's about adjusting schedules, though it's not entirely clear if it's an actual project. Maybe \"HR Support\" could apply since it concerns staff coverage hours. Overall, I need to pick the best category that fits this situation without overthinking it too much!**Identifying the right category for IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket seems to be more about HR scheduling, but the categories are specific to IT support. The content mentions things like coverage hours, different locations, and public holidays, which doesn't clearly align with technical issues. I think \"HR Support\" could apply since it's about staff coverage, but it feels more operational. Maybe \"Internal Project\" fits best since it involves adjusting coverage times, or \"Miscellaneous\" if I'm uncertain. I'll need to decide carefully!"
