Since the ticket content mostly revolves around the inability to access the feedback links, I think the most suitable category is \u201cAccess.\u201d I\u2019ve considered other categories like \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d but they don't quite fit as well. There\u2019s no mention of hardware, HR support, storage, purchase, or internal projects. So, I\u2019m confident that \u201cAccess\u201d is the best choice here!**Formatting response in JSON**\n\nI need to respond with the category in the correct JSON format since the system expects a specific structure with a \"category\" field. Based on my previous analysis, the category should be \u201cAccess.\u201d I also know I shouldn't add any extra commentary, so I need to ensure that the final answer is precisely the JSON object. This sounds straightforward! Let\u2019s get that formatted correctly. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
