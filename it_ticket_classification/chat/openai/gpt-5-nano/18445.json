The categories I have to work with include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It seems the mention of \"pm code\" relates to configurations, so I\u2019m considering whether it fits into Administrative rights, Internal Project, or possibly Miscellaneous. Since it's about project management, Internal Project likely makes the most sense.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating how to categorize this IT ticket that mentions a \"PM code\" and project updates. The ambiguity is challenging; it could relate to \"Administrative rights\" if they seek permission changes. \"PM code\" might mean \"project management code\" for logins or configurations. Since it refers to project management, \"Internal Project\" seems fitting. The user might want to add the PM code to configurations, which aligns with internal project management tasks. I need to select the best category based on this context.**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out how to categorize this IT ticket. It might relate to \"Administrative rights\" since they want to adjust access to the PM code, but there's no explicit mention of permissions. Typically, I'd categorize it as \"Internal Project\" because it involves project updates, or perhaps \"Miscellaneous\" if it\u2019s unclear. The user wants me to provide a category, so I\u2019ll conclude with the safest option: \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll respond in a structured way, suggesting that as the category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
