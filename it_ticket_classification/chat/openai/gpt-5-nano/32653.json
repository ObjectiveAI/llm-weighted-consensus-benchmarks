The user's text seems focused on an end date, updates, logistics, and the return of equipment. While there are mentions of access and administrative rights, it appears that the primary concern is related to returning equipment. So, I'll classify this ticket under \"Hardware\" since it primarily deals with equipment management.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI need to determine if the IT ticket fits into \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The content mentions scheduling, updating dates, and equipment return logistics, which points to asset management. So, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Hardware.\" I'll ensure everything is in the appropriate JSON format. The instruction indicates to give a JSON object for the category. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} while following the schema structure correctly. This seems concise and clear!"
