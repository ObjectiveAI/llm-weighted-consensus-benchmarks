The ticket's content is messy, but it appears to be related to a leaver\u2019s mobile subscription and involves closing a contract and updating documentation. It seems to involve the HR process as well as access issues. I\u2019m considering categorizing it as \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" but \"Miscellaneous\" could fit too. It\u2019s a bit tricky!**Classifying Mobile Subscription Ticket**\n\nThis ticket is about a mobile subscription linked to a leaver, focusing on contract closure, removing them from the system, and deleting a ticket queue. This suggests it's related to access management and device handling. The term \"leaver\" indicates offboarding, so I\u2019m considering \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" for classification. While \"Access\" deals with user accounts, this ticket seems more about offboarding and device ownership, making \"Administrative rights\" a strong choice. It's a bit of a puzzle!**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT ticket. \"Administrative rights\" seems to fit best, especially since it involves offboarding. \"Internal Project\" doesn't quite match, and \"Miscellaneous\" is too vague. \"Purchase\" would apply if it were about contracts, but it's not a sale. I'll prepare a concise response in JSON format. The category object should simply be: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. This ensures clarity and accuracy without any extra text.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
