The categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d \n\nThe ticket message seems messy, though; it talks about marking opportunities as won and contracts. This might relate to CRM or sales system operations. I\u2019m considering whether it fits best under \"Administrative rights,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or even \"Purchase.\" It\u2019s a bit tricky, but I need to select a fitting category.**Clarifying Ticket Categorization**\n\nThe content talks about marking opportunities as won and mentions executed contracts, which clearly relates more to a sales process rather than hardware or HR issues. I\u2019m considering if it fits under \"Administrative rights,\" as there could be a request for help with system operations, even though there\u2019s no explicit access request. \n\nIt might also work as \"Miscellaneous\" if none of the categories quite fit. Alternatively, it could be \"Internal Project\" if it's related to internal processes. The taxonomy is a bit tricky here!**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nI need to select the most fitting category for this ticket. It could be \"Internal Project\" if it's about improving the CRM system, or \"Administrative rights\" if the user needs to change statuses, since they mention marking opportunities as won\u2014a functional operation. \n\nIf nothing quite fits, it could fall under \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019m thinking \"Administrative rights\" might be the best choice, as it suggests a request for help with admin tasks. The user seems to want quick assistance with this.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
