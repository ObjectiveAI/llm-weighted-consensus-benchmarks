Let's clarify that before finalizing!**Categorizing laptop issues**\n\nI'm analyzing a ticket related to laptop problems, specifically around issues with the display and external monitor connections. It seems there might be a corrupted driver causing black screens when external monitors are connected, and there's mention of hardware issues, possibly related to the GPU. Given the context, I need to categorize it under \"Hardware.\" The response should be formatted in JSON like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I'll keep it straightforward with no extra text!**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI see now that the instructions specify I should respond with just the JSON object representing the category. There's no need for any extra text or explanation; the output should be straightforward. So, I'll focus on ensuring the format is precise and directly present the JSON. Let's proceed and output only the category object in the required format. This keeps things simple and clear!"
