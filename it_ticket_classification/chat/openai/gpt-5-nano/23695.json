The snippet mentions a \"new starter\" and a \"starter form,\" which seems to point towards HR onboarding. The potential categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the context, \"HR Support\" looks like the best fit since it relates directly to onboarding. However, I should also consider \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Deciding on a category**\n\nIt looks like the best category for this IT ticket is \"HR Support\" since it relates to onboarding, specifically the starter form mentioned. While \"Access\" deals with access rights and \"Administrative rights\" is even more specific, the context here primarily involves HR processes. I\u2019ll craft a concise JSON object with the category specified: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This way, it aligns with the category schema, and I could add a brief justification if needed. It's important to get this right!**Preparing the response**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I just need to categorize the IT ticket without needing to add an explanation. I'll create the category object with a field named \"category,\" using \"HR Support\" from the list. So, the output will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That's straightforward, and it aligns perfectly with what\u2019s required. Now, I\u2019ll deliver that response. It's nice when things are simple like this!"
