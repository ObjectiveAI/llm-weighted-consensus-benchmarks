It mentions \u201cagile champions,\u201d possibly a group related to this context. From the categorization options, it seems to fit best under \u201cAccess\u201d for membership management and permissions or \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d for admin-level access. Both options are relevant, but \u201cAccess\u201d feels like the more appropriate fit here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user has provided a string regarding an IT ticket and is asking me to categorize it without providing additional steps. Based on the content, I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category since it concerns adding a member and modifying membership, which relates to access management. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it were explicitly about granting admin rights, the context leans more towards \"Access.\" I'll respond with the required JSON format, setting the category to \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
