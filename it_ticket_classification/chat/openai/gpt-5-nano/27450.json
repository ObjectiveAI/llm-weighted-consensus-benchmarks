Since it mentions a change in a project manager, \"Administrative rights\" might be the best fit if it pertains to access changes. I\u2019ll ultimately output a JSON object specifying the category once I decide.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m working to categorize an IT ticket with some unclear language, mentioning \u201cproject manager change\u201d and \u201cannual leave.\u201d The \"Access\" category might fit for granting access, and \"HR Support\" could cover the annual leave reference. However, if it's about project management, \"Internal Project\" seems fitting. The phrase \"please add except code\" raises questions too; it might suggest granting access as well. I need to decide on the best category.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing the ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it involves a project manager change and mentions \"agile\" and \"annual leave.\" The text suggests connections to project management and teams. So, I\u2019ll format my answer as a JSON object with the category property. It seems that including a brief rationale isn't necessary, as the instruction emphasizes categorization alone. Thus, I\u2019ll respond with: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI need to keep it clean and straightforward, without extra text.**Outputting the category object**\n\nIt looks like the system needs me to provide a JSON object specifically formatted for the category. So, I'll create the object with the \"category\" field set to \"Internal Project.\" The final output should simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI\u2019m just making sure everything is aligned with what\u2019s required. Let's produce this correctly!"
