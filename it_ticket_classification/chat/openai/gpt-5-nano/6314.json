The message is a bit confusing, with phrases like \"set am as owners to users\" and the word \"owners\" repeated. It might suggest something related to access rights or administrative rights. Considering this repetition and the context of setting permissions, I think the ticket fits best under \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll stick with that category for clarity and proper handling.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI think the message is likely about granting ownership or administrative rights to users. \"Owners\" could refer to owner roles in a system, which aligns with the \"Administrative rights\" category. \"Access\" is another potential category since it\u2019s about ownership and access rights too. The request to \"set am as owners to users\" isn't entirely clear, but it suggests ownership privileges. Overall, \"Administrative rights\" seems to be the best-fitting category for this IT ticket.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
