The specific mention of \"work location\" makes me lean towards \"HR Support,\" as it relates to onboarding and organizational logistics. Let's go with that!**Choosing the right category**\n\nThis IT ticket mentions \"analyst ext hub\" and \"administration officer,\" suggesting they're asking about work location details for a new starter in Bucharest. I'm considering whether this should fit into \"Administrative rights,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Access\" based on what they're needing. Since it relates to onboarding and work location, \"HR Support\" feels like the best fit. However, I should note that \"Access\" could also work, but the request isn\u2019t specifically asking for access. Overall, \"HR Support\" seems most accurate.**Formatting the response**\n\nThe answer needs to be in a JSON-like structure, specifically formatted to meet the requirement. The prompt specifies that I should respond with something like: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. So I\u2019ll ensure to follow the schema exactly as outlined without adding any extra text. It's important that I only output the JSON and nothing else to match the instructions. Therefore, it will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Let's finalize and deliver that!"
