The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. I want to ensure I choose the most appropriate category for the ticket to streamline the process. Let\u2019s see how each category aligns with the issue. I\u2019ll think through the specific details of the ticket to make the best choice! It\u2019s all about clarity and efficiency.**Analyzing Onboarding Ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve got a long ticket text regarding new starters, specifically about onboarding processes in ServiceNow. It's mentioning licenses, accounts, starter forms, and the transition of interns to full-time employees, which is quite a bit to unpack! There are also details about license costs, access controls, approval procedures, and how to proceed. I need to organize this information neatly to address all aspects effectively. It\u2019s all about making sure we handle the onboarding smoothly!**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m sorting through the category options for this IT ticket. \"Access\" is quite relevant since it involves managing user accounts and permissions. \"Administrative rights\" could work because it relates to onboarding and approvals, while \"HR Support\" might fit due to mentions of interns and employment status. But since it\u2019s primarily an IT context, \"Access\" stands out as the best choice. I\u2019ll return the response in the required format, presenting it simply as a JSON-like object with the category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
