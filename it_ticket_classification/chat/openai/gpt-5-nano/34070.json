The content seems to involve a software issue but the available options are limited. The closest fit appears to be \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Internal Project.\" There's no specific \"Software\" category, and since it talks about data constraints, it might align with \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" too. I\u2019ll choose the most fitting category!**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe user's message suggests there might be an issue with a calendar or card creation tool, especially since it mentions creating cards only between specific dates. It's tough to pinpoint the issue's nature since the category options don't include something specific like \"Software.\" Given that, my best guess is to classify it as \"Miscellaneous\" or potentially \"Internal Project.\" I'll format my response in JSON, choosing \"Miscellaneous\" for a safe classification and providing a brief justification for this choice.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nI see that the content includes error messages, so it isn't about hardware, HR, access, storage, or purchase. It could relate to \"Administrative rights\" due to the context of deleting entries and creating cards; however, it seems more focused on data validation. Therefore, I\u2019m settling on \"Miscellaneous\" as the category. \n\nI'll ensure the formatting is correct and provide the JSON object as required: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} \n\nIf needed, I can also include a brief note about the choice!"
