They mentioned assigning phones to employees and included terms like \"friday pm\" and \"allocated.\" It seems to be about phone assignments and could relate to \"Hardware\" since phones are involved. However, it might fall under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" depending on the context. Typically, this situation connects to hardware asset management, suggesting \"Hardware\" is the best fit, unless it's a new phone purchase request.**Assigning phone categories**\n\nI need to categorize a ticket about assigning existing phones to employees, and it sounds like policies may apply with \"conditions how allocated.\" While it could fit \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" the best option is \"Hardware\" since it specifically involves phones as devices. The user wants it in a JSON format, so I\u2019ll structure my response as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I just need to confirm that I'm providing the JSON object correctly, focusing on the \"category\" field.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
