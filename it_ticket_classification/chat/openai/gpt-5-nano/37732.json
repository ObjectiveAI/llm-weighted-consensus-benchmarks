Given the focus on time reporting and the connection to human resources, it seems appropriate to categorize this ticket under \"HR Support.\" The context about task details and error messages indicates it's likely related to an HR function. This categorization should help address the issue effectively!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m weighing options for categorizing an IT ticket related to a software issue in Oracle time reporting. The text mentions key elements like \"time reporting issue,\" \"hours entered,\" and \"minimum hours,\" which strongly ties it to human resources; therefore, \"HR Support\" seems to be the best fit. While \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous\" are possibilities, they feel less specific. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and prepare to output this in JSON format!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
