They mentioned that it's affecting remote machines and testing, which definitely indicates a problem. I need to choose from the categories provided: \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It could be \"Access\" if it's specifically about remote session access, but it seems more related to network performance. Maybe \"Miscellaneous\" works, but \"Hardware\" could also apply if it relates to networking equipment. I\u2019ll need to finalize a category.**Selecting IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the best category to classify this IT ticket since it doesn't have a clear option for Networking or IT Infrastructure. The user is experiencing remote connectivity issues, with phrases like \u201cset up remote session\u201d indicating a problem with access. The closest category seems to be \"Access,\" even if it's more about connectivity than rights. \"Miscellaneous\" could work too, but since they can\u2019t access remote machines reliably, I\u2019ll go with \"Access.\" It's the most fitting choice!**Formatting response as JSON**\n\nI\u2019ve decided on the category \u201cAccess\u201d for the IT ticket. Now, I need to return this in the proper JSON format, as instructed. The format requires a structured object containing the category field. I\u2019ll create the JSON object like this: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. I want to make sure not to add any extra explanations\u2014just the straight JSON response. It\u2019s time to deliver that succinctly!"
