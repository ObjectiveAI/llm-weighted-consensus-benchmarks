The ticket talks about unblocking a port on a secured network to run scripts remotely, which relates to performance and stress testing. I'm leaning towards either Access or Administrative rights for this. It seems like Access fits best.**Categorizing IT Access Issues**\n\nThe ticket is about unblocking a port to run scripts remotely on a secured network. I consider whether to categorize it under \"Access\" for network access or \"Administrative rights\" for requiring privileged access. However, since the user emphasizes unblocking the port as a networking access issue, it seems clear that \"Access\" is the right choice. I\u2019ll format the response as a simple JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's proceed with that!"
