It discusses annual leave approvals, holiday requests, and other HR-related management software issues. The relevant terms include \"review annual leave,\" \"approve holidays,\" and \"accept decline option.\" Since the content centers around HR support, the best-fitting category is \"HR Support.\" Even though the specific term \"HR\" isn't listed, \"HR Support\" is one of the options. So, I will respond with the JSON category: HR Support.**Formatting IT Ticket Response**\n\nThe prompt asks me to categorize an IT ticket and return the response in JSON format, specifically needing the \"category\" property. The required output should be {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I should ensure that \"HR Support\" is properly capitalized to match the enumerated options exactly. Even though I might want to provide some rationale, the instruction says to respond with the JSON only. So, I'll stick to just that and return nothing else."
