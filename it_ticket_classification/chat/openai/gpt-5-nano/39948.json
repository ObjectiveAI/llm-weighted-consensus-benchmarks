The user mentions that the customized dashboard does display graphs when running reports, which seem to work fine. However, since there\u2019s no explicit category for \"Software\" or \"IT Tools,\" I\u2019m considering \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. It appears the available categories are somewhat limited for this issue.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket and decide between \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The user\u2019s note focuses on graphs being missing, with no mention of access rights. It seems best to categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" since this issue falls under general IT tools. Based on the required format, I\u2019ll provide a JSON response containing that category. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ll respond: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Confirming the category**\n\nI'm set to deliver the response as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I did double-check the text mentioning \"snow,\" which likely refers to the \"Snow dashboard\" or possibly \"Snowflake,\" a brand. However, this detail doesn\u2019t affect the categorization itself. The important part is sticking to the main category identified as \"Miscellaneous.\" So, I\u2019ll proceed with the JSON output as planned."
