I think the best fit is \"HR Support\" since it's related to submission errors. Alternatively, if it's unclear, I could consider \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\nSince the user asked to categorize the ticket, I need to respond with a JSON object that includes the category field. I\u2019ll format it correctly. The final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}**Delivering Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the user\u2019s request to categorize, and while I could ask clarifying questions, it seems the best approach is to focus on delivering the category directly. Let's proceed by providing the classification without additional inquiries, as the main objective here is to fulfill the request efficiently. I'll finalize the response now!"
