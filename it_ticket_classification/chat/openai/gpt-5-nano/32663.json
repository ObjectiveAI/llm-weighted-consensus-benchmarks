The ticket involves reviewing an annual leave request and is HR-related, so \u201cHR Support\u201d seems to fit best according to the provided categories. The user has requested a review of the annual leave approval workflow and balance, reinforcing that it falls under HR rather than IT. So, I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}, making sure not to include any extra text.**Responding with JSON**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to respond with only a JSON object that contains the \"category\" field. I recognize that the appropriate category for this situation is \"HR Support,\u201d and I'll present it simply as requested. So my final response will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It's straightforward, and I want to make sure to stick to the requirements without any extra text or information."
