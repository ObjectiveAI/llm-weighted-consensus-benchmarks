It sounds like they want to add wireless access. Given this context, \u201cAccess\u201d seems to fit best since it directly relates to connectivity and requesting permission.**Clarifying IT Ticket Category**\n\nOkay, let's break this down further. \n\nHardware, Internal Project, Storage, Purchase, and HR Support don\u2019t seem to apply. Miscellaneous could fit, but Access feels like the best category. The user appears to be asking for network and wireless access, specifically wanting to add a device to the allowed list. They mention difficulties connecting during meetings, which affects productivity. I think categorizing this as \"Access,\" with a sub-issue of \"Wireless network access request / add device to allowed list,\" makes the most sense.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
