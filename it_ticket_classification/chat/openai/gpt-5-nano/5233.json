The request touches on access permissions, restoring versions, and involves signatures modified by various users. I think the best fit for this ticket would be either \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or possibly \"Storage,\" as it primarily concerns access to a folder and the associated rights. So, I'll lean towards \"Access\" as it directly addresses the issue.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nThe categories \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" are both relevant here. The user\u2019s request involves restricting access to a folder, changing rights, restoring versions, and mentions deleted files\u2014suggesting lost data. It seems the best option is \"Access\" since it addresses permissions for accessing a folder. Though \"Administrative rights\" points to admin-level issues, with the details provided, \"Access\" feels more appropriate. I\u2019ll prepare the JSON format: {\"category\": \"Access\"} for the ticket.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
