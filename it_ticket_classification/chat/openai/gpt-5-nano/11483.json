I'm thinking \"Purchase\" fits best since it's about costs and procurement options. \"Miscellaneous\" also comes to mind, but we have a dedicated category for items that don\u2019t fit elsewhere. \n\nSo, the JSON object should look like this to meet the system's requirements: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I won't add any extra explanation since it's a straightforward request!**Selecting category in JSON**\n\nI\u2019m going with \"Purchase\" for the category. I need to present this in a clean JSON format without any unnecessary text. So, I'll format it like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It's straightforward and meets the requirements perfectly, keeping it simple and clear!"
