Given the context, it feels like it could fall under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" since it's about issues with the approval system. However, since per diem is a travel expense, it might also fit into \"Purchase\" or possibly \"HR Support.\" I need to choose the category that best matches.**Selecting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at an IT ticket where the user is struggling with approvals in the system. The most fitting category seems to be \"Access,\" since it relates to permissions and the inability to approve something. \"Administrative rights\" is another option, but it doesn't quite capture the issue of pending approvals. I\u2019ll go ahead and format my response as a JSON object, specifying \"Access\" as the category, along with a nice justification.**Deciding on Access Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the IT ticket that mentions \"unable to approve\" and the visibility of pending approvals. Given these details, \"Access\" seems to fit best since it pertains to system permissions necessary for approvals. While \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, it\u2019s a subset of Access, so choosing the broader category seems right. I\u2019ll present my final answer as a simple JSON object without additional commentary, like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
