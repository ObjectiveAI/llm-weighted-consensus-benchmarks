It seems to fit into the \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" categories since changing an approver might involve altering access rights. I\u2019m also considering \"HR Support,\" which seems relevant here. I\u2019ll need to ensure \u201cHR Support\u201d is indeed part of the provided list before making a final decision.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019ve confirmed that \"HR Support\" is an option. The user is asking about an \"approver change\" for annual leave, which definitely seems like an HR process. It could be categorized under \"Access,\" as it involves changing approval permissions in a system. The request includes multiple mentions of changing approvers and a phrase about \"work bench moment,\" suggesting it may be related to a tool. However, I believe \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" fits best since it\u2019s a permission change.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIn the context of IT ticket taxonomy, changing who can approve requests falls under access rights or admin rights. Given that \"approver\" is a role in a system, I\u2019d lean towards categorizing this as \"Access\" since it directly involves permissions. While \"Administrative rights\" also exists as a category, changing an approver mainly pertains to granting someone the rights within an HR system, so \"Access\" feels like the safer pick. I need to output the category in the required JSON-like format.**Finalizing Category Response**\n\nI need to respond with the correct category value wrapped in JSON. Since this is about changing the approver for annual leave requests, I\u2019d categorize it as \"Access\" because it involves user permissions changes. So I'll go with \"Access.\" I\u2019ll return the response as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThat should be it\u2014no extra content needed!"
