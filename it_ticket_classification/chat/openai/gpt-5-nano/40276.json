The categories I can choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the context of the request, it seems like this ticket is related to Hardware or possibly Internal Project, but I'm not entirely sure.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"windows slave issues\" and references builds, server OS, and a restart. It seems \"slave\" relates to build slaves, which are typically part of a software process rather than user hardware. Given the choices available, it might best fit in the \"Hardware\" category since it involves server issues. I'll need to structure my response as a JSON object following the specified schema for categorizing this IT Ticket.**Outputting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to create a JSON object with a \"category\" property, using one of the specified string values. While I initially thought \"Hardware\" might fit best, given the server-related context, \"Internal Project\" could also be relevant due to the mention of a senior engineer and internal processes. However, since this ticket primarily addresses server issues rather than a distinct hardware failure, I believe \"Hardware\" is still the most appropriate choice. If I'm unsure, \"Miscellaneous\" could work as a fallback.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
