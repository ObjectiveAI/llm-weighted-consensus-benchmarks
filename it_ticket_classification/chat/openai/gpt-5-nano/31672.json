It appears to detail a request about new hardware allocation for starters in Belgrade, scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. The mention of \"joiners\" and \"accounts created\" indicates concerns around new staff assignments and equipment distribution, along with a problem involving colleagues winning equipment. Given this context, it seems to fit best under the category of Hardware, focusing on the allocation for new employees.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI see that the grammar is a bit mixed in the ticket. It primarily relates to hardware allocation for new starters, and I believe the best category is Hardware. While there\u2019s mention of account creation that could fit under Access, the main focus seems to be on hardware. Since the user wants me to categorize this IT ticket, I'll go with \"Hardware\" as the category and prepare a summary. I\u2019ll also format the output as JSON.**Responding with JSON**\n\nI'm prepared to provide the response in JSON format. The main category I\u2019ve identified is \"Hardware,\" which fits the ticket\u2019s focus on hardware allocation. While I could consider factors like account creation and possibly categorize it as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" the primary concern remains hardware. So, I\u2019ll stick with my decision. I\u2019ll keep the response simple and direct, ensuring there\u2019s no extra text. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
