The ticket mentions a broken laptop screen and a request for a replacement. It seems best to put it under \"Hardware\" since it's about a hardware issue. Although \"Purchase\" might fit too, since it's related to acquiring a replacement, \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate category. I'll confirm this in the required format.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nI need to output a JSON object with just the category field based on the prompt \"Categorize this IT Ticket:\". It seems the category is clearly \"Hardware\" since the ticket mentions \"replacement needed\" and \"laptop screen broken.\" It could be \"Purchase,\" but the core issue is hardware failure. So, the correct response is {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll make sure it's formatted correctly as a JSON object and has no extra text\u2014just the category! Let's go with that!"
