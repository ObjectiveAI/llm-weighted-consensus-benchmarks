The keywords like \"computer needed,\" \"workstation,\" and \"physical port\" suggest it's related to hardware. Since the user may be requesting a workstation, it could also fit in the \"Purchase\" category. However, since it's primarily about hardware, \"Hardware\" seems to be the best fit, as \"Purchase\" focuses more on procurement. I'll go with \"Hardware.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe phrases \"computer needed\" and \"provide workstation\" indicate a request for equipment, specifically regarding the \"workstation physical port needed.\" This suggests they may require specific types of ports, pointing to hardware. In IT ticket categorization, these requests typically fall under \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" Since the user is requesting a workstation, it leans toward \"Purchase,\" but it's mainly about the physical device, so I\u2019ll ultimately categorize it as \"Hardware.\" Now, I can prepare my final response in JSON format.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nThe system's category schema indicates that I need to output a JSON object with a specific category value. The accepted categories include \"Hardware,\" among others. For this task, I'll select \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate choice. So, my final JSON response will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI won't add any extra text \u2014 just the JSON output as per the prompt, which asks me to categorize this IT ticket."
