The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nGiven the context, it seems to relate to scheduling problems and inviting employees, which might fit under Miscellaneous or Access. However, none of the categories directly mention software or calendar-related issues, so it'll likely end up being categorized as Miscellaneous.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize the ticket about calendar scheduling issues. It might fit under \"Access\" if it\u2019s about permissions for inviting attendees, but that isn't clear. \"Administrative rights\" relates to admin permissions but doesn\u2019t quite match either. \n\n\"Internal Project\" doesn't seem applicable, and \"Miscellaneous\" feels too generic. Since the user is having trouble with calendar invites and scheduling, it makes sense to lean towards \"Access\" for potential access rights issues related to invitations or scheduling conflicts.**Categorizing ticket response**\n\nIt seems the issue is about calendar invites, likely related to permission or email problems. Since it's a bit ambiguous, I'll go with \"Miscellaneous\" as a safe choice. \n\nNow, I need to create a response in JSON format according to the specified schema. I'll make sure to follow the instructions properly and just include the category field. \n\nSo the output will simply be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
