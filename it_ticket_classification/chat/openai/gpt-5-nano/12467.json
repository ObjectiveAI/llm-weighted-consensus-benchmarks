It seems like the user wants to unsubscribe or remove themselves from these notifications. The context involves supplier contracts, but interestingly, the categories available don\u2019t include \u201cProcurement\u201d specifically. However, I think the \u201cPurchase\u201d category fits best since it relates to procurement matters. Even though there are hints of it being an internal project, the focus is more on the administrative aspect of managing notifications.**Parsing Category Output**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I've got to provide a JSON-like category. The required output format specifies a category object that should include \"category\" as a string from an enumerated list. Based on the context, I think I should categorize this as \"Purchase.\" \n\nI see that I need to follow a specific schema, which defines \"category\" as an object with properties. While it's a bit unusual, I\u2019ll just output the category as a JSON string. So, it\u2019ll look like: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
