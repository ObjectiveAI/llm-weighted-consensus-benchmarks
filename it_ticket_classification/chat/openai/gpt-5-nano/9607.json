It talks about changing a mobile phone and mentions a cooling pad, which seems to lean towards the \"Hardware\" category. However, there's also mention of annual leave and potentially \"Administrative rights.\" So, I need to balance the hardware aspect with whether it relates to HR or internal processes. It's a bit tricky since it seems to cover multiple categories!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on the provided string. The mention of \"changing the mobile phone\" suggests it's related to Hardware or possibly a Purchase request for a new phone. Though there's also a reference to \"annual leave,\" it seems most relevant to designate this as \"Hardware,\" given the focus on mobile devices and a cooling pad. \n\nI\u2019ll respond with a JSON object, strictly following the required format. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Keeping it simple and direct!"
