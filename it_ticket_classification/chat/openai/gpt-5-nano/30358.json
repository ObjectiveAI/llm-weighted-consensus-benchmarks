Since it\u2019s about installation help, it could fit as a \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access\" issue, and may even relate to \"Administrative rights\" if they need those to proceed with the installation.**Analyzing ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a ticket that mentions \"issues on installing\" software, particularly \"Studio,\" on a PC. The request is vague, but it seems they\u2019re seeking help after attempting to solve the problem themselves. Given the categories like Hardware, HR Support, and Access, it could fall under \"Administrative rights\" if they need permission to install the software. Since installation issues usually relate to permissions, categorizing it as \"Administrative rights\" makes sense for escalation.**Categorizing installation request**\n\nThe user is asking for help with installing software on his PC, which indicates it's a request for assistance. It could fit into several categories, but the safest classification seems to be \"Administrative rights\" since the installation requires those rights. I need to respond with a JSON object that specifies this category according to the system's schema. I'll format it as {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"} to ensure clarity and proper categorization in the system.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
