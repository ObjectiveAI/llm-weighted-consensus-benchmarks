However, \"Administrative rights\" could also work because reinstatement of roles is key. Given the user\u2019s comment about roles being changed or reinstated, it strongly indicates that access rights are at play. So, I'll go with \"Access\" as the main category and consider \"Administrative rights\" could be a subcategory if needed. I'll output a JSON object with \"category\": \"Access\".{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
