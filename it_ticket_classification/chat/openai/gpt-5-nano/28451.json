If things are unclear, Miscellaneous could work. Overall, Purchase seems the most fitting category for a license request.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the IT ticket that seems a bit unclear. It mentions \"MS Project license\" and \"download plans.\" The \"download plans\" might relate to Internal Project since it sounds like it\u2019s about project planning.\n\nHowever, the best fit for \"ms project license\" seems to be Purchase since they\u2019re likely requesting license procurement. I also consider Access, but there\u2019s no direct access issue. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as Purchase and prepare to output the JSON with this category properly structured.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
