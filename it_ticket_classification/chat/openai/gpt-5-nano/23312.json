The mention of \"pm importance high\" suggests it\u2019s a high priority. I think the best fit here is \"Access.\"**Determining the category for access request**\n\nThe request for \"access to all staff list\" clearly indicates a need for permission, suggesting it's an access request and potentially relates to admin rights. If I had to pick one category, \"Access\" feels like the right choice. I need to respond in the required JSON format, outputting just the category. So, I'll provide:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nHowever, I wonder if \"Administrative rights\" might be more fitting since accessing the staff list could indeed require those rights. But I'll stick with \"Access\" for now, aligning with the core request.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
