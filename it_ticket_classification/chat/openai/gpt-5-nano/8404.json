It talks about a \"new starter\" in Belgrade and seems related to employee onboarding. The allowed categories are \"HR Support\" and \"Access,\" among others. This ticket likely requests account creation or access for the new employee, given the references to their arrival. I\u2019m leaning towards classifying it under \"HR Support\" or \"Access\u201d since it involves provisioning for a new hire.**Categorizing IT ticket for new starter**\n\nI\u2019m examining the ticket content about a \"new starter\" in Belgrade, likely requesting setup for a new employee. It mentions \"arrival information\" and \"creating his access,\" which suggests it\u2019s about onboarding. The categories available include \"Access\" and \"HR Support.\" Since the request involves providing access for the new starter, I\u2019m leaning towards classifying it as \"Access.\" This seems the most fitting given the context of the request.**Categorizing IT ticket as Access**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how onboarding typically relates to either \"Access\" for account provisioning or \"HR Support\" for HR processes, but this ticket falls into an IT context. The mention of \"Administrative rights\" refers to elevated permissions, which complicates things a bit. However, since the content primarily points toward account access without mentioning hardware or storage, \"Access\" is the best category. I\u2019ll format my final output in the required JSON format, indicating the category.**Outputting category as JSON**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on the instruction that specifies I need to format the output as a JSON object with the category. The correct entry seems to be \"Access,\" but I\u2019m considering if \"HR Support\" might also fit since it concerns a new starter. However, the content primarily points toward account access. So, I\u2019ll stick with \"Access\" for the category. The final output will just be JSON format without any extra text: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
