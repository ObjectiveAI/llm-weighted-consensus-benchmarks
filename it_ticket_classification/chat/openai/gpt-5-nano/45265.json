The user mentions being approved but indicates that it wasn't working correctly. I\u2019m considering the most appropriate category among the available options, and it seems like it could relate to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it involves waiting for approval and access permissions. Both categories seem relevant here, but \"Access\" might fit best.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user wants to categorize the ticket rather than solve it. I believe the best match for this ticket is \"Access,\" especially since it mentions \"closed after approval\" and \"waiting for approval,\" indicating a general access request. While \"Administrative rights\" could also fit, it doesn't seem to be the right context here. I\u2019ll respond with the required format, providing a clean JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This keeps it straightforward without any extra wording."
