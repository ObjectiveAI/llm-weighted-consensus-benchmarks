The user's message indicates issues with cluster disruptions, errors, and log events. Since this content suggests an IT infrastructure issue, I'm thinking it might fit under either Storage or Internal Project. The key terms like \"file share\" and \"debug\" lean more toward Storage, but there's also a chance it could fall under Internal Project given the broader context. I need to decide carefully!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket related to cluster disruptions and file shares. It seems like a storage issue since Storage covers everything from NAS to SAN and file shares. However, it could also be linked to an \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s about a specific cluster. The ticket mentions critical terms like \"errors,\" \"log events,\" and \"nodes,\" leading me to think \"Storage\" is the best fit since the available categories don\u2019t include \"Cluster\" or \"Networking.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user asked to open a ticket for cluster disruptions, which hints at an IT infrastructure issue. It might be related to an ongoing internal project, but that\u2019s uncertain. Since the ticket mentions \"file share witness disappear\" and \"cluster disruptions,\" it clearly indicates a storage-related problem. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Storage\" and respond with the required JSON object format. So the final output will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. Keeping it minimal, just as instructed!"
