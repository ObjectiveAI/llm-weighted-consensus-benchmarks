It mentions a full mailbox related to someone on maternity leave and undeliverable messages. The user seems to need help with this problem. Based on the provided categories, it sounds like it fits best under \"Storage\" due to the mailbox volume issue. While it references HR aspects like maternity leave, this is ultimately an IT concern focused on storage and delivery problems.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user needs help categorizing a ticket regarding an \"undeliverable message,\" likely due to a full mailbox. I think it fits best under \"Storage,\" but I wonder if \"Access\" might also apply if they can't access their mailbox. However, since the focus is on capacity, \"Storage\" feels right. I should respond using the required JSON format, outputting `{\"category\":\"Storage\"}`. I\u2019m considering if any other category fits, but this seems appropriate for now.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
