I think \"Hardware\" is the right category since they are looking to address a PC installation issue.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm considering whether to categorize the IT ticket as \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" There's a mention of \"package order,\" which could indicate a purchase. However, the ticket also discusses access permission issues, specifically about viewing a directory, suggesting it's more related to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The frequent mention of \"permission\" points towards \"Access\" being the most relevant category. Although \"install his PC\" hints at hardware, the main issue seems to be access permissions, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\"**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON-like object that specifies the category. The instruction clearly indicates I should format it as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Although I could explain my rationale for choosing \"Access\" over \"Administrative rights,\" the user specifically asked for a categorization without an explanation. I should ensure I'm precise with capitalization for the allowed values: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" So I\u2019ll return just the JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
