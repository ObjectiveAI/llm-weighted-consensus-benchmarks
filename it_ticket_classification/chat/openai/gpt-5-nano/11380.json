Given that it's about permissions, it could fit under \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d There's a distinction between these two categories in the list. Since the focus is on ownership change, I think \"Administrative rights\" might be the better fit here.**Responding with JSON**\n\nThe content indicates a desire to change the owner of a bid squad, which relates to access rights and ownership. This makes \"Administrative rights\" the appropriate category. I need to respond with a JSON object following the required format. The schema specifies that I should include just the category field. So, I\u2019ll output `{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}` as per the instructions, without any extra text. I'll make sure to get it right!"
