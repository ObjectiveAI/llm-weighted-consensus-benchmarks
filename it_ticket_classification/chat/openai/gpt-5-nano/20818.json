The user mentions their mailbox being nearly full, increasing size, and housekeeping. This suggests it relates to storage capacity. \n\nConsidering the categories available, it likely falls under \"Storage\" since it's primarily about mailbox space management. I also see options for \"Administrative rights,\" but here, the emphasis is on mailbox storage rather than permissions. So, \u201cStorage\u201d seems like the best fit!**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on the user's needs. They might need to request a quota increase or archive old emails, which tells me this should fall under \"Storage.\" \n\nThe JSON object format specified indicates I should provide just that. So, I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. While a short note could be helpful, the instructions say the output should strictly be in JSON. Let's keep it simple and stick with just that!"
