It seems to relate to an onboarding process, mentioning a \"starter form,\" \"joining NJ,\" and issues regarding \"licenses.\" The request includes installation details, access provisioning, and guidance needed from the administrative officer. Given these points, it seems most appropriate to categorize this under \"Access,\" as it's likely about granting access for a new starter.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm working to categorize this IT ticket based on its content. It mentions issues related to accounts and access, such as \"accounts log enter screen\" and \"licenses were assigned,\" which suggest it's about user access provisioning. The \"starter form\" hints at onboarding but isn't strictly HR-related. I think the most fitting category is \"Access.\" \n\nNow, I\u2019ll finalize it and respond in a simple, JSON-like format, just specifying the category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
