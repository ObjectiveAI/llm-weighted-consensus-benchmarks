It's a bit garbled but mentions leaving today and Friday PM, and something about closing resources. This hints at possibly \"de-provisioning\" or termination. The part about \"closing resources\" suggests it might relate to disabling access, so I think the \"Access\" category fits best. Since the query involves user access rights, I'm leaning toward categorizing it under \"Access.\"**Categorizing IT ticket clearly**\n\nThe ticket seems to request closing resources, which might indicate a de-provisioning of user accounts, so categorizing it as \"Access\" makes sense. While \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant, the content doesn't specifically mention admin privileges\u2014it's mainly about closing resources for someone who is leaving. Therefore, \"Access\" appears to be the most appropriate category. I will respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, ensuring no extra text."
