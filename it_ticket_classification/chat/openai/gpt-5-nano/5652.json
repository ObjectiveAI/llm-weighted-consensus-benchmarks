However, it doesn\u2019t seem to fit into categories like hardware, storage, purchase, or internal project. It's tough, but I'll lean towards \"Miscellaneous.\"**Classifying Outlook rules**\n\nOutlook rules are about software configuration, so I need to consider labeling this ticket as either \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights.\" There\u2019s no clear mention of admin rights, but the phrase \"assign colleague\" implies they might want to delegate something. However, there isn\u2019t a specific category for \"Assignment.\" Since configuring Outlook rules doesn\u2019t need access rights, \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d seems like the best fit, as this category often covers general IT requests that don\u2019t align with the other options.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the ticket as \"Miscellaneous\" since it\u2019s about Outlook rules and doesn\u2019t explicitly require administrative rights. Now, I need to output this in a specific JSON format that includes the category as a property. According to the guidelines, my final output should be clean and simple, just the JSON object without any extra text. So, it will look like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I\u2019ll make sure not to add any additional commentary."
