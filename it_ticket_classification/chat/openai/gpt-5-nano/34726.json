It mentions required equipment for Denmark offices, including a TV screen and desktop conference call device. These fall under hardware procurement since the ticket is all about sourcing these items.

I'll prepare output in JSON format, ensuring everything aligns with the allowed categories, confirming that \"Hardware\" is the right choice here.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket regarding equipment acquisition. It could fit under \"Hardware,\" but since the request emphasizes procurement and approvals, \"Purchase\" seems to be the more suitable choice. The request is clearly about acquiring equipment, so \"Purchase\" aligns with that focus. I'll create the output in the required JSON format. This will include the category as \"Purchase,\" which is fitting for this ticket.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
