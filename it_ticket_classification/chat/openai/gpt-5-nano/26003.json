It mentions \"create installation\" and \"receipt by screen capture,\" which makes me think it could relate to a few categories. \"PO\" likely refers to a purchase order, so \"Purchase\" seems like a reasonable choice. However, since it includes \"installation,\" it could also be software-related, fitting into \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019m weighing options carefully here!**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"please create installation,\" which hints at an installation plan. \"Receipt by screen capture\" probably means capturing a receipt on the screen, possibly for proof of installation. There's also the mention of contacting an \"administrator\" on the phone, which adds a layer to the request.\n\nConsidering \"purchase order,\" I lean towards categorizing it as \"Purchase,\" especially since \"PO\" appears twice, emphasizing its relevance. However, \"Internal Project\" could still be possible if it pertains to a project. Overall, \"Purchase\" feels like the best choice here!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
