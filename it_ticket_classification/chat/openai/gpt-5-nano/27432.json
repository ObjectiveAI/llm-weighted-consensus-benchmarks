The text is a bit muddled, but it seems to be about connecting devices to a switch on the floor and involves some troubleshooting and request for user access. Since it's mainly focused on connecting devices, I think \"Access\" or \"Hardware\" might be the best fit for this ticket type. I'll go with that!**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket seems to focus on hardware networking issues like connecting devices to a switch and managing ports on a floor. I\u2019m considering whether to categorize it as \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it mainly involves hardware networking, \"Hardware\" sounds like the best fit. I briefly think about \"Access\" due to mentions of user privileges, but the main task is about connecting devices. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware\" and consider responding with a JSON object!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
