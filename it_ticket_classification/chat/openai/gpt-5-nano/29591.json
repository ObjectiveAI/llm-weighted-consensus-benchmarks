The user has provided a blob of text related to migration and transferring old Confluence files, with significant deadlines involved. Given the focus on file transfer and deadlines, it likely fits best under \"Storage\". I'll go with that category, as it seems the most appropriate!**Categorizing IT ticket details**\n\nAlright, the ticket involves migration, uploading files to a new Confluence site, and a deadline for the file transfer. It mentions closing down the old site, which hints at either \"Storage\", \"Administrative Rights\", or \"Internal Project.\" There's a bit about access, but since it's primarily about file storage and transitions, I'd say \"Storage\" is the best fit. It just feels like the most relevant category for all these details!**Evaluating IT ticket categories**\n\nThe ticket discusses launching a new site and uploading files before closing the old one. It seems to fit in the \"Storage\" category, but there\u2019s also a possibility for \"Internal Project\" since it's about migrating to a new site. While \"Administrative Rights\" might apply if permissions are needed, they don\u2019t explicitly request access. They mainly ask for help with the file upload location, which leans more toward a task request for uploading files. I\u2019ll lean toward \"Storage\" for this categorization!**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nThere's no explicit request for rights, so it seems to fit into the \"Storage\" category, focusing on moving and archiving files. The ticket discusses the deadline for transferring old files, indicating it's about storage and migration. Since the user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, I\u2019ll create a response in a proper JSON format with the category value. Given the content, I believe \"Storage\" is the best choice. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}!**Outputting JSON format**\n\nThe instructions specify that I need to respond with a JSON object that matches the given schema. The category we're focusing on is clearly \"Storage\". So, the response will simply be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I need to ensure there are no extra texts or details, just the JSON output. Alright, let's deliver that!"
