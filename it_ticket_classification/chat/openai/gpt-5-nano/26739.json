The text is a bit messy, discussing change rejection notifications, rejections by leaders, and some technical jargon about configurations.\n\nBased on the details, it seems to relate to change management. I'm thinking it might fit best under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" but \"Miscellaneous\" could also apply if it doesn't fit neatly. It's a bit tricky!**Determining the right category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket seems focused on change rejection notifications related to network infrastructure. It talks about updating configuration switches and mentions priorities and approvals.\n\nWhile it could potentially fit \"Internal Project\" because it involves project changes, \"Administrative rights\" might not be the best fit. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too generic, but the ticket leans more toward process-related issues than hardware. So, I'm inclined toward \"Internal Project.\"**Finalizing category selection**\n\nIt looks like I should choose \"Internal Project\" because the content of the ticket doesn't reference access permissions or admin rights. So, I'll prepare the final answer as a JSON object with the category set to \"Internal Project.\" \n\nI just need to provide the JSON format without any extra explanation. The correct response would be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI want to make sure everything is formatted properly and accurate."
