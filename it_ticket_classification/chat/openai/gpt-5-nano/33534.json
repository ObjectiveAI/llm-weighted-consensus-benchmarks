They mention needing cables, connecting, and a senior engineer. While \"Purchase\" could fit since they need to procure these items, I think \"Hardware\" might be the best choice due to the clear reference to cables and monitors.**Deciding on ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m thinking through the ticket that seems to request cables. The phrase \"need cables\" suggests it's about procurement, so \"Purchase\" comes to mind. However, it also mentions \"monitor,\" indicating hardware. While \"Purchase\" could fit, the primary focus seems to be on hardware components. In IT ticket triage, requests for cables typically fall under \"Hardware.\" Based on the context, I think the best category is \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll provide this in a JSON format string.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m determining how to respond with the category for the IT ticket. Since the prompt is clear about categorization, I should output in the required format: a JSON object with \"category\": \"Hardware\". The prompt also mentions that it may need to be parsed by code, so clarity is key. While I briefly questioned if \"Miscellaneous\" could be a better fit, I think \"Hardware\" is best since it focuses on cables. So I\u2019ll go ahead and produce: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
