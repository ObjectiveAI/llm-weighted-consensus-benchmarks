Given the concerns around mailbox storage and user access, the most suitable categories could be \"Storage\" for mailbox quotas or \"Access\" for user permissions. \"Miscellaneous\" could also apply, but those seem the best fits.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe content indicates that there's a password expiry, but the primary issue is the mailbox being full. \"Access\" could be appropriate since it pertains to mailbox access, but the focus is more on email delivery, making \"Miscellaneous\" another option. Ultimately, \"Storage\" seems to be the best category since it's directly related to the mailbox storage quota. I\u2019ll output a JSON object to reflect this decision, formatted correctly for clarity. My response will be: {\"category\": \"Storage\"}.**Outputting category**\n\nThe prompt tells me to categorize the IT ticket, and I realize I should only provide the category in the required format. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}\n\nThat's clear and straightforward! I'm making sure to follow the instruction precisely."
