The ticket mentions several terms including \"servers request,\" \"setup parameters,\" \"hardware details,\" and \"cost setup.\" It definitely touches on elements related to hardware and storage, but it also involves procurement with the mention of cost. The available categories include \"Purchase\" and \"Hardware,\" both of which could fit. I'll lean towards categorizing it under \"Hardware\" due to the focus on hardware details while considering \"Purchase\" as well.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket is requesting server provisioning with specs like cores and storage, along with associated costs. It mentions roles like \"developer\" and \"tester,\" and possibly a \"developer edition\" referring to software. I need to categorize this request appropriately, and while \"Purchase\" fits due to the procurement aspects, it also contains hardware details. Since the focus is on cost and setup, it makes sense to categorize it as \"Purchase.\" So, the response should be a concise JSON object: `{\"category\": \"Purchase\"}`.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
