Now, I'll format my response in JSON to match the required structure: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket that states it's urgent for a laptop charger. It's clearly a hardware-related issue since it's about providing a charger and not purchasing one. Normally, issues like this would be categorized under \"Hardware.\" \n\nThe JSON output should be structured as follows: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.
