The categories I can use include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The text mentions expense reports, approvals, and requests, which could fit under \"Purchase\" since they deal with expenses and financial processes. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object stating the category accordingly. I'm leaning towards \"Purchase\" for this ticket.**Confirming IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ve ruled out categories like \"Access,\" \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and others. The best fit is clearly \"Purchase,\" since the text includes \"expense reports,\" \"purchase requests,\" and \"requisitions,\" all tying back to purchasing. I need to format this as a JSON object, specifically: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. The instructions only call for the category field, so I won\u2019t add anything extra. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and ensure the JSON format is valid."
