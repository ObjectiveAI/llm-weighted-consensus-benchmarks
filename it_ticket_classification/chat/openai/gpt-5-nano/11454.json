After reading the ticket, it seems messy but indicates that it\u2019s mainly about configuring a project management board for a repository. The focus is on adding columns, reviewing progress, and addressing issues, which likely relates to an internal project. It might also touch on access, but configuring the board seems to be the primary concern.**Classifying the ticket**\n\nThe ticket doesn't clearly fit into categories like hardware, HR support, or others, but \"Internal Project\" seems likely. \"Administrative rights\" might also apply if they need permissions to configure the board. However, since it\u2019s primarily about configuring the project and its columns, it aligns more with internal project tasks. I will categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" The output will be a JSON object with \"category\": \"Internal Project\" based on the required format, as that\u2019s what the system message specifies.**Formatting the IT ticket category**\n\nThe instruction is clear: it\u2019s about categorizing the IT ticket, and I need to return just the category. The format often involves giving a JSON object, like {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. The guidelines mention the schema, so I want to align with that. I\u2019ll follow the system's expectations for a proper response, ensuring my output is strictly in the format needed without any extra text. So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
