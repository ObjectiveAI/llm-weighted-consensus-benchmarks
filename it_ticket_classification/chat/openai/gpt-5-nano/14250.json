I have categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others to choose from. It might relate to \"Automation\" or \"Digital,\" possibly linking to an \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since there's no specific category for Automation, I\u2019ll need to rely on what fits best.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nWe've got categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administration rights,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" If the ticket is related to an automation or digital project, \"Internal Project\" might fit best. If it's unclear, then \"Miscellaneous\" could work. Maybe I should suggest these options and ask the user to confirm? Since the description involves \"automation\" and \"digital,\" I'll propose \"Internal Project\" as the primary choice while clarifying the \"polls suspended\" part, which could relate to permissions. It's a bit confusing!**Categorizing and clarifying IT ticket**\n\nThe text from the user appears to reference \"automation\" and \"digital,\" but it's still unclear. I could suggest categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" since it's vague. To comply with the user's request for a single category, I\u2019ll propose this option and ask if they prefer something different. I\u2019ll also mention that \"Automation\" isn\u2019t a selectable category. To keep it structured, I\u2019ll deliver my response in a JSON format that fits the expected schema for clarity.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
