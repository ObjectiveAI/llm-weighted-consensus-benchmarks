I'll finalize my category choice based on that.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm identifying that the IT ticket relates to directory services and administration. The categories available include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the ticket involves importing to Active Directory, I think \"Access\" is the best fit for managing user accounts and permissions. The mention of \"priority assigned\" suggests some planning is involved, but the focus remains on access management. I should respond with a JSON format, which will look like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Yes, that's my final output!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
