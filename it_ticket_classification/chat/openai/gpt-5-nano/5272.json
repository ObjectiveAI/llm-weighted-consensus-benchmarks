They mentioned various details that seem to revolve around a new purchase, specifically for an adaptor. Since it's requesting information about a purchase order, allocation of the item, and includes receipts, I think it fits best under the \"Purchase\" category among the options provided. The ticket includes specific requirements like mandatory receipts and a video link, which emphasize its purchase nature.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like this IT ticket relates to purchasing, logging allocation, and possibly procurement. The \"Purchase\" category seems to fit best among the options given, particularly with mentions of \"new purchase\" and \"log allocation after receive item.\" I\u2019ll need to format my response as a JSON object, specifically: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It\u2019s important to ensure I use the exact category string in the proper capitalization. I also need to keep my response concise without any extra text.**Providing category output**\n\nI see that I need to categorize the request and the output is expected in a JSON-like format. The category options are defined in the system, and since \"Purchase\" fits best, I\u2019ll respond with {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It's probably best to provide the full JSON object instead of just the word \"Purchase\" to follow the instructions accurately. So I\u2019ll stick with that format and keep it concise, without any additional commentary."
