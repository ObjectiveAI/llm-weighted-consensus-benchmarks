It looks like they're asking for something adjustable, with a cable, and more specific details are requested. Given the options provided, I think this clearly falls under hardware since they need a new monitor. However, it could also fit under \"Purchase.\" I'm leaning towards \"Purchase\" as they\u2019re specifically requesting a new monitor.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nFor this IT ticket, I'm leaning towards the category \"Hardware\" since it's clearly requesting a new monitor. The user mentioned \"new monitor needed,\" \"monitor adjustable,\" and \"cable,\" which all relate to hardware. While \"Purchase\" could also apply because it involves acquiring new equipment, I think \"Hardware\" is more fitting here as the primary need is for the monitor itself. I'll respond with the category in the required format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to return the right JSON object here. Typically, I would just output the category like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. However, the system mentions a specific format: it needs a JSON schema that looks like {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[...]}}}. \n\nGiven the instructions request to categorize the IT ticket, I should ensure I'm following the format correctly. It feels safer to output the minimal object while still meeting the schema requirements: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
