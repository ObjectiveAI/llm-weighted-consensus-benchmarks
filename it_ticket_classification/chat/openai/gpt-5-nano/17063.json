The ticket overall seems related to purchasing items and logging installations. Given that it mentions mandatory receipts, it's likely best suited for the \"Purchase\" category. Although \"Administrative rights\" could apply, there\u2019s insufficient detail for that. I'll proceed with categorizing it under \"Purchase\" and prepare to format it as a JSON object.**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to format my response as a JSON object that specifies the category of the IT ticket. The instruction is clear: I want to respond with something like {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It\u2019s essential to stick to the required format and only include necessary content, especially since there's a schema involved. So, I\u2019ll ensure the curly braces and quotes are correct and provide just the category without unnecessary explanations. \n\nHere\u2019s the response: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019m ready to deliver it!"
