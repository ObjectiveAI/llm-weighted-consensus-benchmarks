Given it mentions \"change,\" I\u2019m leaning toward \"Internal Project,\" but there's no specific \"change request\" category. \"Miscellaneous\" might also fit because it's unclear. I\u2019m considering asking, \"Could you provide more context or a full ticket description?\" It seems related to Oracle and change management. So, my proposal could be either \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" along with some justification.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m planning to categorize the IT ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it mentions \"change,\" \"PM\" (which could stand for Project Management or something else), and \"Oracle.\" However, it\u2019s not very clear. I realize many IT triage systems use \"Access\" for permission issues, but that doesn't fit here. \"Oracle\" likely refers to software, and \"sheets\" probably means spreadsheets. Since it\u2019s vague, I should ask for clarification. My primary suggestion would be \"Internal Project,\" and if uncertain, \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll include a rationale for my choices!**Preparing Category JSON**\n\nI\u2019ve got the JSON schema for the category, which shows different options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and so on. Since the user wants me to categorize, I need to respond with a JSON object containing my chosen category. I\u2019m thinking \"Internal Project\" makes the most sense based on the information provided. I should include a note about the limited context and suggest they provide more details if it\u2019s miscategorized. However, to stay safe, I\u2019ll just output the JSON object for now to meet the format requirements.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe prompt asks me to categorize this IT ticket, and it looks like it expects a single response in a specific format. I'm going with the category \"Internal Project,\" even though \"Miscellaneous\" could also work since the context isn't super clear. I should be cautious about the output format, so I\u2019ll stick with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Given the phrasing about updating Oracle sheets, that reinforces my choice of \"Internal Project.\" It feels right!"
