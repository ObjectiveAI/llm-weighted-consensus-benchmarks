The core issue seems to revolve around gaining access, so my best guess is it fits under the \"Access\" category. However, it might also touch on \"Administrative rights\" due to the nature of access permissions. Overall, this ticket is likely about permissions for accessing the secured area.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI'm narrowing down the best category for this IT ticket, which could be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It mentions securing access for colleagues in a secured area starting in February, hinting at an access request. The distinction between access and administrative rights relates to physical versus system permissions. Given it's an IT ticket, I think \"Access\" is the correct category. I'll respond with a JSON object indicating this as the category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
