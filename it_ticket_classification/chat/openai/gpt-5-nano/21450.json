It\u2019s quite jumbled, but it seems to revolve around adding users to a repository, likely related to permissions and administrative rights. Keywords like \"add users,\" \"permissions,\" and \"newly created repository\" pop up. I\u2019m considering categories like Access for access rights and Administrative rights for admin rights. It might also relate to an Internal Project named \"tuesday february.\" So, Access seems like the best fit.**Analyzing User Request**\n\nThe user wants to add users to a repository, which suggests they might want to manage access or permissions. They mention giving everyone access to repositories, so it seems they\u2019re looking to restrict or control that. The message also references integrated Active Directory, likely indicating a need to manage groups. Given these details, the proper categories appear to be Access for general permissions or Administrative rights for higher-level admin roles. Access seems the most fitting for this request.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
