It also mentions an updated subscription and installation. Since \"po\" indicates a purchase order, the ticket seems to fit best in the \"Purchase\" category. However, since it involves hardware, \"Hardware\" could also be appropriate. I'll go with \"Purchase\" as the most fitting category for this.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m working on categorizing the IT ticket. Typically, \"Hardware\" is for device issues while \"Purchase\" is for procurement tasks. This ticket mentions \"new purchase po\" and \"purchase order,\" indicating it's related to processing a new purchase order and requisitioning. Although \"Miscellaneous\" could apply due to the reference to videos and installation, the focus is still on purchasing devices. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase\" and format it as a JSON object for output.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
