The user is experiencing issues uploading a referral tool and mentions trying different browsers. It seems that the problem is software-related, so it could fit under \"Access\" if it's about permissions, or maybe \"Miscellaneous\" if it doesn't fit neatly elsewhere. \"Administrative rights\" might also be relevant if it's a permissions issue. Overall, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" considering the problem stated.**Classifying Application Issues**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a user reporting an issue with an application. \"Internal Project\" seems fitting if it\u2019s an internal tool, but \"Miscellaneous\" might be better for general IT issues. They mention problems uploading a referral tool, which could indicate a glitch. They\u2019ve tried both IE and Chrome, and the issue continues with an attached screenshot. I\u2019m considering \"Access\" if it relates to permissions or \"HR Support\" if it\u2019s specifically an HR tool, but I need to clarify the category details first.**Determining the Right Category**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the category list for the user\u2019s ticket regarding an application tool called \"referral tool,\" which seems related to HR and employee referrals. The user is an Applications Engineer facing an issue uploading. I need to categorize this correctly into one of the eight options. \"Access\" might fit since uploading errors can relate to permissions. \"Internal Project\" could apply if this tool is internal, but \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t seem to be explicitly mentioned. What's the best choice here?**Finalizing Ticket Categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this ticket for the referral tool used by HR. Since the user is an Applications Engineer facing an upload error, I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as \"Internal Project,\" but \"Miscellaneous\" seems safer. I need to respond with a JSON format, showing the category. Given the issue isn\u2019t clearly about access and I don\u2019t have the error details from the screenshot, I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous\" as a general option. Let's output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Formatting the Output**\n\nI need to ensure I follow the specified output format, which requires a JSON object with a \"category\" field. The instruction is to respond with just the category, so my output should be simple: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. While I could consider \"HR Support\" since it relates to a referral tool, the user is an Applications Engineer, and this might not be HR-specific. \"Access\" could also fit if it were about uploading permissions, but since they can open the tool, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the safest choice."
