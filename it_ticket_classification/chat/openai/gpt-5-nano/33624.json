To categorize it correctly, I\u2019ve looked at the possible categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nGiven the nature of the request, it likely falls under \"Administrative rights,\" since it involves creating a resource that requires specific access privileges. \"Access\" seems relevant too, but I think \"Administrative rights\" fits best for this ticket.**Categorizing shared mailbox request**\n\nThe user's request is clear: they're asking to create a new shared mailbox and possibly grant access to it. The phrase \"ext mob blvd\" might refer to some kind of extension or distribution but doesn\u2019t seem relevant for categorization. \n\nGiven that this involves creating a mailbox, I think \"Administrative rights\" is the most fitting category, as it's related to provisioning new resources. \"Access\" could work if focusing specifically on granting rights, but I believe \"Administrative rights\" is the more precise choice here.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nThe prompt provides a clear category schema that I need to follow, with options including \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nI should output a JSON object specifically stating the category as \"Administrative rights.\" The platform seems to expect just that. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond simply with: \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nNo extra text needed! I think this fits perfectly."
