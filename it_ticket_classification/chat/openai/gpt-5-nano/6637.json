The ticket mentions an \"independent director,\" seeming like a request for wording or version text related to this role. It's not a clear fit for \"Administrative rights,\" but it could be considered \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The user wants to add version text, likely in the context of a document about the independent director's role.**Assessing the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket categories: \"Access\" relates to permissions and roles, while \"Administrative rights\" seem to focus on admin rights assignment. The user requests adding version text for the independent director role in English, which could imply something like \"internationalization\" or \"versioning text.\" I\u2019m trying to figure out whether it fits best in \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Although it could relate to \"HR Support,\" it's not specifically HR, but might still cover role descriptions.**Categorizing the role request**\n\nThe request is to \"add version text\" for the \"independent director\" role in English. This sounds like they may want to add translation or localization text for this role. If I must categorize, I might choose \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it involves role permissions. The user seems to want to insert wording for a role description, which might fit under \"Administrative rights.\" However, it could also be \"HR Support,\" but it's more governance-related than employee-focused, so \"Miscellaneous\" might be a safer option.**Choosing the ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket into one specific category. \"Access\" relates to user roles and controls, and the \"independent director role\" does involve access. While I could say it's \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights\" is a subtype that\u2019s also relevant here. The ticket mentions wanting \"version text\" for the role in English, which makes me think it's more about wording than permissions. Still, \"Administrative rights\" is the closest option. The phrasing in the request is a bit unclear, with \"de\" possibly indicating a Spanish connection.**Finalizing the category selection**\n\nIt seems the user wants to add version text to the \"independent director\" role, specifically in English. Given that this is about role naming related to access rights, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Administrative rights.\" According to the instructions, I need to respond in JSON format, so it should look like: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. While I wonder if adding a brief note would be helpful, the instruction primarily requests the category, so I\u2019ll keep it simple and deliver just the JSON response."
