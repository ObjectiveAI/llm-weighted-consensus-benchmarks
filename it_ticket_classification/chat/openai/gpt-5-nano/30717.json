The string mentions a new starter access card and a few other details, which makes me think it fits under the \u201cAccess\u201d category. The schema gives options like Hardware, HR Support, and others, but \u201cAccess\u201d seems the most appropriate here.\n\nSo, I\u2019m thinking I need to format this response like a JSON object. I\u2019ll output it as {\"category\": \"Access\"} to follow the instruction correctly!**Categorizing a Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the text: \"new starter access card enabling Friday PM re starter form...\" It seems like a request for creating an access card for a new starter, along with reference to a starter form and some scheduling details. \n\nThings like high importance and potential holiday notice come up, which make me think this is likely in the \"Access\" category given the focus on enabling the card. It might also relate to \"Administrative rights,\" but I feel \"Access\" fits best overall.**Finalizing Ticket Categorization**\n\nThe request clearly indicates they want to enable an access card for a new starter by Friday PM. While \"HR Support\" could fit due to the starter form, the relevant category here is not \"HR Support,\" but \"Access.\" The ticket content leans more toward access rather than administrative rights. \n\nThus, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Access\" and prepare the JSON response as {\"category\": \"Access\"}. It\u2019s important to stick to the requested format without any extra commentary."
