The ticket discusses \"site needed mobile device inventory,\" mentioning tools, rights, borrowing devices, and owners. This could fit into \"Hardware\" since it relates to devices, but it might also be an \"Internal Project\" if it's about creating a portal for mobile device inventory. However, since the ticket specifically mentions \"update attached mobile devices,\" that leans towards a more hardware-focused issue. I'll need to consider these details carefully.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis ticket seems operational in nature, focusing on setting up a site portal for mobile device inventory, ownership, and processes. It fits well under \"Internal Project,\" as it involves developing a portal to manage inventory. While \"Hardware\" could apply since it's about mobile devices, the emphasis on process and rights\u2014like borrow requests\u2014suggests it's more related to an IT project. Overall, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" since it's about managing inventory rather than hardware repairs.**Categorizing the ticket correctly**\n\nThe ticket refers to needing a \"new site portal for mobile device inventory,\" which indicates it's an \"Internal Project\" focused on deploying and maintaining a tool. I\u2019ll categorize it accordingly. The final response will be in proper JSON format, simply stating that the category is \"Internal Project.\" The required structure shows it should just be the JSON object itself, so I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and say:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}  \n\nThis fits best since it's really about project management rather than falling into miscellaneous categories."
