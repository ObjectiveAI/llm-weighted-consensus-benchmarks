The user's message suggests they want to rename something quickly. My instinct is to classify it under \"Administrative rights,\" but I might need to double-check if \"Internal Project\" is more appropriate for renaming projects.**Evaluating categorization**\n\nLet's see. If the user wants to rename a project, that's definitely an internal operation. The \"Internal Project\" category seems to be the most fitting here. For a request like \"rename product digital id checker,\" that falls under product renaming, which also aligns with \"Internal Project.\" However, since there\u2019s no specific \"Product\" category, I think \"Internal Project\" works for both. I should prepare to output this as a JSON object, following the specified schema.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
