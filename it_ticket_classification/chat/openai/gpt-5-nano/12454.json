It sounds garbled, but it seems to focus on the \"interns bulk starter form\" mentioned multiple times. There are indications about a \"table available by interns join consultant mobile\" and \"seats assigned occupied by talk guys move table.\" The user is also asking for help with filling out the bulk starter form. I'm trying to make sense of it all and clarify these points!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket based on the provided text. The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" The text talks about \"interns,\" \"bulk starter form,\" and some logistical details. It probably isn\u2019t about hardware or HR support directly, but it touches on intern onboarding. It could fit under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but it may not strictly align with \"Administrative Rights\" either.**Deciding on category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket. \"Miscellaneous\" might work if the message is unclear, but \"Internal Project\" fits tasks related to projects. However, it seems more logistical than an actual IT task. \"Access\" could be relevant only if it involved login details, but it doesn\u2019t mention that, nor does it discuss \"Administrative Rights.\" So, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best choice. I'll format my final output as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
