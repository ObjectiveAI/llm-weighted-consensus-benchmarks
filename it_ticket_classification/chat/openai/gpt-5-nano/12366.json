It mentions logging allocation and mandatory receipts, which reinforces it's a purchase-related matter. The provided categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since it's mainly about a new purchase order, I\u2019m confident that the best fit is \"Purchase.\" Although \"Hardware\" could apply here, it\u2019s more focused on procurement.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to format my response as a JSON object with a \"category\" key. The system expects something that matches the required schema, which includes options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Based on the context of the ticket, I\u2019m going to use \"Purchase\" since it pertains to procurement. Therefore, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Purchase.\"} That's clear and straightforward for the user!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
