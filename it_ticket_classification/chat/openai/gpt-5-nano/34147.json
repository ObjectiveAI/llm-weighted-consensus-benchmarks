The user\u2019s message specifies issues with access and permissions regarding links and folders, alongside communications requesting additional permissions. It seems the best fit for this ticket would be \"Access\" due to the focus on link functioning and permission-related concerns. I'll format the output as a JSON object with the chosen category.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket is mostly focused on access control and permissions for a folder and links. I see the category options include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Access\" seems more fitting based on the described issues. I\u2019ll ensure to format the output correctly as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I just want to confirm the format is right and that I\u2019m sticking to the instructions. Let's finalize this and move ahead!"
