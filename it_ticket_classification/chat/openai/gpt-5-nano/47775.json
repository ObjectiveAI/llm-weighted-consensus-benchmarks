It mentions something about an unresolved Oracle password reset, which definitely suggests it's related to access issues. Generally, password resets fall under the \"Access\" category rather than \"Administrative rights.\" There's a note about a previously closed incident that hasn't been resolved yet, reinforcing that this ticket also fits in the \"Access\" category. I'll provide the category in the required format.**Formatting the JSON Output**\n\nI need to create a JSON object for categorizing an IT ticket, specifically something like {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The user just wants this formatted without any extra text or commentary. Since the ticket mentions an \"oracle password reset,\" it's clear that this relates to access issues. So, I'll confirm that \"Access\" is the right category. I'll make sure to format it correctly and output only the necessary JSON. Here's the final output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
