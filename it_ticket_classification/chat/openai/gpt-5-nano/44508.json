However, \"Miscellaneous\" fits better for issues that don't precisely match. Since I want to be safe, I'll go with \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\nThis fits within the allowed categories. I need to make sure to format my response accurately, so I'll output just the JSON object without any extra commentary or whitespace. Here it is: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
