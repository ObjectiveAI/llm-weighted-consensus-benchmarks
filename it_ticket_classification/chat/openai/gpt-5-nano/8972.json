I think \"Internal Project\" fits best since it involves management tasks. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" for this ticket.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether this ticket could also fit under \"Administrative rights,\" since creating an instance might need those privileges. But the text doesn\u2019t clearly mention access permissions. Reviewing the categories again, I see \"Internal Project\" stands out as the best fit because it relates to creating tasks for a board. Alternatively, \"Miscellaneous\" might work if it remains too vague. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" Now, I should format this as a JSON object to meet the instruction requirements.**Outputting JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nI need to create a JSON object with the category field set to \"Internal Project,\" since that fits the request best. The platform expects a specific format, so it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I should avoid extra commentary. Although there's a slight possibility this could fall under \"Access,\" the phrase \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d would clarify any permission needs more explicitly. So, I'll stick with \"Internal Project\" and prepare the JSON response as planned."
