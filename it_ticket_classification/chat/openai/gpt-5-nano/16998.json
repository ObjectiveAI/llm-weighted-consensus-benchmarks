The options are \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights.\" The user's message about meeting rooms seems a bit confusing but suggests that the rooms on a specific floor should be marked as restricted. It seems like it might relate to access and proper naming conventions for those rooms. I'll need to classify this appropriately.**Interpreting IT ticket request**\n\nIt looks like the user wants to mark specific meeting rooms on a floor as restricted and possibly rename them to indicate this. They might be discussing access controls, especially concerning secure areas. This could fall under \"Access\" or might even relate to \"Administrative rights\" based on their specifics about booking permissions. Since the request primarily focuses on access control, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" There's a hint about \"exchange Friday,\" which could indicate some system interactions, but access seems to be the main concern.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe user's request mentions needing \"restricted exchange Friday\" and \"inside secure areas dedicated,\" suggesting they want to tighten access. I interpret \"assign appropriate action\" as a need to escalate this issue. Therefore, the most fitting category seems to be \"Access.\" I'll respond in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to make sure there's no extra text or formatting and focus strictly on the category output. Let's finalize this!"
