The text has phrases like \"purchase request for IT\" and \"approved,\" which makes me lean towards the \"Purchase\" category, since it mentions a purchase request and approval. The mention of \"electrical snakes\" could relate to cable management, but it's still about purchasing. I could consider \"Hardware\" if it's about specific hardware, but \"Purchase\" seems to fit best overall.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI see the mention of \"monitor\" and \"patch cat monitor,\" but I'm not entirely sure of its relevance. The categories list has \"Storage,\" but that seems less fitting since the focus leans more towards purchase and storing. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" don't apply, and \"Access\" isn't relevant either. So, the best category is definitely \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object, like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"} \n\nThat seems to fit the instruction perfectly!"
