It seems they're discussing expressway network settings for clients that should connect to a server providing important records. However, they mention that settings have changed recently, and the parameters might not include necessary records. Given this context, I'll categorize the ticket under \"Access,\" as it's related to network connection issues.**Categorizing Expressway IT Ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s issue mentions \"Expressway,\" indicating it's related to Cisco Expressway (part of Cisco collaboration). They describe access problems where clients connect to a server that provides important records. There's mention of possibly using an \"old backup server.\" I think the best category for this ticket is \"Access,\" since it's focused on connection and settings issues impacting access to records. Now, I\u2019ll prepare the final answer as a JSON object with the category set to \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
