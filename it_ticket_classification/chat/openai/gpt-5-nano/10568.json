The user references a \"new purchase,\" \"PO,\" and \"receipts,\" which suggests they're talking about procurement. Since the categories we can choose from include \"Purchase\" and others, it seems clear that \"Purchase\" is the best fit. I\u2019ll label it as such and explain that it relates to the purchase order and receipts. I might want to consider mentioning a possible alternative category, but \"Purchase\" feels solid for now.**Outputting JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket and present it in a JSON format. The prompt specifies a \"category\" field, requiring me to respond with an object like this: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll make sure the capitalization matches, since the category \u201cPurchase\u201d needs a capital \"P.\" I realize it's essential to output just the JSON object without any extra commentary. So, I'll go ahead and present it succinctly!"
