The user has mentioned a variety of details that seem repetitive, focusing mainly on the screen issue. \n\nI should determine which category it falls under from options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. Given the repeated mention of a broken screen, it likely fits best in the Hardware category.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket, which focuses on a broken screen, display replacement, and related hardware issues. The message repeatedly mentions the phone, display, and a replacement quote. While I could consider \"Purchase\" for the quote, it\u2019s mostly a hardware concern. The ticket also touches on administrative procedures, but those don\u2019t seem to fit. Ultimately, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" \n\nTo follow the proper format, I\u2019ll output the classification as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}}"
