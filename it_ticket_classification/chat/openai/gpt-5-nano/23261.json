This clearly revolves around access rights. I need to decide whether to categorize this as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since both seem relevant. I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as it fits the request more directly, but \"Administrative rights\" could also work depending on the specifics of the taxonomy.**Categorizing the request**\n\nThe user is asking for new access permissions for managers, focusing on enabling access rather than requesting administrative rights. They mention \"pm permission,\" which suggests project manager access, not necessarily elevated privileges. Their request revolves around sharing, viewing, and updating files, so I think the most suitable category is \"Access.\" Given the format requested, I'll respond with: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I'm also considering if there should be any alternatives, but I feel confident in this choice!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
