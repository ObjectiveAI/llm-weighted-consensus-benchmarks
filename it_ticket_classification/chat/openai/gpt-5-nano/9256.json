It mentions triggers, forms, a mailbox, and syncing updated survey instances, weighing a fatal error question, and logging calls. My best guess is that this ticket relates to modifying surveys and triggers in ServiceNow, possibly fitting into \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"HR Support.\"**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm looking at the categories available: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The ticket seems focused on survey modifications, ServiceNow, triggers, and forms. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Internal Project,\" potentially \"Administrative Rights\" if they need permissions for those modifications. It doesn\u2019t fit hardware, storage, or purchase categories. \"Miscellaneous\" could work for general IT requests, but \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit here.**Parsing the IT ticket request**\n\nI'm parsing the request, which is about survey modifications in ServiceNow. It mentions making survey triggers, forms, linked surveys, syncing updated instances, and addressing a fatal error question. This task falls under \"Internal Project\" since it's more about configuration in ServiceNow. So, I\u2019ll need to respond with just the required JSON format for the category. I\u2019ll produce a simple output: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
