The user might be involved in internal QA, indicated by their title as \"senior tester.\" There's a repeated mention of the problem, so I need to consider either \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" Since it relates to software upload issues and mentions installation steps for Flash, which is deprecated, I think \"Miscellaneous\" best fits. I'll finalize this as my category choice.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm evaluating the IT ticket about the referral tool. It seems appropriate to categorize it as \"Internal Project\" since it\u2019s likely used internally, especially given the user's role as a senior tester. While \"Miscellaneous\" could also fit, I think \"Internal Project\" is more precise here. Although I briefly considered \"Access\" due to upload requirements, the ticket doesn't mention permission issues. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" and finalize that as my JSON output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
