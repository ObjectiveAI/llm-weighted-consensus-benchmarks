The user provided a string that includes information about \"internship switch between offices\" and mentions \"tower,\" \"senior tester,\" and \"backpack.\" It sounds like it might relate to moving interns and possibly involves access issues. I think it could fall under \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or even \"Hardware\" since \"backpack\" might refer to equipment. I'll need to decide which category fits best before outputting the JSON.**Evaluating category for ticket**\n\nThe content is a bit messy, likely due to languages mixed in, featuring phrases like \"va si tower\" and \"cum anterior care\". The mention of \"internship switch between offices\" suggests a process change for interns\u2014possibly related to access rights or account provisioning. I need to categorize this under \"Internal Project\" since it involves an internal process, but \"Access\" could also fit due to the need for separating accounts per user. I need to choose carefully between these options.**Deciding on category**\n\nI think the most suitable category for this ticket is \"Access\" because it relates to access rights when interns switch offices. While \"Administrative rights\" could also fit, it\u2019s not as clear. \"Miscellaneous\" might be an option if things are unclear, but given the repeated mention of \"internship switch between offices\" and the specifics about \"per each user,\" it seems to be about provisioning users for different office spaces. Since this is an IT ticket, categorizing it as \"Access\" seems the best choice. I'll output it as JSON.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to make sure the output is in the correct JSON format with the property \"category.\" The system specifies that the category must be one of the provided options, and I want to keep it straightforward. I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra text in the output\u2014just the required JSON. Let's get this done efficiently! It\u2019ll be a clean response, ready to go."
