However, I also wonder if it could be \"Administrative rights\" if it's about changing access. Still, \"HR Support\" fits best for onboarding. This ticket is likely about requesting HR forms, so I'll categorize it accordingly and format it as a JSON object.**Producing the category JSON**\n\nI see the instruction is about categorizing with a specific schema. The options include several categories, but I think the best fit here is \"HR Support.\" Since the task is to produce a JSON object, I\u2019ll format it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI could also consider \"Administrative rights,\" but since the focus is on contract changes and forms, \"HR Support\" makes more sense. I'll just deliver that simple output without extra words."
