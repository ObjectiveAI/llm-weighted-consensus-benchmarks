It mentions why someone could change the status, implying an access control or security issue. I\u2019m considering whether this relates more to \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d The user is asking for a look into why they could change the incident status independently. So, I think the appropriate category could be \"Access.\"**Categorizing permissions in IT tickets**\n\nThe ticket deals with someone changing the incident status to active on their own, which relates to permissions and roles in the ITSM tool. I\u2019m trying to decide if it fits better under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" It really touches on access control regarding privileges. Since the user questions why they could change the status themselves, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d seems more accurate. However, it also mentions the status transition, which could fit \"Access\" as well. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Administrative rights.\"{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
