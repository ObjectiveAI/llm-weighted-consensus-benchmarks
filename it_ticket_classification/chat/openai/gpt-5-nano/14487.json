Given the mention of \"share\" and permissions, the \"Access\" category feels like the best fit since it's about sharing permissions. I could also consider \"Internal Project\" if it relates to a specific project, but \"Access\" seems most appropriate here.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the IT ticket text, and it doesn't seem to fit categories like hardware, storage, or HR. The phrase \"wants to share\" suggests it might not be about administrative rights either. They're discussing sharing services with Tuesday PM, which hints at calendar invites with \"accept\" and \"decline\". Given this context, \"Access\" looks like the right category for permissions involved. Now, I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object with the category specified.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
