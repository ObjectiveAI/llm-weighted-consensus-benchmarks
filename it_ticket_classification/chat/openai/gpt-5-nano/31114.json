They seem to be inquiring about holiday status and might also be asking for access rights or something related to rescheduling. I'll need to choose an appropriate category from the list provided.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket content includes \"access\" and mentions \"Administrative rights.\" The phrase \"access to wednesday pm\" likely refers to needing access on Wednesday afternoon. The reference to \"re approved pm perspective\" could mean something about Project Management or Privilege Management. Given the repeated mentions of \"access,\" it seems best to categorize it as \"Access.\" While it might border on \"Miscellaneous\" due to its garbled nature, I'll go with \"Access\" as the primary focus is on permissions."
