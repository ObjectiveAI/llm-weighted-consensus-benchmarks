Since the ticket involves a \"broken access card,\" it fits best under the \"Access\" category because it's related to access control. I'll prepare the JSON object in the required format with \"Access\" as the chosen category.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket description mentions a \"broken access card,\" which suggests it could fit into either the Access or Hardware categories. However, since it relates specifically to access control, \"Access\" makes more sense. I\u2019ll choose that category. Now, I need to provide a JSON object formatted correctly, focusing on: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The instruction emphasizes following the required schema, but I'll ensure the output only needs the category value as stated in the prompt.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nIn similar tasks, the output has been simply: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The instruction requires a structured JSON object, so I\u2019ll stick to that format. The repeated mention of a \"broken access card\" indicates it falls under \"Access\" since that's about permission issues, not just physical hardware. But I ponder if \"Hardware\" might fit too\u2014after all, it\u2019s a physical card. Yet, I believe the best choice is still \"Access\" for this specific situation.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI think the safer choice is \"Access\" since it directly relates to the user's issue: they can't access something because of a broken card. The focus seems to be on the access device rather than permission changes. They did mention \"damaged card\" and \"broken card,\" but in ticket routing, hardware problems usually go to facilities, while access issues go to security. Given that, I\u2019ll stick with \"Access\" for my final output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's proceed with that!"
