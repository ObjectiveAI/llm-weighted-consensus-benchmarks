I see keywords like \"friday,\" \"july,\" and \"building.\" It seems like they're requesting access cards, so \u201cAccess\u201d looks like the best category. However, if it\u2019s about granting access rights, it could fit under \"Administrative rights.\" Since access cards typically relate to physical access, I'll go with \"Access\" for classification and format that as JSON output.**Finalizing IT Ticket JSON**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket according to the specified format. The system's guidelines state that I should provide a simple JSON object with the category as \"Access.\" I'll ensure there's no extra text beyond the JSON itself, just what\u2019s required. So, my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's essential to follow the instructions precisely and keep it clean. Alright, I\u2019m ready to finalize that!"
