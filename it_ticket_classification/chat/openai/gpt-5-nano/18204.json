We're looking at configuration, scheduling for Thursday in March, and aspects of building and deployment. The listed categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the content, it could fit in Internal Project, Administrative rights, Miscellaneous, or Access since there's mention of adding a picture. Let's decide!**Deciding ticket categories**\n\nI'm evaluating categories for this IT ticket and want to choose the best fit. The categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket references configuration and deploying artifacts, which aligns with DevOps and deployment. Internal Project might work if this is for an internal task, while Administrative rights could be relevant if it relates to permissions. I'm leaning toward Internal Project because of the deployment content. I'll format the output as a JSON object with the chosen category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
