It seems related to either \"Internal Project\" or \"Access\" categories. Since the user\u2019s message is somewhat garbled, I'll likely classify it under \"Internal Project\" or \"Access,\" as that's the most fitting based on the context.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nLet\u2019s analyze this IT ticket to determine the best category. It mentions \"setup,\" \"project,\" \"upload forms,\" \"policies,\" and \"procedures,\" suggesting it fits \"Internal Project\" since it\u2019s about project setup. There are repeated phrases like \"setup\" and \"assign,\" which could hint at access rights, but it doesn't explicitly ask for administrative privileges. Overall, since the main focus is on setting up an Oracle and PAS project, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\""
