It mentions new interns and ordering equipment, which suggests it's about providing hardware for those interns. Looking at the category options, it could fit under Purchase or Hardware since it involves procuring equipment. While HR Support seems relevant because of the interns, this ticket focuses on the equipment aspect, so I think Hardware or Purchase is most appropriate.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user has asked me to assign a category to an IT ticket. \"Hardware\" might relate to providing laptops for new interns, but it seems \"Purchase\" fits better for ordering equipment. The phrase \"ordering equipment\" really emphasizes procurement, so I think \"Purchase\" is the most appropriate. I\u2019ll also note that it appears to be about provisioning equipment for new interns and remind about possible attachments. Ultimately, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object containing the category as \"Purchase.\"**Responding with JSON format**\n\nThe instructions ask me to respond with a JSON object indicating the category. The required format is simple: I need to ensure it\u2019s output as {\"category\": \"...\"}. So, I\u2019ll confirm my output will be {\"category\": \"Purchase\"} while making sure to match the exact capitalization. Although I briefly considered \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" it's clear that \"Purchase\" is the most relevant. I\u2019ll just stick with that and deliver it!"
