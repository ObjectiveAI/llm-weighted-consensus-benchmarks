The message mentions terms like \"discipline lead\" and \"October PM,\" suggesting it relates to the onboarding process. \"Hi please fill\" could indicate they want some form completed. Based on this context, it looks like it should fall under HR Support. I'll format the output as JSON with the appropriate category.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to determine the right category for an IT ticket related to onboarding a new starter. The phrases \"new starter\" and \"please fill\" suggest it\u2019s about access provisioning or administrative rights, which makes sense for someone starting. I'm considering both Access and HR Support since onboarding often involves these aspects. However, I lean towards Access as more common. The overall message seems to surround organizing access or permissions for the new employee.**Choosing category for access**\n\nI\u2019m interpreting the ticket as a request to fill out something, possibly related to \"POP\" which might mean \"proof of concept\" or \"point of contact.\" The best category seems to be either Administrative Rights or Access. The user mentions \u201cplease fill,\u201d indicating they might want a form completed rather than access rights. Given that, Access is the most appropriate choice for the onboarding process. I\u2019ll format my output as JSON with \"Access\" as the selected category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
