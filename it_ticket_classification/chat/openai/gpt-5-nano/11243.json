The text is pretty jumbled but contains phrases like \"project management staff\" and \"created members,\" which might suggest it relates to \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project.\" It seems there's a request about adding members or creating a new unit for a project on Thursday. I\u2019ll have to map this information into a JSON object with the appropriate category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI see a list of categories like Hardware, HR Support, and so on, and I need to categorize the IT ticket text. It seems related to project management and mentions \"created members,\" suggesting \"Internal Project\" might fit. However, it might also relate to \"Access\" if it's about member access. The text doesn't provide a clear action, making it a bit ambiguous, but I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and output the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to output just the category in JSON format, but I\u2019m considering if a brief justification might help. The instruction specifies it should only be JSON. \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it's about creating users, since \"created members\" suggests that. However, the text is unclear. While \"Access\" covers user permissions, it doesn\u2019t explicitly mention logs. Given the focus on \"project management staff,\" I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit, so I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
