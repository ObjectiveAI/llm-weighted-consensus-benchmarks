                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nI need to classify an IT ticket based on unstructured text from the user. The message mentions internal audits, forbidden software, and a report related to these issues. It talks about colleagues and software policy compliance but doesn't clearly relate to hardware or storage. My best guess is that it falls under \"Administrative rights\" since it discusses permissions along with software policy compliance. It\u2019s really about finding the right fit for the category.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket, and I see a few options. \u201cInternal Project\u201d might fit since it mentions an audit, but that sounds more like ongoing initiatives. \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d seems likely since the content discusses access rights and enforcing software restrictions. Though it also mentions file sharing and \"installed assets,\" which could hint at \u201cStorage.\u201d However, since this is about auditing forbidden software, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could be the best fit. I just need to output a JSON with the chosen category.**Parsing IT ticket content**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the user\u2019s message, which mentions \"internal audit\" and \"forbidden software.\" It seems to be asking for a report and discussing colleagues involved in file-sharing and games. Since this relates to an internal audit, \u201cInternal Project\u201d could be a good fit, as it aligns with audit activities. On the other hand, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d might work if it were about enforcing software restrictions, but there's no explicit request for access. \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d feels too broad for this situation.**Evaluating IT ticket categories**\n\nI see that the allowed categories are fixed, and \"Internal Project\" seems to be the most fitting option. Let\u2019s break down the others: \n\n\u201cHardware\u201d doesn\u2019t apply since there\u2019s no mention of hardware. \u201cHR Support\u201d isn't relevant either. \u201cAccess\u201d could relate to rights, but the text focuses more on forbidden software rather than login issues. \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is too vague, and while \u201cStorage\u201d could relate to file sharing, the primary context is the audit of forbidden software. So, \"Internal Project\" really does seem to be the best choice here.**Formulating JSON response**\n\nI see that while \u201cfile store\u201d might suggest storage, the main focus is actually on a software policy audit. The \u201cPurchase\u201d category doesn\u2019t fit, and \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d seems aimed at requests for permissions, which aren\u2019t present here. \u201cInternal Project\u201d aligns perfectly with this internal audit situation. It looks like I need to respond with a simple JSON object. I\u2019ll format it correctly, ensuring to maintain the allowed values. So, I\u2019ll respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nNo extra text, just the JSON object!"
