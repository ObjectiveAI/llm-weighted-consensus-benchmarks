It seems mostly related to an employee leaving, or a \"leaver\". There are several mentions of forms, dates, and various account details, which indicates steps that need to be taken for someone who is departing. I should ensure everything is organized effectively, so it\u2019s clear what actions are necessary regarding their email, permissions, and any equipment that needs to be returned.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket related to offboarding an employee. The ticket has details about leave dates, permissions, mailboxes, and AD rights, among other things. Based on the categories available\u2014like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and Administrative rights\u2014it looks like \"Access\" fits best since it deals with removing access rights, mailboxes, and roaming profiles for leavers. I think I'll go with \"Access\" as the most appropriate category for this ticket.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
