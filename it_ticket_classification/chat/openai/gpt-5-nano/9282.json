The mention of \"new starter\" indicates it relates to onboarding. The concerns about floor maps, equipment, and an additional monitor suggest the user may need \"HR Support\" or \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll lean toward categorizing this ticket as \"HR Support\" since it deals with a new employee's onboarding process and associated equipment needs.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI see that the ticket mentions \"head analysis\" and additional details about equipment, which points to provisioning hardware for a new starter. It's unclear, but the focus seems to be on hardware needs like floor maps and monitors. While HR onboarding is mentioned due to \"new starter,\" the emphasis is more on hardware provisioning. Hence, I think the best category here is \"Hardware,\" rather than \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll propose this in the requested JSON format.**Outputting IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe prompt specifies that I need to respond with a JSON object for the category. Based on my analysis, I\u2019ve determined the appropriate category is \"Hardware.\" \n\nSo, I\u2019ll ensure I stick to the format and keep it simple without additional explanation. The final output will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nThis matches the user's request neatly and clearly."
