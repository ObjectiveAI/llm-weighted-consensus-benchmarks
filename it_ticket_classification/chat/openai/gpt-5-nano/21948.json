There are options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and more. \n\nGiven the mention of \"Active Directory\" implications for adding interns, the \"Access\" category looks appropriate for access provisioning. However, since it refers to HR elements too, \"HR Support\" could also work, but it\u2019s explicitly labeled in the categories.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis IT ticket indicates a need for internal provisioning, mentioning \"new interns\" and \"bulk starter form.\" The term \"AD\" likely refers to \"Active Directory,\" suggesting it's about providing access for interns. \n\nGiven this context, the \"Access\" category seems most fitting rather than \"Administrative rights,\" since it focuses more on access provisioning. I'll need to format my response as a JSON object specifying the category, which will look like {\"category\": \"Access\"}.**Providing Category Output**\n\nI need to output the category for the IT ticket based on the provided requirements. The focus is on delivering a clean JSON object without any extra text, just like the prompt specifies.\n\nThe schema shows that I need to set the field \"category\" to \"Access.\" It\u2019s straightforward, so I\u2019ll finalize my response as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This structure follows the required format perfectly, and no additional explanations are necessary since the user simply wants the category."
