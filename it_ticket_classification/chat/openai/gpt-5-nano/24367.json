The user mentions an \"internal project proposal,\" suggesting they\u2019re asking for access to this proposal and want to know whether their request has been accepted or declined. It appears to fit the \"Access\" category since it's about gaining access to a file. However, since it directly relates to an internal project, categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" also makes sense. I need to choose the best fit!**Classifying access request**\n\nThe text refers to \"access,\" \"internal project proposal,\" and asks to \"provide accept decline,\" which indicates that the user wants access to that proposal and possibly to approve or deny it. In IT ticketing, access requests generally fit under the \"Access\" category. The mention of \"internal project proposal\" makes it clear the resource in question is that proposal. Since it\u2019s about granting access, I'll categorize this task as \"Access\" and respond with the JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
