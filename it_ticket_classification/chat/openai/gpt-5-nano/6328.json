The ticket references \"add labels project view\" and details about UI labels, particularly a \"red square.\" This suggests it's relating to project management rather than hardware, HR, access, storage, purchase, or internal projects. It seems to fit best in the \"Miscellaneous\" category since it's an internal request focused on the user interface. So, I'll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous.\"**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI think the \"Internal Project\" category might be the most appropriate, as the ticket seems to relate to an internal project management feature concerning labels. \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t really apply since it\u2019s not about permissions. \"Miscellaneous\" could work, but it\u2019s very broad. The user likely needs assistance adding labels to a project view and is possibly trying to address the issue related to the red square. So, I'll stick with \"Internal Project\" for this ticket.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThis ticket is clearly about software UI, so I need to choose a category. I think \"Internal Project\" fits best since it relates to tasks for an internal project management tool, while \"Miscellaneous\" is more vague. The request doesn't involve admin rights, so \"Internal Project\" makes sense. I\u2019ll present the response as a JSON object, formatted properly with the category field: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It's straightforward, and I\u2019ll keep it simple as requested."
