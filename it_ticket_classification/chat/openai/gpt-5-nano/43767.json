It mentions issues with shared reports, specifically involving report names and closed incidents from the previous month. \n\nFrom the given categories \u2014 Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights \u2014 I\u2019ll need to interpret the ticket's content carefully to determine the correct category for it. This should help in appropriately addressing the user's concerns.**Interpreting ticket issues**\n\nThe user seems to be reporting an issue regarding shared reports not displaying properly. They mention specific reports related to closed incidents from the previous month, which seem vital for monthly client reports. \n\nI\u2019m considering what category fits best. \"Access\" could apply since it involves issues with permissions or access rights. There\u2019s also \"Administrative rights,\" but it looks like that might be a subcategory. Based on the context, \"Access\" seems to be the most appropriate choice for this ticket.**Identifying ticket category**\n\nThe user is dealing with a ticket about \"shared reports not showing,\" which likely indicates a permissions or access issue. They mention \"catalog req item required for monthly client reports,\" which might relate to specific resources, but it\u2019s unclear. \n\nI need to decide between \"Access\" and \"Internal Project\". The latter doesn't fit since it's not about project tasks. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too general. Given the focus on sharing and permissions, categorizing this as \"Access\" seems most appropriate, especially since it directly pertains to access rights and shared reports.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket, which means I need to respond with a JSON object that includes a \"category\" key. The permitted categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\"\n\nI'll respond with {\"category\":\"Access\"}, making sure the capitalization is spot on since it seems the enum values require that. I\u2019m also wondering if \"Administrative rights\" might be more accurate, given the focus on access permissions for shared reports.**Responding with category**\n\nThe user's issue revolves around \"shared reports not showing,\" which suggests a problem with access permissions. I believe categorizing this as \"Access\" is appropriate. To satisfy their request, I\u2019ll need to respond with a JSON object that includes the category. \n\nThe instruction clearly states that I should output it in that format. So, I\u2019ll just go ahead and say: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra text needed for clarity!"
