I'll ensure the categorization reflects their request accurately!**Determining the right category**\n\nI need to decide which category fits best for the IT ticket. The options I have are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Deleting Outlook folders seems to fit best under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, since the user didn't mention needing permissions, I wonder if \"Miscellaneous\" might be appropriate, as it seems to be a general IT support request. I also consider \"Storage,\" but that might not be the main focus given their wording.**Choosing a category for the ticket**\n\nI think it's a good idea to ask a clarifying question, but the user asked to categorize the IT ticket, so I only need to pick one category from the provided options. \"Miscellaneous\" seems fitting since it's a generic request about Outlook folders. It could also be \"Administrative rights\" if they needed special permissions to delete those folders, but that wasn't mentioned. Given all this, I'll decide to categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" and format my response in JSON.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
