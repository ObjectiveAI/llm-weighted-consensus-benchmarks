The ticket mentions terms like \"new purchase po,\" \"log allocation,\" and \"mandatory receipts section,\" which suggest it's about purchasing and resource allocation. It's a bit unclear, but it heavily involves \"purchase order\" and logging aspects. Given all this, it seems like the most appropriate category would be \"Purchase.\" It fits with the procurement and request context highlighted in the text.**Finalizing category output**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether this ticket could fit into categories like Administrative rights, Storage, or Internal Project, but none of those feel right. \"Miscellaneous\" might be a possibility, but the focus on \"purchase\" and \"PO\" really stands out. So it seems like \"Purchase\" is the best category.\n\nNow, I need to respond with the correct JSON format. The ticket needs a simple output that looks like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. That's it! I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text at all."
