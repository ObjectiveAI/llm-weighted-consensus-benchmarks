However, the mention of \"new starter\" signals possible onboarding for a new employee or contractor, and \"re-activated\" could indicate access issues or administrative rights. Given all these elements, it seems like the most fitting category could be \"Hardware\" due to the focus on RAM, but access considerations might also apply.**Evaluating Ticket Category**\n\nThe content of the ticket states \"new starter RAM for Wednesday PM contractor reactivated,\" which makes me think about what RAM refers to. In IT, it usually means Random Access Memory, indicating hardware provisioning for a new employee or contractor. The mention of \"re-activated\" might suggest account reactivation, leading me to consider categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It seems \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category here since it emphasizes the need to provide new RAM.**Categorizing Ticket Content**\n\nI see that the ticket primarily revolves around hardware provisioning, especially since it mentions \"starter RAM.\" However, there's a possibility it could relate to \"Access,\" particularly for reactivating a contractor's access to systems. The phrasing is a bit confusing, but it leans more towards hardware since the user is likely referencing new memory. Given the emphasis on \"new starter\" and \"RAM,\" categorizing this under \"Hardware\" seems to be the most straightforward choice.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
