The ticket talks about task details and project management, which makes me think it fits into \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or maybe \"Administrative rights.\" Since the ticket is about an internal project management tool, I\u2019ll lean towards \"Internal Project.\" It clearly isn't related to hardware, storage, purchase, or HR. Now, I'll structure my output as a JSON-like format to reflect this decision!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm looking at the provided categories, and \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit. The user wants me to categorize their IT ticket, so I\u2019ll format my response in JSON with \"category\" set to \"Internal Project.\" \n\nThough \"Miscellaneous\" might also fit due to mentions of \"templates\" and \"task details options,\" it\u2019s really about a project management issue. Therefore, I\u2019ll confidently choose \"Internal Project\" as the most accurate option and just respond with the JSON.**Formatting the output correctly**\n\nI\u2019m confirming the output format needs to be JSON-like, specifically with a category object. The schema shows that the response should simply include the category key. So, I need to provide something like `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. \n\nI realize that the expected content is just the category string value without any extra wrapping. I\u2019ll make sure to stick with the format and send that clear JSON response with no additional text. Let's go ahead and respond accordingly!"
