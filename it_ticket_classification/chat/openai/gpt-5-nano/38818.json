The user mentioned issues with the Outlook app, saying they can open it but are having problems. The message isn't very clear; it sounds a bit jumbled with phrases about attaching a print screen and having closed Word before retrying. Given this context, it seems the most relevant category might be \"Access,\" since the user is struggling to use the app properly.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIt looks like the user is having trouble opening an app, possibly Word or Outlook. They mentioned closing Word before retrying, so maybe it\u2019s related to that. The issue seems to fit into the \u201cAccess\u201d category since it's about launching apps. They also included an attached print screen, although I don't have that here. I\u2019ll go ahead and categorize this IT ticket as \u201cAccess\u201d and respond with the proper JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
