The options I have are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nFrom the text, it seems the user is struggling to access client servers, which suggests the \"Access\" category might be the most appropriate fit. I\u2019ll focus on parsing the ticket to confirm this category.**Interpreting the IT ticket**\n\nThe user provided a message indicating they were able to access client servers last week but are now having trouble connecting. They mentioned something about a range, possibly referring to a VPN range or a range of IPs. It sounds like they're requesting help with access issues to client servers. That leads me to think the appropriate category for this ticket is \"Access.\" I'll need to respond with a JSON object reflecting this category.**Outputting the category**\n\nI need to provide a category using the specified schema, which requires me to output a JSON object. The user asked to categorize the IT ticket, so it seems they only want the category itself. Based on my interpretation, \u201cAccess\u201d is the correct choice from the list of enumerated values.\n\nI'll make sure my response is formatted correctly: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThis will fulfill the instruction without any extra text."
