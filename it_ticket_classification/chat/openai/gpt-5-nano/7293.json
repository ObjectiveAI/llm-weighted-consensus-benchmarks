The category options are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given that the ticket focuses on inventory status and hardware assets like servers and network devices, \"Hardware\" seems to be the best fit.
