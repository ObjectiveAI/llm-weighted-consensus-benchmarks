The ticket mentions \"snow notifications,\" which likely refers to ServiceNow, and involves an IT support team. There are several elements to consider: the dates mentioned, satisfaction scores, and an \"annual leave notice.\" However, since the ticket is primarily IT-related with a request to add notifications for the ServiceNow system, I think classifying it under \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" makes sense. So I'll lean towards one of those categories.**Choosing the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on a category for this IT ticket related to ServiceNow notifications. It could fit under \"Internal Project\" since it's mainly about configuring notifications for the IT support team. \"Administrative rights\" crossed my mind too, but it doesn't seem to focus on access changes. While \"Access\" could apply if they need any modifications, the intent is clearer as a configuration task within an internal system. So, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit! I'll format my response as a JSON-like category object.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
