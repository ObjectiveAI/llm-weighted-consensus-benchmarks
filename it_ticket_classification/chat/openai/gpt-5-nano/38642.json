The ticket includes a request about Exchange connection issues, which probably relates to Microsoft Exchange email. \n\nIt seems like they\u2019re facing access troubles. The mention of \"BR\" could refer to \"branch\" or \"browser,\" but I'm not entirely sure. Given the context, the best fit for this ticket would be the \"Access\" category since it's about connecting to Exchange. I\u2019ll format my answer as a JSON with the category set to \"Access.\"**Outputting IT ticket category**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize an IT ticket, and I should format my response as a JSON object specifying the category. \n\nSince the issue is about access, the required output should simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to focus solely on that in the final answer, avoiding any extra commentary. Just keep it straightforward and stick to delivering the desired JSON format. So, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
