The message mentions \"cd out of space,\" which likely refers to a drive issue, probably the C drive. It also includes \"teams continuous running out,\" likely indicating a problem with Microsoft Teams. I should consider the \"Storage\" category for this ticket since storage issues seem to be the primary concern. Let's go ahead and classify it as \"Storage.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI see that the user message hints at a \"C drive\" or \"disk\" space issue. Phrases like \"continuous running out\" indicate a storage problem, likely in a hosted environment. Given that the content reveals a typical storage issue, I should categorize this as \"Storage.\" The categories typically include both \"Storage\" and \"Hardware\" for such matters, but since this seems to focus on disk space, I'll go ahead and output a JSON-like object with \"category\": \"Storage.\"{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
