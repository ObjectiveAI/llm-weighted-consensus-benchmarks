The ticket mentions someone unable to access shared folders, which clearly ties to access issues. While \"Storage\" could be a consideration, the main problem is access, so \"Access\" fits best. I'll prepare to provide a JSON response for this, setting the category value accurately as requested.**Delivering category response**\n\nI see that the \"Response Formats\" specify I need to respond with a JSON object containing the category \"Access.\" The required format is: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Since the instruction emphasizes categorizing the IT ticket, it\u2019s clear I should just provide this JSON object without extra reasoning. So, I\u2019ll make sure to deliver it in the specified format now! Here we go: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
