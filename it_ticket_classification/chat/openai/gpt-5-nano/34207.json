The user mentions an error while trying to remove entries, suggesting it relates to HR Support. The category options available are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given its focus on the timesheet, I think \"HR Support\" is the best fit, but \"Miscellaneous\" could work too depending on context. I'll format this as a JSON object.**Categorizing time sheet request**\n\nThe user wants to reset their timesheet due to encountering an error while trying to remove entries. I\u2019m considering the best category for this request: it could fall under \"HR Support,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Administrative rights\" if admin permissions are needed. However, since the request is specifically about the Oracle timesheet, \"HR Support\" seems like the most appropriate choice, especially for HR-related systems! I'll prepare a JSON object with the category set to \"HR Support.\"{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
