I'll carefully consider the specific details of the ticket to make sure it aligns with one of these categories.  Let's ensure a smooth process by categorizing it correctly!**Parsing project request**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a rather messy string of text that seems to be about a \"career map project\" and involves requests for a \"setup form,\" \"cost recovery,\" and other details like \"role location,\" \"grade,\" \"days total,\" and \"tester designer totals.\" There are mentions of approved costs, codes that need to be created, and a deadline specified. It seems crucial to clarify these details for better understanding and to ensure that all steps are properly followed in the project.**Categorizing project ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at this project coordination ticket, and it seems to fit best into the \"Internal Project\" category. While \"Administrative rights\" and \"Purchase\" could be considered, they don\u2019t quite match the context, which focuses on a setup form and cost recovery involving codes. So, I'll go ahead and respond with a JSON object to categorize this ticket. The format will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That fits the instructions perfectly!"
