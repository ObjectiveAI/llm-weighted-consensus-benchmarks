Given the context, I should classify it as \"Access\" because it's specifically about granting access for new staff members. My response will be in JSON format reflecting that determination.**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nThe ticket might also fit under \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are needed. However, since it specifically mentions \"new staff to be added,\" \"Access\" really seems like the best option. I need to format my response correctly as a JSON object because that\u2019s what the user asked for. So I'll simply return: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s good to double-check that it\u2019s correct without any extra text! Let's go with that."
