The user describes the ticket as a feedback question related to editing profiles and selecting English levels, validated by English teachers. It seems like a feature request for more user independence in selecting their language level, which might fit best under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\"**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThis IT ticket centers around system design, specifically user profile editing and the English level field. I\u2019m weighing the categories: it could be \"Administrative rights\" if it involves permissions for editing, \"Internal Project\" for IT features, \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Access\" focused on user capabilities. The feature request highlights whether users can select their own English level, validated against teachers' records. I'm leaning towards \"Access\" due to the emphasis on user editing capability.**Outputting Category Object**\n\nI need to create a JSON-like object with the appropriate category for this IT ticket. Based on the content, it seems most fitting to categorize it as \"Access\" since it revolves around user permissions to edit their English level. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply, it also touches on validation methods. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too broad. So, I'll go with \"Access\" and output the category object. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra explanation needed!**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI need to ensure that the output is in a JSON-like format, specifically for the category selection. The allowed value is clear, and I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" So, the output will be straightforward. It looks like I'm ready to deliver the final object. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That's all that\u2019s needed!"
