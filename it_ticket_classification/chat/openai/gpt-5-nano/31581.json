I\u2019m considering whether it falls under \"Administrative rights\" for access issues or \"Internal Project\" for project-related requests. The categories seem limited, with no clear fit for \"Software\" or \"IT Support.\" \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous\" are the closest options. It looks like this is about internal CRM tasks rather than hardware or software access.**Evaluating ticket classification**\n\nThis might be an \"Access\" request because the user seems to need access to certain systems or links. The mention of \"Administrative rights\" likely relates to permissions for changing dashboard or lead IDs. However, the user is asking for specific actions like \"assign opportunity lead ID\" and \"change distinct lead.\" It could also fit under \"Internal Project\" since it's about updates in an internal environment, but that category feels a bit vague. Overall, it leans toward either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Analyzing ticket content**\n\nThe phrase \"link working takes please copy link button screen per example\" suggests there\u2019s a UI issue\u2014specifically, a link that isn't functioning properly. I'm considering that \"Miscellaneous\" might not be the best fit, while \"Internal Project\" seems a bit more appropriate. The overall content is messy and unstructured, with repeated phrases about changing leads and IDs. This definitely feels like it\u2019s from a disorganized ticket that needs clarification and proper categorization.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe main details include repeated phrases like \"change distinct lead\" and requests to \"assign opportunity lead ID.\" There\u2019s also mention of a UI issue with a \"link working\" phrase, but other parts, like \"officer registered st floor registration vat social,\" seem extraneous. Overall, it's a request to modify a CRM lead workflow. I think \"Internal Project\" fits best as a category since it pertains to a feature request. I'll format my answer as a JSON object with the category property. \n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}  \n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
