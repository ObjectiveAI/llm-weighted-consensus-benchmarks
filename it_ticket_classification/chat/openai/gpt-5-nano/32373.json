This sounds like it\u2019s relating to application access or authorization. I\u2019m leaning towards the \"Access\" category, although \"Administrative rights\" could also fit if it pertains to admin privileges for that app.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"screen attached contain code\" suggests there's a code snippet involved. I believe \"Access\" would fit well for user access or permissions, and \"Administrative rights\" is a relevant subcategory too. If the ticket is specifically about granting admin rights, it should be classified as such. The mention of \"fulfillment rights\" could indicate permissions to fulfill orders, and I wonder if the \"oracle time app\" refers to \"Oracle Time and Labor.\" Ultimately, I should respond with a JSON object indicating the appropriate category.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe text mentions a \"screen attached contain code,\" indicating there's a code snippet involved. The phrase \"application connect app fill table July\" hints at potential development tasks. Given the user's request to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" I'm leaning towards classifying it as \"Access\" since it deals with permissions to connect to the app and fulfill rights. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if admin privileges are needed, the safer choice here seems to be \"Access.\" I'll keep it concise and output a JSON object with that category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
