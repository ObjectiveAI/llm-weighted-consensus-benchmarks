It mentions a completed starter form and requests help, which likely relates to onboarding. The phrases indicate it could be about access or administrative rights. I need to choose between the categories available, and given the focus on contractor forms and administration, I think \u201cAccess\u201d might be the most fitting category.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI'm looking at the categories like Access, Administrative rights, and HR Support. The mention of \"new starter contractor\" suggests it's about onboarding, and \"starter form complete\" implies it's related to access requests. The phrase hints at needing access to systems like Active Directory, which adds to the idea of provisioning access. Given the context, the best category seems to be \"Access,\" with \"Administrative rights\" as a close second, especially since it mentions an administration officer.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nFor this IT ticket about onboarding a new starter, I\u2019m deciding on the appropriate category. Since it revolves around access and form completion, \u201cAccess\u201d seems to fit best. Although I could consider routing to HR or Admin, the instruction suggests I should provide a single category. I need to respond with a JSON-like output for format consistency. So, I\u2019ll simply provide this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra text needed, just the category."
