The ticket discusses server configurations, static versus dynamic addresses, and requests for static addresses. It\u2019s not strictly hardware-related and is more about IP addressing and network setups. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the best fit, but \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" could also be considered.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for this IT ticket. \"Administrative rights\" comes to mind since it involves assigning static addresses, potentially requiring admin privileges. However, \"Internal Project\" also seems fitting, as the issue relates to server configurations within an IT project. The ticket is essentially a change request for static IPs for test servers, which could lean towards project-related tasks. It's tricky with only eight category options, but \"Internal Project\" might be the closest match.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe content of the ticket mentions assigning static addresses, indicating that it's a request for configuration rather than a rights issue. After considering the options, the best match for this request appears to be \"Internal Project,\" since it's related to server configuration changes in an ongoing project or infrastructure. I\u2019ll go ahead and format the response correctly as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. It\u2019s essential to stick to the structure they expect with no extra commentary."
