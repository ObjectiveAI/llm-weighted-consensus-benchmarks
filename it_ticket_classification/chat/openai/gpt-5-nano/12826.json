Given the repeated mention of \"communication specialists,\" this seems HR-related. However, it might also fall under \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" especially if it involves updating an address book or distribution list. Let's see what fits best!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the ticket content, which hints at adding \"communication specialists\" to an address list or distribution. That could fit under \"Access,\" since it involves user provisioning. \"Administrative rights\" might apply if it's about granting access as well. However, there's no mention of hardware, storage, or purchasing, and while it loosely references HR, it's not strictly HR-related. Given these factors, I\u2019m thinking \"Access\" would be the most fitting category, but \"Miscellaneous\" is an option too if I'm unsure.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI see that I need to categorize the IT ticket about adding communication specialists, which seems related to adding users to an address book or contact list. Since this involves provisioning and permissions, \"Access\" is the best fit. It doesn\u2019t seem to fall under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project.\" \n\nSo, I\u2019ll output the category in the required JSON format as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Including a brief note might be helpful, but the instructions mainly emphasize providing the category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
