The ticket talks about assigning extensions to meeting rooms and references managing Active Directory groups. It seems to involve access control, making \"Access\" the likely category. \"Administrative rights\" might be relevant too, but that sounds more about elevating permissions. Overall, \"Access\" is probably the most appropriate choice for this ticket.**Categorizing IT Tasks**\n\nThe tasks I\u2019m looking at seem to revolve around configuration, particularly around Active Directory, suggesting they relate to access control. The category \"Access\" feels most appropriate here. There\u2019s also a chance it could be \"Internal Project\" if it's about reconfiguring meeting room resources, but it leans more towards operational tasks involving meeting rooms and AD group memberships. I think \"Access\" is the best fit. I\u2019ll respond with just the JSON format requested.  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
