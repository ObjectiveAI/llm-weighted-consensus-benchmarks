I wonder if this relates to license management. The mention of \"leavers\" could connect to HR since it often refers to employees who have left. It seems like the ticket is primarily about disabling licenses for these leavers, which is common in IT. So, I should lean towards categorizing it as \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\"**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm thinking the best category for this IT ticket is \"Access\" since it deals with licenses being disabled, which impacts user access to systems. Alternatively, I could consider \"Administrative rights\" because disabling licenses is an admin action. However, \"HR Support\" seems relevant too, especially with the mention of \"leavers,\" which implies an offboarding process. Overall, I feel like \"Access\" is the best fit for this scenario, as it aligns with revoking access for leavers.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
