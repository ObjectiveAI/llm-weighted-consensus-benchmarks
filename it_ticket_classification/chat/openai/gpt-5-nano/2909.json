This looks like it fits best under the categories of \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" Considering the context, I think \"Purchase\" is the most appropriate category.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis ticket clearly relates to purchasing and logging allocation, so the best category seems to be \"Purchase,\" given it's about a new purchase order for a hardware item. Even though it's a headset, both \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase\" are separate categories in the list. The user asked me to categorize it, so I need to respond as per the guidelines: essentially, presenting this as a JSON object that signifies the category. \n\nSo, my output should be: \n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Outputting category schema**\n\nI need to follow the \"category\" schema, creating a JSON object where the key is \"category\" with a value from the enumerated options. Given that it's a task about purchasing and logging allocation, the most fitting category looks to be \"Purchase.\" I considered \"Hardware\" since it involves a Voyager headset, but the focus is more on the procurement process. Since the user specifically mentioned the purchase order and related tasks, my output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
