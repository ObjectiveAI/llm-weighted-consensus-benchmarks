I think the best fit for this ticket is \"HR Support,\" considering we're dealing with onboarding forms. I'll construct a JSON output specifying this category for clarity.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding how to categorize this IT ticket. The content mentions \"new starter\" and references in Colombia, suggesting it's about onboarding. Phrases like \"completed form\" and \"lead consultant joining\" indicate they need support for a new user. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply, it feels more aligned with \"HR Support.\" So, I\u2019ll stick with that for classification. I need to respond in JSON format as specified, ensuring it\u2019s exactly right!**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nI realize I should respond with a JSON object specifying the category as \"HR Support.\" The system's required format indicates that \"category\" should be a property inside a JSON object. I'll output it as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It\u2019s good to ensure I don\u2019t include any extra text, keeping it succinct and clear. Following the schema correctly is essential, so I'll represent it precisely as expected!"
