The phrasing might suggest they're seeking information about these teams. I think the \"Internal Project\" category fits best for this ticket.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe user's request mentions teams formed by members and a \"senior developer,\" suggesting they're asking for help with team creation. This points towards an internal project management action, making the \"Internal Project\" category the best fit. I briefly considered \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"HR Support,\" but they don't fit as well. \n\nI\u2019ll respond with a JSON formatted category object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It might also be a good idea to include some clarifying questions to ensure I fully understand their needs."
