The text mentions cables, a distributor, and solved issues, so I\u2019ll have to consider the provided categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the mention of cables and the request for a cable distributor, it seems like \u201cPurchase\u201d might be the most fitting category. I'll prepare a JSON-like output with the appropriate category.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing a message that includes phrases like \"solved issue\" and \"lead,\" which seem like internal notes. The text primarily revolves around cables, suggesting it relates more to hardware. I have to decide between the \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase\" categories since it addresses the procurement of cables. Given that it's about getting a distributor for cables, \"Purchase\" seems the right choice. Other categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"HR Support\" aren't relevant here, so I\u2019ll go with \"Purchase.\"{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}  \n\nI'm preparing the final output, which needs to be a JSON-like object specifying the category. Since the instructions indicate I should stick to the enumerated categories, I'm confirming that \"Purchase\" is the right choice here. The format is straightforward: it should simply read {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll keep it concise and avoid adding any extra text. Alright, let's deliver this!"
