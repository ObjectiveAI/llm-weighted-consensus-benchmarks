There's a user message that seems quite garbled but mentions an \u201coracle time issue,\u201d \u201cchange card,\u201d and \u201csubmitted for period mon dec.\u201d It looks like they tried submitting a timecard but encountered an error related to \u201ctask active expenditure item date.\u201d Overall, the issue revolves around Oracle time entry for a specific submission period and requesting help.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm trying to figure out the best category for this IT ticket, which revolves around timecard submission errors. The query asks for help and mentions \u201cexpenditure item\u201d and \u201ctask active.\u201d I\u2019m thinking \"HR Support\" could fit well since it relates to timesheet management. It doesn't seem like it\u2019s hardware, storage, or purchase-related. It looks clearly connected to timekeeping and payroll, so I\u2019d categorize it as HR Support, addressing the user's issue effectively.**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nI'm deciding between categorizing this ticket as \"HR Support\" or \"Internal Project.\" While \"Internal Project\" relates to project management, the message about \u201cbench\u201d and \u201ctask active expenditure item\u201d leans more towards HR and timekeeping issues. The user is asking for help rather than creating a task, so \"HR Support\" feels like the best fit. I'll format the final output as a JSON object: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}` to keep it clear and concise without any extra content."
