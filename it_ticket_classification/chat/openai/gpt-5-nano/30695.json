Since it talks about \"tester\" and hardware-related aspects, it looks like the best fit would be the \"Hardware\" category. I've got a clear direction here!**Categorizing IT Ticket Again**\n\nI\u2019m considering if the ticket might fit \"Internal Project\" since it involves hardware testing. However, looking closer, the content clearly relates to hardware tests for different models, so it\u2019s clearly a fit for the \"Hardware\" category. I need to respond with a JSON-like object, as instructed. The output should just include the category as a string. I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s just one line: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Let\u2019s get that done!"
