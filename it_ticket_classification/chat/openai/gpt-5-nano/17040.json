It could relate to \"Access\" for adding people to a mailing list or \"Administrative rights\" for modifying it. Alternatively, it might fall under \"Internal Project\" if it's related to project management. I'll choose the category that best aligns with these interpretations.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user said, \"add people to new list thursday pm,\" which suggests this could involve granting access or adding users to a distribution list for Thursday afternoon. It might fit into \"Access\" due to the nature of user access, but it could also be \"Administrative rights\" if it relates to permissions for modifying lists. Since the message is somewhat vague, it may even fall under \"Miscellaneous.\" I wonder if asking for clarification might help pinpoint the exact category.**Deciding on category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this as \"Access\" because it involves adding people to a new list, likely a distribution list for communication, with the mention of \"Thursday PM\" indicating a scheduled time. It doesn't fit categories like hardware, storage, purchase, or internal projects. So, adding to a list aligns well with access. I need to format this as a JSON response as per instructions. I\u2019ll ensure it\u2019s structured properly for easy parsing or display in an app.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
