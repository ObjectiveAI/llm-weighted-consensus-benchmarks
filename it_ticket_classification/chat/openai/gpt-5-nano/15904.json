The phrases mention items like \"monthly restart of the controller,\" \"downtime,\" and \"alerts,\" which suggest it's about system maintenance. It sounds like a request to schedule a controller reboot and notify teams. \n\nGiven the options, \"Hardware\" seems the closest fit since it relates to the controllers, but it's more about maintenance scheduling rather than a hardware issue. So, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\"**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nIt could potentially fit under \"Administrative rights\" if downtime scheduling is involved, but it's not about permissions. \"Internal Project\" might apply if it's part of a larger maintenance task. Ultimately, \"Hardware\" seems like the best choice since it concerns the monthly restart of the controller hardware. I'll format the output as a JSON object specifying the category. Here\u2019s the succinct response:\n\n{\"category\": \"Hardware\"}"
