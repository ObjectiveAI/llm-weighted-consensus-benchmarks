The closest options might be \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Internal Project\" typically refers to internal IT tasks, while \"Miscellaneous\" covers general software issues. Since the ticket involves problems with the time cards application, it seems more aligned with \"Internal Project.\" However, it could also reasonably be categorized as \"Miscellaneous\" given the nature of the software errors. I think \"Internal Project\" is a solid choice.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
