It seems they\u2019re experiencing difficulties in accessing the timekeeping system. Given the details, this doesn't relate to hardware and looks more like an access issue. I'll likely classify this ticket under the \"Access\" category since it concerns visibility and management rights within the time card system.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering whether to categorize this ticket as \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" It's primarily about visibility issues with time cards and the user's request to \"raise ticket\" and \"assign card.\" The mention of \"view blocked\" really suggests access restrictions in the application. Since this is related to login and permissions, I believe the best fit is \"Access.\" It seems to encompass the user\u2019s need for visibility and management rights for time cards.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm determining the right category for the ticket, and while \"Administrative rights\" could apply, it feels more like an access issue given the restricted view being mentioned. The standard IT classification would lean towards \"Access,\" which covers these kinds of permission issues effectively. I need to format the output as a JSON object, specifically: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to adhere to the expected style, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ll go with!**Finalizing Category Decision**\n\nI\u2019m considering the nuances here \u2014 while it could potentially fit into \"Miscellaneous\" because it's a somewhat messy ticket, I believe \"Access\" is the clearer choice given the issues at hand. This seems more straightforward and directly relates to permissions or visibility challenges. So, it feels right to stick with \"Access\" for categorization. Now, I\u2019m ready to deliver the response!"
