                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket based on a messy user text regarding a new starter named Cornel. They mention an \"administration officer,\" \"fill date,\" and \"template code created.\" This could fit several categories: \"Administrative rights,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Internal Project.\" Considering the context of onboarding a new starter, this ticket likely involves tasks related to provisioning accounts and access rights. I'll make sure to pick the most fitting category for clarity!**Interpreting onboarding context**\n\nThe phrase \"new starter\" indicates onboarding, with \"administration officer\" likely indicating the person responsible. However, the meaning behind \"nap code requested template code created\" is unclear. It might refer to an NPA or NAP code, but it\u2019s challenging to decipher. The request to \"fill date\" suggests someone created a template and needs updates. This could tie into \"Access\" for system permissions or \"Administrative rights\" for elevated access. For onboarding, category options like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" seem most relevant.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nSince this is about onboarding a new starter, I suspect \"HR Support\" isn't the correct category to choose. The term \"administration officer\" likely refers to someone handling admin or HR tasks. We might need to clarify, but since the user expects a categorized response, I think the best fit is \"Access.\" This is because the phrases about \"new starter,\" \"code requested,\" and \"template code created\" suggest access provisioning. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Formatting JSON for response**\n\nI see that the instruction specifies a category format in JSON: it mentions \u201ccategory\u201d as a string with specific enum options. We need to respond with a JSON object containing just the category field. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and respond with {\"category\":\"Access\"} as that fits best. While a brief justification might be useful, the instructions focus on the JSON response. Therefore, my final answer will be precisely: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
