Given the context, I\u2019ll consider relevant categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, or Internal Project to find the best fit.**Evaluating ticket categorization**\n\nThe phrase \"add to pm friday\" likely points to a request related to a Project Management meeting on Friday. However, \"PM\" could also refer to \"Power Manager\" or something else. Without clearer context, the most fitting categories appear to be \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project.\" If this is about permission management, \"Access\" could be appropriate. I need to format the response in JSON, selecting the best category like \"Access.\u201d**Determining the right category**\n\nIf this request is about adding someone to a Project Management list or schedule for Friday, it likely falls under \"Access\" because it seems related to granting permissions. The categories include \"Administrative rights\" for specific admin privileges, so it may not be the best fit. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" for general access requests. However, if it\u2019s indeed about a meeting, \"Internal Project\" could also be relevant, though it's typically for internal project tasks. I need to clarify the category structure!**Choosing the category for the ticket**\n\nThe user's request to schedule \"PM Friday\" could imply it's about an Internal Project or possibly Administrative rights if they're adding someone to project management. However, since the instructions clearly ask to categorize the IT ticket, I'll go with \"Access\" because it relates to granting permissions or adding someone to the PM group. The phrase \"please add pm\" suggests a request for access. I'll format my answer as required in JSON: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
