It seems to touch on adding to a mailbox that's full, possibly indicating an email storage problem. There are various categories to choose from, like Storage, Access, or Administrative rights. I'll focus on the mailbox's storage nature, so it might fit best under Storage. This requires careful consideration because the message is quite messy and unclear overall.**Categorizing Mailbox IT Ticket**\n\nFor this IT ticket, I see that \"mailbox full\" signals a storage issue, so I should categorize it as \"Storage.\" The mention of \"shared mailbox\" could also imply an access-related request to grant permissions. However, the choice between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" is tricky since both deal with permissions. The message is quite jumbled, but it seems to be a request about the mailbox full on Tuesday PM and adding a shared mailbox. I need to finalize the categorization!**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nIt looks like categorizing the IT ticket as \"Storage\" is the safest choice since \"mailbox full\" indicates a storage issue. According to the instructions, I need to provide this as a JSON object in the specified format. I\u2019m thinking I'll finalize it as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. While I could add a brief explanation, the guidelines say to stick to just the category object. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and output only the JSON."
