They\u2019re requesting the location of this storage video. I\u2019m considering categorizing this as either \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since the content mentions \"access\" and \"location,\" I think \"Access\" might be the most appropriate category here.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that this could fit into the \"Storage\" category since the user mentions a storage location. However, they also want access to the resource, which suggests the \"Access\" category as the primary choice. The phrase \"location storage video\" indicates they\u2019re looking for that specific location. Since the system expects a single category, and given that it's primarily about user access, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" to align with typical IT ticket routing.**Interpreting IT ticket request**\n\nI\u2019m interpreting the ticket: it asks for access to a resource and specifically for the location of a storage video. The mention of \"friday pm\" might indicate a due date. The request centers on \"access to resource,\" suggesting this falls into the \"Access\" category. I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Access,\" as it aligns with the core of their request. Following the format guidelines, I'll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let\u2019s finalize that."
