They seem to be asking for a list of IT devices in Belgrade and requesting to order those devices, while also mentioning asset locations. It sounds like their main action revolves around ordering assets. Given this context, the best category for this ticket would be \"Purchase,\" as it clearly involves purchasing hardware or related items.**Deciding on Category Format**\n\nI'm considering categorizing this IT ticket as \"Hardware,\" since it mentions devices. However, since the focus is on ordering assets, \"Purchase\" fits better. I\u2019ll finalize the response as a JSON object that specifies the category. The prompt indicates that I should categorize the ticket in a specific format, so I'll keep it concise without extra commentary. I\u2019ll respond with a clear JSON-like structure: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
