Based on the description, it seems like the issue relates to authentication and repeated prompts for credentials. The best category appears to be \"Access,\" as it aligns with login credentials problems. Some organizations even include \"Email/Outlook Sign-in Issues\" under Access. I\u2019ll respond with the category, likely in a straightforward format like a simple string or JSON object for clarity.**Formatting the response**\n\nThe required output format is a JSON object with a \"category\" field. Following the schema, I'll respond with {\"category\":\"Access\"} since that fits the issue described. I need to be cautious about punctuation and ensure it matches the exact requirements. Asking clarifying questions might be helpful, but since the user asked for categorization, I can focus on just providing the category. I'll finalize the response strictly as the JSON object with no extra text. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
