It might seem like it could go under \"Access,\" but that's usually about login and access control, and this ticket is focused on modifying forms and correcting errors.

Since the user asked for a category, I\u2019ll default to \"Miscellaneous.\" I need to format my response as a JSON object with the category specified.  \n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
