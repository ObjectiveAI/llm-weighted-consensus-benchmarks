The ticket mentions \"survey results,\" \"daily survey results,\" and \"dashboard,\" which suggests it's related to an internal project rather than hardware or access issues. The unclear section about \"log snow\" might be additional context but doesn\u2019t strongly steer the ticket into any specific category. So, I'll categorize this as \"Internal Project\" and format the response as a JSON object. I\u2019ll make sure to follow the required format!**Choosing a Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket related to a dashboard tool, data import, and monitoring survey results until November. None of the available categories really fit, like \"IT Operations\" or \"Data.\" The best matches seem to be \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it\u2019s about monitoring daily survey responses, it might lean towards \"Internal Project,\" but it\u2019s unclear. \"Miscellaneous\" looks like the safest choice here as a catch-all, considering it doesn't fall within the other specific categories.**Creating JSON Output**\n\nI'm ready to finalize my response by creating a JSON object. The category will be \"Miscellaneous,\" and I want to ensure I format it correctly. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I\u2019m making sure not to add any extra text; I just want it to be clear and straightforward. So, let's go ahead and provide that JSON!"
