There are several categories to choose from: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nBased on the ticket text, it seems to relate to accessing codes and possibly systems. My best guess is that it fits in the Access category, but it might also relate to Internal Project or Administrative rights because of the context.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user brings up that they receive hundreds of tickets daily, emphasizing urgency and impact, particularly for high-impact, high-urgency tickets. The ticket content could involve requests to perform a revert or access code issues, which isn't very clear. Given the context, I think the best category would be Access since it includes help with accessing codes. Alternatively, it could fit as Internal Project if it relates to project-specific codes, but Access still seems most appropriate. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object categorizing it as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
