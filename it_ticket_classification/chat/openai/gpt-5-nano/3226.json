It's mentioning terms like \"career coaching\", \"maternity\", and \"member return\" for someone coming back in December. Based on the provided categories, I think this could be an HR Support ticket since it deals with maternity leave and employee return. There\u2019s also a slight possibility of it being related to Access if they're asking for certain rights or permissions.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nFor this IT ticket, \u201cHR Support\u201d seems like the most appropriate category since it deals with personnel changes, like maternity leave and a return to work. There are also potential IT-related aspects like adjusting user status or permissions, which might fit \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d However, given the content is a bit messy and primarily focused on employee status, I think categorizing it as \"HR Support\" makes the most sense. I\u2019ll format the output to match the required structure.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI think I\u2019m settling on \"HR Support\" for this IT ticket since it mostly deals with maternity and career coaching. While there\u2019s an element of \"Access,\" it feels like HR is the main focus here. The categories provided allow \"HR Support,\" and since there\u2019s no specific \"People Ops\" option, that makes the most sense. Now I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object to match the required structure and deliver that to the user directly."
