They mentioned being unable to log into an admin account after a recent password reset, which suggests it's about access or possibly administrative rights. Since they\u2019re facing difficulties logging in, it really sounds like an \"Access\" issue is most appropriate, rather than just administrative rights. I want to ensure I categorize this correctly to help them resolve their problem quickly.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket based on the provided options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the focus on accessing an admin account, it seems most fitting to categorize it as \"Access\" since the primary issue is the user's inability to log in after a password reset. However, because it involves admin rights, I could consider \"Administrative rights\" too. I\u2019ll decide on \"Access\" for the JSON format output: {\"category\":{\"category\":\"Access\"}}.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe \"Administrative rights\" category typically relates to managing admin privileges, but this situation is more focused on a login issue with the admin account. I think \"Access\" is the best fit here, since the user is having trouble logging in. They've even mentioned accessing the account via mobile, which reinforces the access aspect. So, I just need to output the correct JSON category object without any extra text. I\u2019ll finalize it as: {\"category\":{\"category\":\"Access\"}}."
