The mention of \"lead\" could refer to a person or a role, but given the context and the user's instruction to categorize the IT Ticket, I should respond with a JSON object that fits the required format.**Deciding on Category**\n\nI need to determine the right category for a message that seems odd, mentioning something about an attached file that \"looks harmless.\" It could suggest a suspicious email or malware because there\u2019s no specific \"Security\" category available. So if I have to make a choice, I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous\" as a generic option. I\u2019ll format my response strictly as a JSON object, making sure to use the correct casing for \"Miscellaneous.\" Here's the output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
