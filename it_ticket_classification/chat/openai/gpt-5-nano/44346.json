This will help streamline the ticket handling process effectively.**Analyzing IT ticket content**\n\nThe content discusses notifications and a change request (CR) related to system notifications and the change management process. It mentions terms like \"rejection,\" \"resubmitted for authorization,\" and \"pre-production,\" which are all IT operations rather than hardware or storage issues. Since it doesn\u2019t clearly fit into specific categories, it may be best classified as \"Miscellaneous.\" The options are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights, but this seems less about access rights.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket seems focused on software processes involving change request notifications, authorization, and production environments. I could categorize it as \"Internal Project\" because it relates to a project. However, since there\u2019s also a mention of incident management, it could fit under \"Miscellaneous\" if I'm unsure. \"Administrative rights\" might be applicable, but it doesn\u2019t appear to focus solely on access rights. Overall, \"Internal Project\" probably fits best given the context of change management.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe text references \"log ticket,\" \"notification for CR,\" and \"re-submission for authorization,\" which relate to change management and deployment processes. It seems to focus on operations like cloning to pre-production. Given this context, \"Internal Project\" appears to be the most suitable category. While \"Administrative rights\" could be considered, it doesn't seem necessary here. Following this, I\u2019ll present the response as a JSON object with the category clearly stated. So, I'll format it like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
