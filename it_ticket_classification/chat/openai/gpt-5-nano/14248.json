The ticket could fall under \"Access\" for deactivating an access card, but it might also concern \"HR Support\" related to the leaver process. Since the key task is about issuing or revoking access, \"Access\" seems to fit best.**Categorizing ticket as JSON**\n\nI\u2019m considering if this ticket could be categorized as \"Administrative rights\" since it might involve rights, but \"Access card\" is clearly the main focus here. I think the best fit remains \"Access.\" \n\nThe output should be a JSON object structured with the category key. The system instruction specifies to respond with just the category. So, I'll format the response as {\"category\": \"Access\"}. I\u2019ll keep it concise and deliver just the JSON as instructed."
