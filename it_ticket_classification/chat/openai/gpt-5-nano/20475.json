The ticket text is quite garbled but mentions \u201cnew starter,\u201d \u201cequipment,\u201d and \u201cadministration officer,\u201d which suggests it relates to onboarding. It could fit under \"HR Support\" for onboarding assistance or \"Administrative rights,\" but it also mentions hardware like a large screen and phone. I need to find the most appropriate category based on all these clues.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI have to categorize an IT ticket that mentions onboarding forms and equipment provisioning like a large screen and phone. The categories available are \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support,\" among others. It leans toward \"Hardware\" for the equipment request, but \"HR Support\" is relevant for the onboarding forms. Since the ticket explicitly asks for hardware, \"Hardware\" might be the best single category. However, it does reference HR processes. Overall, I think \"Hardware\" is the most fitting choice for the JSON output.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nThe content refers to hardware provisioning, specifically mentioning \"please assigned large screen also phone equipment.\" So, it makes sense to categorize this as \"Hardware.\" I'll ensure to deliver the output strictly in the specified JSON format without extra commentary. That's key for clarity. \n\nHere\u2019s how it will look: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I'll keep it simple and direct!"
