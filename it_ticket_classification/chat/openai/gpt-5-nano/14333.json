This seems HR-related, so the most fitting category appears to be \"HR Support.\" However, considering it might also involve setting up access or user accounts, there's a possibility for categories like Access or Administrative rights, too.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe categories include \"HR Support,\" which fits since the ticket mentions \"new starter Bucharest.\" There\u2019s also the \"Administrative rights\" category if access is needed, but \"Access\" is another option. There's no \"Onboarding\" category listed. The phrase \"please fill date\" likely refers to the start date for the new employee, and HR would typically manage that. Since the request is to fill in that date, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" I'll format my response as a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
