Based on multiple mentions of \"purchase order requisition implemented\" and references to Galaxy phone models, it clearly fits the \"Purchase\" category. While I briefly considered whether it could fall under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" those don't seem likely. I'll respond with the required JSON format, simply categorizing it as \"Purchase.\" So, my output will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. No extra explanation needed!**Finalizing output**\n\nI need to provide the output in a specific format as requested. The prompt indicates I should categorize the IT ticket and summarize it as a single JSON object. Based on the schema provided, it seems my response should strictly have a \"category\" field. So, I'll follow that instruction precisely and output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It's straightforward, and I'm confident this will meet the requirements without any extra details!"
