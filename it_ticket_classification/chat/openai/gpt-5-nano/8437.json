The mention of \"annual leave issues\" fits into the \"HR Support\" category, but since they might also need access rights to the Oracle system, \"Access\" could be relevant too. I'll lean toward categorizing this as \"HR Support.\"**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI think the best choice for categorizing this IT ticket is \"HR Support,\" since it involves leave requests related to the HR system, Oracle. The user's request to \"insert these days annual leave\" indicates administrative action needed within that system. I need to format my response as a JSON object. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. \n\nI'll double-check that \"HR Support\" is correctly listed in the category options. The prompt specifies just providing the category, but a brief rationale might be helpful."
