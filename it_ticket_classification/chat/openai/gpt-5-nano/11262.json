The ticket discusses a new project code for internal communication, which seems to focus on tracking budget and managing resources. Given the mention of budget consumption and project tracking, it looks like the best category is \"Internal Project.\" That seems to fit the content well!**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Access,\" but it seems to fit \"Internal Project\" better since it's about creating project codes and tracking budgets. I should provide a category with a brief justification, possibly suggesting next steps like escalating it to project management or IT admins and confirming the need for code creation. The output format requires a category JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. So, I'll return just the JSON string as the response!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
