It seems to fit best under \"Access\" or possibly \"Administrative rights,\" especially since they need full access to hidden documents. Maybe \"Storage\" could work if it\u2019s about retrieval, but the main focus is on document access rights.**Categorizing IT request**\n\nThe user is requesting access to secured documents from a hidden library site, indicating they need full access. I think the most fitting category for this IT ticket would be \"Access,\" considering it's primarily about gaining access to documents. Although \"Administrative rights\" could work if the request is focused on granting permissions. Since the instruction is to categorize this ticket, I need to respond with a JSON object, ensuring it follows the provided schema with the appropriate category.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for the user's IT ticket, which is about accessing resources. It looks like \"Access\" is the most fitting choice since they\u2019re requesting access to documents. There\u2019s also mention of \"invisible docs\" and old search results, which could hint at a \"Storage\" issue, but the key action is about granting access. Categories are somewhat broad, but I think \"Access\" makes the most sense. So, I\u2019ll prepare the JSON response as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
