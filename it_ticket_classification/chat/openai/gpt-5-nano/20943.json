However, the safest choice is \"Hardware\" since typical IT tickets for equipment are categorized that way. The added details about time and location don\u2019t change the category.**Outputting JSON for IT ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, so I\u2019ll need to output a JSON object following the required schema. According to the schema, I can categorize it as \"Hardware\" since that's the most fitting category for an extension cord. Though \u201cpm center va\u201d might suggest a location or \u201cAccess,\u201d I\u2019ve determined that \u201cHardware\u201d is definitely the correct choice. Now, I\u2019ll provide the final JSON output without extra commentary.  \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
