They mentioned a wrong line manager and asked for an update. According to the provided category schema, this seems to fit under \"HR Support,\" since it relates to an HR data update. The other potential categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" might also be relevant, but \"HR Support\" seems most appropriate here. I'll format this in JSON.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket that involves changing the line manager in the Oracle system. This task is more about data accuracy related to HR rather than hardware, storage, or purchases. While \"Access\" might imply permissions, it's really about updating employee data, which fits best under \"HR Support.\" I'll finalize the response in the required JSON format with the category specified.
