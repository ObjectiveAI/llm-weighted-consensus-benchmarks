There are Romanian phrases mixed in that talk about timecard submission failures and processes that should be followed weekly. It mentions specific dates and warns that if submissions are delayed, the manager will be notified. The issue is clearly about not following the established timecard submission process, affecting approvals for the user's timecards.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to classify the IT ticket into one of the specific categories provided, like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. Given that this ticket concerns a failure in timecard submission and HR-related processes, it seems appropriate to categorize it as \"HR Support.\" The format requires a JSON object with just the category field. So, my response will accurately follow the required structure and look like: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It\u2019s straightforward, and the system allows this formatting.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
