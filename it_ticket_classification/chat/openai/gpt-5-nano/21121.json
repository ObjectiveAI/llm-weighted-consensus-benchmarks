It sounds like they want to manage attendance for a planning meeting, but it's a bit unclear. The categories available are \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and others. \"Access\" seems most fitting since it's about accessing planning. Though \"Administrative rights\" could work, it feels too specific. I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" for now, as it matches the request.**Deciding on Category**\n\nI\u2019m wrestling with how to best categorize an IT ticket regarding access to planning. The user\u2019s phrasing suggests they want access to a planning document or calendar, so \"Access\" fits well. While \"Internal Project\" could be a consideration, it doesn\u2019t capture the essence of what they need. I should respond with a JSON-like object showing this category as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and avoid adding anything unnecessary."
