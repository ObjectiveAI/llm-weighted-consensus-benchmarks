The text mentions key phrases like \"mobile device,\" \"assigned,\" and \"requisition,\" suggesting it's related to procurement. I see two primary categories that could fit: \"Hardware,\" which pertains to assets, and \"Purchase,\" which aligns with procurement processes. Given the context, \"Purchase\" seems the most suitable choice for this ticket. I'll prepare to return the appropriate JSON-like category response.**Determining JSON Output**\n\nI've got a schema that outlines how to categorize an IT ticket, focusing on the \"category\" field with options like \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" The ticket talks about a \"mobile device,\" which could relate to hardware, but the mention of \"raised requisition\" suggests procurement too. Given that it's primarily about assigning a mobile device, the best fit is \"Hardware.\" I'll respond with the required JSON format: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}` and include a concise line: \"Category: Hardware\" for clarity."
