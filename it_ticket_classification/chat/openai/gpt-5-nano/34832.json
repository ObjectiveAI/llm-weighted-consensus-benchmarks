The description points to a problem with connecting devices and using a speaker, which suggests it's primarily a hardware issue. It could fit either the \"Hardware\" or \"Miscellaneous\" categories, but since it\u2019s specifically about the meeting room equipment, the \"Hardware\" category seems to be the best match for this ticket.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object using the specified format for categorizing the IT Ticket. The instructions clearly outline that I should only include the \"category\" field with one of the allowed values, like \"Hardware.\" Given that the ticket mentions issues with devices in a meeting room, it\u2019s reasonable to classify it as \"Hardware\" because it involves physical equipment like cables and speakers. I'll output just the JSON object without any extra text: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
