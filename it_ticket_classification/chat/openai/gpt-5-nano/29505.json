The ticket seems to focus on migrating a site and involves transferring files and editing rights. It mentions important tasks like closing down the old site, a two-week deadline, and guidelines for uploading files. Considering all this, it sounds like it fits best under \"Access\" or \"Internal Project.\" I'll take a closer look at the details to confirm.**Categorizing Site Migration Request**\n\nThis request appears to involve moving site content, closing down an old site, transferring files, and managing permissions. I need to determine which category fits best from the options provided: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the ticket addresses editing rights and uploading files, \"Administrative rights\" seems to be the most appropriate choice. I'll categorize this IT ticket under \"Administrative rights\" and prepare the JSON response accordingly."
