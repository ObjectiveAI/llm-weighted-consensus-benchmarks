The user's text talks about connection problems, like not connecting, connection timeouts, and resets. It seems related to network connectivity issues, which suggests it might fall under \"Access\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it mentions accessing a service, I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category. It directly relates to their issue of not connecting. I'll go with that!**Formatting IT ticket category**\n\nI think I need to categorize the IT ticket as \"Access\" because the user's issue seems to relate to connection problems, possibly due to a network failure. The instructions require a JSON format output specifying this category. I get that I have to respond with a JSON object, specifically with a \"category\" key. So, my final output should simply be: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I'll just stick to the format specified and make sure it fits the requirements!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
