I could consider categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Purchase,\" or \"Storage.\" Since there\u2019s a focus on mapping and receipts, it appears more related to accounts payable rather than hardware. I'll work on pinpointing the most appropriate category here.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the provided text. Options include \"Administrative Rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Storage.\" Since the text mentions changing mappings and receipts, it could relate to an internal project, but generically, \"Miscellaneous\" feels more applicable here. It\u2019s not about hardware or access issues. I\u2019ll output a JSON object with \"Miscellaneous\" as the category since it best captures the essence of the user's request.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
