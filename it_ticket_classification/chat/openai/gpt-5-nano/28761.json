Since onboarding and offboarding often involve managing access, those categories might be the best fits here. I'll take a closer look, but it feels like it broadly fits under Access or Administrative rights.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think the ticket likely falls under the \"Access\" category since it involves accounts, access management, and tasks related to offboarding. Phrases like \"check list for leavers\" suggest it\u2019s about disabling accounts and revoking access. The mention of \"link code holidays\" is a bit unclear, but it might connect to managing permissions for someone who has left or moved departments. Overall, \"Access\" feels like the most fitting category here, especially with the focus on managing system access for departing staff.**Formatting response in JSON**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object, specifically setting the category field to \"Access.\" Since the prompt is about categorizing an IT ticket, the output format needs to be strictly JSON. I'll craft it as {\"category\":\"Access\"} to match the required structure. I just need to ensure that it's valid JSON without any extra text. So, I\u2019ll finalize it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's stick with that format!"
