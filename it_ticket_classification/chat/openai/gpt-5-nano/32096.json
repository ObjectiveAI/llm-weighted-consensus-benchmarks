That makes me think this falls under \"Storage\" due to the large file size issues. The text doesn't fit neatly into other categories, but this seems like the best option!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThis user's issue revolves around attachments that are too large. They want to save files in a more manageable size, which hints at a need for compression. I\u2019m considering whether it fits under \"Storage\" or \"Administrative rights\" if they need permission for the software. I think \"Storage\" makes sense, as it deals with file sizes. Ultimately, since they want to compress files, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Storage\" for clarity.**Formatting the output**\n\nI'm realizing the required output is a JSON-like object for categorizing this IT ticket based on the prompt. The categories available are clearly listed, and the expected format includes specific capitalization, which I need to adhere to.\n\nSo, I should generate the JSON object simply as {\"category\":\"Storage\"} to keep it straightforward without additional text. Although I wonder if I should ask clarifying questions or suggest next steps, the user specifically asked for categorization. I'll stick with just providing the JSON as requested."
