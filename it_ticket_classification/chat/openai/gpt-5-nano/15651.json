The request suggests it could fall under categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It's likely about permission issues since it mentions not finding a way to delete it. Given that it's a request about access to perform a task, I'll lean towards \"Administrative rights.\" However, I might also consider \"Miscellaneous\" if I'm unsure.**Formatting response for ticket**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket and respond in a JSON format. The user asked for a category, and based on prior tasks, I should respond with a key for \"category.\" Following instructions, the proper response should be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to format it correctly and only include that information, without any extra details. That keeps it clean and straightforward!"
