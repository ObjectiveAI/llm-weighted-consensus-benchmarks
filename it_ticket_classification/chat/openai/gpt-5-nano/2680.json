It seems like it relates to setup for an internal event, so I should consider categories like \"Hardware\" or possibly \"Internal Project.\" The mention of technical support indicates it's not just a miscellaneous request. I'll focus on finding the best fit from the provided categories.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket relates to audio-visual equipment for an all-hands event, focusing on sound, projectors, and TV streaming. It seems like a hardware issue. Given it's an internal event, \"Internal Project\" might fit, but the primary concern appears to be IT support for setting up technical details. \"Hardware\" seems to be the best category. The correct JSON response should be structured with the category field as \"Hardware.\" So, we will respond with it formatted as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
