The terms mentioned, such as \"code setup\" and \"project code setup,\" suggest it could be related to \"Access\" for permissions or \"Internal Project\" since it seems like a developer setup request. There's also the phrase \"create attached code,\" which could indicate some project-related work. Overall, it appears best classified under \"Internal Project.\"**Parsing IT ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket text, which notably repeats \"project code setup\" and includes phrases about setting up code. There are no mentions of hardware, storage, purchase, or HR, so those can be ruled out. While \"Access\" could be considered if it involved permissions, it doesn\u2019t explicitly mention that. \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit since it\u2019s focused on setting up project codes. It makes sense to categorize it simply as \"Internal Project\" in the required JSON format."
