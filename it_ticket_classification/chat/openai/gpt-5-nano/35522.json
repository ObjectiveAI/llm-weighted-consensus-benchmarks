If it's an internal application, \"Internal Project\" could fit. \"Administrative rights\" might work if it\u2019s about permissions, but that doesn't seem right here. \u201cAccess\u201d seems more accurate since it's related to a submission error rather than a login issue. \"Miscellaneous\" serves as a safe filler for issues that don't neatly categorize. I think the best fit might be \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\"**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket regarding an Oracle submission issue. If it\u2019s part of an internal project, \"Internal Project\" seems like a good fit, rather than \"Miscellaneous.\" The user requested a category, so I should produce a JSON structure with my choice. While \"Miscellaneous\" could serve as a default, I want to be more helpful. I could suggest \"Internal Project\" as the category since it involves an Oracle integration error related to holidays being automatically added.**Categorizing the ticket clearly**\n\nI\u2019m considering the categories, and \"Internal Project\" seems fitting for this Oracle submission issue since it\u2019s related to internal development. The mention of \"regards developer\" suggests a sign-off, indicating it's from someone involved with this task. The phrase \"public holidays automatically added\" hints at a payroll or calendar integration issue. Given these clues, I think categorizing this as an \"Internal Project\" fits best. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Outputting as a JSON object**\n\nI see that the prompt specifies a JSON object for the output, so I should stick to that format. Just to be safe, I\u2019ll create an object with \"category\": \"Internal Project.\" It seems the code might be expecting this format rather than just a string. While the prompt doesn\u2019t require an explanation, I think adding a brief note is helpful: \u201cReason: mentions Oracle submission issue in an internal project.\u201d I'll go ahead and present: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let's proceed!"
