I think proposing \"Miscellaneous\" as a default category is a good starting point, plus I can provide some rationales. I should also offer alternative suggestions and ask for their confirmation. I'll respond with a JSON format, such as {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}, while making sure it aligns with the allowed categories. If necessary, \"Internal Project\" might fit in certain contexts too.**Categorizing access requests**\n\nIt seems like \"Access\" might fit if the user is talking about logging in or granting calendar access. Given the phrase \"log meeting invite,\" they're likely wanting to record that invitation in a system. However, since there\u2019s no specific \"Calendar\" category, \"Access\" feels the closest for a permission-related task. The content of the ticket might be messy, so I'll categorize by best fit and suggest \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll format it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Formatting category response**\n\nI have to finalize my response as a JSON object with a key \"category\" set to \"Miscellaneous.\" The ticket text is pretty unclear, so categorizing it as Miscellaneous seems fitting for a vague data organization request. While I wonder if I should include a brief note explaining my choice, the instructions primarily require just the JSON format. Since the system might only need to parse the JSON, I'll stick to the clear and safe option and respond with: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
