The text provided seems to highlight tasks related to adding new members and dealing with PM forms and rights. \n\nGiven the options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights, this content likely fits under HR Support, as it relates to new members and their rights. I'll prepare a JSON object with the appropriate category.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket. The text mentions \"new members for Friday PM,\" which implies adding access for those members. There\u2019s also a focus on \"members rights,\" which could point towards the \"Access\" category. However, since there's a specific mention of \"document members rights,\" it might fit better under \"Administrative rights,\" which is more precise. While \"PM forms\" makes me think of project management, it doesn't seem to fit as well.**Choosing the category for the ticket**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to determine the best fit. The phrase \"new members for Friday PM\" suggests adding members for a session, and mentions of \"members rights\" indicate a focus on access. While \"Administrative rights\" could be a contender because of the provisioning aspect, the content leans more towards general access. Therefore, I'll categorize it as \"Access,\" since it aligns well with adding members and their rights.**Deciding on the category**\n\nThe phrase \"members rights\" hints at access management. Since the user asked to categorize an IT ticket, I need to choose between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Adding members typically relates to access management, while \"Administrative rights\" suggests granting admin privileges. Given the user\u2019s focus on \"completing a document for members\u2019 rights,\" the ticket revolves around adding new members and ensuring access. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and prepare the JSON output accordingly.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
