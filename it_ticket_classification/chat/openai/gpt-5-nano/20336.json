I'm parsing it to find the right category.**Interpreting IT ticket content**\n\nI\u2019m trying to decipher what the user means. \"PAS\" might stand for \"password,\" and they could want to add it to Oracle. The \"pm\" suggests afternoon, and phrases like \"make myself code\" hint they're looking to create a code. \"Client mob\" might refer to \"mobile.\" It feels messy, but it looks like they want access to something. Given this, I think it\u2019s best to categorize it under Access, though Internal Project or Miscellaneous could also fit.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nThe content says \"oracle pas add to Thursday February PM.\" It might lean more toward scheduling, but there's mention of \"add,\" \"code,\" and \"regards client mob,\" which makes me think it could be related to \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" The Access category seems to fit best. I\u2019ll prepare the response in the required JSON format as {\"category\":\"Access\"} since that aligns with the instructions for categorization. I'll stick to providing just the category in the response."
