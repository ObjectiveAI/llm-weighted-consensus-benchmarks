They mention \"reports,\" \"trying to generate,\" and \"receiving error,\" likely indicating a problem with generating reports. This ticket could fall under \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or perhaps \"Administrative rights\" if it's about permissions related to report submissions. However, it doesn't seem to relate to hardware, storage, or purchase issues. Let's clarify the categorization!**Deciding category for IT ticket**\n\nThe user's message doesn\u2019t mention permissions, but I\u2019m considering categorizing it as \u201cInternal Project\u201d since it involves a report. It could also fit under \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d as a general IT issue, or perhaps \u201cAccess\u201d if it pertains to access rights to reports, even though they haven't stated access issues explicitly. Given that they need help with generating monthly reports due tomorrow, I think \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is the safest choice. I\u2019ll structure my response as a JSON object.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
