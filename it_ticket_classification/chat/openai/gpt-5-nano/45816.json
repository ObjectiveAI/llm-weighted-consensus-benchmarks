Since the ticket pertains to annual leave, it seems most appropriate to classify it under \"HR Support.\" It looks like it's about an issue with the HR system rather than IT hardware or access issues.**Classifying an IT issue**\n\nThe user mentions an issue with receiving duplicate annual leave requests. It seems there might be a problem with a workflow or automation that's causing these duplicates. This looks like an issue related to an HR system, so I\u2019m considering the categories: \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and potentially others, but \"HR Support\" feels most fitting since it deals with HR processes. This is definitely an IT ticket, so classifying it under \"HR Support\" makes sense.**Providing category in JSON**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket using available options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" From the user's description of the issue, it seems like this is primarily about HR processes, so \"HR Support\" fits best. I\u2019ll prepare the response in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. While \"Access\" could be a consideration due to mention of assignments, \"HR Support\" remains the most accurate classification based on the ticket content.**Delivering category in JSON**\n\nThe most fitting category for this IT ticket is \"HR Support,\" so I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format. I\u2019ll provide {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} as it's straightforward and accurate for the situation. There\u2019s no need for extra text here; the user is looking for a clear categorization. I\u2019m ready to deliver this response!"
