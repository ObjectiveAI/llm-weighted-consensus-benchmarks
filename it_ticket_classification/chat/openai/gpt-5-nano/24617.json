The user provided a lengthy message that's mainly about onboarding interns, including mentions of contracts, forms, and access. Given its content, the most fitting categories seem to be \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I wonder if it could also fall under \"Access\" if it pertains to system access for interns.**Categorizing Intern Ticket**\n\nI see mentions of ensuring access, creating accounts, and drafting contracts for interns in this IT ticket. It seems to be about provisioning intern accounts and possibly ordering devices, which hints at IT-related tasks. While categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative Rights\" fit, \"HR Support\" feels most appropriate since the focus is on onboarding interns, contracts, and training. Given that the user explicitly asked for categorization, I should clearly assign it to one of the specified categories.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
