So, the best category for this would probably be \u201cHardware,\u201d since it's about a physical device that\u2019s not functioning correctly.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the ticket category, which could fit under \"Access\" since it relates to access control and doors. But it might also qualify as \"Hardware\" due to the card reader device issue. Since the focus seems to be on access control, \"Access\" feels like the best choice. The instructions suggest I output a structured JSON object. So, I should provide this: {\"category\":\"Access\"} to keep it concise and properly formatted!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
