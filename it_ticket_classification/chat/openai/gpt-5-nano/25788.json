The allowed categories include \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights.\" The issue seems related to software performance rather than hardware. It could fit under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project,\" but there's no explicit access request. None of the categories perfectly fit this software-related issue.**Selecting the right category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out the best category for an IT ticket regarding performance issues with \"upgrade caddy.\" \u201cInternal Project\u201d could work for internal tooling tasks, while \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d feels broader. \"Purchase\", \"Storage\", \"Hardware\", and \"Access\" don't seem to apply. The mention of logging an upgrade implies they might need admin rights, but the central issue is performance (freezing and slowness). It seems like \"Internal Project\" might be the best choice if it relates to the Caddy upgrade.**Choosing a category for the ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"upgrade caddy\" several times, with the user asking to log this upgrade. It doesn\u2019t seem like a help request, but rather a request to log a task. The performance issue\u2014constantly freezing and running slowly\u2014needs attention. With no specific category for software issues, \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d seems like a broad fallback. However, \"Internal Project\" could also fit since it relates to upgrading Caddy, which sounds like part of an internal initiative.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
