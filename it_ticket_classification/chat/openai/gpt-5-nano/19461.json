The category options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. This ticket likely relates to documentation review, possibly needing access, but it doesn\u2019t explicitly mention that. It seems best to classify it as \"Internal Project\" since it involves reviewing a document in Confluence.**Selecting IT ticket category**\n\nI'm trying to determine the best category for the IT ticket, considering it relates to a document review. It could fit under \"Internal Project,\" which involves internal tasks, but \"Miscellaneous\" is also a fallback. The mention of \"thursday march pm needed\" suggests a deadline, but I don't think it strictly points to a category. Since it concerns reviewing a document in Confluence, \"Internal Project\" seems like the most suitable option. So, I'll prepare a JSON object with the category assigned accordingly.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a specific JSON format for the category as indicated. The structure is clear: it should look like this: {\"category\": \"<chosen>\"}. Since I've determined that \"Internal Project\" is the most suitable category, I\u2019ll prepare the output as {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. I want to make sure I follow instructions precisely, so I\u2019ll only provide that JSON without any additional text. Let's finalize and get that output ready!"
