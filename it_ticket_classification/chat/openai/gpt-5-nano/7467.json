It seems to be about a new purchase order for hardware like a lightning cable and micro USB cable. They mention receipts and ordering items, which points me towards the \u201cPurchase\u201d category. However, since it specifically involves hardware, I\u2019m considering both \u201cPurchase\u201d and \u201cHardware\u201d as options. Given it's primarily about purchasing hardware, I think \u201cPurchase\u201d is the best category to use.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe request about the new purchase for items like lightning and micro USB cables suggests it fits well in the \"Purchase\" category. It could also be classified under \"Hardware,\" but typically, procurement requests are categorized as \"Purchase.\" I need to format my response as valid JSON without any extra explanation. So, I\u2019ll provide this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} to keep it simple and precise, ensuring that it complies with the required format.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
