The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nThe ticket emphasizes removing tasks that are not completed. Since it mostly relates to process automation, it might not fit neatly into \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project.\" I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" as a safe choice since there's no explicit hardware mention. Let's see if that fits best!**Evaluating IT Ticket Categories**\n\nThe category list I have is somewhat limited, with options like \"Access,\" which refers to permissions, \"Administrative rights\" focusing on user privileges, and \"Internal Project\" related to within-organization tasks. It seems the user is requesting to remove automated tasks that haven't completed, so it might involve job automation or a task scheduler. There's no mention of hardware, storage, or HR aspects. \n\nGiven that, maybe \"Miscellaneous\" would be the safest category to choose. Outputs should be in the correct JSON format.**Preparing JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nThe prompt asks me to categorize an IT ticket and provides a list of categories in a JSON schema format. I need to respond with a JSON object that includes the category field, probably as: {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}, because it fits the ticket content.\n\nI should ensure the value matches one of the defined strings exactly. Although I could add a brief justification, the instructions focus on the category alone, requiring me to keep it clear and simple. So my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I'll make sure there's no extra text."
