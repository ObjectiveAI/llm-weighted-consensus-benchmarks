The ticket seems to be related to loaner hardware, like a laptop. So, under the provided JSON schema, the best category would be \"Hardware\" because it aligns perfectly with the issue described. I'll output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Confirming category selection**\n\nI\u2019ve confirmed that \"Hardware\" is absolutely the correct category for this IT ticket. While I briefly considered others like \"Internal Project\" and \"Administrative rights,\" they just don\u2019t fit. \"Access\" and \"Storage\" aren\u2019t relevant either, and \"HR Support\" is a definite no. \"Miscellaneous\" could work if it were ambiguous, but since the issue is clearly related to a loaner device, it's hardware. So, I\u2019ll respond with the exact JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
