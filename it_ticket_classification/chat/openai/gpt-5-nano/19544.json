The user has asked for help with categorizing this ticket, and I've got a set of categories to choose from, like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and a few others. The phrase \"add com to block list\" hints it might relate to \"Access,\" possibly permissions, or maybe even \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context, I think \"Access\" is the best fit, especially if it\u2019s about blocking a domain.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a noisy IT ticket that possibly relates to a financial transfer request, given phrases like \"want make transfer upon receipt information complete.\" There are mentions of Teams and a date reference that adds to the confusion. The key phrase \"add com to block list\" likely indicates a request to block a domain, pointing toward access controls. I think the \"Access\" category fits best, as it involves security actions. I'll format my response as JSON specifically to indicate the category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
