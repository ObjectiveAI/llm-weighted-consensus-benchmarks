The content suggests it\u2019s about access, specifically referring to \u201caccess Friday PM\u201d and then discussing creating a build job for an artifact. This indicates it's a request for access to resources or permissions.\n\nConsidering the categories available, it seems the best fit is \u201cAccess\u201d since the ticket clearly asks for access and likely involves administrative rights for the build job creation.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m working through categorizing the IT ticket. The categories include Access, Administrative rights, and Internal Project among others. The ticket mentions \u201caccess Friday PM,\u201d which indicates a request for access at that time. There\u2019s also a development task about creating a build job to pull artifacts, possibly for a senior developer. Given this context, the most fitting category appears to be \"Access\" since it aligns with the request for resources.**Categorizing IT ticket further**\n\nI\u2019m considering the category options for the IT ticket. There\u2019s \"Administrative rights,\" which is a subset of access, but the request for creating a build job doesn't necessarily mean they need those rights. It might relate to an internal project since they mentioned provisioning a senior developer. However, since the term \"access\" is explicitly stated, I think \"Access\" is the most suitable category. I\u2019ll format this as a JSON object with the category specified.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
