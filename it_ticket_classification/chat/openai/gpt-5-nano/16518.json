The categories available include \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights\". Given the focus on reporting and capacity, it doesn\u2019t tightly fit any specific category. But the closest match seems to be \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Internal Project\" or \"Storage\", rather than \"Hardware\". I'll go with \"Miscellaneous\".**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI think the best category for this ticket is \"Miscellaneous\" since it\u2019s a general request related to generating reports. However, if this is part of an ongoing internal project related to capacity reporting, it might fit better under \"Internal Project.\" But since the user hasn't specified any project name, \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the safest option. I'll prepare the response as a JSON object showing this choice. \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
