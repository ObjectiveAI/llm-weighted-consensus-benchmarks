The user's message about mail merge communication regarding new joiners seems quite garbled. However, it points towards internal communications for new employees. Given this context, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit since it relates to new joiner communications, but I also recognize it\u2019s an IT ticket.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nLooking at the categories, \u201cHR Support\u201d seems suitable since this ticket is about onboarding mail, particularly involving mail merge for new joiners. I also consider \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d \u201cInternal Project,\u201d or \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d but the focus is clearly on communication for new team members. It aligns with HR processes. However, since it\u2019s an IT ticket, maybe the IT department is addressing this as a process improvement. Ultimately, \u201cHR Support\u201d or \u201cInternal Project\u201d appears to be the best choices based on the content.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
