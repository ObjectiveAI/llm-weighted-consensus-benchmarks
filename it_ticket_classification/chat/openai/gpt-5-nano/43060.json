The ticket talks about an error during the approval process, mentioning something like an application error that halted the workflow. It clearly isn't a hardware issue, HR support, or access rights. I\u2019m leaning towards \u201cInternal Project\u201d or perhaps \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d as it could be a general error. Since the categories are limited, I'll aim to find the best fit based on what's described in the ticket.**Clarifying ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a ticket about an error in the request system and approval process, which is a bit odd. The phrase \u201cincident server fun\u201d suggests it might relate to a server issue. I\u2019m considering \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d if it\u2019s connected to access problems. But since it primarily discusses a workflow, maybe \u201cInternal Project\u201d is a better fit. If nothing else fits neatly, I could go with \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d but \u201cAccess\u201d might make sense if it\u2019s about halting an approval request.**Outputting ticket category**\n\nSince the category options don\u2019t include \"Incidents\" or \"Application,\" I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best choice here. In classification tasks, \"Application error\" often maps to \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project,\" but without further guidance, \"Miscellaneous\" seems appropriate as a default. I\u2019ll provide a JSON object to meet the prompt's requirements, formatted correctly. Here goes:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure the capitalization is correct to match the allowed values."
