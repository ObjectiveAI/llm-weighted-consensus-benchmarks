Given the context, categorizing it under \"Administrative rights\" seems most appropriate since an OS rebuild typically falls under administrative tasks. The categories are somewhat limiting, making the decision a bit tricky.**Finalizing the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m wrestling with categorizing this IT ticket. The request is for an OS rebuild, so it\u2019s primarily a maintenance task that typically requires admin privileges. While I could consider \"Miscellaneous\" if there's no specific category, \"Administrative rights\" is best since it involves admin-level operations. The user mentioned sending something on Friday, but I can\u2019t pinpoint what they meant. Since it\u2019s an OS rebuild request, classifying it under \"Administrative rights\" feels like the most accurate choice.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
