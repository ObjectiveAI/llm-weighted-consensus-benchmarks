Since this request involves a project, \"Internal Project\" could be a fit. However, it might also relate to needing \"Administrative rights\" for access to the repository. The message indicates a request for repository access, which could align with \"Access\" as well. I'll lean toward categorizing this as \"Internal Project,\" given the focus on project setup and build automation, but \"Access\" might apply if they need permissions. Let's go with \"Internal Project\" for clarity.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to go with \"Internal Project\" since this ticket relates to a project repository and build automation. Now I need to prepare the final answer in the required JSON format, which should look like this: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. The output requires a succinct response, so I\u2019ll deliver just the JSON object. The instructions clearly say to respect the category schema, so I\u2019ll stick to that and send back {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let's get this done!"
