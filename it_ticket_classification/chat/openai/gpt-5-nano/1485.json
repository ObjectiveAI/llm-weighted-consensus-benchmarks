The ticket content seems to revolve around license requests for everyone, with mentions of subscriptions and Azure. It probably falls under \"Purchase\" due to the focus on acquiring a license, but \"Access\" might also be applicable since it involves user access rights. Overall, \"Purchase\" feels like the best fit.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI'm considering whether this ticket could fall under \"Administrative rights,\" but it seems more focused on licensing rather than admin rights. The request clearly states \"license for everyone\" and asks for a subscription, indicating it's about procurement. I'd say \"Purchase\" is the best category. I'll structure my response as a JSON object following the required format, which should look like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I'll keep it straightforward without any extra text.**Confirming ticket category**\n\nI need to make sure that \"Purchase\" matches one of the enumerated categories accurately. It does! So, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object and it will simply be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It's straightforward and aligns with what\u2019s required!"
