The ticket clearly mentions installation rights and permissions. Since this is about permissions for software installation, I think \"Administrative rights\" fits best. \"Access\" could also be considered, but it seems more focused on elevated privileges. So, I'll categorize it under \"Administrative rights\" and output a JSON-like object with the category field included.**Classifying ticket category**\n\nThe prompt gives me a category schema that includes options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. I need to output a JSON object specifying the category. The ticket mentions installation rights for a project, asking for permissions, which leads me to think \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit. Since it relates to privilege elevation specifically for installation rights, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Administrative rights.\" I should only respond with the JSON object format for clarity."
