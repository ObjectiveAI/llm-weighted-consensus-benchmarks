The user's instruction is clear\u2014they want the response in a JSON format with just the category field. So, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It's important to stick to the formatting without adding extra content!**Confirming category choice**\n\nI've determined that the appropriate category for the IT ticket is \"Purchase.\" The text mentions terms like \"requisition,\" \"view requisition details,\" and other purchasing-related elements, reinforcing that choice. I need to make sure that I stick to the expected format and avoid any extra text. The final output I'll provide should be precisely: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. This keeps everything clear and concise, as expected!"
