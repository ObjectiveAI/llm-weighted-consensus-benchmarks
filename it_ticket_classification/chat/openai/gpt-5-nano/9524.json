They mentioned a \"leaver hardware bulk leaver form,\" which likely indicates that it's related to employees leaving and decommissioning hardware. My first thought is that this fits under the \"Hardware\" category, given the mention of hardware. However, it could also relate to \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights\" due to the bulk leaver form for access management. I should consider the context carefully!**Determining the right category**\n\nLooking at the categories provided, \"Hardware\" fits if the ticket deals with hardware allocation or decommissioning for leavers. It's possible that \"HR Support\" would apply too, but since this ticket is from IT, it makes sense to lean towards hardware. The request to fill out a \"bulk leaver form\" hints at managing multiple employee departures, possibly involving deactivating accounts and returning hardware. All this leans me towards categorizing it primarily as \"Hardware\" or \"Access.\"**Choosing the right category format**\n\nThe \"bulk leaver form\" could imply an HR process for reclaiming hardware, but given the minimal ticket information, categorizing it as \"Hardware\" seems most appropriate for escalating the bulk hardware processing. I need to respond with the correct JSON format. The prompt states: \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" followed by the text, so I should output a JSON object with the filled-in category. The schema requires a response that follows their specifications, so my finalized response will focus on including the category value properly.**Finalizing the response format**\n\nThe final answer I need to provide should be in the format of: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Since the \"category\" property is part of the schema's object, I only need to include that field. There's no need for any extraneous text since the user specifically asked to categorize. I\u2019ll keep it clear and straightforward by providing just the category with no additional information. So, I\u2019ll respond with exactly: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
