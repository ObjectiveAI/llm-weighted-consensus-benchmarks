The categories I have are various, including \"Access.\" It seems like they\u2019re having issues with access rights. \n\nFrom my understanding, the user wants to edit or configure a board, but they're being prevented from proceeding, which further supports choosing \"Access\" as the category. I'll format my output in JSON as required: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Choosing the right IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket is all about issues with editing and configuring boards, suggesting a potential permission problem. The phrase \"should have access\" hints at a rights issue, so I'm considering \"Access\" for the category. However, \"Administrative rights\" also fits, as it specifically pertains to the necessary permissions for editing. Since the text emphasizes the need for access, I think leaning towards \"Administrative rights\" would be more precise. I\u2019ll go with that as my categorization!{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
