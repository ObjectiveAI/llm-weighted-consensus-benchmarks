While it could also fit into Access or HR Support, the main focus is clearly on hardware. So, I\u2019ll categorize this under \"Hardware\" and prepare the JSON format for the output.**Outputting the IT ticket category**\n\nI need to provide a JSON object with the category for the IT ticket. The category clearly falls under \"Hardware.\" While the instructions mention a schema, what I really need to confirm is just to state the category itself plainly. So, my output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I want to keep it straightforward without adding unnecessary details since that could mess with how it's parsed or displayed. Let's keep it simple and direct!"
