This helps prioritize the ticket appropriately.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category to assign for the IT ticket. \"Miscellaneous\" could work for general issues, while \"Internal Project\" might apply if it's part of a specific task. The user mentioned investigating priority problems regarding \"Belgrade,\" which sounds like a network issue affecting the entire site. Given that context, it seems \"Internal Project\" is a better choice if this pertains to task tests, even though it feels a bit like a stretch. I'll lean towards that.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nSince there's no specific \"Network\" category, \"Miscellaneous\" fits as the best option for this IT ticket. I need to return a structured JSON object for the category. The user's system requires that format, so my response should look like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.  \n\nI also considered \u201cAccess\u201d because it may relate to network access for Belgrade, but the issue is mainly about packet loss affecting the entire site. So, \"Miscellaneous\" seems most appropriate after all. I should keep it simple, no need for extra notes!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
