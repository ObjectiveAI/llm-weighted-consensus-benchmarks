It mentions a \"new starter\" and a location, \"Bucharest,\" hinting at onboarding, which sounds like HR Support. The mention of \"priority high\" suggests urgency. It also refers to a \"form code,\" which could imply a need for account access. I should classify this ticket into HR Support since it revolves around the onboarding process for a new employee.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm sorting out the appropriate category for an IT ticket related to a \"new starter.\" Since it involves onboarding, \"HR Support\" comes to mind, but I also see \"Access\" as a potential fit, considering it's about granting access. The mention of \"form code\" points toward access requirements, so I'll go with \"Access\" for this ticket. It doesn't seem to fit categories like hardware or storage, and I can respond with a JSON-like object containing the selected category.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to create a JSON response for the IT ticket category. The instruction provides a clear structure, specifying that I should include \"category\" as one of the allowed values. Since I've decided on \"Access,\" my response will be straightforward: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. \n\nI\u2019ll ensure that I only provide this JSON object without any extra text. It's crucial to follow the schema precisely, focusing on the category property as outlined. So, I\u2019ll reply with exactly that format."
