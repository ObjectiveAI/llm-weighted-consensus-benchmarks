They repeatedly mention \"upgrade available version\" and related phrases. It looks like they're primarily requesting access rights at the application level and discussing impacts of changes. So, it seems like the best fit would be either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm contemplating which category to assign this IT ticket: \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It talks about \"admin access on servers\" and references rights related to application upgrades. The \"Administrative rights\" category seems like the most precise fit since it's specifically about those access rights. However, I wonder if calling it \"Access\" might also work if it\u2019s not strictly about rights. Ultimately, I think \"Administrative rights\" is appropriate. I'll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
