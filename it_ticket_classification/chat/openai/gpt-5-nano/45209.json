The ticket discusses annual leave visibility, absence issues, and high-priority notifications, which makes me think it could fit under HR Support or Administrative rights since it's related to HR processes. However, since there's mention of engineers investigating, it might also relate to Access. Ultimately, it seems most like an HR system issue needing categorization.**Analyzing notification messages**\n\nI need to analyze several messages regarding annual leave visibility errors. The first discusses an error notification about leave days, indicating it was resolved. Another message confirms the issue is still ongoing and mentions high priority, affecting the submission of leave requests. There\u2019s repetition regarding the need to manually update absence records, particularly for several regions like Germany, Colombia, and Macedonia. It seems there's ongoing confusion about leave requests due to this investigation, and messages seem to emphasize the issue's importance.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe message is about the visibility of annual leave days, indicating a high-priority issue that engineers are investigating. It definitely fits under \"HR Support,\" since it's related to human resources processes. The available categories do include \"HR Support,\" so that\u2019s reassuring. I\u2019m thinking I need to respond in a structured format, following the JSON schema presented. Since the user asked to categorize the IT ticket, I\u2019ll provide my response like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}**Providing the response**\n\nI need to respond with the JSON-like object as required. The schema indicates I should just provide the necessary information without extra text, so I'll keep it straightforward. I\u2019ll output exactly:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nThis way, I\u2019ll adhere to the guidelines about no heavy formatting, ensuring clarity without any unnecessary information. Keeping it clean and simple is the goal here!"
