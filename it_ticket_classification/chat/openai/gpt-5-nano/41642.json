The text mentions issues with a tunnel when on wireless, suggesting potential VPN or network problems. Considering the context, I think it fits best in the \"Access\" category since it's about access to servers. Although \"Network\" might also be relevant, it isn't one of the provided categories. I'll go ahead and assign it to \"Access.\"**Preparing JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m categorizing an IT ticket based on a user request. The available categories include \"Access,\" which seems fitting since the ticket discusses issues with VPN connectivity over wireless compared to wired connections. I need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category. Following the required format, my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's confirmed that I should only include this JSON object as my response, keeping it simple and clear.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
