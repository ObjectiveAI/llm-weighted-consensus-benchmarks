The content suggests this relates to onboarding, which makes me think it might fit under \"HR Support.\" However, since there are mentions of filling out forms and potential access needs, it could also relate to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It seems the best fit would be \"HR Support,\" as that's most relevant for onboarding processes.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm reviewing an IT ticket related to a new starter and a \"starter form,\" which likely involves onboarding. Generally, these tickets deal with access provisioning, so it could fit under either \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" The user\u2019s focus on filling out a starter form suggests this is HR-related, making \"HR Support\" the best fit. While \"Access\" pertains to account provisioning, the form clearly points towards onboarding tasks tied to HR. So I'll categorize it as \"HR Support.\"**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI believe the best category for this ticket is \"HR Support\" since it involves a starter form related to onboarding for a new employee. The user is asking for classification, and the mention of \"new starter\" and filling out the starter form reinforces that idea. So, I'll map the category as \"HR Support.\" I need to format the response correctly in JSON: {\"category\":{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}}. That aligns with the required standards.**Creating the category object**\n\nI need to provide just the category object in the correct format. So, I'll create it as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. While the instructions specify only the category object, adding a brief explanation could help clarify the context. However, I see that the primary task is simply to deliver that object, so sticking to the simple format is the right approach. Let's finalize it!"
