They mention \"Service Now,\" likely referring to the ITSM platform, alongside a request regarding an attachment. There are various possible categories like \"Access,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Given the context, it feels like \"Access\" is the most fitting category since it usually pertains to new user setups and access rights.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThis IT ticket is about a \"new starter,\" which usually means setting up accounts. The best category here looks like \"Access,\" especially considering the mention of \"ServiceNow,\" a platform for provisioning. The phrases about an attachment and filling out a form suggest some administrative steps, but that aligns more with \"Access\" in this case. Therefore, I think it\u2019s best to categorize this ticket as \"Access\" for setting up a new user's provisioning. I'll format the response as a JSON object with \"Access\" in the category field.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
