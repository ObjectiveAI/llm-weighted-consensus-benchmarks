Given that this is about completion of a new starter induction form, it fits best under \"HR Support.\" Categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" aren't applicable here. I'll classify it as HR Support.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on the \u201cnew starter form induction,\u201d which relates to onboarding.
