The list of available categories includes things like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. I really want to make sure we classify the ticket correctly into one of these categories to keep everything organized. Let's decide which option fits the best for the specific ticket we have at hand.**Analyzing Noisy Ticket Text**\n\nI'm looking at a rather noisy ticket text that includes many references about access to the network for contractors in Columbia, NJ. There\u2019s mention of multiple emails, requests for engineer assignments, and detailed instructions about connection setups. To make sense of this, I\u2019ll need to focus on the main points, such as who needs access, the type of connection required, and specific contractor information. It seems critical to clarify this so we can help efficiently.**Categorizing IT Access Request**\n\nI'm noticing several phrases like \"assign engineer,\" \"schedule meeting,\" and \"allowed connect\" in the ticket text, which points to a request for IT access for contractors\u2014likely related to network access. Therefore, I think the best category for this ticket would be \"Access.\" Since the user explicitly asked for a categorization, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure the formatting is exact, as that's really important!"
