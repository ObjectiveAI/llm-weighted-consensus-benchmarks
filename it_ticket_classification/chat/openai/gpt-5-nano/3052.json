This is likely hardware-related. I\u2019m considering whether to label it as \"Purchase\" since they\u2019re requesting a cable, or \"Hardware,\" which may fit better if it\u2019s about the physical item itself. In many ticketing systems, such requests could fall under either category, depending on the specifics of procurement or internal assets.**Classifying the IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m interpreting the user's request about a cable to connect to a monitor. They might be asking for a replacement since they can't connect it. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Purchase,\" given that they\u2019re requesting the cable. However, it also relates to hardware. Since it's not a troubleshooting request, I think \"Hardware\" fits well because it\u2019s a physical component. I\u2019ll output a JSON object with \"category\" as part of the required format.**Choosing the Category**\n\nIt looks like \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate category for this ticket. While \"Purchase\" could also fit since they asked to provide a cable, the main point is that they're seeking a hardware component to resolve an issue with their monitor. The ticket doesn't request troubleshooting, just the cable, so \"Hardware\" captures that well. I'll be outputting just the required JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, sticking strictly to the instructions. No extra text needed here!"
