They mention wanting a new monitor and that the visibility of their old monitor is degraded. Given this, the appropriate categories to consider would be \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" However, since they're asking for a replacement due to the degraded visibility, I think the best fit is \"Hardware.\" It looks like this ticket clearly relates to a hardware issue with the monitor.**Classifying IT Tickets**\n\nWhen classifying this IT ticket, I see the category will likely be \"Hardware\" based on the user\u2019s request to replace their monitor due to degraded visibility. While \u201cPurchase\u201d might fit if they need to buy a new one, the mention of a scheduled replacement suggests it's primarily a hardware issue. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" The response format should follow the JSON schema with the appropriate category value. I'll keep it concise!**Formatting the Response**\n\nI need to respond with the specific category format. The response should just be the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. While I could add a brief note, the instructions specify that the output must strictly follow that structure without extra commentary. The ticket refers to a degraded monitor and mentions a new monitor, reinforcing that it's a hardware issue. I\u2019ll make sure to keep it concise and stick to the requirement. Here\u2019s my final output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
