I have several categories to choose from like Access and Administrative rights, both of which could be relevant here. Since it seems like the request is about obtaining codes, it might lean toward Access, but I'm really not entirely sure. I'll need to clarify before finalizing.**Interpreting the IT ticket request**\n\nI need to parse the request, which is a bit jumbled: \"new codes request pas thursday december pm codes hello please forms attached note these pre code opportunities thank.\" \n\nIt seems they're asking for new codes, possibly referring to \"pass.\" The mention of \"forms attached\" might suggest they need to complete something. It could fit under the \"Access\" category if it's about system credentials, or maybe \"Administrative rights\" if it's about admin access. Since it's unclear, I might also consider \"Miscellaneous,\" but I want to select the best option.**Categorizing IT requests**\n\nWhen categorizing IT tickets, requests for codes or passwords typically fall under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" depending on the permissions needed.\n\nThe phrase \"new codes request\" hints at access codes, possibly for something happening on a specific date. There are mentions of \"forms attached\" and \"pre code opportunities,\" which could connect to a project. However, given the context, I think \"Access\" is the best fit for the category.\n\nI'll format this properly as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Access\"} and make sure it matches the expected format."
