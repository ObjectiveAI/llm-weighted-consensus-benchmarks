It could fit under \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights,\" due to references to forms and hardware provisioning.**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket refers to a \"starter form\" and mentions \"hardware ready,\" indicating it relates to onboarding a new employee. From the options available\u2014Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights\u2014I\u2019m thinking \"HR Support\" fits well since it involves onboarding paperwork. However, the hardware component might suggest it could also fall under \"Hardware.\" It seems the primary focus is on the onboarding process, so I\u2019ll lean towards \"HR Support\" for categorization.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe task is to categorize the IT ticket by providing a JSON object with a category field based on the schema given. The available options are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given that the ticket mentions \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"hardware ready,\" it's clear this is about onboarding. I think the best fit is \"HR Support,\" reflecting the onboarding process and related forms.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
