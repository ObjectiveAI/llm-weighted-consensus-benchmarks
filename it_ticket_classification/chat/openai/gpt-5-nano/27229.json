The ticket text from the user is a bit jumbled but mentions blocking an October PM free trial video and asking for assistance in blocking future access. I\u2019ll need to determine which category fits best based on this information. Let\u2019s figure this out!**Classifying the ticket**\n\nI see that the ticket text is a bit chaotic, talking about a free trial video, subscription services, and various technical aspects. However, it seems to mention blocking an October PM free trial video, which makes me think this ticket might indeed be about access control. Given this context, I should categorize it under \"Access\" since it pertains to blocking access or stopping a service. Let's proceed with that classification!**Determining the ticket category**\n\nThe ticket text includes a request to \"assist blocking\" something, which suggests it could fall under either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" as both pertain to restricting access. There are mentions of terms like \"replace existing endpoints\" and \"privacy policy,\" which complicate things a bit. However, since the user specifically asked to categorize this ticket, I should consider if the focus is more on pricing and video platform details. In that case, maybe \"Purchase\" aligns best, as they discuss free trials and discounts. Let\u2019s finalize this category!**Selecting the category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the options for the ticket category. It could be \"Internal Project\" if it relates to video room infrastructure, or \"Miscellaneous\" if it seems too jumbled. However, the mentions of \"block October PM free trial video\" and \"assist blocking future\" suggest a request to restrict access, making \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" more fitting. Since the ticket discusses blocking and contains privacy policy references, I think \"Access\" is the best choice, even if the privacy aspect feels a bit off. Let's go with that!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
