The user has asked me to categorize it, so I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON-like object. Since there's no specific \"Network\" category, the best choices appear to be \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Internal Project.\" I'll determine which fits best!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a ticket regarding network connectivity between machines and specific ports. The mention of \u201cspecified ports\u201d likely suggests a firewall issue. The user notes they have access but are experiencing problems with DNS resolution via curl. This situation points toward connection issues. While there's no specific \"Networking\" category, choices like \"Access\" and \"Internal Project\" seem suitable. I want to avoid \"Miscellaneous,\" as it feels too vague. I'll go with \"Access\" since it directly relates to their connectivity issue!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
