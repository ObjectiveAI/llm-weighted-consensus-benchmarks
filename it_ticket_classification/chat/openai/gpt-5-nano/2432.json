The provided categories include \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It sounds most relevant to \"HR Support\" since the context relates to maternity leave. I'll construct a JSON object with the category field, which will look like: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. This should fit the user's request correctly!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI see the text mentions a \"new starter returning from maternity leave,\" which sounds like it\u2019s about returning to work and possibly filling out forms. It could fit \"HR Support\" since the focus is on maternity leave. While \"Access\" could relate to system access for the employee, the HR aspects are stronger here. Thus, I'll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and format it into a JSON object as follows: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}.**Providing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to ensure the category I provide is one from the allowed options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context, \"HR Support\" fits best. I\u2019ll produce a JSON object with just the category as instructed, following the guideline to respond as simply as possible. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and output: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. Let's keep it straightforward!"
