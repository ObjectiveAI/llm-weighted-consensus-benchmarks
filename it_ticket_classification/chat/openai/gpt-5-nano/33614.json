The categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It seems like the user's message is a mix of terms and doesn't clearly fit any category.\n\nI'll analyze the key phrases and decide which category is the best fit. Then, I'll format my response as a JSON object containing the chosen category to comply with the specified output format.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI need to determine the best category for the ticket content, which includes terms like \"platform testing,\" \"hardware resources,\" \"CPU,\" and \"automation.\" It sounds like it could be related to internal project work, especially with mentions of decommissioning and annual contract extensions. \n\nThe confusing phrases like \"new Friday July pm edge\" don\u2019t add clarity, but the overall focus seems to be on IT aspects, particularly hardware-related issues. I'll consider these insights to select an appropriate category.**Finalizing category decision**\n\nI think I've analyzed the ticket content thoroughly. It mentions hardware resources, which might fit under Hardware, but there's no clear connection to Storage, Purchase, or Administrative rights. \n\n\"Internal Project\" sounds like the best fit, since the content revolves around platform testing, decommissioning, and contract extensions\u2014typical project-related themes. Even though there are some messy phrases, the overall gist points towards project management. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and format my response as a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Formatting response**\n\nThe instructions indicate that I need to focus solely on the category when responding to the user's request to categorize the IT ticket. It\u2019s important to keep my answer simple and direct, providing only the necessary information without any extra explanation. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll format my response in a JSON format, ensuring it's clear and concise. The final output will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This way, I comply with the requirements while delivering exactly what the user wants."
