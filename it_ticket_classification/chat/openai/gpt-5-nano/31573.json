The \"CAB ribbon\" could involve something related to an interface in Microsoft Office, which is a bit unclear.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user's message contains phrases like \"link view\" and \"access,\" which seem to indicate a request for access to something, possibly related to the CAB Ribbon. \n\nI think the most fitting category to select is \"Access\" because the ticket focuses on access. \n\nTherefore, I need to provide the response in a JSON-like format. The output should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll ensure I stick to this format without any extra explanations unless the user asks for more details.**Outputting the Category**\n\nThe user's instruction is clear: \"Please categorize this IT Ticket.\" I need to respond with a specific output format: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nIt's important to ensure this is formatted correctly as a JSON object. The instruction emphasizes avoiding heavy formatting, so I'm sticking to just the necessary text representation. \n\nHere it is: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nThat keeps everything straightforward and to the point!"
