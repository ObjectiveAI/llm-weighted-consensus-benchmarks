They mentioned a \"new starter,\" \"administration officer,\" and asked to \"fill back date.\" It doesn\u2019t clearly fit into the categories like hardware or access. I\u2019m leaning towards \"HR Support\" since it seems like it relates to onboarding a new employee. However, the term \"administrative rights\" might be relevant too. I just need to be sure before making a final choice!**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing this IT ticket and weighing the options. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" don't seem right. Given the context of onboarding, \"HR Support\" feels most fitting, as it\u2019s typically related to new employees. However, there's talk of access changes, which complicates things since rights could be relevant too. The request isn't fully clear, but it focuses on the new starter. Since there\u2019s no direct mention of access details, my best guess is to go with \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll ensure to respond in the needed JSON format!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
