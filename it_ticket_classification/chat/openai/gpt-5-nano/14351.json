They said, \"unable to open documents from Thursday PM,\" which suggests an issue with opening those documents. They mention that Chrome works fine, indicating the problem isn\u2019t with the browser. I'm wondering if this error might be related to Windows Explorer or File Explorer, which makes me think the best category might be \"Access,\" as it deals with document accessibility.**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt seems there\u2019s an issue with accessing documents, likely related to either \"Access\" or \"Storage.\" The phrase \"unable to open documents\" suggests it fits in the \"Access\" category since it might involve permissions or file access. However, if the documents are stored on a network drive, it could relate to \"Storage.\" The mention of \"Thursday PM\" hints at a specific folder. Since the user is unable to open documents with Explorer, \"Access\" seems to be the best fit for this ticket.**Categorizing ticket as JSON**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the best category for this IT ticket, and \"Access\" seems to fit well. I need to respond in a JSON format, specifically with a category field. The instructions say it should include only the \"category\" key. So, my output will be concise: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. I want to ensure it matches the expected format exactly, and it appears \"Access\" is a valid enum option. Let's go with that!"
