There's a chance it's related to HR functions, but given it's an IT ticket, that might complicate things. Overall, \"Access\" feels most appropriate.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nIn most IT categorization systems, access to a system is usually classified under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since the user didn\u2019t request admin privileges, I'll go with \"Access.\" I also need to format the response as a JSON object, which should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nI want to make sure it's clear and straightforward, without any extra text. Since there\u2019s no personal info in the request, I can confidently proceed with my response!\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
