So \u201cAccess\u201d could be the most appropriate category since it deals with network connectivity. There are also hints of hardware involved, but the main focus appears to be on access to the network for a specific time. So, I'll go with \"Access.\"**Formatting IT Ticket Response**\n\nThe request is about connecting to a wireless network on Thursday afternoon, so I need to categorize it as \"Access.\" The user refers to their needs in a somewhat unclear way, but it's clear they want help with accessing the network. To fit the tool's requirements, I must respond with a properly formatted JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra wording\u2014just the clean JSON object.
