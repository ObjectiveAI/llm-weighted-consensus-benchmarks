The available categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The user seems to be asking about connecting to a personal drive, which makes \"Access\" a fitting choice since it involves connecting to systems. However, \"Internal Project\" could also apply if it relates to a specific project, and \"Storage\" for the personal drive. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" as the best fit for the category.**Determining the right category**\n\nI'm analyzing the user's message, which mentions \"how to connect to Wednesday PM.\" I wonder if \"Wednesday PM\" refers to a remote desktop or a specific schedule. The request seems a bit jumbled, but it appears to be about categorizing access issues. Given the context, \"Access\" fits since it involves connection rights, and the mention of \"personal drive\" suggests storage access as well. Both \"Access\" and \"Storage\" could apply, but I think \"Access\" is the primary focus here.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user is asking \"how to connect to Wednesday PM,\" which could refer to their workspace or meeting. They also mention connecting to a personal drive, indicating a need for storage access. Since \"PM\" is unspecified, the safest broad category for connectivity issues seems to be \"Access.\" \n\nI need to return a JSON object with \"category\" set to \"Access.\" So, the final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's important to keep it clean and valid. Let's go with that!"
