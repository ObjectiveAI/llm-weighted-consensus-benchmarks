Given the categories provided \u2014 like Hardware and Access \u2014 it's essential to accurately map this ticket. The user's context seems to lean towards an issue with the submission process, possibly suggesting it's related to Access. I'll classify the ticket accordingly.**Parsing IT ticket content**\n\nI need to break down the user's message about an issue with submitting a card. They mention a \"leave code\" from Oracle and problems with task details. It appears messy, but I\u2019m gathering that the user is facing difficulties with this submission. Given the context, I'll consider it as related to HR Support, possibly regarding expenses or leave. I\u2019ll classify it accordingly from the available categories.**Evaluating ticket categories**\n\nThe user's message refers to \"leave\" and issues with task details, so I\u2019m considering whether this fits under \"Access\" due to potential permissions issues. The mention of \"Administrative rights\" could imply they can't submit the card because they lack those rights. However, there\u2019s also the possibility that \"Miscellaneous\" fits if the issues remain unclear. Since they mention problems with submitting a card, it seems like it really points toward \"Access.\" I'll take another look to clarify which category works best.**Identifying ticket issue**\n\nLooking at the categories, \"Internal Project\" would apply if this relates to internal development. The user is a tester, and this is indicated in their sign-off. The phrase \"when trying to submit card\" may refer to an expense card or a credit card. They also mention wanting to attach screenshots, which can help clarify the issue. It seems that the \"task details\" field may be pre-filled but not functioning correctly. This looks like a bug in the submission form related to the application.**Classifying IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket, and it's tricky. The issue could fall under \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but it doesn't seem to be about hardware. Since \"Oracle\" refers to a software application, it might be an internal app. However, there\u2019s no specific \"Software\" category. Considering that the problem involves submitting a card and it's likely a UI issue, I\u2019ll classify it as \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\nThe final response will be the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
