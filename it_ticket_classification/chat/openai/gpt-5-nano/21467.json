The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nThe input text mentions folders, reports, and moving files, which suggests it relates to storage and access rights. There are various references to locations and sectors too. So, I should focus on sorting it under either \"Storage\" or \"Access.\"**Classifying IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket appears to involve storage or access rights, possibly an internal project. The phrases \"move files\" and \"create store related document\" hint at storage concerns, while \"advise location\" suggests access needs. Although it doesn't mention login credentials, the \"Administrative rights\" category could come into play if they're seeking admin permissions for file movement. Ultimately, I should categorize this ticket under \"Storage,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights,\" focusing on folder reports and file movement.**Parsing IT ticket input**\n\nThe input text is quite garbled, but I\u2019m noticing repeated mentions of \"folders,\" \"move files,\" and \"reports,\" which all point towards a storage issue. Given that the context revolves around these elements, I think the best label for this ticket would be \"Storage.\" I'll categorize it accordingly and prepare the output in a JSON-like format to reflect this decision. It seems clear now that storage is the primary concern here.**Outputting category object**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to respond with a category object formatted as specified. I should use the schema indicating it must be an object with a specific properties structure. Thus, my response will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}\n\nThis complies with the required format exactly as described, ensuring I follow the guidelines while keeping it straightforward and concise! There's no need for extra analysis here, so I'll just stick to the format."
