Is it a hardware problem, or maybe related to access? I want to make sure I choose the right category to help resolve the ticket efficiently!**Analyzing a Messy Ticket**\n\nI have a complicated ticket that involves assigning a new extension for the curiosity meeting room on the th floor. It seems there's a lot of confusion around signing in and authentication, as multiple users have reported errors with their credentials. I need to focus on the core issues\u2014like access control and possible technical problems in signing in. It\u2019s important to clarify the details to get the necessary assistance from the engineers. Let's sort this out!**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket likely falls under the \"Access\" category since it involves authentication, sign-in, and credentials related to a meeting room extension. It could be \"Administrative rights,\" but that doesn\u2019t quite fit. \"Internal Project\" is definitely not applicable. There's a mention of \"pc credentials\" and \"authenticate curiosity meeting room,\" which points to access issues. So, I\u2019ll categorize it strictly as \"Access\" and prepare a concise JSON response like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s important to keep it straightforward!"
