The details indicate it's likely related to hardware, specifically since it's a phone on the 3rd or 4th floor. Although I considered \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access,\" those don\u2019t fit since they\u2019re not the main concerns here. \"Miscellaneous\" could be a choice, but I believe \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate category for this situation.**Finalizing Ticket Categorization**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the user's request about a connection issue with a meeting room phone. The categories available are Hardware, Access, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights, HR Support, and Miscellaneous. Since the phone is clearly a hardware device, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" \n\nThe response needs to be in JSON format, which should look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to stick to the format required by the system!**Finalizing JSON Response**\n\nI see that the category schema shows I need to return an object. The right response here is to provide {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} since the issue relates to a phone connection in the meeting room.  \n\nI briefly considered whether it could be \"Internal Project\" since it involves logging a ticket, but that's not the focus here. So let\u2019s keep it clear and concise: the output will just be {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Perfect!"
