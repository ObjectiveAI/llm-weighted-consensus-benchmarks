It seems to be an HR-related issue since they can't submit the form without the location. Therefore, I think \"HR Support\" is the best category, especially since it was listed among the options.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket is about adding the Belgrade location to a leave form, and they can't submit without selecting that location. This could suggest an issue with form customization within the HR system. While \"Access\" might be considered since it relates to submitting a form, it's more about the HR process. Therefore, categorizing this as \"HR Support\" makes the most sense. The final response should be a JSON object stating the category: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
