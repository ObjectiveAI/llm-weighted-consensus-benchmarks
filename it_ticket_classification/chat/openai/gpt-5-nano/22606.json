Since backup tapes are related to storage media, it seems appropriate to categorize it primarily under \"Storage.\" However, there are mentions of logs and queues, which might relate to \"Administrative rights.\" Ultimately, \"Storage\" is the main focus, so I\u2019ll go with that. The response will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket and return the result in the required JSON format. The appropriate category for this ticket is \"Storage,\" so my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. However, I need to pay attention to the schema, which indicates that \"category\" is actually a property of an object. So, it should still just be {\"category\":\"Storage\"} as long as I follow the specified format. I\u2019ll make sure to output only this JSON."
