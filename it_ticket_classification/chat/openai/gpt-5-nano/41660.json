It seems to reference the approval workflow, with phrases like \"unable to approve\" and \"approval entries,\" which suggests it may fit into either the \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" categories since it likely relates to permissions or system access. I\u2019ll consider these two categories carefully when mapping this ticket.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe user points out an \"unable to approve\" issue with an approval workflow, where clicking on an approval entry shows nothing. This suggests a bug in the approval UI. Since it focuses on permissions, the best category seems to be \"Access.\" It could also fit under \"Internal Project\" if it's related to a specific workflow, but \"Access\" feels more appropriate overall. I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
