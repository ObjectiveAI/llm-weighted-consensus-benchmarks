Specifically, the ticket mentions that despite entering an approved status, they still encounter an error when resubmitting. It seems they need assistance figuring out what to do next. I should categorize this ticket under Oracle submissions or timesheet approval issues based on the details provided.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user is asking for help with an issue related to a system or hardware, and it appears to be an IT ticket. The categories I can choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and a few more. HR Support seems appropriate since the ticket involves timesheet approval and potential payroll issues. The mention of \"Oracle\" suggests a bug in the time & labor module, but since it's an IT ticket, I'll confidently categorize it under HR Support for clarity.**Deciding on Category for IT Ticket**\n\nI'm considering the user's issue about a status not updating and errors when submitting forms. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they lack permissions, the focus seems more on the system issue. \"Miscellaneous\" is an option, but the best fit is clearly \"HR Support,\" as it relates to Oracle timesheet approvals. So, to respond correctly, I'll prepare the JSON with only the necessary format, ensuring it's clean and free of extra spaces:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
