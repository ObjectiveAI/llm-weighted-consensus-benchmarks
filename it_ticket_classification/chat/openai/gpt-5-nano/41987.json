The text is a bit garbled, but it mentions configuring columns and setting resolutions, which could suggest it relates to \"Administrative rights.\" Alternatively, I might consider \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s an IT report for a sprint. If I can't determine a clear category, \"Miscellaneous\" could also work. The content touches on reporting and mismatched statuses in the sprint chart.**Assessing ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m looking at this ticket, which seems to be about configuring a reporting tool. If they need permissions, it could fit under \"Administrative rights.\" However, the wording hints that they want the recipient to have rights to modify the report. It might also align with \"Internal Project\" if it's about a project task. Considering they mention \"administrative rights\" explicitly, the ticket might really pertain to the rights needed to modify the report.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the category for this IT ticket regarding permissions issues, which clearly fits under \"Administrative rights.\" I need to provide the category in JSON format. The prompt specifies a structure for the output. So, I\u2019ll ensure my response is formatted correctly without any extra explanations. Following the correct capitalization, my final output should be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
