They mentioned encountering a \"screen death\" when booting their PC, so I should consider the prompt's provided categories: \"Hardware,\" \"Software,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it seems to be a boot issue with Windows, it might relate more to a hardware problem like the display or motherboard. However, it could also be a software issue with the OS. I\u2019ll place it in the \"Hardware\" category, as it seems most appropriate given the context.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nIn categorizing this IT ticket, since the user mentions a \"screen death,\" it likely indicates a hardware issue like a display or GPU problem. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" Other categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" don't apply here. The output needs to be in a specific format, so I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll also consider whether I should include any notes or disclaimers with this output.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize this IT ticket. The user mentioned \"screen death when trying to boot PC,\" which could hint at a Windows issue, but since \"Software\" isn\u2019t an available category, I have to go with \"Hardware.\" So I\u2019ll respond strictly with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It fits within the constraints, as \"Hardware\" is in the list. I\u2019ll just provide the JSON object without any additional commentary, since that\u2019s what\u2019s requested."
