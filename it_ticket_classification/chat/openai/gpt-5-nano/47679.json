The ticket mentions various critical issues related to connection permits and security, which seem to involve network security and access control. Since the categories are somewhat generic, \u201cAccess\u201d seems to fit best here, given the focus on connection permits and the need for enabling checks. It feels appropriate to classify this ticket under that category.**Analyzing ticket content**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket text, starting with \"security connection permit on NJ,\" which might relate to VPN or firewall rules. The phrase \"importance high ... critical issue\" suggests urgency, and \"log incident\" indicates it's a formal ticketing matter. There are mentions of checking traffic from NJ, which aligns with access permissions. Since it discusses network access and firewall rules across locations, I think the best category might be \"Access,\" though \"Administrative rights\" could fit if it\u2019s specifically about permissions.{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
