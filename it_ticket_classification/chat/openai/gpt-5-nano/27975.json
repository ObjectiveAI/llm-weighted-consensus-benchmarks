They're mentioning things like \"project slave needed\" and \"running tests locally,\" which might relate to hardware or access concerns. The phrase \"estimated cost\" suggests it could also be a purchase request. Given the context, it sounds like this ticket might best fit under \"Purchase,\" but part of me thinks it could also relate to \"Internal Project.\" Let's assign it to \"Purchase\" for clarity.**Finalizing category decision**\n\nThe category \"Purchase\" seems fitting since the request appears to be about procuring a slave node, which is a type of CI agent. \"Internal Project\" could work too, especially with mentions of roles like \"design lead\" and \"software consultant.\" They're seeking an \"estimated cost\" and discussing steps related to the project, but overall, it sounds like a procurement request. I'll go ahead and respond with the JSON object indicating the \"Purchase\" category to keep it clear and straightforward.**Providing the response**\n\nI just need to create a simple JSON object with the category field set to \"Purchase.\" It sounds straightforward; I want to keep it concise and clear. I'll respond with exactly:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nThat way, it\u2019s easy to understand and follows the set format without any extra information. Let's deliver this succinctly!"
