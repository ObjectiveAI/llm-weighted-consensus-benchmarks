The ticket mentions \"error\" and \"infrastructure programme manager upcoming leave,\" which is a bit messy. It sounds like it could fit into \"Administrative Rights\" or maybe \"Internal Project\" since it relates to an infrastructure program. It could also be an \"Access\" issue if it's about login or submission problems, or possibly \"Miscellaneous\" if it doesn't clearly fit.**Analyzing submission error**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"submit for last week,\" which suggests a submission failure rather than access rights, although there is an error mentioned. It could be classified as \"Internal Project\" since it relates to an infrastructure program and a manager's leave. There are repeated phrases like \"error,\" \"cannot,\" and \"need submit for last week,\" indicating a request for help. If they require permission to submit, it might fit \"Administrative Rights,\" but it doesn't seem definitive. I should choose one clear category.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI believe \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category since the ticket references an \"infrastructure programme manager\" and mentions \"upcoming leave\" along with needing to \"submit last week,\" indicating a project report. The repetition of \"error\" suggests a bug in an internal project portal too. I should format my response according to the provided schema, creating a JSON-like object that sets the category. The final output will look like this: \n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
