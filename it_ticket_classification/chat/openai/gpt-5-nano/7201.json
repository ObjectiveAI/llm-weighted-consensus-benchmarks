The ticket mentions a broken screen that requires urgent replacement, which clearly falls under hardware issues. However, it also includes references to moving users manually and AD reconciliation, which could relate to access or administrative rights. While the primary category seems to be Hardware, I need to consider that it could also fit under Access or Administrative rights due to the Active Directory context. So, I'll categorize it as Hardware.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe task is to categorize an IT ticket efficiently. Given the urgent replacement for a broken screen, the category clearly aligns with \"Hardware.\" I need to format my output as a JSON object, which specifies just one category. It doesn\u2019t seem necessary to propose multiple categories here since the instructions say to provide a single category. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and respond with the required format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
