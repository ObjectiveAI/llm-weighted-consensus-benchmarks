It\u2019s a bit jumbled, but it mentions typical onboarding elements. Given the context, this looks like it pertains to HR onboarding or possibly access provisioning, making \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" the most appropriate categories.**Choosing Ticket Categories**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on its content, which mentions \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"extension.\" It seems likely that this ticket relates to HR onboarding, and could fit into categories like Access, Administrative rights, or HR Support. The mention of a \"starter form\" suggests setting up access to systems, which would point to \"Access\" as the best category. However, it could also fall under HR Support, since that\u2019s directly related to HR forms. I'll make sure to provide a JSON object with the chosen category.**Outputting JSON Category**\n\nI need to provide a JSON object with a category based on the guidelines. The allowed categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. The user\u2019s ticket seems related to onboarding, specifically mentioning \"new starter\" and \"starter form,\" which makes me lean towards the \"Access\" category. This aligns with setting up user accounts and provisioning access. Still, since it also mentions HR elements, I\u2019ll confirm that \"Access\" is definitely the best fit before outputting: {\"category\": \"Access\"}.**Outputting JSON Response**\n\nI need to provide a simple JSON object without any extra text. So, to ensure everything is clear and formatted properly, I will deliver the response as follows: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This keeps it concise and focused on what the user needs. Confirming that I'm ready to submit it!"
