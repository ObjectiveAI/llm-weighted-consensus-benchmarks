I might also consider \"Access\" since it involves navigating and encountering a blank screen. However, the user isn't explicitly mentioning login, which leans more toward software problems. While some might categorize it as \"Hardware,\" since they mention a monitor, I feel it's more accurate to go with \"Miscellaneous.\" So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Determining response format**\n\nI'm reviewing the tool's \"Response Formats,\" which indicates I need to respond with a specific category in a JSON format. The options available include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Since I want to classify the user's issue, \"Miscellaneous\" seems appropriate. I think it's best to keep the response concise and just provide the JSON object without any additional text. So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
