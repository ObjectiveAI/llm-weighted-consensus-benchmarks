There's also the mention of \"accept decline,\" which might hint at RSVP, suggesting it\u2019s about admin rights too.**Categorizing IT Ticket Request**\n\nThe request seems to be about sharing a template, which doesn\u2019t strictly fall under IT categories like hardware or storage. \"Miscellaneous\" could be too broad. \n\nFor the categories: \n\n- Hardware isn\u2019t relevant here.\n- HR Support could fit because it's related to induction sessions, which ties to HR onboarding. \n- \"Internal Project\" may also apply if the template is part of a broader initiative. \n- Lastly, it might touch on \"Administrative rights\" since it's about accessing shared resources.**Determining Category for Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking it could be categorized as \"Internal Project\" since it's related to a template for internal induction sessions, but it's mainly about sharing a document. \"Administrative rights\" doesn't seem to apply since there's no indication that access rights are relevant here.\n\n\"HR Support\" feels like the closest fit, especially with the mention of \"induction sessions\" tied to HR onboarding. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and format it as a concise JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
