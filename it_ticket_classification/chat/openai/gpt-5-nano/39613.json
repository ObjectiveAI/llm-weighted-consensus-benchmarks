They mentioned issues with printing an expenses report, specifically that the \"print preview action\" is missing. This could point to a problem related to software features. \n\nLooking at the provided categories \u2014 Admin rights, Access, Hardware, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and HR Support \u2014 I think it would likely fit under \"Access\" since it relates to using a specific function in their system.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think this ticket could potentially fall under \"Administrative rights\" if the user lost access to the print preview action. But it seems more like a software feature issue. So, I\u2019m considering options like \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access.\" The user is specifically requesting help with the print preview function, suggesting it\u2019s related to access. However, since it doesn\u2019t mention anything about login or permission, it feels better categorized as \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\nSo, I'll summarize it as: category: Miscellaneous, with a note about the request for restoring the print preview function for printing expenses reports.**Outputting ticket category**\n\nThe prompt clearly asks me to categorize the IT ticket, meaning I need to provide a JSON object with the specified format. In this case, it will be {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}. The instructions emphasize that I should respond without any extra text or commentary, so I\u2019ll just stick to that.\n\nI'll make sure to provide the clean output as requested: {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}."
