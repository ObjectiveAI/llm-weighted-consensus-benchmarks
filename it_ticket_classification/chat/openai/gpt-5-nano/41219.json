I think categorizing this under \"Access\" is more appropriate since it's about logging in. While \"Administrative rights\" might be a consideration for permissions, it doesn't seem necessary here. I'll stick with \"Access\" because this seems to be the core problem regarding the user's annual leave access.**Categorizing the Leave Issue**\n\nThe user has a ticket saying they need help with an issue related to annual leave, which seems to be connected to a login problem since they mentioned \"cannot log for last week.\" This suggests the issue is access-related to the HR/leave system. I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" For the response, I\u2019ll create a JSON-like object formatted correctly, so it will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll keep it minimal and without extra commentary."
