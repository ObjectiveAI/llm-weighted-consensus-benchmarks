There's not a lot of technical detail provided, so nothing about hardware, storage, purchase, or HR support seems relevant here.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe message says, \"project manager change thursday pm change,\" which suggests there\u2019s a change in the project manager role. It seems like the user is asking to update this in some system, likely pointing to an administrative change. I\u2019m thinking the best fit for the category is \"Internal Project\" since it relates to the project manager's role. Although \"Administrative rights\" could apply if permissions were mentioned, they weren\u2019t in the message. So, it's primarily about the project aspect.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
