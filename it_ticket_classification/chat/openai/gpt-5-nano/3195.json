From the provided options, I see potential categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or perhaps \"Hardware,\" since meeting rooms often involve AV equipment and IT infrastructure. I'll focus on entering a JSON-like structure with one of these relevant categories for the user's needs.**Choosing a category for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at how to best categorize the IT ticket about meeting room setup and cabling documentation. The options I have are varied, including \"Hardware\" and \"Internal Project.\" Since this seems to involve an ongoing project for meeting room infrastructure, \"Internal Project\" could be the right fit. The reference to documentation also hints at system governance. I'll finalize my choice as \"Internal Project\" and format it as a JSON object for clarity.**Outputting the category**\n\nI\u2019m tasked with providing a JSON object that categorizes the IT ticket. The category should be exactly \"Internal Project,\" as specified. I think I\u2019ll keep it simple and just include that without any additional text. The instruction says to focus on the category object, so my final response will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nThat seems clear and concise! Let\u2019s stick to that format."
