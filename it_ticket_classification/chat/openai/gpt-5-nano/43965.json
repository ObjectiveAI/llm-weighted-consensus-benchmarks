They're facing a \"net use problem\" with accessing a folder and receiving an error. I see that this ticket best fits the \"Access\" category since it relates to access issues involving network drive mapping. It could be considered \"Storage,\" but it's not about hardware, so \"Access\" really seems the most appropriate. I'll go ahead and format the output as {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Outputting JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON-like object based on the prompt. It's clear that the expected format is a JSON with the category specified as \"Access.\" There shouldn't be any extra text or explanation; just the JSON object itself is required. I'll make sure the spelling is exact. So, my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's go ahead and present that!"
