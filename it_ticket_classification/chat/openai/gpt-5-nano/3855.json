Terms like \"pre sales code\" and \"programme portfolio officer\" complicate things\u2014I'm wondering if \"Access\" or \"Internal Project\" fits better here. If it's about system permissions, then \"Access\" might be the way to go. Alternatively, if it relates to a project, then \"Internal Project\" could work. The details are a bit unclear, though!**Classifying IT Request**\n\nIn the user\u2019s request, there\u2019s mention of \"pre sales,\" \"code,\" and \"per attached form.\" It looks like they want help creating a code, probably for a project or program. I think \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit for categorization since the term \"programme portfolio officer\" suggests a project role. Alternatively, \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it related to access, but the user didn\u2019t mention rights. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and respond accordingly!**Formatting IT Ticket Response**\n\nThe user asked to categorize an IT ticket, and I see that I need to return a JSON object with the \"category\" field. Based on my earlier reasoning, I\u2019ll classify it as \"Internal Project.\" So, I'll produce the answer exactly in the required format without any extra words or content. Just the clear and concise JSON response it needs! Here we go: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
