The category options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. \n\nGiven the references to \"new starter\" and \"starter form,\" it seems best to classify this under \"HR Support,\" as it relates to onboarding processes. I\u2019ll create a JSON-like object to reflect this categorization accurately.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm assessing which category to assign to this IT ticket. The user\u2019s message mentions a \"starter form,\" which relates to onboarding\u2014a usual HR task. While \"Access\" refers to IT granting system access, it seems more aligned with HR processes this time. \n\nConsidering the context of new starters and forms, the \"HR Support\" category appears to be the best fit for this ticket. I'll categorize it there, as it directly relates to onboarding.**Parsing IT Ticket Content**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the content of the message. It appears to concern a \"starter form\" related to a new hire, with requests for filling out sections. This leans towards HR matters rather than IT access or hardware issues. \n\nSo, I think the best choice here is to categorize it under \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object following the specified schema: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll ensure it's structured correctly, as only the JSON object is needed.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
