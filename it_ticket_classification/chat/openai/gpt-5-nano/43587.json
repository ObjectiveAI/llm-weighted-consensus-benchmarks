It mentions issues related to \"cannot open trackers from template,\" suggesting it's a problem with the ticketing system, possibly ServiceNow. The ticket focuses on template functionality and filling fields. The categories I can use include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Based on the context, I'll likely categorize it under \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nIt seems this issue is related to an application or system settings. It could fit under \"Access,\" or maybe \"Administrative rights\" if admin access is needed to fix the template. I also consider \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" The ticket mentions difficulties opening trackers and a request to raise a ticket related to ServiceNow (SNOW), specifically to fix how the template fills fields. Given the context, it\u2019s primarily about template issues rather than hardware or access.**Selecting a Category**\n\nThe best fitting category for this ticket seems to be either \"Administrative rights\" or potentially \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Administrative rights\" involve permissions, which might be relevant if template access is an issue. The user's request to \"raise a ticket with snow\" implies it's about ServiceNow, focusing on a bug with the template. It mentions that the template should auto-fill fields, indicating a process problem. While \"Access\" is relevant, it's not strictly accurate given the context. I\u2019ll lean towards \"Administrative rights\" as the most appropriate choice.**Deciding on the Category**\n\nThe user isn't asking for permission rights; they want the template to auto-fill correctly. \"Internal Project\" could fit if it ties to an internal task, but \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the safest choice for a broad IT issue. I need to create a JSON structure that properly categorizes the issue. The required format should just include the category field, which needs to be exactly named \"category.\" So I\u2019m planning to output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Although, I\u2019m still considering \"Access\" if permission issues are involved.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
