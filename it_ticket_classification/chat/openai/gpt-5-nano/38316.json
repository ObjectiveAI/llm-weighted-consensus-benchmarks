The user's text is clearly related to IT, though the grammar isn\u2019t great. I need to choose the best category from the predefined options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. My goal is to analyze the content and determine the most appropriate category before outputting a JSON object with the chosen category.**Interpreting user request**\n\nI need to parse a user's request about adjusting views in an application, specifically regarding ServiceNow. The text is quite jumbled, but it seems the user wants to fix issues with how views display search results. They mention wanting to simplify the view to show only essential information: number active, summary, created, assignee, owner, and location. They also suggest adding more fields and indicate a need to manage incident listings and approval history.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, which is about adjusting views in an application, possibly ServiceNow. I'm considering the categories available: Administrative rights, Internal Project, Miscellaneous, and others. It could fit under Administrative rights if it involves permissions. However, it might also fall into Internal Project if it's a request for internal adjustments. Since it's not related to hardware, storage, HR, or purchases, I should pick the best category based on its context.**Determining the category**\n\nThis request seems to align with \"Administrative rights\" because it involves adjusting views and permissions. However, the mention of \u201cend list for incidents\u201d suggests it relates to ServiceNow modules. I\u2019m leaning toward \"Administrative rights\" since it could involve modifying view settings for a corporate platform. But it might also be an \"Internal Project\" aimed at changing ITSM views. Ultimately, since the user has asked to categorize it, I\u2019ll need to pick the most fitting category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
