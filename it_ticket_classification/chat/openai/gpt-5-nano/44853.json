It\u2019s important to make sure the tickets are properly addressed! Let\u2019s get this sorted out in a way that makes sense and is easy to navigate.**Interpreting the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve got a ticket saying there's an urgent issue where someone can't open files that were sent on Wednesday, highlighting the importance as high. It looks like there\u2019s downtime for maintenance, and the web app view might not show documents for a while. The user mentions others having similar issues and offers a workaround with the open explorer option. I\u2019ll need to make sure we categorize this correctly since it seems centered on file access and app functionality during maintenance.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
