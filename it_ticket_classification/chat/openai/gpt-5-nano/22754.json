It sounds like they want to add two \"PM devices\" or \"presentation management devices,\" but I'm not entirely sure. Considering the available categories, it should fit under \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" Since they're requesting new devices, that leans towards \"Purchase,\" but it might involve hardware installation too. I\u2019ll choose \"Purchase\" as the best fit for this request.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket is requesting new devices for two conference rooms, which suggests that it's about hardware procurement and installation. I\u2019m deciding between \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase\" as the best category. \"Hardware\" seems more appropriate since it relates directly to equipment. However, some organizations might use \"Purchase\" for procurement requests. The keywords point to a request for adding devices, not asking for permission. So, I\u2019ll choose \"Hardware\" for the JSON response: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize the request as \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" Since the user is asking for new devices for two conference rooms, \"Purchase\" could fit if it\u2019s about procurement. They mention adding two devices, which leans toward hardware, but if the system typically designates procurement requests as \"Purchase,\" that might be more accurate. However, I think \"Hardware\" is simpler and appropriate for this ticket. I'll respond with a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
