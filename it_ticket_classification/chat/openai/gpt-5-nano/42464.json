I\u2019m thinking it could be \"Access\" since it\u2019s about joining calls, but it's not a login issue. It might also relate to \"Hardware\" if it\u2019s a device problem, but I\u2019m still unsure which category fits best. I\u2019ll finalize it soon!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned their mobile phone works, but they couldn't join conference calls, which seems to point to a software or service issue. I'm thinking the best category might be \"Access\" since it's about accessing calls, or maybe \"Miscellaneous\" if I'm unsure. However, I should pick the most appropriate category and follow the required format. I need to output it in a JSON-like structure, so I'll ensure it fits the schema given!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
