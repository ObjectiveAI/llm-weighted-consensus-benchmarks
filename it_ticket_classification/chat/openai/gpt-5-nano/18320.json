The ticket has phrases like \"replace files for service\" and asks for help with attachments. This suggests it's about handling files, which makes \"Storage\" a fitting category. However, I also need to consider \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are involved or \"Internal Project\" if it's project-related. \"Miscellaneous\" could apply, but it seems less likely given the context.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering whether to categorize the ticket as \"Administrative rights\" since there might be permission needs for replacing files. However, the user didn\u2019t mention access issues directly. They brought up \"files attached\" and \"restart,\" hinting at a possible service schedule. I need to create a JSON-like category spec, following the schema provided. The likely categories seem to be \"Storage,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Access.\" I need to pick one based on the context.**Parsing IT Ticket Details**\n\nLet\u2019s break down the user's request: they mention \"replace files for service Tuesday March PM,\" suggesting they might need to replace files due to a service scheduled at that time. The phrase \"files attached\" indicates there are attachments involved, and since they're asking for help again, perhaps they want to revert to an earlier version. In terms of categories, \"Storage\" seems the best fit for file handling. I\u2019m going to create a JSON response with the category set to \"Storage.\"**Delivering Category Object**\n\nI\u2019m ready to respond with the category object for the IT ticket. The instruction is clear: I should provide the JSON object without any extra information or context. So, I\u2019ll simply output: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. This keeps it straightforward and follows the guidelines perfectly. Let\u2019s go ahead and deliver that!"
