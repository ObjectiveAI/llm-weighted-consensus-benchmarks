The options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket mentions creating a job for SonarQube analysis. It seems related to an internal project since it deals with coding and repository management. I think \"Internal Project\" is probably the best fit for this ticket, given its focus on a development task. Let's go with that!**Categorizing Sonar job request**\n\nThe user is asking to create a job for Sonar code analysis, which seems related to a project task. I think the best category for this request is \"Internal Project,\" since it focuses on development work. Although I considered \"Administrative rights\" in case they needed permissions, there\u2019s no explicit mention of that. I\u2019ll make sure to format my response as a JSON object with the required category: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That should do it!**Ensuring proper JSON formatting**\n\nI need to make sure my response contains no extra punctuation and that the allowed values are spelled exactly as specified. This means I'll carefully format the JSON object to meet the requirements. I'll respond with just the correct category, ensuring that everything is precise. It's important to follow this guideline closely so that the output is accurate and helps the user effectively. Let's get that JSON right!"
