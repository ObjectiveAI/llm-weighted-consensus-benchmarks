The ticket emphasizes deleting artifacts and permissions in Nexus, suggesting it's about access rights. Overall, the best fit seems to be \"Administrative rights\" or \"Storage.\"**Determining Ticket Categorization**\n\nThis ticket seems focused on \"Nexus,\" a repository manager, and involves cleanup due to wrong artifact versions. While permissions to delete aren\u2019t explicitly stated, phrases like \"update right nexus has assigned\" hint at needed permissions, suggesting \"Administrative rights\" could be a good category. However, since the ticket centers around artifact cleanup, including the need to delete wrong versions, it might not fully align with user rights. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too broad, so \"Administrative rights\" appears to be the best fit.**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nI\u2019m weighing between \"Storage\" and \"Administrative rights\" for this ticket. The main request involves deleting artifacts due to wrong versions, which suggests storage cleanup. However, \"Storage\" typically refers to hardware or data storage issues. \"Access\" relates to login or permission issues, but the repeated mention of \"update right nexus has assigned\" directly points to rights in Nexus. Since \"Administrative rights\" explicitly mentions rights, I\u2019ll choose that category. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object with \"Administrative rights\" as the category.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
