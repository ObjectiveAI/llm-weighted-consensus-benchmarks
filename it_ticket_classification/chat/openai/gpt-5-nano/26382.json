Since \"new starter\" suggests onboarding, it could fit into several categories like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"HR Support.\" However, the most fitting category seems to be \"Access,\" given the focus on credentials and user groups. I'll categorize it accordingly!**Assigning IT ticket category**\n\nThis ticket is about onboarding a new starter, mentioning \"AD has created\" and \"please find credentials.\" It indicates user creation in Active Directory, focusing on credentials and group assignments. I think it's mostly about \"Access\" provisioning. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if admin rights were requested, the text doesn't directly state that. It emphasizes access to various groups, making \"Access\" the best fit for categorization. I'll go with that!**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that \"Access\" is the most fitting category for this ticket. The list includes categories like Hardware, HR Support, and Administrative Rights. Based on the instructions, I need to format my answer as a JSON-like object with a \"category\" field. Since this ticket involves AD credentials and group assignments, I\u2019ll respond accordingly. So the final output will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra text!"
