The request is about changing a broken network cable in meeting rooms with high importance, mentioning client relations. It seems clear that this is primarily a hardware issue related to the broken cable. While I considered \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" those don't fit as well since it's specifically about the cable replacement. So, \"Hardware\" looks like the best choice for this ticket.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to output a structured JSON object according to the schema provided. It specifies that the category must be one of the enumerated values, and \"Hardware\" fits perfectly. I want to ensure that my response matches the expected format exactly. \n\nSo, I'm finalizing my response as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nIt seems that adding anything else might complicate things, so I'll keep it simple and stick to just this category.**Generating JSON output**\n\nThe user is asking for just the category in a clean JSON format, so I need to keep it minimal and free of any extraneous text. I want to make sure there\u2019s no heavy formatting, just the straightforward JSON.\n\nGiven the context of the request regarding a \"meeting rooms floor,\" it confirms that this is indeed a hardware repair. \n\nSo, the response will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"} \n\nI\u2019ll stick to this clear output!"
