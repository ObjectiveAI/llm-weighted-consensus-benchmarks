It mentions a video device installed in what might be the \"Fuji room\" (or is it \u201cFiji room\u201d?) and seems to relate to needing ports opened for the video conferencing device, likely Cisco Jabber. I\u2019ll have to decide whether this fits best under \"Hardware\" or perhaps another category like \"Access\" based on the context of the request.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a ticket related to a video conference device that requires network configuration because ports need to be opened. This seems to involve access issues for the video device, which suggests the \"Access\" category might be a fit. Although it could also be seen as \"Hardware\" since it's a physical device, the primary issue here revolves around enabling network access for video, making \"Access\" the most appropriate choice for this ticket.**Formatting response in JSON**\n\nI've decided that the ticket category is \"Access.\" Now, I need to respond with a JSON object as specified in the prompt. The required format is simple: I need to create an object with the key \"category\" and assign it the value \"Access.\" I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text or explanation\u2014just the raw JSON response. So, I'll output it as follows: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
