It mentions project setup, assignments, and templates along with a reference to \"forms policies procedures.\" \n\nGiven the context, it seems this ticket is related to setting up a project, likely falling under \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" However, I\u2019ll need to double-check to make sure I'm placing it correctly in one of the defined categories.**Evaluating IT ticket category**\n\nI'm looking at words like \"setup,\" \"project setup,\" and \"assigned\" to help me figure out how to categorize this ticket. It mentions tasks like creating a code platform and details about an order fill card, which may indicate a connection to procurement.\n\nHowever, it's not exactly a fit for \"Purchase.\" The ticket seems primarily related to \"project setup\" and task assignments. So, I think \"Internal Project\" is the most suitable category here, and \"Administrative Rights\" could also apply if access rights are being requested.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering categorizing this IT ticket as either \"Internal Project\" or \"Access.\" The text has repeated mentions of \"setup\" and \"code platform,\" suggesting it's more about project activities rather than access rights. \n\nI need to respond with the right JSON format, which includes specifying the exact category string. Based on my reasoning, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit here. So, I\u2019ll prepare the response as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll stick to the format without adding extra notes since the instructions specify a JSON object."
