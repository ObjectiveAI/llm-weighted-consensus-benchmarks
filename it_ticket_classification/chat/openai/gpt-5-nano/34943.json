The available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given that it's a server-related issue, \"Hardware\" seems the most appropriate. Though \"Miscellaneous\" could also fit, it's predominantly a hardware/system issue. Since there are no login concerns, I will choose \"Hardware.\" I'll format the response as a JSON category object as instructed!**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI'm focusing on how to format the output as a JSON object. The specified category for this IT ticket is \"Hardware,\" so I'll craft it in the required shape. The format is defined as a JSON object with the structure: {\"category\": \"value\"}. Thus, I'll create it as {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. \n\nEven though I could add a note or confirmation, the instruction clearly states to output just the category object. So, I'll keep it straightforward and provide: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}."
