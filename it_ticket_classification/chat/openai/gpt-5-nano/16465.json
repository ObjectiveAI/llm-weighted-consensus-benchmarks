It looks like I have to find the best fit from the categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.\n\nI see mentions of \"pipeline to be removed,\" \"upgrade app,\" and \"core teams.\" Still, the ticket is garbled. I\u2019ll need to determine which category fits best based on those elements. Let\u2019s analyze it more closely!**Categorizing project tasks**\n\nIt seems like the IT project mainly involves removing pipelines and upgrading apps, leading me to think \"Internal Project\" fits best. I considered \"Administrative rights\" since there could be a request for access, but it feels less relevant without an explicit mention of access. The mention of \"core teams\" and \"pipeline to be removed\" adds context but still keeps it generic. Therefore, I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" and respond with the required JSON format.\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
