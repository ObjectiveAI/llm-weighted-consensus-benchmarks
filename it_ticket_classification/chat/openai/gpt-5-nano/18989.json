I\u2019ll take a moment to analyze the ticket details and determine which category aligns most closely with the content of the ticket.**Analyzing ticket content**\n\nThe ticket describes problems with user rights, issue types, linked issues, and adding members for a project management tool. It seems the user is facing confusion regarding permissions and needs assistance with re-setup. Their request hints at misunderstandings about their access rights and issues with creating links, possibly affecting multiple users. I should categorize this ticket under \"Access,\" as it directly relates to permission and rights. I'll ensure clear communication to address these concerns effectively.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
