The ticket asks for assistance with the subscription.  \n\nWe have a category schema with options like Purchase and Access. Since this is primarily about the licensing or purchase of a software subscription, I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"Purchase.\" I did wonder if \"Access\" or maybe even \"Administrative rights\" might apply, but \"Purchase\" seems to fit best here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt seems \"Internal Project\" isn't the right fit here. I think the best category is \"Purchase\" since the request is specifically for a professional subscription license. While \"Access\" could be relevant if they're unable to access it due to expiration, the focus on acquiring a license suggests that \"Purchase\" is more appropriate. \n\nSo, I'll output a simple JSON object: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}` to keep it minimal and aligned with the instructions."
