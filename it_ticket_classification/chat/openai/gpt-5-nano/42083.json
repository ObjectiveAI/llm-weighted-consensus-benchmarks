They mention \"old submissions,\" which could refer to outdated data. Given their error revolves around a submission issue, I should select a category from the predefined list. The likely categories are \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or possibly \"Access\" if login issues are involved. The context seems to point towards an application-related problem.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI see that the ticket involves an Oracle error when trying to submit something, with a message indicating it can't proceed. The phrase about \"some old have submitted\" suggests there are old submissions involved. Since there\u2019s no category specifically for \"Software\" or \"Application,\" the best fits seem to be \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or maybe \"Access\" if it's a permissions issue. However, since this ticket isn't directly about accessing rights, I think \"Internal Project\" might be most appropriate.**Choosing a category**\n\nI see there's a category schema I need to follow for the IT ticket. This includes options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and others. Based on the user's description of an Oracle error during a submission process, I think \"Internal Project\" is a suitable choice, since it likely relates to an internal application. However, if I'm unsure, \"Miscellaneous\" might be a safer fallback. The context indicates it's not about hardware or HR issues, so that helps narrow it down.**Responding with category**\n\nThe error message indicates that the user cannot proceed, which might relate to permissions, but since there's no mention of login issues, I won\u2019t categorize this as \"Access.\" \"Internal Project\" is looking like a good fit. So, I\u2019ll make a JSON snippet as the response. Since the user didn't ask for an explanation, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and just present the JSON object with the exact casing. Here\u2019s my final response:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
