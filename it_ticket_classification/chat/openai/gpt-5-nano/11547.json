They've provided a somewhat unclear text that mentions missing July PM reports and cleaning reports related to direct reports. The repeated request to \"double these two persons reports\" might hint at a problem concerning access or perhaps a mix-up in records. I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing this as \u201cAccess\u201d since it seems more relevant than the other options listed in the schema. So, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object accordingly.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket regarding missing reports, and it might fit into a couple of categories. The options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the references to \"direct reports missing July PM reports\" and the cleaning and potential duplication of reports, I think \"HR Support\" fits best. This seems like an HR-related issue regarding missing or duplicate performance reviews. So, I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support\" for the categorization.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
