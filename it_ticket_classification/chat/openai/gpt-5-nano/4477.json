The ticket discusses issues related to time cards, including submissions and errors, which seems to relate to HR or payroll systems. Since \"HR Support\" matches best, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Ensuring correct JSON format**\n\nI need to follow the required format exactly as specified. The prompt asks me to categorize the IT ticket, and the output must be in a structured JSON format that includes the \"category\" field. For this ticket, after considering the content related to timecards and submission issues, I've determined that \"HR Support\" fits best. So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\u2014no extra text, just the JSON object as needed."
