It seems relevant to \"Access,\" since it involves managing approval rights. However, it also fits \"Administrative rights,\" as this directly relates to changing who holds approver privileges. I'll decide on \"Administrative rights\" as the best category.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket mentions wanting to remove a PC change approver, which involves an access or permission change in ServiceNow. It could fit into the \"Access\" category, but \"Administrative rights\" seems more specific since it directly relates to modifying approval workflows. Although this isn\u2019t about user account rights, it pertains to approval privileges. I think I'll go with \"Administrative rights.\" Then, I'll format my response as JSON to reflect this category choice.**Returning the Category in JSON**\n\nI need to provide a JSON object with either \"category\":\"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" Since the instruction is to categorize an IT ticket, I should return a minimal answer. The category field must be one of the enumerated values. I think the best choice, given the context, is \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nSo, I will respond simply with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nI'll keep it straightforward without any extra commentary, focusing only on delivering the necessary information."
