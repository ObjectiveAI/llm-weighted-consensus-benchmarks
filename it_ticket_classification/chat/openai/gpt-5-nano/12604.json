The ticket refers to a \"bulk starter form\" for interns, hinting at onboarding. It seems most related to \"HR Support\" since it's about intern onboarding forms. \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t quite fit because the ticket doesn\u2019t mention permissions specifically. So, it looks like \"HR Support\" is the best choice here.**Outputting JSON for Category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the ticket as \"HR Support.\" The required output format is a JSON object, specifically needing a \"category\" field. Based on the instructions, I\u2019ll provide the JSON object as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.\n\nIt seems like there\u2019s some confusion regarding whether the output should include just the category or follow a more complex structure. Since the instructions clearly ask for the category, I\u2019ll stick with my output of {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} to keep it straightforward and proper!**Confirming Category Format**\n\nI\u2019m checking if \"HR Support\" fits the enumerations provided, and yes, it does! So, I'll keep it concise and only include the object itself. The instructions seem to indicate that the grader prefers the exact category without any extra text. Therefore, my final output will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Let's go with that!"
