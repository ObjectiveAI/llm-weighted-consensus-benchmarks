I have predefined options like Access and Administrative rights to choose from. Since the ticket specifically requests help with a password reset instead of admin rights, \"Access\" seems like the best choice.**Formatting category as JSON**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object for the IT ticket category. The required format specifies having a \"category\" key with an allowed value from the given options. For this case, I think \"Access\" matches well based on the ticket's context. So, I will return it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The platform seems to prefer this specific object, and since the instructions emphasize conciseness, I won\u2019t include extra text\u2014just the JSON snippet.**Clarifying user request**\n\nI want to make sure I understand the content from the user: they mention \"ad password expired tuesday.\" This leads me to think it refers to an \"AD\" password expiration issue. They also included something like \"please help,\" indicating they likely need assistance with this. Since it\u2019s definitely related to Active Directory and access issues, \"Access\" is indeed the right category to respond with. Alright, let\u2019s move forward with that!"
