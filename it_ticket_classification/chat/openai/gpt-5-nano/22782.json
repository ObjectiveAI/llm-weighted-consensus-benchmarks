However, the ticket's overall message is quite messy, which makes it challenging to pinpoint a clear classification.**Analyzing IT ticket categories**\n\nI see keywords like \"galaxy back cover screen protector,\" which suggests hardware accessories, and \"subscription,\" which implies a software subscription. The phrase \"create installation deliver device downstairs\" indicates they want installation and delivery. \"Add sn\" likely refers to adding a serial number. \n\nThe ticket mentions \"purchase,\" so it leans toward the \"Purchase\" category, although \"Administrator rights\" could be relevant, but it seems unlikely. \"Access,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Internal Project\" don't fit, while \"Miscellaneous\" might be a stretch. We need to settle on one category!**Categorizing device installation request**\n\nThe ticket seems focused on procuring a device and organizing the delivery and installation. The likely categories are \"Purchase,\" \"Hardware,\" or even \"Administrative rights.\" Given the user mentions \"purchase has items,\" along with \"delivery\" and \"installation,\" I think \"Hardware\" fits best as it's primarily about devices and accessories. While \"Purchase\" could work if it strictly pertains to buying items, the request clearly leans toward hardware. It looks like we should go with \"Hardware\" for this categorization!**Finalizing category response**\n\nI\u2019m working through how to categorize this IT ticket, which mentions \"purchase\" alongside items like \"galaxy back cover\" and \"screen protector,\" suggesting they're looking for hardware accessories. Since the focus is on devices and installation, \"Hardware\" seems like the most appropriate category. The user wants a clean output in JSON format, so I\u2019ll stick to that requirement. I\u2019ll ensure to return just the category in the specified structure: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
