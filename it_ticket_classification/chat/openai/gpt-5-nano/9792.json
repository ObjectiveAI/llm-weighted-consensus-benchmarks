The ticket mentions terms like \"Oracle,\" \"delegate,\" \"approvals,\" and \"holiday,\" which makes me think it might relate to access or administrative rights. The repetition of \"delegate\" and the context about approvals suggests it could be about access approvals. Given the categories available, I'll lean toward \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, the text is a bit garbled, so it's challenging to be sure.**Categorizing ticket details**\n\nThe ticket seems to mention \"Oracle delegate approvals\" and \"user guide details\" related to planned holidays. This could mean it's asking for delegation approvals during a holiday, possibly needing either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" On one hand, \"delegate\" may refer to user accounts in Oracle, and on the other, it\u2019s about approvals that typically fall under administrative rights. Since the text hints at needing permissions, I might categorize it as \"Access,\" though \"Administrative rights\" could also fit due to the context.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
