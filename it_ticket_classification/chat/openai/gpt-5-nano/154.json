The response should be a JSON object specifying the category type. I\u2019ll ensure it follows the exact format required by the system, so I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I think I\u2019ve got this right!**Providing JSON Response**\n\nThe user requested to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to return just the category in JSON format. The \"category\" field is required, and the instruction clearly indicates it should be formatted as a JSON object. Based on my understanding, I'll respond with {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll double-check to make sure the quotes are in the right place and that \"Internal Project\" matches the enumerated value. No extra commentary; just the JSON is needed!"
