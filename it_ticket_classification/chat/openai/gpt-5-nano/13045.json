The mention of \"new starter tower\" probably refers to a PC or desktop for the new employee. The request to change accounts to permanent status makes me think about Access or Administrative rights. I see that the catalog includes categories like Access and Administrative rights, so I\u2019ll lean toward \"Access\" for this ticket.**Parsing IT ticket content**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the content about changing account statuses, which likely refers to converting contract accounts to permanent user status. The user described as \"specialist\" has asked me to categorize the IT ticket. The message is a bit jumbled, but key points include the reference to a \"new starter tower,\" which indicates a computer for a new hire, and the request to change intern accounts to permanent status. I'll need to select an appropriate category based on these elements.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
