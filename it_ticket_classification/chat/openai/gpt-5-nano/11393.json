The request seems to involve adding people to a mailing list, so I think it fits under \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d since it relates to permissions for mailing list management. It might also be considered \u201cAccess,\u201d as adding people pertains to accessing a mailing list resource. Other categories like \u201cHR Support,\u201d \u201cPurchase,\u201d \u201cStorage,\u201d or \u201cHardware\u201d are irrelevant. I\u2019ll output a JSON format including the chosen category.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe instruction is to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to provide a JSON object with a category based on given values. The ticket mentions adding people to an engineering mailing list. This likely relates to access control, making \"Access\" a plausible choice. However, since it's a request to modify group membership, \"Administrative rights\" could work too. I\u2019ll consider which category fits best before outputting the JSON with the correct value.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m contemplating whether to categorize the ticket under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \"Access\" is a more general term for access to systems or accounts, while \"Administrative rights\" specifically relates to permissions for certain resources. Since the request involves adding someone to a mailing list, which is definitely an administrative change, \"Administrative rights\" seems like the more accurate category. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" and format my response in JSON: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
