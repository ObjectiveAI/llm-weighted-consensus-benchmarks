They mention receiving multiple notifications for the same issue and include a lead ID image. I can consider options like \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but it seems to hint at a duplication issue affecting many users. Depending on the specific context, it could also fit under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll choose the best category based on these clues.**Determining ticket category**\n\nFor this IT ticket, the most fitting category seems to be \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Internal Project\" since it revolves around Oracle notifications. It's unlikely to be about hardware or storage, and while it could touch on access, it doesn\u2019t seem to fit there either. I'll prepare a JSON object to categorize it, responding with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}\n\nThe mention of \"lead id image\" seems a bit confusing, but it doesn't appear directly relevant to the category. So I'll stick with \"Miscellaneous\" for the duplication issue.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nThe system is prompting me to categorize an IT ticket based on a specific instruction. The given categories are listed in a JSON-like format. To meet the requirement, I\u2019ll provide a simple and direct JSON object, with \"Miscellaneous\" being the best fit for this ticket.\n\nSo, I will output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}\n\nThere's no need for a lengthy explanation, as the prompt doesn't call for it. Just delivering the JSON object will suffice."
