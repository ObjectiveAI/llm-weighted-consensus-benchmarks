It appears to be about creating a new Confluence space for a data science practice, focusing on naming the site, handling logos, and establishing owner rights. The ticket is related to a collaboration tool, Confluence, and involves administrative aspects. The available categories include \"Internal Project,\" which seems the most fitting for this request since it involves setting up a new site.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize the IT ticket and weighing between \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d and \u201cInternal Project.\u201d The ticket discusses creating a Confluence site and mentions \"owner rights,\" which indicates administrative tasks. It seems about assigning rights for a new data science practice space. I could see how \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d fits best since it focuses on granting rights. However, \u201cInternal Project\u201d could also apply due to the new project aspect. Overall, I\u2019ll go with \"Administrative rights\" for clarity.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
