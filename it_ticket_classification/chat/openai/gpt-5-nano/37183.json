The user mentions various issues related to database entries and public holidays affecting data. I'm considering categories like \"Internal Project\" due to the weekly project data aspect, while \"Administrative rights\" might fit if there's a lack of access to enter data. However, since \"Oracle support\" is mentioned, it could hint at \"Storage,\" but that seems a stretch. Overall, \"Internal Project\" seems most fitting.**Parsing the support request**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the request that includes issues like no entry of weekly project data because of a public holiday. The user is trying to enter this data into a database but can't seem to press the next buttons. They reference a message about a database issue related to a public holiday in Germany. Given these details, categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" seems most appropriate. However, \"Administrative rights\" could apply if their inability to press buttons relates to rights, even though that's not explicitly mentioned.**Formatting the response**\n\nI\u2019m confirming that the answer should be in JSON format. The system's schema indicates that we need to respond with a JSON object that includes the category as a string. Therefore, I\u2019ll produce:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}  \n\nIt\u2019s important to follow this strict formatting, as the requirement specifies no additional text or explanations. The output must be exactly in the specified JSON format, so I\u2019ll make sure no extra information is included. Let's stick to this concise requirement!"
