The phrase \"require change rights\" could indicate a request for Administrative rights, which is a specific category for elevated permissions. The mention of \"germany\" suggests a location. Overall, I would classify the ticket primarily under Administrative rights, given the context of changing permissions.**Classifying IT Ticket Categories**\n\nI'm focusing on how to categorize the IT ticket regarding Oracle access and changing rights. This ticket mentions \"change rights,\" clearly indicating a request for Administrative rights rather than just general access. The allowed categories are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\", but since it specifies wanting to change rights, Administrative rights is the more suitable choice. I'll format my final output in a JSON object, ensuring I include only the necessary category value.**Preparing the JSON Response**\n\nI\u2019m ready to respond with the JSON object for the IT ticket classification. The correct category is \"Administrative rights,\" and it's important to keep my response concise. I won\u2019t add any extra explanations or text, just the required JSON format. I\u2019ll make sure to use proper quotation marks and follow the guidelines strictly. It\u2019s all about clarity and precision here! So my final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
