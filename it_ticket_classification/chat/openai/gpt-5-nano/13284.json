It looks like they want to add mailbox groups and access the shared mailbox by mentioning \"expenses com Tuesday PM.\" \n\nBased on the context, the categories I could consider might be \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or maybe even \"Miscellaneous.\" It's likely about granting access and configuring that shared mailbox, so I\u2019ll lean towards either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" for this ticket.**Interpreting IT request**\n\nThe user is asking to add something to a shared mailbox, specifically mentioning \"expenses\" and mailbox groups for Tuesday PM. It looks like they're referring to \"expenses\" as a shared mailbox. They\u2019ve also involved someone named \"leader\" in this request.\n\nSince this is about gaining access to and configuring the shared mailbox, I believe the best category for this would be \"Access.\" I'll format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. Simple enough!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket, so I'll respond with a JSON object containing just the category. Based on the context of the request, \"Access\" seems like the right classification. \n\nI see that the instructions emphasize providing a category in this specific format, so I\u2019ll keep it simple. I\u2019ve decided to format my answer as: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. That should do the trick! Let's go ahead with that."
