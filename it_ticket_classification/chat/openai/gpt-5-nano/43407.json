Given that \"Security\" isn't an option here, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best choice. The final category would be \"Internal Project\".**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm determining the right category for this IT ticket about patching Apache Struts vulnerabilities across servers. It involves vulnerability assessment and requires a project scope. \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option, but it\u2019s less specific. The instructions say to categorize the ticket in JSON format. So, I\u2019ll go with:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nAccording to the requirements, this format includes only the category string.**Outputting JSON correctly**\n\nI need to keep my response concise since extra text isn't required. I'll output only the valid JSON: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. There's a slight consideration about whether \"Access\" could fit, given the mention of external addresses for vulnerability detection. However, since the focus is really on patching and not on access rights, I\u2019ll stick with \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category. Let's go with that!"
