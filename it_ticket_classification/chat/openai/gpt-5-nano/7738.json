I see two potential categories: \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" However, since it's about procuring a monitor, \"Purchase\" might be the better fit. I need to select the most appropriate category from the available options and prepare to format this as a JSON-like object.**Formulating a category response**\n\nThe system defines a category response with specific fields. I need to respond in a JSON format, providing a category value from the allowed options. Initially, I thought \"Hardware\" fits since the ticket requests an additional monitor, but \"Purchase\" might be more accurate because it's a procurement request. The mention of \"developer mobile\" is a bit confusing\u2014is it referring to a person or type of device? Ultimately, I need to categorize this IT ticket appropriately based on the primary request for a monitor.**Choosing the best category**\n\nThe phrase \"additional monitor requirement\" indicates a clear need, but it could imply both a requirement and a purchase. Since the user asked to categorize this request, I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit. I'll keep the response straightforward without adding extra explanations unless requested. The required output format is a JSON object for the category, so I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I'll make sure there\u2019s no risk of misclassification, as the mention of 'developer mobile' doesn\u2019t change the primary request for hardware."
