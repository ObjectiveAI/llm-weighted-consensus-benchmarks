Given the available categories, \"HR Support\" appears to fit best since it deals with leave days. However, since it's an IT ticket, I should double-check if it truly aligns with their needs.**Classifying HR Support**\n\nI believe we should classify this IT ticket as \"HR Support\" since it revolves around leave and holidays, which ties to HR policies. There\u2019s a chance they want to update their leave in a system. I considered \"Administrative rights\" but it doesn't fit here, and \"Miscellaneous\" isn\u2019t suitable either. The user\u2019s request to \"add working days leave holiday\" suggests they\u2019re looking to adjust their leave record. Thus, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object with the category indicating this.**Providing the JSON output**\n\nThe instructions specify that the category must be one of the enumerated options, so I\u2019m going with \"HR Support.\" I need to ensure that there's no extra text or commentary\u2014just the JSON object. The valid channels require plain text, so I\u2019ll format it correctly. If there\u2019s any confusion later, I can always ask for clarification, but for now, I'll keep it straightforward and stick to the category choice without considering \"Administrative rights.\" Here\u2019s the output I\u2019ll provide."
