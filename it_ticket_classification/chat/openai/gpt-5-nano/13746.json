My task is to pick the most appropriate category and output it in a JSON format. I\u2019m wondering which one fits best, taking careful consideration to match the ticket's content to the appropriate category. I\u2019ll focus on making sure the classification is accurate to help with ticket management and follow-ups.**Analyzing IT Ticket Content**\n\nThe ticket content is quite messy and seems to cover issues related to capacity checking, equipment status, and some maintenance discussions. It mentions details about rack units, compliance, and power management, along with communication about change requests. It's clear I need to streamline this information to better categorize it. My aim is to extract relevant details clearly to help with analysis, ensuring I address the maintenance and planning considerations effectively.**Categorizing IT Ticket Content**\n\nThe ticket discusses calibration tests for devices, power management, rack units, and cutting mains, which implies it's infrastructure hardware-related. While access might be relevant due to password updates, the main category should focus on Hardware since it deals with equipment and maintenance in racks. There's also a mention of change requests indicating possible ongoing projects. Ultimately, I\u2019ll categorize it under \"Hardware\" because it aligns best with the core issues in the ticket. I\u2019ll provide that as JSON.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
