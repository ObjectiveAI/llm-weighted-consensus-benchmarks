I need to categorize this ticket into one of the provided categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The structure I need is a JSON object that includes a \"category\" field. Given the context, \"Purchase\" seems to fit best since it relates to the new purchase mentioned. I'll finalize the JSON accordingly.**Categorizing the ticket request**\n\nThe ticket mentions a \"new purchase po\" and specifics about a hot plug hard disk drive, like \"transfer rate\" and \"form factor.\" It seems to be a hardware request, likely related to storage. I need to classify it into either \"Storage\" or \"Purchase.\" However, since it focuses on procuring the hard drive and includes instructions for logging installation and receipts, it aligns more with the \"Purchase\" category. I'll finalize the category based on this context.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe ticket discusses specifics about a hard disk drive and asks to \"log installation\" and receive an item ordered. I need to categorize this IT ticket. Considering it mentions a new purchase PO, \"Purchase\" seems to fit best since it focuses on procurement. While it has hardware details, the main theme is buying. Categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" and \"Access\" don\u2019t apply here. So, I\u2019ll finalize the JSON object with \"Purchase\" as the category.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
