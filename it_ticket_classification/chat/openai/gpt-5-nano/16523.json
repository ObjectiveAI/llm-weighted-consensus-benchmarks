I need to express this as JSON with the appropriate category as a field.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThere are no hardware installation details or procurement mentioned in the ticket. \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could apply to access rights, but that isn\u2019t mentioned here. \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems more appropriate since the ticket is about a planned outage and team coordination. When I look at the categories provided, like Hardware and Miscellaneous, Internal Project stands out as the best fit. So, I'll categorize it as Internal Project and respond with JSON using the specified schema.**Outputting category JSON**\n\nThe task requires me to categorize the ticket using a specific structure, and I need to ensure I\u2019m following the guidelines. The appropriate category is \u201cInternal Project,\u201d so I\u2019ll format my response as JSON. The output should only include the JSON object specified in the instructions, without any additional comments. While some might consider \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d I believe \u201cInternal Project\u201d is a better fit in this case. So, I\u2019ll present it as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
