The possible categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given that the ticket is focused on virtualization and hardware configuration, I'd say it fits best under \"Hardware.\" So, I\u2019ll output a JSON object with \"category\": \"Hardware\".**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it discusses experimentation. But looking at the options: \"Hardware\" deals with issues like BIOS and VT-d; \"Administrative rights\" doesn't apply here; \"Access\" and \"Storage\" are also not relevant. \"Purchase\" isn\u2019t applicable, and \"Miscellaneous\" might fit if nothing else does. However, \"Hardware\" seems best because nested virtualization relies on hardware features and BIOS settings, with the user mentioning \"BIOS mandatory.\" \n\nSo, I\u2019ll output a JSON: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
