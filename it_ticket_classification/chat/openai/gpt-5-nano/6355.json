The message seems a bit garbled, but some terms like \"adaptor broken\" are repeated, and there are references to ordering and flights. \n\nThe instructions specify several categories, including \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" Given the mention of a broken adaptor, my best guess is that it fits into the \u201cHardware\u201d category. I could consider \u201cPurchase,\u201d but it seems less likely. I'll output in the required JSON format.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user seems to want to order a replacement adaptor based on phrases like \"adaptor broken\" and \"please ordered next,\" which I think means they\u2019re asking to order. I consider the \"Purchase\" category, but since the primary issue is about a broken hardware item, it fits best in \"Hardware.\" The rest of the message is a bit unclear, but I believe \"Hardware\" is the most accurate choice. I\u2019ll return the JSON object as required.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nThe task is to follow the specified output format for an IT ticket categorization. Based on the guidelines, I need to return a JSON object. I\u2019ve confirmed that \"Hardware\" is the chosen category based on the user's message about a broken adaptor. So, I\u2019ll deliver the output strictly as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any additional commentary. Just the JSON, and I\u2019m ready to go!"
