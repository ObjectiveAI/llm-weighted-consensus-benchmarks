The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The ticket mentions a problem with loading promotion history when accessing the employee screen. It seems to be an issue with data loading performance or user interface. I\u2019m thinking it fits best under \u201cInternal Project,\u201d but it could also go under \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d if that feels more appropriate.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI need to decide on a category for this IT ticket. It seems to be related to a software feature involving promotion history and an employee's screen, which likely falls under HR. The available categories include \"HR Support,\" \"Internal Project,\" and more. Since it's about HR content within an IT system, \u201cHR Support\u201d seems the best fit. I should then produce a JSON object with \"category\": \"HR Support\" to follow the required format.**Finalizing category output**\n\nI should definitely output a brief justification for the category but the main focus is to provide the correct JSON object for the IT ticket. Since the ticket involves promotion history and is clearly within an HR system, \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category. It doesn\u2019t relate to hardware or storage. Therefore, I\u2019ll return the JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} to clearly meet the expected format. This keeps things straightforward and accurate!**Formatting category JSON**\n\nI need to prepare the correct JSON output for the category endpoint. Based on the schema, it looks like I only need to provide the \"category\" property without any additional metadata. So, I\u2019ll output the JSON object as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This keeps it simple and straightforward\u2014just the essential information without any extra commentary. Let's finalize that!"
