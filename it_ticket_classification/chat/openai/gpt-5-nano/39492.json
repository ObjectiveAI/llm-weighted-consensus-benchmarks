They mentioned several urgent issues, including errors when submitting and OneDrive references, which might lean towards \"Access\" due to submission issues. Alternatively, if it's about OneDrive, \"Storage\" could also fit since OneDrive is a storage service. However, there are mentions of \"internal project\" and a technical programme manager, which makes \"Internal Project\" another strong possibility. I'll need to choose the most appropriate category.**Categorizing project tasks**\n\nThe content describes project logistics and tasks, so it doesn\u2019t fit categories like Hardware or HR. The phrase \u201cunable submit\u201d suggests it might be an \u201cAccess\u201d issue. While \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is an option, \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems more appropriate since it involves a project context with references to a technical programme manager, holidays, and updates. I\u2019ll go ahead and structure my response accordingly, using the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Simple and straightforward!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
