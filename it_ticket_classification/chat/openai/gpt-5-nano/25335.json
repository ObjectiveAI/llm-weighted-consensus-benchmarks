                    "reasoning": "**Interpreting a change request**\n\nIt looks like the user is requesting a change for an Oracle entry related to an \"entries file\" for analysts. The phrase suggests it's a change request within an internal project. The ticket falls under categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" However, since the focus is on changing entries and not granting access, I think it leans more towards an internal change rather than a request for permission.**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nIt seems that the user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket based on the provided text. If I\u2019m uncertain, I should ask for clarification. Since the ticket mentions a \"change\" related to Oracle and involves \"analysts\" and an \"entries file,\" the safest bet is to categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" This feels fitting for a project task, but I could also use \"Miscellaneous\" if nothing else seems appropriate. The lack of a specific \"Database\" category means I should choose between those two.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe phrase \u201chello writing regarding entries file analysts under example part please change\u201d suggests they want to change something related to the \"entries file\" for analysts as part of a project. Considering that, I\u2019d say \"Internal Project\" is the right category. I can justify this by noting it\u2019s an Oracle change related to a project task, and it doesn\u2019t involve hardware or access. I\u2019ll respond in the required JSON format, including the correct category field.**Crafting the output**\n\nI\u2019m preparing to output the category as JSON: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It\u2019s important to maintain case sensitivity since the schema expects the exact enum value. I\u2019ll keep it concise and provide just the JSON since that's the required format, despite the system mentioning that bullet lists are acceptable. So, I'll make sure to present it clearly and correctly in the final output."
