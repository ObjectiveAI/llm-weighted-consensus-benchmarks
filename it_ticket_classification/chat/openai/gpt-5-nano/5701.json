The ticket text is quite a jumble but focuses on \"free space\", \"partition thresholds\", and \"poll status down\", which all suggest it's related to storage. So, categorizing it as \"Storage\" makes sense. I\u2019ll prepare to return JSON with the appropriate category field.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to ensure the JSON string is in the right format, specifically { \"category\": \"Storage\" }. The instructions clearly state I should only include the allowed categories, which I've confirmed. So, I\u2019ll respond simply with: \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}\n\nI must keep it straightforward without any extra commentary or heavy formatting. It\u2019s important to stick closely to the requirements here, so I'll proceed with that."
