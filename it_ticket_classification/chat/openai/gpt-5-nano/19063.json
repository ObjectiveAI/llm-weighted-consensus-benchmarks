The \"ext\" could mean \u201cextension\u201d or potentially \u201cexternal.\u201d Given this context, I would categorize this as either \"HR Support\" or \"Access,\" since these types of requests typically involve account provisioning and access issues.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m working on categorizing an IT ticket. The user mentioned \u201cnew starter wednesday march pm starter form ext,\u201d which makes me think this is about onboarding. \u201cStarter form\u201d likely refers to an HR onboarding document, so \"HR Support\" could be a fitting category. But since new starters often need access provisioning for accounts, \"Access\" could also make sense. The \u201cext\u201d might refer to an extension for office hours, but I\u2019ll lean toward categorizing it as \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\"**Clarifying Ticket Details**\n\nIn the context of this ticket, \u201cext\u201d could mean \u201cextension\u201d for a phone line. \"Starter form ext\" might refer to its extensions or a specific onboarding document. The user might be looking to add a phone extension for the new starter, but it's all a bit unclear. Since I need to categorize this IT ticket, I\u2019ll choose between \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\" Given the onboarding nature, I\u2019m leaning toward \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Access\" if it\u2019s about account provisioning.**Assessing Ticket Category**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and it's useful to consider its purpose. The mention of a new starter form indicates it could relate to onboarding, making \"HR Support\" a potential category. However, if the ticket focuses on system access for the new employee, then \"Access\" might be more appropriate. Analyzing the ticket text: \u201cnew starter wednesday march pm starter form ext\u201d leads me to think it may imply an extension for onboarding. Still, I\u2019d lean towards \"HR Support\" for categorization, given the context.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user is asking for a category, and it seems they might expect \"Access\" since that's the usual category for creating accounts for new starters. The phrase \"new starter\" definitely points towards requiring access setup. In many IT ticket systems, onboarding involves multiple categories, but for this case, \"Access\" fits best. Therefore, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" \n\nTo align with the required format, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object:\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
