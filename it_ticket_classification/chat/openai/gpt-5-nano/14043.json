It's a bit garbled, but I can see mentions of checking server space and hosting capacity. Phrases like \"check space on servers,\" \"host requirements,\" and \"install application\" stand out to me. Given its focus on server space and installations, it seems this ticket should fall under the category of \"Hardware.\" I'll make sure to label it correctly!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm looking at an IT ticket that revolves around server storage and hardware. The category options include \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" \"Internal Project,\" and others. Phrases like \"check space on servers\" and \"host servers\" lean toward storage resources. Given the focus on space and hosting capacity, I think \"Storage\" is the best category. While \"Hardware\" could apply too, \"Storage\" is more precise for this situation. I'll categorize it accordingly!**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that includes the category based on the user's requirements. The proper format should just be the category string, not the entire schema. So I'll structure my response like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} because the ticket mentions checking space on servers, which relates directly to storage capacity. The text might be a bit messy, but it\u2019s clear enough for categorization. Now, I'll produce the final answer concisely!"
