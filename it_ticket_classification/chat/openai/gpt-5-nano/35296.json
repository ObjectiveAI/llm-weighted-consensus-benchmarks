It seems most fitting to categorize this ticket under \"Access,\" since it's about account access issues. I\u2019ll format the output in a JSON-like structure as instructed.**Outputting JSON Category**\n\nThe prompt specifies that I need to create a JSON object following the schema provided. It asks for \"category\": \"Access,\" so I need to keep it straightforward and exact. According to the prompt, there shouldn\u2019t be any extra commentary or additional formatting issues. I\u2019ll ensure the output is solely the required JSON object without anything else. So, I'll provide: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's keep it clear and concise!"
