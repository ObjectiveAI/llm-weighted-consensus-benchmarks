However, since \"Internal Project\" fits well with mentions of \"setup platform redesign,\" I'll choose that one. It looks like it's about setting up a project. So, I\u2019ll output the category as \"Internal Project\" in the JSON-like format.**Formatting the category response**\n\nI need to format the response as a JSON object with the proper structure. The \"category\" field should reflect the classification chosen, which is \"Internal Project.\" The required format is clear: I should return {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} without any extra text for clarity. \n\nI\u2019m confirming that I\u2019m sticking to the proper quoting and structure required by the system. Since the instruction is to respond with just the category object, I'll ensure to keep it simple."
