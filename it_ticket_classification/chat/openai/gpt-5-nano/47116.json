While \"Access\" might seem fitting if it involved permission issues, the text doesn\u2019t mention that, so it\u2019s safer to categorize this as \"Miscellaneous.\" Even though some guidelines might suggest \"Internal Project\" for specific tasks, it seems more accurate to classify it as a general IT issue.
