The phrases indicate a request for access. The allowed categories include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" both of which could fit. Given the context, it seems to be primarily about access to the Sonar tool, which leads me to decide on the \"Access\" category. I\u2019ll format my answer as a JSON object.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions a request for \"access to sonar,\" which I think indicates they're asking about SonarQube or SonarCloud. The wording suggests that the user is looking to access an instance. While the phrase \"sonar instance located sp\" may imply locating a service provider, it still relates to access. Therefore, I believe the most fitting category is \"Access.\" I\u2019ll return the correct JSON format with the category specified.**Delivering ticket category**\n\nThe ticket content mentions \"access to sonar\" and \"instance located,\" but it doesn't specify anything about privileges or administrative rights. It seems like a straightforward request for access rather than any elevated permissions. So, I'll categorize this as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format the response in the proper JSON style. Here\u2019s the final output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
