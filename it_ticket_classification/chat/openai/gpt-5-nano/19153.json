They mentioned terms like \u201caccess,\u201d \u201cnew team member,\u201d and \u201cfolders.\u201d The primary focus seems to be on granting access, so I\u2019m drawn to the \"Access\" category. However, there could be a hint of \"Administrative rights\" too since they refer to access rights. Ultimately, it looks like \"Access\" is the best fit for this ticket.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m weighing whether to categorize the ticket as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \"Access\" is more general, while \"Administrative rights\" is specific to higher-level permissions. The user's message indicates they want access for a new team member and mentions \"folders\" and \"testing.\" However, there\u2019s no explicit request for admin privileges. Therefore, \"Access\" seems to be the better fit. I\u2019ll provide the response in the requested JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Formatting category response**\n\nThe system indicates that bullet lists are acceptable, but I need to stick to the specific category object format. In similar cases, I've used: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's important to match the capitalization exactly, so \"Access\" should be just like that. I need to avoid adding any extra text. I feel confident about this approach, and I\u2019ll keep it concise to stay on point! Let's go ahead with that format."
