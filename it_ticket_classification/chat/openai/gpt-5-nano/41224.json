The user seems unable to do this, and it might be a system issue. I\u2019m considering which category fits best from the options: Access, Miscellaneous, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. It doesn't fit perfectly in Access but could lean towards Administrative rights or Miscellaneous since it\u2019s not a standard access issue. I'll decide shortly!**Categorizing IT issue**\n\nI'm analyzing the categories for the issue about linking multiple Change Requests (CRs) to a Work Request. It seems like a functional issue with the application. If it\u2019s an internal project management problem, it might fit under \"Internal Project.\" However, the user seems to imply a permissions issue since others can link CRs. So, \"Access\" could work, but \"Administrative rights\" might be more specific for permission issues. I\u2019ll finalize the category soon!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe user reported they \"cannot link more than one CR,\" suggesting an issue potentially related to administrative privileges. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this as \"Administrative rights\" since it deals with permissions. However, it could also fit in \"Internal Project\" if it's specific to an internal tool. Since they requested assistance, the best fit seems to be \"Administrative rights\" in the context of IT helpdesk taxonomy. I'll prepare a JSON category object for the response!**Providing category for IT ticket**\n\nI see that the instruction is to categorize the IT ticket, and the specific category is \"Administrative rights.\" It's important to ensure that I format the output correctly as a JSON object. The key should be \"category\" followed by the exact string \"Administrative rights,\" without any additional text or explanations. So, I\u2019ll format it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nThis keeps it clear and follows the required format precisely!"
