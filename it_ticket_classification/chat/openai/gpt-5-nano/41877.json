It mentions a recurring issue with ServiceNow, so the categories to consider are \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It doesn't relate to hardware, storage, or purchase. Since \"Software\" or \"Application\" isn\u2019t listed, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to fit best. I'll go ahead and respond with the appropriate JSON-like category format.**Outputting the category**\n\nI need to provide a JSON object with a category value for the IT ticket. The most fitting option seems to be \"Miscellaneous\" due to a recurring issue with ServiceNow. While \"Access\" could also apply if it's about access rights, that\u2019s not entirely clear. I think \"Miscellaneous\" is a safe default. It might be helpful to ask clarifying questions if I'm uncertain, but for now, I\u2019ll simply respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
