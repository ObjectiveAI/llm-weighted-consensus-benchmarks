Given the context, it seems to fit best under the \"Access\" category. So, I\u2019ll note that the category for this ticket should definitely be \"Access.\"**Formatting category response**\n\nThe system instructs me to respond with a category in the required JSON format. So, I should output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I noticed that the focus is on accessing People Operations, with references to \"Hi Planner,\" which may be a scheduling tool related to HR, but what's clear is that this is an access request. Therefore, I\u2019ll make sure to provide my answer directly as a JSON object without any extra commentary. The category is definitely \"Access.\""
