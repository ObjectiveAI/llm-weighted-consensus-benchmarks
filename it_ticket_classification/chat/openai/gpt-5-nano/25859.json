The ticket is quite jumbled but mentions access to virtual machines, installing an OS, and reviewing a template report. It seems to center on virtual machine access and installation, so I'm debating between \"Access\" and \"Internal Project.\" Since it involves accessing servers and logins, \"Access\" feels like the best fit for this ticket.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe text mentions various tasks related to \"virtual machines,\" installation of Excel, and working with templates. It\u2019s a bit messy, but I need to produce a JSON output that categorizes this ticket. I'm considering the \"Access\" category for permission-related issues, but it also fits \"Internal Project\" due to the project tasks involved like report reviews and installation guides. Since there's no \"Technical\" category, I think \"Internal Project\" or maybe \"Miscellaneous\" works best here.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
