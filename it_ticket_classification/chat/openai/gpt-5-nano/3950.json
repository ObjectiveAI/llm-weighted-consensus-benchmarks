It\u2019s a bit vague, so I need to decide the best category from the options: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", or \"Administrative rights\".\n\nSince it sounds more like a suggestion or general inquiry about the app, I\u2019m thinking it could fit under \"Miscellaneous\". It\u2019s definitely not about any specific issue.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the category for this IT ticket where the user mentions an \"expenses app.\" It might fall under \"Purchase\" if they're buying one, but there's no explicit mention of that. \"Administrative rights\" definitely doesn't fit. \"Internal Project\" could work if they\u2019re developing the app as a project. Since it seems to be about an already existing mobile application for tracking expenses, I think \"Miscellaneous\" fits best, as it doesn\u2019t quite align with the other categories.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
