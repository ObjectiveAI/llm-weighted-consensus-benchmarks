The urgency indicates that it\u2019s a connectivity issue, so I should categorize it appropriately. It seems to fit best under \"Access\" since it relates to accessing the email server. \"Internal Project\" and \"Administrative rights\" don't apply here, and while \"Hardware\" could be a factor, this seems more about software connectivity. So I'll categorize it as \"Access\" and prepare a JSON object as instructed.**Formatting the response**\n\nI\u2019m working on the right format for the JSON object with the category string. The user needs a straightforward response, so I\u2019ll set it up as {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra commentary. It\u2019s essential to ensure that \u201cAccess\u201d is in the correct format as specified. I\u2019ve confirmed that it aligns with the allowed values. The system needs this exact format, so I\u2019ll finalize it with plain text in a proper JSON format. Let's go with that!"
