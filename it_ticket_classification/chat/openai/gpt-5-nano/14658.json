The content seems related to cards and availability, mentioning \"leaver card,\" which likely refers to access cards for employees who are leaving. The terms \"suspended\" and \"analyst ext hub\" also pop up. This ticket appears to concern user access control. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Access\" since it primarily deals with access cards. Let's finalize this category!**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI think the category for this ticket is likely \"Access\" since it's about access cards and badges, especially concerning employee departures. It might be \"Administrative rights\" if it involves admin access, but that's less probable. The user asked to categorize the ticket, so I need to respond with just the category in JSON format. The final output will be: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. I\u2019ll keep it clean and straightforward, without additional commentary.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
