The provided categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket seems to involve requisition approvals, mapping issues, and tasks related to purchasing flight tickets and accommodation. Given the focus on approvals and requisitions, it looks like the best fit will be \"Purchase.\" There don't seem to be any mentions of hardware or access rights, so that narrows it down nicely.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering if the ticket might fit into \"Administrative rights\" due to its references to permissions for requisition approvals. However, since the main focus is on purchase requisition approvals and mapping issues, \"Purchase\" seems to be the most appropriate category.\n\nI need to prepare a JSON object to classify this ticket correctly. The required format is straightforward, including just the \"category\" field. So, I'll output it as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} and maybe add a brief justification as well. Let's finalize this!**Providing the category**\n\nThe user's request is clear: just categorize the ticket. The instructions state that I should provide only the category, so I'll make sure to stick to that. I need to present just the JSON output with the designated category. There's no need for extra details or explanations here. Let's go ahead and finalize that response!"
