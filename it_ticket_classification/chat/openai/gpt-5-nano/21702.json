It seems to mention a server for regression tests, a dedicated machine, selenium tests, and related technical terms. Given the context, I should categorize this ticket into either \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s likely Hardware or Access since it mentions machines and environments that are typically related to hardware setup or access needs. I'll choose the most fitting category based on that.**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket mentions \"administrator needed\" and \"options senior developer,\" which suggests it\u2019s about admin rights and possibly procuring a dedicated server for regression tests. There's also a mention of Vagrant, Git, and environment setup. I\u2019m contemplating whether to categorize it as \"Purchase\" if it's about buying a server or \"Internal Project\" for internal setup. However, since it revolves around acquiring a server for tests, \u201cHardware\u201d seems to be the best fit. I\u2019ll categorize it as Hardware.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
