This suggests it's related to changing administrative rights or access controls, likely modifying an approval workflow. I\u2019m leaning toward \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d since it involves altering permissions in a system, but \u201cAccess\u201d could also fit. Ultimately, \"Administrative rights\" seems to be the best choice here.**Categorizing IT ticket correctly**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize this IT ticket under \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d Since the request is about changing an approver, it seems to imply modifying who has approval privileges. Therefore, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d feels like the right choice. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object, ensuring it includes only the necessary category: \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nI should also keep extra notes out; the output just needs to be clean and concise."
