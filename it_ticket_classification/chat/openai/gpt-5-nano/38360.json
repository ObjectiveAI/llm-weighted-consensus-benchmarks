The text mentions \"amend,\" \"resolved,\" and \"request,\" which suggests it's about changing something despite being resolved. It could fit into \"Administrative rights\" if it's about permissions or \"Access\" if it's related to user access. There's also a chance it falls under \"Miscellaneous\" since the content is minimal. The phrase \"would you be able amend please\" indicates they are asking for an edit.**Deciding on IT ticket categories**\n\nI'm considering whether to categorize this ticket as \"Administrative rights\" since it involves modifying something in the system. However, since the ticket mentions \"active stage resolved\" multiple times, it might be stuck in a status loop. A safe choice is to label it as \"Miscellaneous,\" which is also an available category. It seems prudent to respond with a JSON object formatted correctly. The user\u2019s request to \"amend\" could imply elevated privileges or access, but I'll stick with the safest option for now.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
