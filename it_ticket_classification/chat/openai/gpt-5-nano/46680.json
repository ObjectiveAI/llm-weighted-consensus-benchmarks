The message indicates that their mailbox is full, suggesting a storage issue because they've mentioned trying to clean up old data but still face the same problem. So I think the best category for this ticket is \"Storage.\" Although \"Access\" might be an option if the focus is on mailbox access, it clearly revolves around storage limits. I\u2019ll prepare a response structured as a JSON object with the category field.**Formulating JSON Response**\n\nThe prompt asks me to categorize an IT ticket, and there's a specific schema I need to follow. The category I\u2019ve determined is \"Storage.\" I need to present my answer as a JSON object that fits the required format. The expectation is to keep it simple without any extra text or formatting. So, I\u2019ll craft the final output as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. This way, I'm sticking to the format and giving exactly what's needed!"
