It specifically refers to a monitor, linking it to hardware. Given the focus on procurement and purchases, the category \"Purchase\" seems most appropriate. I could consider \"Hardware\" too, since it mentions a monitor, but \"Purchase\" aligns with the overall context best.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}**Confirming Ticket Category**\n\nI should double-check to avoid any misinterpretation of the user's garbled text. Words like \"new purchase\" and \"PO\" stand out, as well as \"monitor,\" indicating hardware. However, since the focus is on the purchase order process and receipts, the category is better suited as \"Purchase\" rather than \"Hardware.\" I feel confident that \"Purchase\" is the right choice for this ticket, as it aligns well with the overall context. Let's finalize that decision!"
