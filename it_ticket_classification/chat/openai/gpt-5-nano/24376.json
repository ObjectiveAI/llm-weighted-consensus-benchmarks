The ticket seems to be garbled but mentions \"new purchase po,\" indicating it's related to a purchase order. It talks about installation and receipts. I could consider it for \"Purchase\" since it focuses on purchase orders and receipts. I don't think \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" fits, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase.\"**Formatting response as JSON**\n\nIt looks like I need to respond in a JSON-like structure to categorize the IT ticket. The instruction specifies that I should include a \"category\" field with a string value. Since the ticket clearly falls under \"Purchase,\" I'll prepare the output as a JSON object with that category. I\u2019ll simplify it by keeping it concise and format it correctly without any extra explanation. My final output will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Let's get that done!"
