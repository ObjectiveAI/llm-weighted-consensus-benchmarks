It seems to fit best under \"Administrative rights\" since it involves mapping columns on a Jira board. \"Access\" could also be a possibility, but it primarily focuses on admin rights for setup, so I'll lean towards that option.**Categorizing IT Ticket for JSON**\n\nI\u2019m deciding between \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" for this IT ticket since it talks about needing admin privileges to map columns. It specifically mentions \"requires administrator access,\" which leans towards \"Administrative rights\" being the most fitting category. I\u2019ll present this as a JSON object, as specified in the required format. The ticket content clearly indicates it fits under this category.\n\nSo, I\u2019m planning to respond with: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} as requested."
