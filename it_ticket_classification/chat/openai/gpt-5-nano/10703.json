The user is requesting access to floor space for tomorrow, indicating that this likely fits into the \"Access\" category. However, it may also touch on \"Administrative rights\" since it's about granting access. Since \"floor space\" suggests a physical resource, \"Access\" seems the most appropriate choice.**Deciding on access category**\n\nIt seems like the \"Access\" category is the right fit for this request to access a resource. If it were about \"administrative rights,\" it would focus more on user rights to digital systems. The user wrote about a request for access to floor space tomorrow afternoon, which indicates access control. Therefore, I should categorize this as \"Access.\" The output will likely need to be a JSON object that indicates this choice: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
