They seem to be describing an issue with submitting something, mentioning terms like \"submit button,\" \"apply button,\" and \"issue resolve.\" Given the context, it sounds more like a user access issue rather than something related to hardware or internal projects. I will categorize this ticket into the \"Access\" category and structure my output in the required JSON format.**Analyzing Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket seems to relate to a UI issue where the submit button isn't visible. I can see that it might fit into categories like \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access,\" but not \"Hardware\" or \"HR Support.\" Since it specifically mentions an Oracle application, it could align with \"Internal Project,\" but it also might just be a general software issue better categorized as \"Miscellaneous.\" The lack of clarity makes it tricky, so I'll lean towards calling it \"Miscellaneous\" for now.**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nI need to select the best category for this issue. It could fit under \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Access\". The mention of the missing submit button suggests it could relate to access rights since users can't submit forms. However, without more context, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the safest option because it covers general issues that don't clearly fit any other category. I'll go with JSON output stating the category as \"Miscellaneous\", while considering \"Internal Project\" if it's specifically about an internal Oracle app.**Determining the Category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking this ticket is likely best categorized under \"Miscellaneous,\" especially since there's no specific category for software issues. The user mentions a missing \"Submit\" button, which affects their ability to submit an access request, hinting at an access issue, but generally, \"Access\" is for permissions or system access. Since \"Miscellaneous\" covers notable software issues, I\u2019ll stick with that. Finally, I\u2019ll output the required JSON, ensuring it has the \"category\" field formatted correctly."
