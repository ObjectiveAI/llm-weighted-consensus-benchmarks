It could be \"Hardware\" since it involves the core switch, but it also seems more like an \"Internal Project\" since multiple teams are coordinating efforts. It\u2019s about resolving network issues, with daily calls and tracking, which makes \"Internal Project\" feel right. I\u2019m ruling out categories like \"Miscellaneous\" and \"Administrative rights\" since they don\u2019t fit the context. So, it looks like \"Internal Project\" is the way to go!**Formatting category output**\n\nI need to make sure I output the category as a single string in the required JSON format. The prompt states that I should categorize this IT ticket, which means I\u2019ll respond with the format: `{\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}`. I need to confirm that \"Internal Project\" is one of the valid categories and doesn't require any extra commentary. I\u2019ll ensure it matches all the specified guidelines and get this down to simply providing the JSON response."
