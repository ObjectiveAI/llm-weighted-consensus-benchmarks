It seems to revolve around access, specifically for \"engagers\" and tools for event organization. The phrasing suggests it\u2019s about giving or requesting access rights. It could fit into either the \"Access\" category or \"Administrative rights,\" but since they are separate categories, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Access\" due to the primary focus on access issues for the members involved.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nIt looks like this ticket is about granting access to a tool for engaging members. I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"Access\" since the request seems to be about using a tool rather than assigning administrative rights, which would imply higher privileges. The user specifically mentions \"please add engagers,\" indicating they want to include them in tool access. Since it\u2019s about permission to use rather than management, I'll choose \"Access\" and prepare to respond in the required JSON format.**Preparing final response**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket and respond with the appropriate JSON format. I\u2019ll provide the category as \"Access,\" since that aligns with the ticket's request about tool access. \n\nThe output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Although a short justification could be helpful, it seems that the prompt specifically requests only the category. So, I\u2019ll stick to the required format and submit it as instructed."
