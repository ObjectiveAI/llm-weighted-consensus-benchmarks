I see a distinction between categories like \"Administrative rights\" versus \"Access.\" Requests for administrative rights relate to system management, while standard access allows users to upload files or use folders. Still, it's primarily about permissions, so \"Access\" fits better. I could contemplate \"Storage\" too, but that's more about capacity and quotas for a library or folder. I think the right category is \"Access,\" and I'll format that as a JSON object.**Responding with proper format**\n\nOkay, I realize the tool probably expects a specific format for my response. For this task, I\u2019ll simply provide the category as a JSON object. So, the response should be: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. It looks like keeping it straightforward is the best approach here, with no extra commentary or details. I\u2019ll make sure to present it cleanly and clearly as required."
