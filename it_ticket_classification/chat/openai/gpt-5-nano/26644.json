While there's no perfect category, \"Internal Project\" seems the closest for IT tasks. \"Access\" could fit if it involves linking or permissions, but there's no explicit need for access. \"Administrative Rights\" might apply if admin privileges are needed for deletions, but I think \"Internal Project\" works best overall.**Evaluating categories for IT ticket**\n\nI need to think through the categories for this IT ticket. Hardware and HR support don\u2019t fit, and while \u201cAccess\u201d could apply, it doesn\u2019t explicitly mention that. \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is too generic, and \u201cStorage\u201d isn\u2019t quite right either. \"Purchase\" definitely doesn\u2019t apply, but \"Internal Project\" seems like a good fit. \"Administrative Rights\" might be relevant if deleting repositories requires them, but it\u2019s listed separately. I\u2019ll output a JSON with {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} and possibly include a brief justification as well.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
