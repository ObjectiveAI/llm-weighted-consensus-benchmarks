The user's jumbled text suggests it's related to a \"work pattern change\" and involves Oracle software. It appears to concern administrative rights or HR support since it discusses updates to employment type and salary. This doesn't fit hardware or storage categories, so I might classify it as \"Administrative rights,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI think this ticket could relate to an HR policy update, but since the options include \"HR Support,\" that seems the closest match. The mention of \"Oracle\" hints at a system for managing work patterns, and it could be classified as an \"Internal Project\" if it involves program changes. However, since it focuses on updating the \"work pattern\" and employee salary, \"HR Support\" seems most appropriate. It looks like we should return a JSON object with the selected category.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
