Since the ticket refers to a \"document purchase order requisition\" and mentions aspects like requisition and supplier, it seems clear that it fits under \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format and ensure that it matches the schema by simply providing: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Keeping it concise is key here!**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nThe directive specifies that the output needs to be in the format of a JSON object for the category. So, I\u2019ll simply create that output as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It's straightforward! I want to make sure I get it right, and since the format is clear, there shouldn't be any confusion. Let\u2019s go ahead and do this! It\u2019s nice to wrap this up neatly."
