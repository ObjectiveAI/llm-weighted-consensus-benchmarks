The user's text seems garbled, likely from a poor translation, mentioning things like \"tickets queue,\" \"holiday notice,\" and \"working instructions.\" It appears to relate to ticket assignments and changes, pointing toward categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Access.\"**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI see that this ticket seems to fit under \u201cAccess,\u201d \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d or \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d The text includes terms like \"assigned,\" \"tickets,\" \"queue,\" and \"reference number,\" which suggests it's about ticket assignments or access changes. The \"Administrative rights\" category would apply if it's related to privileges. Although it could touch on \u201cInternal Project\u201d due to its procedural content, that's more about project development. Since the information is unclear, I think \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d might be the safest choice.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nIt seems this ticket requests modifications to procedures or assignments in ServiceNow. It could fall under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" but these don't seem to fit perfectly since the focus is on changes like \"change name\" and \"revise document.\" While \"Internal Project\" could relate to procedural changes, it isn't exactly a project. Given the ambiguity, \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d feels like the safest category. I might consider suggesting that the user clarifies the ticket content, but for now, I\u2019ll categorize it as \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
