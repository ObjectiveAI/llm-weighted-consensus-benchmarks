So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object including \"HR Support\" as the category. I might add a brief explanation to clarify why this fits if necessary. I'll keep the format as specified!**Formatting the JSON Output**\n\nI need to output a precise JSON object with the category field. Based on the schema, it should look like this: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`. I want to stick to the requirements, avoiding any extra text or commentary. I did consider \"Access\" versus \"HR Support,\" but since this ticket is about Oracle time cards not saving or submitting\u2014which is an application malfunction in the HR system\u2014\"HR Support\" is clearly the right fit.
