The text is quite messy, but it seems to involve assigning someone as a project manager for Oracle and includes terms related to planning and budgeting. I need to classify it into relevant categories from the system's enumeration, like Access, Administrative Rights, or Internal Project. Let's break down the content and decide on the best fitting category based on the information provided!**Categorizing project manager request**\n\nIt looks like the user is asking to be set as project manager for Oracle and July. This could be an access request, possibly fitting under \"Access,\" but there's also \"Administrative rights\" that might be more precise. The content mentions granting PM rights, so that points to needing administrative rights. Since the ticket revolves around granting rights for the PM role, \"Administrative rights\" seems like the best category to choose. Let's aim for the most accurate classification!**Deciding on category for request**\n\nThe request includes phrases like \"set as project manager\" and \"rights,\" indicating it might be related to setting up a role in Oracle for July. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this as \"Administrative rights\" since it\u2019s mainly about permissions. While \"Internal Project\" could apply due to the mention of a project manager, the core of the request seems focused on granting rights. So, I feel \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit for this ticket.**Creating JSON for category**\n\nI\u2019m preparing to create a JSON object for the category \"Administrative rights.\" The format specified in the system prompt is clear: I need to include \"category\" and ensure it matches the enumeration provided. There shouldn't be any extra text; just the JSON structure itself. So, it will look like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure everything is structured correctly, and it\u2019s valid JSON before proceeding. No extra commentary here!"
