The user's message is pretty garbled, but it mentions \"access to servers\" and \"admin rights,\" which indicate a request related to Access or Administrative rights. I need to determine which category fits better. With the emphasis on server access and login, \"Access\" seems the most appropriate, considering the context of granting entry.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI see a lot of mixed words in the user's message, making it a bit tricky to interpret. It talks about \"access to servers,\" \"redirect,\" and possibly \"administrator rights,\" which hints at issues with access. The content is vague, but if it\u2019s about requesting server access, then the \"Access\" category seems to fit best. If it leans more toward granting admin rights, then \"Administrative rights\" would be appropriate. I need to choose carefully!**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe ticket text is of poor quality, but it starts with \"access to servers,\" which clearly relates to the \"Access\" category. I'm going to categorize it accordingly since it doesn't pertain to hardware or storage, for instance. I'll format my response as a JSON object, ensuring it aligns with the required schema. According to the instructions, I'll simply output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nNo extra commentary, just the JSON is needed! Let's go!"
