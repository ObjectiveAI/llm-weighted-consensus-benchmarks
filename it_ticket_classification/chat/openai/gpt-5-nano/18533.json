The relevant categories from the list include \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access.\" Since this specifically mentions removing rights, it likely falls under \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll proceed to create a JSON-like category object with the appropriate classification to ensure it meets the required format.**Deciding on Category**\n\nI'm evaluating the ticket's action of removing access rights. I see two possible categories: \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" Since this is about changing permissions, \"Administrative rights\" seems to fit best. It's specifically about managing folder rights. While one could argue it might also fit under \"Access,\" I feel that \"Administrative rights\" is more precise in this case. The user clearly asked for a categorization, so I\u2019ll go with my final choice of \"Administrative rights.\""
