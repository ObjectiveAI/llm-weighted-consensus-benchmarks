They\u2019re mentioning things like \"oracle,\" \"assign person,\" and \"log,\" which could relate to several categories. I think \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" might fit since it involves permissions. The mention of \"order submitted approved\" may also suggest a \"Purchase\" category. There is a bit of confusion, but I'll sift through these options to find the best fit.**Identifying IT ticket issues**\n\nI'm trying to understand a user's message that seems related to an Oracle issue, possibly a request for access or administrative rights. The content mentions things like \"forgot log\" and \"add order submitted approved,\" but it's pretty unclear. However, it hints at needing help with permissions or login issues. Since the ticket involves Oracle, the \"Access\" category seems plausible. I need to pick the category that best fits this confusing request.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
