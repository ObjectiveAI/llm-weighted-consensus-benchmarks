The text includes terms like \"oracle configuration,\" \"order submit,\" and mentions bypassing an official process. It's unclear but hints at access or approvals. The category \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if someone needs admin rights to make changes in the Oracle configuration. I\u2019ll focus on selecting the best fit for this ticket from the provided categories.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering categorizing this IT ticket as \"Access\" since phrases like \"allow him submit\" suggest it involves granting access, perhaps while someone is out. The mention of \"official process bypass\" hints at needing to sidestep standard procedures. \"Access\" fits well since it relates to permissions and submissions. However, \"Administrative rights\" might also apply due to the Oracle configuration needing elevated privileges. The text is a bit unclear, but \"Access\" seems to be the best fit overall.**Finalizing the ticket category**\n\nI believe the best category for this IT ticket is \"Access\" since it focuses on permissions and submission rights. The user didn't indicate a need for escalation or hardware configuration, so \"Access\" feels right. Now, to respond appropriately, I need to format it as a JSON object with the specified \"category\" property. Keeping it simple is probably the best approach, so I\u2019ll just output: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text."
