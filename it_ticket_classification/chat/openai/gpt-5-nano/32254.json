The ticket focuses on updating licenses for a collaborative infrastructure environment, which involves concurrent users and approvals. It might fit \"Purchase\" because of the licensing aspect, or \"Access\" due to the user permissions and setup. Additionally, it could also be an \"Internal Project,\" but the limited categories are complicating things. So which is best?**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user is asking about updating licenses and ordering for concurrent users in a collaborative infrastructure environment. This suggests that \"Purchase\" fits well, given the focus on licensing and additional cores. I consider \"Internal Project\" too, but it doesn't explicitly mention project tasks. The user\u2019s stream-of-consciousness writing repeats phrases related to the environment. They also mention \"cores,\" which could mean \"Hardware\" since cores refer to CPUs, but really seems focused on software licensing for those cores. So, it\u2019s a bit tricky!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
