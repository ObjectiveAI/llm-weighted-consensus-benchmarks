The user asks me to classify the text about someone unable to access servers anymore. They\u2019ve mentioned \u201ctwo floor ports for connection currently connected,\u201d but it\u2019s a bit unclear. From this, it seems I should classify it under \"Access\" since they're asking for help to regain access. So, I\u2019ll output a JSON-like object indicating the category as \u201cAccess.\u201d**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe ticket clearly indicates it's an access issue to servers, not a hardware problem. Although I initially considered \"Infrastructure,\" that category isn't available here, so \"Access\" is the best fit. I must return a JSON object for the category. The required format simplifies to just the category string, so I\u2019ll produce: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. While I could suggest actions for the agent, the instructions only require me to categorize, so I'll stick to that.**Delivering the IT ticket category**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize the IT ticket, so I need to keep my response straightforward. The instructions specify that I should output just the category in a JSON object. I should avoid any extra text. It\u2019s clear that the category is \"Access,\" so I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Keeping it concise and plain is essential, so I'll make sure there\u2019s nothing unnecessary in my response!"
