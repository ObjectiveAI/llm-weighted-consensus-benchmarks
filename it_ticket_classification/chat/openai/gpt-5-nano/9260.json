It mentions setting a location as inactive and refers to an \"oracle closing down plan.\" The terms \"closing down plan,\" \"holiday notice,\" and \"ready call minutes\" point toward it being related to an \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, it might also fit under \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" So, I'll weigh these options carefully to choose the best fitting category.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user provided details about a \"closing down plan\" and making a location inactive, which could hint at actions related to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The mention of \"infrastructure\" is interesting. It seems like this project might relate to the decommissioning of an Oracle service, making it suitable for the \"Internal Project\" category. However, since changing the status of a location is more an administrative task, it also fits under \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" for clarity.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI've reviewed the categories available, and \"Internal Project\" seems to be the most fitting for this case, given it's related to a closing down plan, decommissioning, and readiness calls. The user asks to categorize this IT ticket, so I need to prepare a JSON object with the category value. Although \"Administrative rights\" could also be considered due to the action of setting the location as inactive, \"Internal Project\" covers it better overall. So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
