The term \u201cleaver\u201d particularly stands out as an HR concept linked to employees leaving. So, I think it fits best under the \u201cHR Support\u201d category, which is available. That makes sense!**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe ticket includes terms like \"apply process,\" \"data imported,\" and \"error\" related to the application process. Unfortunately, the categories don\u2019t cover \"Software/QA\" or \"Bug,\" so I ruled those out. \"Internal Project\" doesn't fit either. \"Access\" isn\u2019t right, as it's more about the process itself. Given the context of HR and terms like \"leaver\" and \"end date,\" the best fit appears to be \"HR Support.\" I'll output the category in JSON format as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Alright, let's do that!"
