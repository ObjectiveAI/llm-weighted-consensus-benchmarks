The available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The ticket text mentions several issues regarding the Outlook app, server setup, and user credentials. Given the content, it seems like it relates to user access and application support. I\u2019ll likely categorize this ticket under \u201cAccess\u201d since it primarily deals with credential issues and app functionality.**Categorizing IT Support Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the details of an IT ticket related to the Outlook app and server settings. It seems to involve issues with credentials and access, which makes \"Access\" the most fitting category. Other categories like Administrative rights don\u2019t apply here. I need to ensure that I provide the response as a valid JSON object. So, I\u2019ll format it like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It should cover the requirements for categorization!"
