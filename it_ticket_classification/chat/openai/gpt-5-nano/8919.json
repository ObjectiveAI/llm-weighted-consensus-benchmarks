The ticket mentions a form for a tester technician joining and requests assistance with work location. It seems like it primarily concerns onboarding a new employee. Given the context, I think the categories \"HR Support\" for onboarding and possibly \"Administrative Rights\" for access permissions could fit. It looks like HR Support might be the best choice here.**Deciding on a ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to classify the IT ticket under \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" There\u2019s no clear request for access, just a need to complete a form and determine a work location, which sounds like an onboarding situation. The mention of \"new starter\" supports this. So, I think the best choice is \"HR Support.\" The request is clear: it needs a specific format, possibly JSON-like, to categorize the IT ticket appropriately.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to create a JSON object to categorize the IT ticket. The required format shows that we should keep it simple without heavy formatting. I\u2019m going to respond with just the essential information needed: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This seems to fit best given that it\u2019s about onboarding and involves a new starter's work location. Although I considered \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights,\" \"HR Support\" is clearly the most appropriate choice for this context."
