The ticket mentions a network outage related to a router and faulty equipment, which clearly indicates a hardware issue. Although it could fit under Internal Project or Miscellaneous, I believe \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate category. I need to respond with a JSON object stating that. So, I'll format it as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm looking to finalize the category for the IT ticket, which I've determined to be \"Hardware.\" I briefly reconsidered options like \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but none fit better. I've decided to keep it simple and deliver the response clearly. So, I'll format the response as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to ensure it's concise and to the point. This approach should be straightforward and effective!"
