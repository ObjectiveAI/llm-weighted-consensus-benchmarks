The snippet revolves around issues with submitting a holiday request, mentioning things like a line manager and submissions made multiple times. This seems clearly HR related, particularly about holiday leave processes. Although \"Administrative rights\" is an option, this request leans more towards \"HR Support.\" Thus, I'll classify it as \"HR Support\" since it doesn't address any technical aspects.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket. While \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could be relevant to permissions, the user is asking for help with submitting holiday requests. This leans towards \u201cHR Support,\u201d given it\u2019s about HR processes. I think it makes sense to choose that. \n\nNow, I'll format my response as a JSON object according to the schema provided, which will just be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll stick to outputting just the required JSON.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
