That should work!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket based on the provided text. It seems to relate to \"expense approval flow,\" so it could fit under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" but those don\u2019t seem right. \"Purchase\" looks like the best fit because it focuses on procurement and requisitions.
