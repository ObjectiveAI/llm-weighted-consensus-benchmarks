The user seems to be asking for help regarding access, specifically needing a tutorial. Among the categories provided, \"Access\" seems to fit best given the context. Though \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant too, I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate since it\u2019s directly related to logging in and user management.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user requested that I categorize an IT ticket. I\u2019m leaning toward \"Access\" since it relates to the user's concern about logging in and adding members. However, \"Administrative rights\" might be more precise, considering the specifics around rights and adding members. I\u2019ll craft a response in the required JSON format, outputting the category as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI want to ensure it's clear and straightforward. But I should stay open to the possibility that \"Administrative rights\" could also be a fit.**Delivering category response**\n\nThe user mentioned issues like \"cannot log\" and \"adding following members,\" which suggests it's about user provisioning. While \"administrative rights\" relates to rights assignment, the overall context seems more about general access issues. Given that, the safest bet is to categorize it as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and provide only the JSON format for the category. Here\u2019s the response:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
