Since the request is about purchasing a license, \"Purchase\" seems to be the most fitting category. While \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access\" could also be options, \"Purchase\" aligns best with the ticket's context.**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI'm reviewing the allowed categories for this IT ticket and ruling out options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Storage,\" \"Hardware,\" and \"HR Support.\" The phrase \"sketch license\" indicates it's likely related to the Sketch app, possibly confirmation of a license received. Since it's about managing a license, the \"Purchase\" category fits best. The user likely wants this categorized as such, since it's associated with software licenses. So, I will respond with the category object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
