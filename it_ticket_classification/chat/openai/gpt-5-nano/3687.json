But since the user is also looking to buy something, I think \"Purchase\" could apply too. I need to pick the best fit!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket based on the user's request for a \"cooling pad.\" It sounds like they're asking for hardware, which could fit into a couple of categories. \"Purchase\" is meant for procurement requests, while \"Hardware\" can cover general hardware issues. Since the user is asking to \"provide a cooling pad,\" it could lean towards \"Purchase.\" I really want to make sure I pick the best category for this request!**Categorizing IT request**\n\nI need to categorize this request for a cooling pad. Without more context, I lean towards \"Hardware\" since it's a hardware asset. However, since the user is asking for the provision of it, \"Purchase\" might also fit better. It seems we need to respond succinctly with a JSON object. So, according to the format, I\u2019ll just output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. No extra text around that, just the category itself!"
