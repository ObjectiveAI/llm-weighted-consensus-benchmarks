The ticket mentions \"filtering request,\" \"filtering addresses,\" and it seems to involve access control for newcomers. It could also connect to \"internal project\" or \"access\" categories. There\u2019s mention of high-priority configuration affecting a sprint, which suggests a potential internal project or an administrative rights issue regarding permissions. I need to determine which category fits best based on its content.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm evaluating the IT ticket that mentions \"high priority,\" \"sprint,\" and \"configuration.\" It seems to describe a software task related to filtering addresses for newcomer onboarding, possibly involving email filtering. The categories I can choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Since it leans more toward software configuration in a development context, \"Internal Project\" might be the most fitting category, although \"Administrative Rights\" could apply if user permissions are involved.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the IT ticket and trying to decide on a suitable category. Terms like \"filtering request\" and \"addresses represent addresses newcomers\" are a bit ambiguous. However, considering the focus on a sprint and developer configuration, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best choice. I need to format my output as a JSON-like object with the category set to \"Internal Project.\" The instructions indicate that this schema is necessary, so I\u2019ll follow that to ensure it's done correctly.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
