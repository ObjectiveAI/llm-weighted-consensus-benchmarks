I should categorize this as \"Hardware.\" \n\nTo respond, I'll provide the JSON as: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. The system expects this specific format, and it aligns with the instructions to provide a category object. So, I\u2019ll ensure to deliver that without any unnecessary details, as they might ask for more if needed!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket based on some unclear text. I\u2019m considering that it might be about a \"temporary mobile phone for two weeks.\" \n\nIt could also fit \"Purchase\" if they're looking to buy one for testing, but \"temporary\" leans towards short-term provisioning. Still, since we're talking about a device, \"Hardware\" seems like the best fit. So, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, keeping it concise without extra explanation."
