It sounds like a problem with the network connection, perhaps due to hardware issues or access problems. I should consider the categories: \"Access\" for login issues, \"Hardware\" for devices, or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" It might even relate to an \"Internal Project\" if it involves an internal app.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s issue involves a web app where they cannot submit their draft, suggesting they need to reopen it. This could be linked to connectivity problems, possibly with Wi-Fi or a VPN, especially since they mentioned disconnections while moving between floors. Among the given categories, \"Hardware\" seems applicable if it relates to devices like laptops. However, the best fit appears to be \"Miscellaneous,\" as it covers issues that don't clearly belong to the other categories. \"Access\" might also work if it pertains to network access, but it's less specific.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's issue involves problems like needing to \"restart connection\" and \"connect manually\" while drafting, which suggests a connectivity issue with a web app that autosaves drafts. Given the limited categories, \"Miscellaneous\" fits best. I plan to respond with a JSON object in the required format for categorization. The schema specifies a \"category\" field, so I'll structure my answer accordingly. Thus, I'll provide this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Adding a brief note is optional.**Delivering category response**\n\nIt looks like the instruction is asking for just the category, so I want to be cautious and ensure I return the right format. I\u2019ll stick with the JSON response and deliver that clearly. It\u2019s important to keep it concise and straightforward. Let's go ahead and provide the JSON object for the category without any extra notes or complications. This way, the user gets exactly what they need."
