Typically, these IT tickets fall under categories like \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access.\" The request about a \u201cconference line\u201d suggests it\u2019s more of a \u201cTelephony\u201d issue, though that isn\u2019t an option. They\u2019re asking for dedicated phones for someone working remotely, which leans towards hardware procurement. I think I\u2019d choose between \"Purchases,\" \"Hardware,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" What's the best option?**Determining ticket category**\n\nWhen categorizing a ticket about a conference line and phones, I would generally lean towards \"Hardware\" because it involves phones. However, the term \"conference line\" is actually a service and doesn't fit under that category. \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Internal Project\" aren\u2019t suitable either. Given the text is unclear, I think \"Miscellaneous\" would be the best choice. I need to respond with a JSON object containing the selected category\u2014time to format that correctly!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
