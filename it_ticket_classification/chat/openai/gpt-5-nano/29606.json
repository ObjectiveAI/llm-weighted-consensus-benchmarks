The ticket text has some scrambled phrases, but it mentions \"wireless and access\" and requests to \"allow wireless tunnel.\" It seems to focus on wireless access and control, which makes me think it could fit into either the \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" categories. However, since it's primarily about granting access, it likely falls under the \"Access\" category.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to parse the request about wireless access and categorize it. The user is likely asking for a category rather than a resolution, so I'll respond with a JSON-like object. The requested format is clear: it requires a \"category\" field from the specified list. Upon evaluating the content, it seems the most fitting category is \"Access\" because it pertains to wireless network access and tunnels. I'll present the response strictly in the correct JSON format without any extra commentary.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
