The options are: [\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", \"Administrative rights\"]. The issue seems about software and connectivity, which might align with \"Access\" since it relates to login/auth or possibly \"Miscellaneous\" for general software concerns. I\u2019ll consider both options before deciding the best fit for the category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's IT ticket highlights issues with connecting to the server while sending Outlook invitations. Given the terms \"connect to server\" and \"cannot connect,\" it seems to relate to access issues. I think \"Access\" is the best fit, as the ticket involves authentication and reaching the server. Although \"Miscellaneous\" could work if I'm unsure, the key focus is on connectivity problems related to sending invitations, which reinforces the \"Access\" category.**Finalizing category output**\n\nThis ticket falls under either \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but since the user seeks help with login or connection issues, \"Access\" seems to be the best category. I\u2019ll output the category in JSON format as required, focusing on the schema provided, which includes several options. It\u2019s clear I need to respond straightforwardly with the JSON object indicating the \"Access\" category, ensuring it fits within the defined structure. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ll format that response.**Preparing category output**\n\nI\u2019m ready to output the category as JSON: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. The required format specifies a category object that matches the schema. Even though the instructions allow for simple JSON, the key focus is on presenting the category clearly. Since they asked to categorize, returning just {\"category\": \"Access\"} should comply with expectations. There\u2019s no need for heavy formatting, so I\u2019ll provide the straightforward output requested. Let\u2019s go ahead with that."
