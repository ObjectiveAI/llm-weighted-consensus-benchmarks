The text talks about needing IT support for an external event called Tech Flow Innovations Spark Light Center in October. This seems to fit best under the \"Miscellaneous\" category, since it's about technical support rather than hardware, HR, or other specific areas listed. I'll output a JSON object with \"Miscellaneous\" as the category so the user has exactly what they need!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe request is for assistance with the external event tech flow from Spark to Light, likely referring to the Spark Light Center. I\u2019m considering the possible categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since this is about IT support for an event, it seems to fit best under \"Internal Project.\" It's not hardware or HR, and \"Administrative rights\" doesn't apply here. So, I'll go with \"Internal Project\"!**Choosing the right category**\n\nThe user\u2019s request involves \u201cexternal event\u201d tech flow from Spark to Light, which seems like it could be about systems integration. While \"Access\" might fit if they need permissions, the ticket text is poorly formed. Overall, classifying it as \"Internal Project\" appears to be the best option, though \"Miscellaneous\" is also possible if the system uses typical categories. Since many tickets land under \"Internal Project,\" I\u2019ll finalize with that and prepare the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI realize that the task requires a JSON object with a \"category\" field set to one of the allowed values. The expected format is clear, so I\u2019ll provide the response as just the JSON object. Given the context, I\u2019ll go with the category \"Internal Project.\" So, I\u2019ll respond simply with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I won\u2019t add any extra content; clarity is key here!"
