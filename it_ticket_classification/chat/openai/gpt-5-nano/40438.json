It seems like they want to request adding someone's career to a list, possibly related to an Oracle database. The options for categories include \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"HR Support.\" Given that it mentions \"career\" and \"missing person,\" I think HR Support might be the most suitable category to select. Let's go with that!**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThis ticket seems to be HR-related, possibly involving personnel data or access in the Oracle system since they want to \"add her career\" to a list. The closest category available is \"HR Support,\" as there's no explicit \"HR\" option. The user appears to be requesting to update someone's career information, which aligns with HR records. I think selecting \"HR Support\" makes the most sense, while disregarding categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" which seem less relevant here.**Selecting JSON Category**\n\nGiven the text about \"oracle,\" it seems they might be talking about a system related to access, but there's no clear mention of access privileges. The focus is on adding a person's career to a list, which aligns more closely with HR data. Thus, I\u2019m deciding to categorize this as \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll respond in the required JSON format to properly categorize the ticket.\n\nSo, here\u2019s the JSON object:  \n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
