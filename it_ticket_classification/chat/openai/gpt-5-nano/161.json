It references terms like \"new starter,\" \"two hires join February,\" and \"administrator.\" \n\nGiven this context, I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"HR Support,\" but it could also fit as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it relates to provisioning access for new employees, I think \"Access\" might be the most appropriate category to choose for the JSON output.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe content mentions \"please find attached\" and \"new starter,\" which suggests it's related to onboarding. This could involve tasks like granting access and creating accounts. \n\nI see \"HR Support\" for HR processes, \"Administrative rights\" for admin access, but \"Access\" seems generic yet fitting, especially since IT ticket categories often include user accounts and permissions. The mention of \"two hires\" and the attachment implies it relates to access provisioning. So, categorizing this ticket as \"Access\" feels appropriate. \n\nI\u2019ll return the JSON object with that category."
