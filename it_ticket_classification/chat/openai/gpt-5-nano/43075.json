While \"Access\" could fit, it seems that \"Storage\" is the most appropriate category. So, I'll output a JSON object indicating \"Storage\" as the category.**Outputting IT ticket category**\n\nI see that I need to categorize this IT ticket, and the typical approach is to provide a JSON object with \"category\": \"Storage.\" The instructions clearly specify the format I should use, which includes the category field as a string based on the given enum. Since the content points to a mail storage quota issue, I\u2019ll go ahead and prepare the final output as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"} \n\nI\u2019ll make sure not to add any extra text; just keep it straightforward!"
