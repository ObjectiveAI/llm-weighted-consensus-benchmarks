It seems like an \"Internal Project,\" especially since it's related to a setup requested for a Tuesday PM. However, it could fit under \"Storage\" as well, given the emphasis on storage needs.**Selecting the right category**\n\nThe user mentioned details like single core processors and storage, but the main focus is on setting up infrastructure, including virtual machines, clusters, Confluence, and a Git repository. This context makes \"Internal Project\" the most suitable category. While \"Hardware\" and \"Storage\" options might seem relevant, this ticket primarily addresses a project setup, not access or admin rights. Therefore, I'll go with \"Internal Project\" and output it as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}.**Preparing the category response**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket and provide a JSON object. I\u2019ll output {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} as my main response. Even though the enum uses capital letters for \"Internal Project,\" the JSON format is consistent with lowercase as needed.\n\nI should follow the instruction strictly to keep things simple. While a brief justification could be helpful, I\u2019ll just return the category since that's what the instruction emphasizes. So, here it is: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
