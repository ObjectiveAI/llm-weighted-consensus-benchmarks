It includes phrases about \"self-service requests,\" an empty description field, and assistance with an issue. Based on the content, it seems to be about a problem with the Self Service Request form within IT service management. Therefore, it looks appropriate to assign it to the \"Access\" category since it's dealing with request forms and user access.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out how to categorize this IT ticket. It could fit in \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access,\" but it doesn't seem right for hardware, storage, or purchase. The ticket mentions \"self-service requests,\" \"request form,\" and \"description field empty.\" Since it\u2019s about an internal process, \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the safest bet, given the ambiguity. \"Internal Project\" might work if it relates to the service portal, but I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best choice for clarity.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
