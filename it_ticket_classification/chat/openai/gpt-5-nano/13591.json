The text seems to involve importing an \"opportunity\" into \"PAS,\" which implies it's about data management within a pipeline, likely related to a CRM system.\n\nGiven our categories, this looks like it fits best under \"Internal Project,\" since it's dealing with data import processes. Let\u2019s confirm this categorization for the ticket based on its content!**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI need to decide on the appropriate category for an IT ticket regarding data import. The available categories don\u2019t include specific terms like \"Data Migration\" or \"Database.\" I'm thinking \"Internal Project\" fits best since it's about importing data in a pipeline, possibly part of an internal initiative. There's also \"Administrative rights\" to consider if file access is needed. Overall, I believe \"Internal Project\" is the way to go, and I'll respond in the requested format.**Formatting the response**\n\nI\u2019ve got to format my response as a JSON object based on the category schema provided. The prompt specifies that I need to respond with one property, \"category,\" which should pull from the enum options. It seems that \"Internal Project\" fits the best. \n\nI need to make sure it's properly capitalized as specified in the enum. No extra text is needed\u2014just the JSON object itself. So, I\u2019ll prepare it like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
