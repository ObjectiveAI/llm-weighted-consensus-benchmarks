They're asking for a \"scheduled job template for review location lists,\" which seems like a blend of automation and workflow. Given the categories available, it could fit under \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The terms like \"amend categories template\" might suggest permissions involved, leaning towards \"Administrative Rights.\" Parsing through their needs shows some complexities, as none of the specific categories match perfectly.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating how to categorize this IT ticket focused on creating a scheduled job template. It feels like this task fits best under the \"Internal Project\" category, since it's related to internal work rather than user service issues. Although \"Administrative Rights\" could apply if it involved permissions, it doesn't seem necessary here. The mention of \"disable fusion\" might refer to a feature, but ultimately, this ticket focuses on development and automation tasks. So, I'll categorize it under \"Internal Project.\"**Formatting response in JSON**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category. According to the schema, I should output: `{\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}`. It's important to follow the exact format without adding any extra text. Since the user asked specifically for a categorization, I should keep it straightforward and stick to this single category, as multiple categories aren\u2019t allowed. So, I\u2019ll make sure to deliver just that JSON object: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}` without any explanations."
