The content suggests someone is requesting to \"add groups\" to something, possibly permissions related to access or administrative rights. The mention of \"pm\" might refer to project management, and it looks like they're specifically asking to add groups connected to that. It truly seems like an access permission request for adding group memberships, so that\u2019s how I\u2019ll categorize it!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThis ticket likely falls under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" because it's focused on adding groups or permissions. The request is to \"add groups,\" which modifies access rights and doesn't relate to hardware or storage. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access,\" as the request seems to be about group memberships rather than elevated privileges. The user mentions \"all July PM,\" possibly referring to project managers, confirming it\u2019s about access rather than admin rights. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\"**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to respond with a single category based on the request to add group memberships. I'll go with \"Access\" for that. So, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The system requires it to be in a JSON-like structure with no extra text, just the essential content. Since the instruction is clear, I'll ensure it matches what the system expects and proceed with that output."
