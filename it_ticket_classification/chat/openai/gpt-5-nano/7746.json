The mention of \"planning officer ext\" likely connects to an extension. Since user requests involve system access, \"Access\" feels like a fitting category choice.**Choosing IT ticket categories**\n\nI need to select a category from options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others for an IT ticket. \"Administrative rights\" relates to permission levels, while \"Access\" is more general.\n\nThe term \"employee locator\" hints at a product, possibly falling under \"Access.\" The phrase \"has started active eel yet\" is confusing, maybe referring to the \"Electronic Employee Locator.\" \n\nConsidering \"planning officer ext,\" it could be an extension number. This ticket seems messy; I might lean towards \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but I need to provide the category in the required JSON format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
