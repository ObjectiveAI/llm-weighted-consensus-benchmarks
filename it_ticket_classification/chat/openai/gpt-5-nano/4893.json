This classification may also tie into an IT security process regarding proper asset handling.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIt could be \"Administrative rights\" if it's about access rights related to cards, but it seems more aligned with an operational task regarding physical destruction of access cards. The available categories include \"Hardware,\" which is likely for devices, and \"HR Support,\" but that doesn't fit here. \"Access\" appears to be the best choice, particularly since it relates to security and badge removal for departing employees.
