It mentions hiding a list, visibility, and a potential reference to a \"Global Address List\" (GAL) in Exchange. This could suggest issues around access control or administrative rights, especially considering terms like \"hide gal\" and \"hide list.\" I wonder if \"Administrative rights\" might be the best fit for this ticket since it relates to access management. Let's go with that!**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nI need to select a category from the given list for this ticket. The mention of \"hide GAL\" could mean it's related to access management or privacy. It might fall under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" since hiding the GAL is about permissions. While it could also be linked to \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" it seems more focused on changing access. Given this context, I think \"Access\" is the most suitable category, especially for routing to the right team.**Identifying Access Request**\n\nThe mention of \"hide GAL\" suggests this ticket relates to Exchange admin tasks, which typically fall under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" The text is a bit jumbled, but the user seems to want to hide a list and GAL for their upcoming absence. They might be asking about visibility controls related to the queue or list. Despite the confusion in wording, I believe the best category for this request is \"Access,\" since it connects directly to managing visibility and permissions.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
