The user mentioned an issue with SonarQube after an upgrade, highlighting job failures caused by Maven incompatibility. Given the context, this ticket relates to troubleshooting software integration. I think the most suitable categories could be \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous\". It's definitely not hardware-related, nor is it about storage or purchases. Given that it's internal, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit for this situation.**Outputting JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nI need to determine the best category for the IT ticket regarding the Sonar software issue after an upgrade. The \"Internal Project\" category fits well, as it's likely intended for specific project-related tasks. While \"Miscellaneous\" could work, it's not as precise. \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" don't seem applicable in this case since the user didn\u2019t mention access issues. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object to reflect the category choice succinctly: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
