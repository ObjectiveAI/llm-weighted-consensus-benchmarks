The user's message is a bit jumbled, but it seems to touch on accessing servers and possibly IP address ranges. There's mention of a client implementing an artifact repository, which could indicate that it relates to an internal project. Considering these details, I think we should categorize it as \"Access\" since it primarily concerns server access, but \"Internal Project\" might fit if it involves design work too.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI need to classify an IT ticket, and I see that \"Access\" fits well since it mentions server access. The term \"artefact repository\" could relate to \"Storage,\" but since it also references a design lead, there\u2019s a chance it's linked to an internal project. However, considering the focus on accessing servers, I think \"Access\" is a safe classification. I'll respond with a JSON format as required: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This way, I\u2019m sticking closely to the specified schema!"
