They talk about relocation and mention connecting servers, which seems to point towards network access issues. This could easily fit into the \"Access\" category. However, there's also a mention of obtaining \"class\" and a \"senior engineer,\" which might suggest this is part of an \"Internal Project.\" It's a little tricky, but \"Access\" seems like the best fit overall.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI believe \"Access\" is the right category since the user is experiencing issues connecting to servers after their relocation. They requested help, which reinforces this choice. Although \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant\u2014especially if they need admin credentials\u2014it's not explicitly mentioned. So, I'll stick with \"Access.\" I need to format the response as a JSON object aligning with the specified schema. It should look like this: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Access\"}}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
