The user mentions a \"new project\" setup on a specific date. The message is quite ambiguous, but it seems to focus on setting up something related to an internal project. Given the context, I\u2019m thinking the best category would likely be \"Internal Project,\" though there\u2019s also a chance it could pertain to \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" It definitely needs clarity.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a list of categories for routing an IT helpdesk ticket. The user's mention of a \"new project\" and \"setup\" makes me think it could relate to \"Administrative rights\" if they need that to set up the project. However, it doesn't refer to hardware, storage, access, or purchase, which leads me to opt for \"Internal Project.\" The note about an attached form also suggests they might be filling something out, but I\u2019ll choose \"Internal Project\" as the main category. I\u2019ll format the output in JSON as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
