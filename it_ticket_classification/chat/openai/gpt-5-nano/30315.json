They mention \"oracle cc approver\" and \"cost center approvals,\" suggesting it's about some approvals workflow. It could relate to administrative rights, access rights, or even purchases. The possible categories I can choose from are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It seems likely that \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" might fit best.**Evaluating IT ticket category**\n\nThe text seems unclear, but mentions \"approver\" and \"cost center approvals,\" suggesting it's about an approvals workflow in Oracle. This might involve assigning access or changing approvers, hinting at \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" If there\u2019s a project, it could also relate to \"Internal Project\" or even \"Miscellaneous\" if nothing fits well. Considering the request to \"move cost center approvals,\" it seems more aligned with \"Administrative rights,\" since that specifies admin privileges more precisely than just general \"Access.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nSince the user mentions \"approver\" roles, that points to administrative rights within the Oracle identity and approval workflows. I should categorize this as \"Administrative rights.\" The instructions also specify a JSON-like format, so I\u2019ll create a JSON object with the category specified. This is how I'll structure it:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nI'll make sure to keep it exactly as shown, without any extra text. It\u2019s important to follow the format!"
