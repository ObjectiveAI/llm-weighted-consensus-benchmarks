The mention of \u201cadjustable monitor\u201d and \u201ctower floor\u201d suggests it\u2019s likely a hardware request. Since the context seems to revolve around needing a computer monitor, I\u2019m thinking it fits best under the \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase\" categories. There's a clear indication that the user is looking for specific equipment, which helps narrow it down.**Categorizing IT Ticket Request**\n\nThis ticket clearly asks to allocate an adjustable monitor, indicating it\u2019s a hardware request. Phrases like \u201cmonitor change\u201d and \u201cneeds monitor herself\u201d suggest it relates to equipment. I think it fits best under the \"Hardware\" category because it's requesting specific hardware. Since the guidelines state I should format my response as a JSON object, I'll present it in that manner, including a brief note that this is an equipment request.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
