The ticket seems to focus on a \"pc test restore\" and mentions \"schedule\" and \"recurring ticket,\" which suggests it's related to a hardware or internal project issue due to its operational nature. Given that it emphasizes high importance and schedules, it's best to classify this ticket under \"Internal Project.\" So, that's the category I'll choose for this ticket!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI think this task is about a storage or backup restoration since \"pc test restore\" suggests it's related to restoring a PC test environment. It could fit the \"Storage\" category, especially if it's about data restoration. However, there might be an argument for \"Administrative rights\" due to the mention of creating requests. Yet, the focus seems to lean towards \"Internal Project\" because of the recurring nature outlined in the ticket. Ultimately, I\u2019ll go with \"Storage\" because it directly relates to restoring data.**Formatting answer as JSON**\n\nI need to create a JSON object to categorize the IT ticket as \"Storage,\" based on the provided schema. The instructions specify that I should keep my response concise and stick to the specified format without any extra commentary. Therefore, I'll ensure I respond with just the structured JSON output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"} \n\nThat's the correct format, and it aligns perfectly with what the user needs!"
