The raw ticket text is quite garbled. It mentions \"rebuild,\" \"Tuesday,\" and \"log tickets,\" which makes it tricky to decipher. I'm considering categorizing it as either an Internal Project or Miscellaneous, but there's a suggestion of asset rebuilding that might relate to Storage. It's a bit ambiguous, so I need to make a thoughtful decision.**Categorizing ticket for project**\n\nI need to choose the best category for the ticket based on the provided options, like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and more. The text suggests a project to rebuild assets, mentioning terms like \"log tickets\" and \"assign.\" Although \"Administrative rights\" has relevance, it doesn't quite fit here. I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit, as it pertains to rebuilding assets. I'll organize this decision and prepare to output in JSON format.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
