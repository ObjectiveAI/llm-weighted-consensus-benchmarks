The ticket mentions various concepts like \"new project request,\" \"confluence,\" \"git,\" and \"setup forms.\" It seems focused on creating a git repository and involves some administrative setup details. Given the provided categories, this ticket likely fits into \"Internal Project\" since it relates to project requests and development processes. Even though the content is a bit overwhelming, I think I've clarified the main focus.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm looking at the IT ticket, and the most fitting category seems to be either \"Access\" or \"Internal Project.\" It mentions access to the Git repository and Confluence, but it also talks about a new project request and setting up processes. While \"Administrative rights\" could work due to access wording, it feels like the best fit is \"Internal Project\" since it's all about creating a Git repository and managing project setups. So, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and format it as a JSON object.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
