The issue seems to be an error when they try to attach documents. They\u2019re asking for help to check the issue. This might not be \"Storage\" or \"HR Support,\" but it relates to permissions or attachment, so I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" for categorization.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the appropriate category for this IT ticket regarding the inability to upload documents. It could fall under \"Access\" if there's a permission issue, or \"Storage\" if it relates to storage capacity. Since the user mentioned an error when attempting to upload, \"Access\" seems to fit best. The issue is specifically about document uploads rather than storage capacity. I need to provide a JSON object to reflect this category accurately.**Outputting the final JSON**\n\nI\u2019m ready to respond with the appropriate JSON format for the IT ticket. Based on my evaluation, I believe \"Access\" is the best category choice for this situation. So, I\u2019ll craft the final output as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I considered \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Access\" is straightforward and fits well. I won't add any extra text; I'll just ensure it\u2019s in proper JSON format and deliver it as is."
