The ticket content is a bit jumbled, covering configuration changes and Jira-related elements. It doesn\u2019t fit neatly into any category. I think the best fits are either \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" Given it relates to internal project management in Jira, \"Internal Project\" seems most suitable.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the categories for an IT ticket. \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant since it involves required fields, but it's really about Jira configuration rather than access. \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a safe catch-all. Ultimately, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best choice since it's about configuring an internal tool with elements like epic links and labels. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} to match the required format. Let\u2019s keep it straightforward!**Outputting category JSON**\n\nThe system instructions indicate I should provide a \"category\" type with an enumeration. The decision is to output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I want to keep it straightforward since the app probably only needs this specific category. I\u2019ll avoid any extra details and just deliver the final JSON as required. Let's make sure to keep it clean and simple!"
