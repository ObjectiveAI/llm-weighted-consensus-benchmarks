The user seems to be asking for access on Tuesday, specifically for someone named Lazar, and there are mentions of permission and work. It\u2019s likely about access since they talk about receiving permission. I need to categorize this properly, so from the list, it should fit under \"Access.\" I'll make sure to clarify any remaining confusion in the ticket for accurate processing.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nIt seems like the request is all about granting access to a space for someone named Lazar on a specific floor. This definitely falls into the category of \"Access\" since they mention permission and working access rights. I believe \"Access\" is the most fitting category. For the response, I\u2019ll format it as required in JSON: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s a proper JSON object with no extra text.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
