The text mentions problems with phones being down and a request for assistance, indicating it's an IT issue related to hardware. I'm narrowing it down to \"Hardware\" since it directly concerns the functionality of phone systems. The other categories like \"Access\" or \"Internal Project\" don\u2019t fit here. So, I\u2019m confident that \"Hardware\" is the best choice.**Categorizing IT support ticket**\n\nI have an IT support ticket regarding telephony equipment, and I need to find the best category for it. \"Hardware\" feels appropriate since it's about physical phone systems. Although \"Miscellaneous\" was an option, it\u2019s definitely a support issue, so I\u2019m sticking with \"Hardware.\" I need to respond in JSON format, specifically:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}  \n\nIt\u2019s essential to ensure the categorization matches the specified allowed strings exactly.
