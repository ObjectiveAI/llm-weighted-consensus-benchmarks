The user's text discusses issues with Active Directory not syncing with Exchange and changes to mailing list membership. This situation mainly relates to directory services and access control. I think the best fit for this ticket is \"Access\" because it deals with synchronization and access groups. \"Administrative rights\" could apply but \"Access\" seems more suitable.**Categorizing the ticket in JSON**\n\nThe ticket discusses the address book and mailing list, which relates to membership management. Since \"Active Directory not synchronizing\" deals with access control, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" I need to respond with a JSON object according to the schema provided. It looks like the required format is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nHowever, I'm considering if we need the full schema object. Given the instructions, I should ensure I provide the exact structure that includes the properties per the schema. Let\u2019s confirm the output follows that format.**Providing the JSON output**\n\nI need to provide the JSON output strictly following the format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Even though there are no required fields specified, it's clear that I should keep things simple and straightforward. I\u2019ll make sure to just respond with the JSON object and avoid any extra text or heavy formatting. The focus is solely on delivering the correct response without any frills. Here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
