I think the best category here would be \"Internal Project\" since it's about importing opportunities as part of a project. While \"Miscellaneous\" is an option, it's too generic, and the request focuses on a specific task. If access issues were mentioned, \"Access\" might apply, but I don't see that here. So, I'll go with \"Internal Project\" and prepare the JSON output.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
