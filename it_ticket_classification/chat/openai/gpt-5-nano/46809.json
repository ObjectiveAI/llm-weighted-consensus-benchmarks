I have a schema with categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others to choose from. My task is to read through the ticket content and determine which category it fits into. I'll ensure I follow the provided schema accurately to help the user receive the right support for their issue.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket content indicates a user encountering a forbidden error while trying to access a site. It's quite garbled but essentially revolves around login issues related to access control. Based on this, \"Access\" seems to be the most fitting category. I also wonder if \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights\" might apply, but Access feels the most appropriate here. I want to categorize it correctly to help the user resolve their issue effectively!**Preparing JSON output**\n\nThe ticket is about a login issue, and \"Access\" seems to be the best category. According to the required format, I need to respond with a JSON object that has a \"category\" field. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to make sure there's no extra text, just the JSON object as specified. The prompt asks to categorize the IT ticket, and the JSON structure confirms that. It\u2019s straightforward!"
