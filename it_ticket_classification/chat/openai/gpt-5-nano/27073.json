It mentions processes for submission, breakdowns, and training materials due by Wednesday. This sounds like it might fit under \"Access\" since it's about accessing and validating the join date in Oracle. Alternatively, it could also be an \"Internal Project\" if it relates to ongoing processes. I need to decide which category best represents it.**Determining category for join date correction**\n\nThe phrase \"join date to be corrected in Oracle\" suggests this might be related to HR or an Access issue. Looking at the provided categories, it fits best under \"Access\" since it involves system data modification in Oracle. However, if it\u2019s about permissions, \"Administrative rights\" might also apply. There are mentions of weekly reporting and training materials that hint at process compliance, which could support classifying this as an \"Internal Project\" as well. The categories are somewhat limited, though.**Deciding on category for the ticket**\n\nI believe \"Access\" is the best category since the request involves correcting data in Oracle, which needs access rights to modify. If that doesn't fit, \"Internal Project\" might apply for a specific initiative. I'm not entirely sure how \"Administrative rights\" fits in, as it tends to relate to permissions. The request to \"please action\" clarifies the need for a deliverable. I will categorize it as \"Access\" and respond with a JSON object formatted like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
