It looks like it\u2019s about a new starter in Belgrade, mentioning dates like Friday and next Wednesday. The ticket is pretty brief, but it seems to involve setting up access or IT hardware for the new employee. Given the mention of \u201cnew starter,\u201d I\u2019ll lean toward \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d since it likely involves onboarding and account access. It could also fit into \u201cHR Support.\u201d**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nIt seems like \u201cAccess\u201d is the right choice for categorizing this IT ticket, as it relates to provisioning user access. The mention of \u201cnew starter\u201d indicates it's about onboarding a new employee in Belgrade, and they might be arranging for a device and access by next Wednesday. Since they referenced an attachment, there are likely details that support this. I\u2019ll categorize it as \u201cAccess\u201d and provide a short justification, focusing on provisioning access for the new starter.**Outputting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to respond with the correct JSON format for the category. Since I\u2019ve decided on \u201cAccess,\u201d I\u2019ll structure my response accordingly. It\u2019s important to ensure proper quoting since the category should be a string. The task specifies delivering a minimal explanation, so I\u2019ll provide just the JSON without extra info. My response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Simple and straightforward\u2014that should do the trick!"
