Looking at the allowed categories, it's clear that this ticket falls under \"Access\" since it's specifically about the access card return. However, since the ticket also references a leaver, \"HR Support\" could also apply. So, for our JSON structure, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" for clarity.**Classifying IT Tickets**\n\nFor typical IT ticket classification, \"Access\" is usually the right category for access cards, while \"HR Support\" fits for HR matters. The user's note mentions that an ex-employee's access card was returned in February. Since it's about returning the card and removing access, it fits better under \"Access.\" \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object formatted as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, keeping it simple without unnecessary explanations.**Outputting JSON Format**\n\nThe instructions clearly state that I should output a JSON-like format. It mentions valid channels, specifically \"final,\" for this task, so that means my response must be in the correct JSON structure. I\u2019ll keep it simple and just respond with the necessary line: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra text or explanations should be included. Let's go ahead and deliver that!"
