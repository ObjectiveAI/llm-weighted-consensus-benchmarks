It seems to be about expenses and auditor approval, but does it really fit in Access? That\u2019s unclear.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the categories for an IT ticket related to an \"expense report.\" The available categories seem generic\u2014like \"Administrative rights\"\u2014but that might not fit explicitly here. \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous\" come to mind, but nothing feels perfect. The mention of \"print preview ca report status pending\" suggests potential \"Access\" issues. Since \"Finance\" or \"Billing\" aren\u2019t options, I think \"Miscellaneous\" could work best as a catch-all for this situation, given its business nature.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
