The text seems garbled but mentions \"hardware change\" and \"returning from maternity,\" which indicates it pertains to a hardware replacement related to someone coming back from maternity leave. Since there's a mix of IT and HR elements, I realize the appropriate category might be \"HR Support.\" However, considering it\u2019s an IT ticket, I need to ensure I classify it correctly within IT specifications.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe content refers to a \"hardware change\" and mentions someone returning from maternity leave, which likely involves IT needing to provide hardware, like a laptop, to this employee. It alludes to filling out a returning date, and while it seems messy, I suspect it could also involve access permissions. However, since the ticket emphasizes the hardware aspect, categorizing it as \"Hardware\" makes sense. An alternative could be \"HR Support\" due to its connection with maternity leave, but the hardware needs take precedence.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize this IT ticket, and I'm considering the content carefully. It could fall under \"HR Support\" if it relates to the return-to-work process, but it also mentions a \"hardware change\" and a \"returning date.\" Though categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" might be options, they don\u2019t quite fit here. Given the emphasis on hardware, I think \"Hardware\" is the best choice. Therefore, I\u2019ll output it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
