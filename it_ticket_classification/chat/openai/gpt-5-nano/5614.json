The user refers to \"allocation,\" \"new purchase,\" and mentions a \"TV LED\" that needs logging after receipt. Looking at the categories defined by the system, it seems like it fits best in \"Purchase\" since it's clearly related to ordering and receiving an item. However, it could also belong to \"Hardware\" since it involves a TV, which is hardware. I'm leaning toward \"Purchase.\"**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI'm deciding that the \"Purchase\" category is probably the best fit for this IT ticket. Based on guidelines for categorizing, if it's related to procurement or purchasing, it should be classified under \"Purchase.\" Categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" and others don\u2019t seem relevant here. I should respond with a JSON-like structure that includes the category. It needs to adhere to the schema format, so I'll use: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. This fits the required output format!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
