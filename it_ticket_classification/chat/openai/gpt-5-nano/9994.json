The list of categories includes Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I\u2019ll need to analyze the text and determine which category fits best, then format my response as a JSON object with the chosen category. This should be straightforward, so I\u2019ll aim for clarity in my output. Let\u2019s finalize this!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s message indicates they want a mailbox space increase, essentially asking to boost mailbox storage. This falls under the category of \"Storage.\" I think the options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Purchase\" don\u2019t quite fit here. So, I'll categorize it as \"Storage.\" \n\nNow I\u2019ll ensure to format my response as the required JSON object. The instruction is clear: I need to provide only the category string. Let's finalize that!**Clarifying output format**\n\nIn past tasks, I remember needing to respond with just the category as plain text, but this time there's a JSON schema provided. It appears the system is expecting a structured object for the response. So, while I could simply say \"Storage,\" the instructions suggest I should go with a JSON object instead. \n\nTo fulfill the requirement, I\u2019ll format it as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. This approach should satisfy the expectations!**Following the output schema**\n\nWhile I could simply respond with \"Storage,\" it seems best to stay aligned with the provided schema. So, I\u2019ll format my response as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} to meet expectations clearly. I need to ensure there\u2019s no misunderstanding, especially since the user's request was about categorization. \n\nNow that I've decided on the final format, I'll just double-check if there's any nuance I might be missing regarding the \"mailbox space increase.\" However, I'm feeling confident about this approach. Let's proceed!"
