The request mentions needing to delete specific code and sounds like it relates to code management. I\u2019m ruling out categories like Hardware or Access since it\u2019s not about those. It might fit into \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The absence of \"Software\" or \"Development\" makes it tricky, but it seems most aligned with code management.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nIn categorizing this IT ticket, I see \"Internal Project\" being the closest fit, especially since it deals with a project code. \"Miscellaneous\" also comes to mind if it doesn't quite fit elsewhere. However, \"Administrative rights\" seems less relevant here since the request is focused more on deleting code rather than needing permission to do so. Given it mentions \"delete oracle code,\" I'm inclined to go with \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
