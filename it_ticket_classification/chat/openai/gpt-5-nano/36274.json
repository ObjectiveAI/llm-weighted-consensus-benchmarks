It seems to touch on upgrade instructions, a potential forced upgrade, and document references. Given the context, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Administrative rights,\" though \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could be options as well. I'll weigh these categories carefully!**Categorizing IT ticket further**\n\nI\u2019m reconsidering the best category for this IT ticket. It doesn't seem to fall under \"hardware\" or \"access.\" \"Administrative rights\" might make sense since it involves tasks related to upgrades, but it doesn't mention admin privileges explicitly. It could also fit under \"Internal Project\" if it's part of a scheduled upgrade or project. \"Miscellaneous\" is a catch-all, but leaning toward \"Internal Project\" seems more appropriate given the focus on compliance and documentation for the upgrade. It's a bit ambiguous, though!**Crafting response for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that this ticket clearly relates to performing an upgrade rather than requesting rights. That makes \"Internal Project\" the most fitting category! I'll need to respond with a JSON object and ensure it follows the specified schema, using the exact allowed values. So, the output should be just {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It might be nice to provide a brief rationale, but since the prompt explicitly asks for a category, I think it's safest to keep it concise and just give the JSON object."
