This way, I can ensure it gets handled by the right team efficiently.**Identifying project tasks**\n\nThe ticket appears to involve various IT project tasks mentioning things like amending tasks for a project, Confluence dashboard, Git library, Puma, Sonar, defects, user acceptance testing, documentation writing, training, environment configuration, and code changes. It's pretty noisy, but it does indicate these specific tasks, which all relate to an internal project. Considering this, I think the best category for this ticket would be \"Internal Project.\"**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe user is asking to create sub codes, but I think the best category is \"Internal Project.\" It could also fit under \"Miscellaneous,\" but since it relates to IT project tasks, \"Internal Project\" seems more accurate. I need to respond with a JSON object in the required format, specifically: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. The instruction clearly asks for a simple classification, so I\u2019ll stick to the JSON format without any extra text. Let's go with that!"
