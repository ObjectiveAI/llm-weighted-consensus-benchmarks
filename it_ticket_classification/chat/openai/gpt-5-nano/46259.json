The category options include \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" but since it clearly relates to remote connection, the best fit is probably \"Access\" for remote access issues.**Deciding on category format**\n\nI\u2019m determining the best category for an IT ticket related to remote connectivity. While \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d might apply since it involves login rights, \u201cAccess\u201d seems more suitable. I need to respond in a specified format, resembling a JSON object. The instruction indicates to provide just the category. Therefore, I should output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It looks like that's what the app expects, even though I wonder if they might want more suggestions. Keeping to the instructions is key here!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
