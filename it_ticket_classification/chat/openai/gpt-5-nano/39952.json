The text mentions urgency and raises concerns about access or permissions. Given the context, it likely fits under the \"Access\" category since it deals with accessing a shared mailbox. While storage might seem relevant, the main issue appears to be about access, rather than storage. I\u2019ll go ahead and classify this ticket as \"Access\".**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering different categories for the IT ticket about the shared mailbox issue. While \"Storage\" might apply if it were a size issue, it doesn't seem relevant here. \"Administrative rights\" could fit if it were about permissions, but \"Access\" seems to be the best choice since it directly addresses the mailbox access problem. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the following: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I just need to ensure the capitalization is correct."
