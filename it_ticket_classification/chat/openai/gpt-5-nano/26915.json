This text mentions \"decommission,\" \"migrated pages,\" and \"default,\" which suggest that it's about decommissioning sites. \n\nI\u2019m considering the categories: Internal Project, Administrative Rights, Storage, or Miscellaneous. Since decommissioning is typically an IT project management task, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best fit. However, it could also relate to \"Storage\" if it involves storing data from those sites.**Finalizing Category Choice**\n\nI\u2019m realizing \"Internal Project\" is a bit too general, but it's the best fit for the phrase \"sites ready for decommission,\" which suggests a project related to decommissioning websites or servers. \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d doesn\u2019t apply, and \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d could work if things are unclear. \n\nThe user provided information about \u201cmigrated pages\u201d and \u201cdefault,\u201d but it doesn't change my mind. I'll respond with a JSON object, categorizing this ticket as: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. It aligns with the instructions and keeps it straightforward!**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI need to provide just the category in JSON format. While the instructions don\u2019t explicitly require extra notes, it seems fine to keep it straightforward. The user might want it formatted as an object. So, I'll stick to the instruction and output only the JSON. \n\nThe final response will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra commentary, just the clean JSON object."
