The ticket mentions a \"new starter\" and requests assistance with a \"starter form\" and mobile phone purchase. \n\nIt seems to involve hardware, access, or HR support. Since it highlights both HR needs and hardware assistance, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it under \"HR Support\" or \"Hardware,\" since both fit the context well.**Categorizing IT request**\n\nThe ticket states, \"please assist completion enclosed starter form please advise hardware.\" This suggests the user needs help with both completing a starter form and hardware advice, plus they mention a mobile phone purchase. \n\n\"Hardware\" seems like a fitting category because of the hardware mention, and \"Purchase\" aligns with the mobile phone reference. However, since IT tickets usually require one category, I'll need to decide the best fit. The mention of onboarding leads me to consider \"HR Support,\" but the IT provisioning angle points more towards \"Hardware.\"**Determining the category**\n\nThe best fit for this ticket seems to be \"Hardware,\" since the main action involves hardware provision and a mobile phone purchase is also mentioned. While \"Purchase\" could apply, \"Hardware\" captures the need for equipment more directly. \n\nI need to respond succinctly with a JSON object for the category. So, I\u2019ll format it according to the required schema. Here\u2019s the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
