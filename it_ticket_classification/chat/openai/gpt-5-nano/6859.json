It looks like an access request, so I'll lean towards the \"Access\" category for being more generic, but it could also be \"Administrative rights\" since they are requesting write permissions, which suggest admin-level access. The phrase about \"accepting or declining requests\" seems less relevant for the category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket, and it looks like it should fall under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it's about adding a user with write permissions, it aligns more with \"Administrative rights.\" The user has asked how to categorize this ticket, and I need to provide a JSON format response. \n\nSo, I'll respond with:  \n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}  \n\nThis keeps everything clear and adheres to their requested format! No extra commentary needed."
