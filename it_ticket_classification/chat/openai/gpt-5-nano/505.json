The user mentions revising mailbox permissions and seems to discuss various aspects like checking members, removing unnecessary permissions, and tracking. Given the focus on access permissions, it looks like this ticket fits the \"Access\" category. The details indicate it's about managing mailbox permissions, which is crucial for maintaining proper access management. So, I'm leaning towards classifying this ticket under Access.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm working on categorizing this IT ticket. The terms \"mailbox permissions\" and \"remove unnecessary permissions\" indicate that it relates to access management. Even references to a task planner and other project-related phrases suggest a focus on access. So, I'm deciding on the \"Access\" category as the best fit. The instructions say I need to structure my output as a JSON object, so I'll format that correctly: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This should meet the requirements!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
