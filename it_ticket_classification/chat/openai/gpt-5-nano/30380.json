There's also a mention of \"package,\" which could mean they need certain permissions for Wednesday PM. Since there are separate categories for \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" I'll lean toward \"Access\" for this ticket.**Deciding on Ticket Categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether \"package\" refers to a software package or a physical one. The phrase \"hi please provide package\" implies they need something. I see that \"Storage\" and \"Purchase\" are options, but they don't directly match. Since they mention \"access\" and \"Wednesday PM,\" I think \"Access\" fits best. However, it could also fall under \"Administrative rights\" if they're asking for admin privileges. Finally, I'll categorize this as \"Access\" and ensure to respond in the correct JSON format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
