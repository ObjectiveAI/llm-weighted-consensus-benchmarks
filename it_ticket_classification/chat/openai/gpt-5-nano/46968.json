The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Based on the ticket details, it clearly relates to hardware issues with the phone device. While it might also touch on internal projects or miscellaneous topics, \"Hardware\" seems like the most fitting category.**Outputting IT Ticket category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to respond with a JSON object that fits the schema provided. The category options are clearly defined, and based on the ticket content, \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate choice. While I briefly considered \"Software,\" it doesn't seem to fit as well. I'll stick to the required format and output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without additional justification, as the instructions specify to keep it concise.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
