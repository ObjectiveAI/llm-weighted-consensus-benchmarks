The user shared a lengthy description about an \"approval tab\" related to a \"zone award nomination\". It seems like it's an internal helpdesk request with lots of praise for a nominee and details about the review process. They\u2019ve asked for a suitable category from a defined list. Given the focus on nominations and approvals, it seems to fit best under \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Internal Project\".**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket and noting that it doesn't fit into categories like hardware, access, storage, purchase, or admin rights. It seems to relate more to \"Internal Project\" or \"HR Support\". This ticket definitely covers nominations and awards, so \"HR Support\" is likely the best fit. The content references nomination details and workflows, indicating it\u2019s more about HR processes than a project. Therefore, I'll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Formatting response**\n\nI'm noting that the required format for the response is specific. It asks for a JSON object that specifies the category. The user has indeed asked to categorize the IT ticket, so I should provide just the category value in the appropriate format. Since the category is determined to be \"HR Support,\" I\u2019ll respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nThis concise response fits the required format without any extra commentary."
