It's also good to think about adding a brief note to clarify, but the priority is correctly formatting the output.  \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}**Formatting the category response**\n\nI see that I need to format the response according to the instructions for categorizing the IT ticket. The main goal is to present the category clearly. It looks like they want just the JSON format, specifically something like {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. However, the schema they provided mentions a structure that includes \"type\":\"object.\" It\u2019s a bit confusing, but I\u2019ll stick to what they asked for and just provide the category in the expected format.  \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}**Returning the category string**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that the most appropriate category to return is \"Internal Project.\" To keep things simple and follow the format requested, I\u2019ll provide the output as a JSON object. This aligns with the allowed enum categories and should meet the user's requirements. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
