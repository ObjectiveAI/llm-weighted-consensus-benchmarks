The user refers to onboarding, transferring access rights, and making accesses linked. Looking at the categories, \"Access\" seems most appropriate because the ticket discusses access concerns. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit since it relates to admin privileges, that feels too specific for this ticket context. So, \"Access\" is definitely the best choice here!**Categorizing Ticket Context**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT ticket, which is about a new starter form. Although \"HR Support\" is a category, this ticket seems more focused on IT functions rather than technical HR tasks. It mentions linking access and transfers for a new starter. That makes \"Access\" the more fitting category here since the main task revolves around setting up necessary access. However, \"HR Support\" could still apply if we view it through the onboarding perspective.**Setting Up Response Format**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to provide a response in a specific JSON format. The instructions clearly state to use a schema for the category object. This means I should output only the category value as one of the predefined strings. I can keep it simple and just respond with the object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to make sure there's no extra text\u2014just the clean JSON object as specified."
