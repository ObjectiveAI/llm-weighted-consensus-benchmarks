The request to \"Categorize this IT Ticket\" signals it needs a structured output. I should categorize this as \"Hardware\" based on the content discussing sizing requirements. So I'll format my output as a JSON-like category, declaring it as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That seems to fit well!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering if this might be \"Storage\" since it's about image sizing. However, \"image determine sizing requirements\" indicates we're considering sizing for storage. The ticket mentions \"machine\" and \"image,\" which leans towards hardware. Given all this, I believe categorizing it as \"Hardware\" is best. There\u2019s also hints of it being an \"Internal Project,\" but it\u2019s not definitive. Since the prompt is clear to provide a category, my response will simply be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. No extra text needed!"
