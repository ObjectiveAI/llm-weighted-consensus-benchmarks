It seems to fit best under \"Internal Project,\" as it\u2019s about a decommissioning task within an infrastructure project. However, since \"infrastructure\" isn\u2019t an option, I\u2019ll consider \"Hardware\" instead.**Deciding Ticket Category**\n\nThe phrase \u201cfloor cage decommission\u201d likely refers to decommissioning hardware infrastructure where servers are housed. I have categories like Hardware, Storage, and Internal Project to consider. While decommissioning is project-related, it\u2019s also about hardware, making it a bit tricky. I lean toward \"Internal Project\" since it relates to a specific task. The user's message indicates they want to categorize this IT ticket, so I need to provide a clear structure based on the options given.**Categorizing IT Task**\n\nI should respond with something like {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} or perhaps \"Hardware\" or \"Infrastructure.\" Analyzing the user's message, it mentions an \"issue with oracle floor cage decommission.\" This likely refers to hardware related to an Oracle system. Keywords like \"internal project\" imply it\u2019s part of a larger task to decommission equipment. So, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit for this decommissioning task within an infrastructure context.**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the options: \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" None seem relevant here. The ticket focuses on the \"oracle floor cage decommission,\" which indicates a project-related action. While \"floor cage\" refers to hardware, the decommissioning aspect aligns it more with \"Internal Project.\" Since the user has asked for categorization, I'll go with \"Internal Project.\" The expected response should be a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} as the final output.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
