They want to keep the Apple Pro, which suggests that this ticket is related to a hardware return process. So, I'll categorize it under Hardware.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe user states, \"return windows laptop november pm\" and reasons for the return: they received an Apple MacBook Pro that works, so they want to keep it and return the Windows laptop. This means it's a hardware issue, making \"Hardware\" the right category. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object indicating that, so it will be formatted as {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}.
