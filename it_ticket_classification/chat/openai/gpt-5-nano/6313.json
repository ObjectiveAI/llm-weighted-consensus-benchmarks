The message is a bit jumbled, but it mentions \"access to servers,\" \"pre prod proxy,\" and \"AD policy.\" I see that this ticket revolves around access rights and possibly administrative rights. The categories I\u2019m considering include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" depending on the details. The user seems to be asking for help with server access, related to Active Directory policy and security.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at an IT ticket that seems to request access to servers, likely with Active Directory (AD) policy considerations. I think the best classification is \"Access\" since it focuses on server access and mentions \"pre prod proxy\" and \"inside secure proxy.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could apply, there's no clear indication of needing elevated privileges in the ticket. So I should respond with a JSON object, specifically: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without adding extra text.**Responding with category format**\n\nThe user has requested I categorize an IT ticket, so I need to respond with a JSON object that includes the category. The ticket mentions \"pre prod,\" which hints at a pre-production environment and could imply \"Internal Project.\" However, since the focus is on access to servers and AD policy, \"Access\" seems to be the more appropriate classification. I\u2019ll finalize my response as follows: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and ensure I provide only that."
