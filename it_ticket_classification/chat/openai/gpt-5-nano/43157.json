The phrase \"sent monday march\" may indicate the sending date, and \"hi merge\" could refer to an email or greeting. Given the context, I'd categorize this ticket under \"Hardware,\" since it directly relates to a physical item, not access.**Confirming IT ticket category**\n\nI'm trying to decide on the best category for the IT ticket, which mentions a \"broken key.\" Categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Storage\" don't fit here. \"Purchase\" could apply if they need a replacement, but since the ticket only states a broken key, I'd categorize it as \"Hardware.\" While \"Miscellaneous\" is another option, \"broken key\" clearly suggests hardware. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object indicating the category: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Let's keep it straightforward!**Responding with JSON format**\n\nTo be safe, I see that the allowed format requires a JSON object to define the category. The correct response would be simply {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I'll make sure not to include any extra content, just stick to the essentials. I'll respond directly with this JSON format since it's what\u2019s expected. Keeping it clear and concise is the way to go!"
