The ticket mentions a cable for a desk monitor, connecting a monitor, and a request for assistance. This strongly indicates it's about \"Hardware\" since it involves a cable and monitor. However, it might also fit under \"Purchase\" if they're requesting to procure a cable. Given the context of asking for a cable, I think \"Hardware\" is likely the best fit, as it's not a problem but a request.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize the IT ticket. The user requests a \"cable for desk monitor,\" which suggests a \"Hardware\" issue since it's about connecting a monitor. While \"Purchase\" might fit if they wanted to buy a new cable, it's more about needing hardware assistance. Given the content, I believe \"Hardware\" is the best category. I\u2019ll present this as a JSON object, focusing solely on the required category.**Formatting category output**\n\nI see the \"category\" object description, and it clearly indicates how I should format my response. I need to keep it simple and straightforward, so the output should just be the category without any additional text. In this case, that means I'll provide it as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nAlright, that seems correct, and I\u2019ll stick to the instructions!"
