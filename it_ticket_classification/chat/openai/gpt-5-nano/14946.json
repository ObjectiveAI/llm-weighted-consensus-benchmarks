The best category seems to be \"Internal Project\" since it fits tasks like this well. Though \"Miscellaneous\" could work for general IT tasks, \"Internal Project\" clearly aligns with installation management. I don\u2019t see a specific \"Installation\" category. I\u2019ll craft the final output as a JSON-like object: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. Double-checking, that matches the valid channels!**Clarifying response format**\n\nI think it makes sense to provide a brief explanation, but the required format is just the JSON object. The user\u2019s instructions indicate they want me to categorize the IT Ticket, and the output format only needs to show the category object. So, I\u2019ll focus on just delivering that JSON object without any fluff. Keeping it straightforward makes sense here to meet their request clearly! I'll make it efficient."
