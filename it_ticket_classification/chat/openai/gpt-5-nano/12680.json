Given the content about password management and access credentials, it looks like \"Access\" is the most suitable category. However, I\u2019m also considering \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d I think \"Access\" fits best.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nLet's confirm the categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I\u2019m considering either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" especially if there's a request to change an administrative password. The ticket seems to focus on updating computer passwords, so \"Access\" appears to be the most suitable option.
