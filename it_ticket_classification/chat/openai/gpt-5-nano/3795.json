The user provided a description related to an employee leaving and various tasks like permissions, mailbox, and profile management. There are several categories available: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It seems best to categorize this as HR Support due to its focus on offboarding tasks like deprovisioning access and managing personal accounts. I need to ensure it fits one category that covers all those responsibilities.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm categorizing a ticket about a \"leaver form\" that includes aspects like access rights, mailbox, and roaming profile. The closest fit seems to be \"Access\" since it's about deprovisioning rights. While \"Administrative rights\" is a separate category, the repeated mention of \"ad rights\" serves to reinforce my decision to go with \"Access.\" For the response, I'll provide the required JSON format with the category value, like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Just need to keep it minimal as instructed!**Providing JSON for Category**\n\nThe prompt indicates I need to produce a JSON object with the category format. I'll use {\"category\":\"Access\"} as it fits. This response must be minimal and direct, with no added text. I just need to focus on providing the category in the specified format to comply with the user's request. Ensuring clarity and conciseness here is key! So I\u2019ll prepare to respond with just that simple JSON object."
