Given that it mentions provisioning hardware like workstations, minis, and associated components, it seems most fitting to categorize this ticket under \"Hardware.\"**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering which category to place this IT ticket. It focuses on hardware provisioning with terms like \"workstation\" and \"minis.\" It could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" if it relates to user provisioning and system access. However, it mainly discusses hardware like monitors and keyboards, making \"Hardware\" seem the most appropriate. Ultimately, I'll need to output a JSON object with this category value. So, I'll go with \"Hardware.\"**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, which involves filling out a bulk starter form and mentions hardware provisioning for interns. It could fit under \"Administrative rights,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Internal Project.\" However, since it heavily discusses hardware like workstations, Minis, and peripherals, \"Hardware\" seems to be the most suitable choice. The ticket involves both provisioning and onboarding, so I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object indicating the category as \"Hardware.\"{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
