The ticket refers to a new purchase order for a PC camera, mentioning logging allocation and receipts. It seems to focus on purchasing hardware, so I should consider categories like \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" It might also touch on \"Administrative rights\" since it mentions logging and receipts. This means I'll classify it as either \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware\" for clarity.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user wants to log allocation and receipts, which makes \"Purchase\" the most fitting category since it refers to a new purchase order for a PC camera. While \"Hardware\" could also apply because it\u2019s a physical device, the primary focus here is on purchasing and procurement. Given the context and requirements for categorization, I\u2019ll choose \"Purchase.\" I'll respond using the required JSON format with the category field set to \"Purchase.\"{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
