It talks about installations and includes terms like \"Windows\" and \"supplier.\" Since it revolves around purchase orders, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase.\" It doesn\u2019t fit other categories like Hardware or Internal Project. The repeated mention of \u201cpurchase\u201d confirms my choice!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
