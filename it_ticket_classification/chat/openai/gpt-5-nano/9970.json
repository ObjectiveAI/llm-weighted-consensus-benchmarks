It seems to relate mostly to HR support because of the focus on leaver forms and rights. So, HR Support feels like the best fit for this ticket!**Categorizing leaver workflow**\n\nIt seems this IT ticket involves a leaver workflow in ServiceNow, focusing on aspects like leaver forms, leaving dates, mailbox access, and rights. I\u2019m considering the categories available: \u201cAccess\u201d feels most fitting because it addresses leaver access changes or deprovisioning. \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, but that typically involves granting or revoking privileges. While \"Purchase\" mentions a coordinator and \"Storage\" references inventory, they don't seem central. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket under \"Access\"!**Categorizing offboarding process**\n\nThis ticket seems to relate to a deprovisioning or employee offboarding process. In typical IT ticket categorization, it might fall under \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"HR Support.\" The provided categories include \"HR Support,\" which is relevant, but since this ticket focuses on user access removal, \"Access\" seems more appropriate. There are multiple mentions of leaver details, such as forms, mailbox access, and profiles. So, I'll categorize this IT ticket as \"Access\" to reflect the deprovisioning aspect!**Outputting category JSON**\n\nI'll categorize this IT ticket as follows: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nThe prompt specifically asks for a JSON object. The system guidelines confirm that the category needs to be one of the defined strings, and in this case, \"Access\" fits best. I\u2019m making sure my output is properly quoted and formatted without any extra text to meet the requirements. It's time to deliver this cleanly!"
