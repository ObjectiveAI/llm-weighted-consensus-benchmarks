The categories to choose from include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and more. The text mentions \"weekly tape change\" and \"backup,\" leading me to think the \"Storage\" category fits best since it relates to tape backup storage. I decide it's about backup management, so I'll categorize it as \"Storage\" and respond with a JSON object reflecting that.**Formulating JSON response**\n\nThe prompt asks me to categorize an IT ticket, and the output should be a JSON object. The required format specifies that I need a category property with a value from a predefined list. I determine that \"Storage\" fits best since the ticket discusses weekly tape changes and backup processes rather than just hardware devices. It\u2019s focused on automation and storage management, so I\u2019ll confirm that the response will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I need to keep the response clean and straightforward."
