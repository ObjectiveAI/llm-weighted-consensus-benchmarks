There\u2019s a mention of updating maps to include a dropdown for work locations, and the priority is the location itself. The request is to add references to Colombia throughout the document. I\u2019m considering what category this fits best. \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t seem appropriate, but \"Internal Project\" may work since it\u2019s an internal document update. \"HR Support\" could also apply due to its relation to HR onboarding processes.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize a ticket about updating a form in the system. It could fit under \"Administrative rights,\" but that doesn't seem quite right. The categories I'll consider are likely \"Internal Project\" or \"HR Support.\" The mention of a \"new starter form\" suggests HR involvement, and the work location dropdown might indicate an IT system update. However, since it focuses on content updates related to Colombia, I'll say \"Internal Project\" is the best fit after all. Crafting a JSON-like response seems like the next step!**Delivering the category**\n\nI see that the instructions are clear: I need to provide the category in a specific JSON-like format. So, I\u2019ll output it as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Being concise is key here! Since the user is asking to categorize an IT ticket, I wonder if it might be helpful to add a brief justification along with that. But ultimately, delivering the required format accurately is my main goal. So, here goes!"
