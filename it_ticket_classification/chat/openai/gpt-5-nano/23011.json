It includes terms like \"re setup,\" \"package technician,\" and \"visibility\" for colleagues. It looks like it's about configuring packages and Mac setups, waiting for a package to finish. \n\nI'm considering categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or possibly \"Purchase.\" Given the focus on setup and guides, it fits well under \"Internal Project\" since it relates to IT setup tasks and creating procedures.**Choosing a Category**\n\nI'm looking at the categories available: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \u201cInternal Project,\u201d \u201cAccess,\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d seem the most fitting. \n\nThe mention of \"visibility\" implies access rights for colleagues, and the request for a \"sort guide\" sounds like it's about creating a how-to guide. While it relates to Mac setups, I think \"Internal Project\" is best, but \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could also work if it\u2019s about permissions to install software or set up configurations.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
