It includes phrases about \"stories\" and \"increasing traffic leads,\" suggesting it's related to some form of content management or project. Considering the terms, it might fit best in the \"Internal Project\" category since it seems to deal with changes and improvements within a system or content stream.**Classifying IT requests**\n\nThis request appears to be related to changing text on web pages and possibly involves the staging environment, suggesting it's connected to development. It could fall into the \"Internal Project\" category, but I\u2019m considering others like \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The latter might apply if permissions are needed, but it feels more like a content change task. Given the context, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit for this development-related request.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
