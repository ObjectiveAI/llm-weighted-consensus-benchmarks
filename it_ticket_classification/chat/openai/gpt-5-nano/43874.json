The user described problems with sending meetings and joining conference calls, which points to email or calendar functionality problems. I\u2019m considering \"Access,\" but it doesn't mention login issues, so that might not fit. \"Administrative rights\" seems too specific, and it definitely isn\u2019t \"Hardware\" since Outlook is software. I think \"Miscellaneous\" reflects the general IT issue best here!**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nThe best category for this IT ticket seems to be \"Miscellaneous\" since it's a general software or communication issue related to Outlook. I considered \"Access\" since it mentions issues with meetings and conference calls, but there's no explicit permission problem mentioned. While \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, it's not clearly stated. So, I'll stick with \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format as requested, like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
