It seems they're requesting a new access card and want to deactivate a card for someone who has left today. The phrasing is a bit unclear, but it seems like they're asking to activate a new card while deactivating the old one of the person who is leaving. So, the main points here are: issue a new access card, deactivate the old card, and activate it for the incoming person.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, and I see we have several options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Since this ticket deals with access control, the best fit is likely \"Access.\" There's also a possibility for \"HR Support\" due to the mention of employee termination and card deactivation. However, I'll stick with \"Access\" for card provisioning. \n\nNow, I\u2019ll format it as a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"} since that's the expectation for final output.**Finalizing category response**\n\nMy task here is clear: I need to provide the category in the required JSON format. Since the appropriate category is \"Access,\" I'll format it exactly as needed. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I must remember not to include any extra commentary or information\u2014not even a word! So, this means I\u2019ll stick with just that JSON object for the final response. Let's ensure it\u2019s perfect."
