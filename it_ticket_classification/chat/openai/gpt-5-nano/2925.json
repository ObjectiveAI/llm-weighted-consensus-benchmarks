The options for categorization include: \u201cHardware,\u201d \u201cHR Support,\u201d \u201cAccess,\u201d \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d \u201cStorage,\u201d \u201cPurchase,\u201d \u201cInternal Project,\u201d and \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d \n\nLooking at keywords like \"reopen\" and \"weekly template sheet,\" it hints that it's possibly related to an internal project or a request for administrative rights. However, nothing mentions hardware, storage, purchase, or HR, so let\u2019s go with \"Internal Project\" for now.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a user\u2019s IT ticket that mentions \"weekly template sheet has assigned\" which could mean that tasks related to this sheet have been assigned. The term \"reopen\" appears twice along with requests like \"Hello please advise.\" \n\nLooking at the categories available, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since it relates to a weekly template sheet, but \"Administrative rights\" could work if editing permissions are needed. \"Access\" might apply too, but there\u2019s no mention of login issues, so \"Internal Project\" seems safest.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI'm working through a ticket mentioning a \"weekly template sheet,\" which might refer to a template used regularly, potentially in Google Sheets or Excel. Since there's uncertainty, \"Miscellaneous\" could be a safe choice. However, the repeated requests to \"reopen\" and \"please advise\" suggest it\u2019s more about workflows.\n\nI\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" as the category since it relates to project artifacts. I should clearly provide the category in a JSON format as specified in the schema, so it\u2019s just about delivering that string value.**Formatting the response**\n\nThe developer has specified that I need to respond in a certain format. I see the JSON schema indicates we should provide a JSON object with a \"category\" field. I'll go ahead and select \"Internal Project\" as my category.\n\nSo the output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It looks like there's no room for extra notes or text\u2014just the category itself, ensuring that the JSON format is valid and correctly quoted. Let's go with that!"
