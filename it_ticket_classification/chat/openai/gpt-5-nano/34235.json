The user is experiencing issues with assigning a task due to difficulties identifying the appropriate user, despite trying to type the name or address. They are requesting assistance with viewing planning epics. This suggests the ticket involves access and project-related issues. Therefore, I should categorize it under \"Access,\" as it primarily concerns user identification and access to tasks.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI think this ticket fits into the \"Access\" category since it\u2019s focused on identifying users and access issues. However, it could also be \"Administrative rights\" if it\u2019s about permission to assign tasks. The user mentions they're unable to assign a task and can't identify the user, which suggests a search issue. Given the mention of planning epics, it points toward access related to project management. Since there\u2019s no specific category for that, \"Access\" seems like the best option.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
