The ticket content mentions \"drive Kennedy,\" which makes me think it refers to a storage drive. \n\nIt seems a bit jumbled, but I\u2019ll likely put it under the \"Storage\" category since that seems most fitting given the context. I want to be thorough in classifying this correctly!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket details, which include phrases like \"request item drive Kennedy\" and \"drive added.\" \"Drive Kennedy\" might refer to either a user or a location for a storage drive. Given the references to difficulties and syncing, it seems related to hardware. \n\nHowever, since it's specifically about a drive, I think I should categorize it under \"Storage.\" I\u2019ll prepare to respond with a JSON object like this: {\"category\": \"Storage\"}."
