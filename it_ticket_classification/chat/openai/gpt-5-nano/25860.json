However, there are also parts mentioning \u201cadministrative rights,\u201d making me consider that option too. Overall, I think \u201cInternal Project\u201d fits best since it relates directly to creating or handling project codes.**Determining category for ticket**\n\nI need to output a category in the required JSON format with the key \"category.\" The user's message mentions creating a new project code and filling out attached forms, which makes me lean towards \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, it doesn't seem related to hardware, storage, or access rights per se. I believe \"Internal Project\" fits best since it directly relates to the project code, so I'll prepare a JSON object with that category.**Formatting the category response**\n\nThe required JSON format specifies how to structure my output, with \"category\" as a string among the given options. The user wants me to categorize the ticket, and it looks like I should simply provide the category value as a string. After analyzing the details, \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems to be the best fit. Therefore, my final response will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I'll stick to the requirement of just outputting the category without additional reasoning."
