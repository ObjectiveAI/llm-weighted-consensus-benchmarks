The user is asking for access to something related to \"Friday help.\" There\u2019s a possibility that \"Friday\" refers to a software or tool. They also seem to be requesting an update on information regarding layouts and sources. \n\nGiven the context, it looks like the best category for this request is \"Access,\" as they are explicitly asking for access. That seems like the most fitting choice.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s message seems to be a polite request for access to something related to \"Friday help.\" I think the best category here would be \"Access\" since it focuses on access issues. It could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" if it involves permissions, but \"Access\" covers the request well enough.\n\nSo, I need to generate a JSON object for the category. The required format is straightforward, so I'll output it as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This will match the expected output.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
