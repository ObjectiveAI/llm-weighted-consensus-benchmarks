The ticket talks about access to upload documents and suggests they need to be granted access. This leads me to think the best category is likely \"Access,\" as it fits their request for permissions. I considered \"Administrative rights\" too, but that seems more specific. While \"Storage\" could apply if it involved uploading to storage, access is the main issue.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to respond by categorizing the IT ticket in JSON format. The prompt indicates that I should output a JSON object with a \"category\" field. This category must be one of the predefined options, like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Access.\" \n\nI\u2019ll go with {\"category\":\"Access\"} since that's the best fit. I won't include any extra text, sticking strictly to the format requested. I need to ensure proper capitalization from the provided options."
