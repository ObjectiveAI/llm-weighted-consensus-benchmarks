However, the text is a bit unclear. I need to decide if it fits into one of the defined categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Storage,\" or others from the provided category schema. Ultimately, I should return a JSON object with the relevant category.**Interpreting IT Ticket Detail**\n\nThe user\u2019s phrase \"default view\" appears multiple times, suggesting it's about \"default view snow\" possibly linked to \"Snow Software.\" As I categorize this IT ticket, I wonder if it relates to \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" if it's about settings. The categories include both, along with \"Miscellaneous.\" The rest of the text seems like a mix of unclear phrases or perhaps even a non-English component. The phrase \"automat se view\" might imply \"automatic view,\" while \"si sa\" could be interpreted from Romanian, but I'm not completely sure.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing the user-provided text with phrases like \"default view\" and \"snow.\" It seems to relate to enabling a default view for \"Snow,\" possibly indicating a request sent on a Wednesday in March. I note that the repeated mention of \"default view\" suggests the user is trying to address settings. This could lean towards \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" Given the content\u2019s ambiguity, \"Miscellaneous\" appears appropriate; however, I need to select from the explicit categories. So, I\u2019ll focus on that while categorizing.**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nThe user is looking for a category assignment, and while I could ask for clarification, I can make an initial guess. It seems to relate to \"default view,\" possibly in a software context like \"Snow.\" I wonder if it fits under \"Internal Project\" as a feature or \"Access\" due to view permissions. However, it might just be a UI setting. Since the details are a bit unclear, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit for now. I'll respond with a JSON object that assigns the category as \"Miscellaneous.\"**Preparing JSON Output for Ticket**\n\nThe ticket text refers to \"default view\" and \"snow,\" which might relate to \"Snow Software\" or another product, suggesting a UI/view issue. Since the classification is ambiguous, I'll note that the user can specify if they prefer a different category. They asked me to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" and I realize they want a JSON output with just the category. The proper format is clear, so I\u2019ll output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}\n\nThis ensures it's valid JSON format. It may also be good to propose follow-up questions, but for now, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward."
