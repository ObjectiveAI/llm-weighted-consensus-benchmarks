The ticket mentions a new starter for Friday and seems to be about setting up an employee. There's a sign-off with \"infrastructure,\" but the specific options don't include \"Onboarding.\" However, \"Access\" could fit, as it relates to setting up accounts. \"Hardware\" makes sense if it's about provisioning a computer. Overall, I'll likely categorize it under \"Access\" since it relates to account and hardware setup for the new starter.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ve determined that the best category for this IT ticket is \"Access\" since it\u2019s related to provisioning access for a new starter. It could potentially also be \"Administrative rights,\" but this is less likely. If I\u2019m unsure, I could use \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Access\" fits best for onboarding processes. Given the required output format, I\u2019ll return it as a JSON object, structured properly with just the category included: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to ensure the formatting is exactly right!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nFor this IT ticket, I've concluded that \"Access\" is the best category since it's about onboarding access for a new starter. The official schema indicates I should return a JSON object with the category property. I briefly considered \"HR Support,\" but since this is primarily an IT matter, that's not suitable. The ticket is straightforward, so I\u2019ll respond simply with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Keeping it concise is key here, no extra explanation needed unless the user asks for more details!"
