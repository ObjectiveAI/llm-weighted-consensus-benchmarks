They note \"editing rights,\" and there's guidance to upload documents themselves. The focus seems to be on moving under hub documentation and closing the old site, which leans towards project management. \"Storage\" could fit due to files and archives, but it seems more related to data storage issues. So, \"Internal Project\" works best!**Delivering the JSON output**\n\nI need to produce a JSON object that includes the category field from the allowed categories. Based on my assessment, \"Internal Project\" is the right choice here. The response should simply be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI want to make sure the formatting is correct, matching the required specification. The user's request is clear, so I'll stick strictly to this format without any extra commentary. Just providing the JSON output as specified!"
