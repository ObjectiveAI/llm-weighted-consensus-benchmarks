The user mentioned something about an \"editor hi tool\" which seems to relate to copying and pasting in a word document. It looks like they\u2019re asking about costs and how to order this tool, possibly inquiring about its availability. Since the request seems scattered, I think it might fit best under \"Purchase\" for clarity.**Decoding the request**\n\nI see a jumbled message that likely points to a request for a tool that facilitates copying and pasting into a Word document. It seems like they're asking about an \"editor hi tool,\" possibly meaning something like a \"Word document editor tool.\" They\u2019re inquiring about costs and how to procure it, along with some mention of upcoming programs and possibly travel plans. Overall, it looks like a request for assistance with purchasing this editing tool.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI think the ticket should be categorized as \"Purchase,\" since the user is inquiring about costs and how to order a tool, likely a text editor for copy and paste functions. There's also a mention of an \"upcoming program,\" which makes me consider if \"Internal Project\" could be appropriate as well. However, since the main focus seems to be about purchasing, I'll stick with \"Purchase.\" \n\nThe response needs to be in JSON format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
