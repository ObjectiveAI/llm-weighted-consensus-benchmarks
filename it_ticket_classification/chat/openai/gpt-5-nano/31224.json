It seems to relate to licensing and may relate to software. The potential categories are \"Purchase,\" \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it involves license procurement and approvals, \"Purchase\" seems likely, but it could also fit \"Access\" due to the interactive maps mention. I'll categorize the ticket accordingly!**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to decide whether to categorize this ticket as \"Purchase\" or \"Access.\" It seems more like a \"Purchase\" since it\u2019s about obtaining licenses for the IT ops team, especially noting the phrase \"additional approvals required,\" which fits the procurement process. The output format needs to be in a JSON-like structure, so I\u2019ll respond with the category included as required. I\u2019ll make sure it aligns with the mentioned schema before finalizing this.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
