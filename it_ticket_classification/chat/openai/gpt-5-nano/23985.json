I think the best fit is \"Access,\" so I\u2019ll output a JSON object with that category.**Categorizing access control**\n\nIt looks like this IT ticket is related to access control, with mentions of employee card usage, disabling cards, and maternity leave. The most fitting category seems to be \"Access.\" I need to ensure I provide the correct JSON format for the response. The schema shows I should return a JSON object that includes the category. So, I'll go ahead and output a simple JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That should work!"
