I'm considering categorizing it under \"Hardware.\" However, since it could also imply a purchase, \"Purchase\" might fit too. The guidelines say to categorize by the type of request, so both options could work, but leaning towards \"Hardware\" seems best in this context.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user's request for an \"extension cord\" suggests a need for hardware. While \"Purchase\" might fit due to it being a request to buy a tool, it\u2019s primarily a hardware item. Ticket systems often categorize such requests under \"Hardware\" for equipment needs. The user didn\u2019t give more context for other categories like \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" So, the best choice is to categorize it as \"Hardware\" and format the response as a JSON object with that category.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nI need to follow the provided category schema, which indicates that I should output a JSON object with the key \"category\" set to \"Hardware.\" While the system suggests minimizing formatting, I\u2019ll still present it as a clean JSON object. The user requested categorization, so my focus should be on delivering just that value. Therefore, I\u2019m confirming the response will be: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}` without any extra details since that\u2019s what\u2019s needed."
