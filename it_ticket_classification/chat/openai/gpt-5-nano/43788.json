It doesn't seem to fit \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" \"Internal Project\" could be an option, but I think \"Purchase\" might be the best fit for this ticket. I\u2019ll just select one category to keep it straightforward.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this ticket. \"Purchase\" seems most appropriate since it's about the costs approval flow, which relates to purchasing processes. It does mention \"Oracle,\" suggesting it might involve an ERP system, but it doesn't fit \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" just yet. The user is focused on correcting approvers, so again, \"Purchase\" fits best here. I'll respond with the category object, saying: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
