It seems they want to restructure their ticket taxonomy to better organize things. I'm thinking that \"Internal Project\" could be the right fit since it involves IT work related to these changes. But I'm questioning whether \"Internal Project\" is only for IT projects. I should definitely respond with a clear JSON object and maybe ask a clarifying question too.**Categorizing user request**\n\nThe user wants to categorize something, and I can propose a category to confirm it. I should respond with a JSON object that reflects the chosen category. Given the ambiguity, \"Internal Project\" seems appropriate since it involves creating a subcategory for internal improvement, even though the request mentions \"urgent\". It sounds like they want to make \"nationwide\" a subcategory under \"application\" and \"client\". If things don't align, I might consider \"Miscellaneous\" but \"Internal Project\" feels safer for this internal change.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and my initial thought is to propose the category as \"Internal Project\" in a JSON format. However, I\u2019m considering if they might prefer categories like \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" instead. I should stick with the required format, which is a JSON object containing only the \"category\" field. Since it's clear that I can't include a \"subcategory\" field based on the schema, I\u2019ll deliver the response as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
