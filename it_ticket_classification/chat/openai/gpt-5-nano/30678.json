The key topics really suggest the ticket falls under \u201cStorage\u201d due to the references to file storage and mapping drives. It seems clear this is about accessing network file storage on a PC.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the ticket. It could fit \"Access\" since it\u2019s about getting to network file storage and mapping a drive letter. \"Storage\" is another option because it relates to storage devices. The phrase \"map drive letter\" suggests instructions for accessing network drives. The user's mention of a broken PC points toward drive access rather than hardware issues. Given that, \"Access\" seems to be the most appropriate category. Let's go with that!**Formatting Response**\n\nI need to provide a JSON category object with the value \"Access.\" The system expects it in a specific format, so I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s nothing extra in the output. \n\nThe prompt confirms the structure I need to follow: it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. As I\u2019ve reasoned earlier, \"Access\" is the right choice since the user is asking how to map a drive letter to access storage. \n\nNow, I\u2019ll deliver the final output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
