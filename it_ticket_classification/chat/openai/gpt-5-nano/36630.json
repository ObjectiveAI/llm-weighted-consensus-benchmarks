There are two potential categories to consider: \"Storage\" or \"Access.\" Since the primary concern here is about a missing resource, \"Storage\" seems like the more appropriate category to choose for this ticket.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI'm looking at how to classify an IT ticket regarding a \"missing personal network drive.\" Generally, I would categorize issues with network drives as \"Storage,\" while access or login problems might fall under \"Access.\" The mention of \"personal drive profile\" suggests an access issue, but since the drive is missing, it seems more like a storage availability problem. Therefore, I think the best choice here would be to categorize it as \"Storage.\" Now, I'll format that as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
