There's mention of \"sessions open displaying data\" and a problem when connecting with default settings. The situation could relate to IT, possibly falling under categories like \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access.\" Since it talks about errors and connection defaults, it may not clearly indicate access denial, but it does hint at permissions or login issues.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt seems this ticket is about a dashboard software issue. However, there\u2019s no dedicated \"Software\" category, so I need to find the best fit. \"Internal Project\" could work for project-specific tasks, but \"Miscellaneous\" is more of a catch-all. The mention of \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d might be relevant if it relates to permissions. \"Access\" could fit as well, but since the dashboard is simply \"not working,\" I'd say \"Miscellaneous\" is the safest option for categorization. I'll format it as a JSON-like object now.**Formatting category response**\n\nI think it\u2019s best to keep it simple since the prompt only asks for categorization. The UI likely needs a JSON format for the answer. So, I\u2019ll create a category object with the required structure. Given the context, I\u2019ll choose \"Miscellaneous\" as the category. The final output will look like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. That should fulfill the requirement neatly!"
