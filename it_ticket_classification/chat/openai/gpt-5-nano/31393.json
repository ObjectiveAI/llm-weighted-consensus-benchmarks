The ticket mentions \"additional monitor request\" and \"possible work tower.\" It seems to indicate either the Hardware category, since it relates to peripherals, or Purchase, since it might involve buying an additional monitor. In this case, I should classify it under Hardware, reflecting that it's a request for additional equipment to connect to their workstation.**Categorizing IT request**\n\nThe user didn\u2019t indicate they want to buy a monitor, so they might just be requesting it as equipment. I'm inclined to categorize this under \"Hardware\" since it\u2019s about hardware equipment. However, I also see the \"Purchase\" category for acquiring hardware. The user repeatedly mentioned \"additional monitor request,\" which suggests it's more of a request rather than a procurement instruction. So I\u2019ll stick with \"Hardware\" and prepare to output it in the required JSON format.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
