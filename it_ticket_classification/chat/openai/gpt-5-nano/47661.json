It seems the reassign option is not holding the details as expected, and they're having trouble with saved data showing incorrectly. So, this ticket would most likely fall under Application issues, specifically related to HR Support for vacation management.**Categorizing IT Ticket Issue**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out how to categorize this IT ticket. It's definitely a software issue within the Oracle system, which makes me lean towards \"Internal Project\" since it's related to an internal application. The user describes a bug about the vacation rule reassign feature not saving correctly. \"Access\" isn\u2019t suitable since it's more about saving data rather than permissions. Given all this, I\u2019ll confidently categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" Now, I'll follow the provided schema for the output!**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with a structured format, specifically a JSON object for this IT ticket category. The instruction is clear: \"Categorize this IT Ticket\" and provide the category in the expected format. Based on my earlier analysis, I'll say:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to keep it concise and focus only on the required information without extra commentary unless the user asks for it. Now, let\u2019s deliver that JSON object!"
