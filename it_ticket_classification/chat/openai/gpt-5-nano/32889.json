The ticket mentions \u201clicense\u201d and \u201cactivation,\u201d which suggests \u201cPurchase\u201d works well. However, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could apply if it\u2019s about installing software. I want to choose wisely from the limited options available.**Categorizing license activation**\n\nThe request is to activate a license and install Visual Studio, focusing primarily on license provisioning. I think \u201cPurchase\u201d is the best fit because a license acts like a product that\u2019s bought. In ticket classification, licensing usually falls under \u201cPurchase\u201d or \u201cSoftware License,\u201d while \u201cAccess\u201d is more about accounts. The ticket mentions activation IDs, which connect to license keys. As they are expecting a structured classification, I\u2019ll go with \u201cPurchase\u201d for the category and format the final output accordingly.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
