Given these details, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as Hardware.**Formatting response as JSON**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that follows the specified category schema. The prompt is asking to categorize the IT ticket and indicates that I should output a JSON-like object with the category set to \"Hardware.\" \n\nThe required format clearly states to use a \"category\" object. So, I\u2019ll ensure my output is exactly {\"category\": \"Hardware\"} without adding any extra text. The ticket mentions an \"issue with battery\" and \"calibration refused due to battery less than,\" indicating it's a hardware issue. Therefore, my final response will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
