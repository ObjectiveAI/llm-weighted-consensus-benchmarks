Since \"new starter\" likely refers to tasks related to onboarding, I should consider categories like HR Support or Access, particularly for provisioning accounts. However, it could also involve Administrative rights if they need admin privileges. Given the content, Access seems most fitting.**Choosing the right category**\n\nFor categorizing the ticket, \"Access\" seems like the safest choice since it pertains to new user access. Alternatively, \"HR Support\" could fit if it relates to onboarding, but the categories are mostly IT-focused. Given that the user has asked me to categorize, I should lean towards \"Access\" as the closest fit. I need to format my response as a JSON object with the required schema, which would be something like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
