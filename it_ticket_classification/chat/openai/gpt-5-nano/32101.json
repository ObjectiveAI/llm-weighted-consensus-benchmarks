The content clearly relates to a Purchase Order Requisition and discusses the procurement process, repeating phrases like \"document purchase order requisition implemented.\" It also contains specific terms such as \"assignee,\" \"task number,\" and \"supplier requisitioning.\" Therefore, I\u2019m classifying this ticket under the \"Purchase\" category.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m identifying the IT ticket as likely belonging to the \"Purchase\" category because it revolves around purchase orders, suppliers, requisition details, and cost centers. It doesn't fit the hardware category. I just need to ensure I'm following the required JSON format, noting the category property as \"Purchase.\" Although there's a mention of \"assignee\" and \"task number,\" the focus remains on the procurement process. So, I\u2019ll proceed with returning: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
