It seems to fit best in \"Administrative rights\" or possibly \"Access.\" The ticket likely refers to changing permissions, so \"Administrative rights\" is the most fitting. However, if it's about an internal project, \"Internal Project\" could also apply. But \"Administrative rights\" seems more appropriate for this situation.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nTo classify the IT ticket, I see that \"Access\" refers to the ability to change owner, which is indeed a permission change. The best fit seems to be \"Administrative rights,\" although \"Internal Project\" could apply since it's mentioned that it's an \"owner change.\" There\u2019s no mention of hardware or storage, so let's skip those categories. The final decision is to go with \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll format it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
