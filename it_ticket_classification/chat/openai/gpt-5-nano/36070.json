It seems like builds take hours to download, which is urgent for testing. I\u2019m wondering if the problems relate to network connectivity and download speeds. \n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize these concerns. \"Internal Project\" might fit best since it\u2019s about testing environments, but maybe \"Access\" or \"Hardware\" could apply too. However, \"Miscellaneous\" feels too vague, and \"Administrative rights\" don\u2019t seem relevant.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI see that the ticket mentions mobile devices used by developers, which might suggest categorizing it under \"Hardware.\" However, the user wants to assign it to the \"Internal Project\" category to track issues in the development and test environments. \n\nThe mention of \"high priority\" and \"environments\" emphasizes urgency. As for \"using personal connections,\" this might relate to VPN or network connections, leading me to consider the \"Access\" category if they\u2019re having trouble accessing networks or applications. Overall, I should weigh these options carefully!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user is asking to categorize an IT ticket, and it mentions \"mobile devices used by developers\" for downloading client application builds and testing. Words like \"high priority\" and \"downloads take hours\" suggest that it's affecting development and test environments, pointing towards \"Internal Project\" as the best option.\n\nThere isn't a specific \"Network/Connectivity\" category available. So, I think categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" is the way to go! I'll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
