It mentions several attempts to upgrade, errors faced, and the need for space. Given that it primarily revolves around storage challenges, I think the best fit for this ticket is \"Storage.\"**Deciding on category format**\n\nI'm considering if this IT ticket could fit into \"Administrative rights,\" since it mentions admin rights but not explicitly. However, the ticket frequently highlights \"insufficient space,\" which relates more to \"Storage.\" It also mentions freeing up space and the maven repository, indicating a storage issue. So, I'll categorize it as \"Storage.\" \n\nNow, I need to format my response as a JSON object with the required structure. The format should be:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
