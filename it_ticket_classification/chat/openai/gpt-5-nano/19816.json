It specifically mentions issues with the hardware and the need to replace the old mouse. Since it's clearly a hardware problem, I'll go with the \"Hardware\" category. While it might raise thoughts about \"Internal Project\" or \"Purchase,\" those don't fit as well. So, I\u2019ll format the response in JSON with \"category\": \"Hardware\".**Formatting the IT Ticket Response**\n\nI\u2019m crafting a response for categorizing an IT ticket, and I need to ensure it\u2019s concise. The output should be a JSON object, like {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I have to be careful not to include any extra text; the request clearly specifies that. Although there might be cases where they only want \"Hardware\" without JSON formatting, the instruction states to use the category object for this task. So, I'll stick with the JSON format."
