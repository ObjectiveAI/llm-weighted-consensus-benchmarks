The user's request is a bit unclear but seems to focus on restrictions affecting on-site work with a mention of access. It looks like \"Access\" is the best fit since the user discusses limitations on working at the client\u2019s site. It\u2019s possibly about remote access as well, but \"Access\" makes the most sense here.**Finalizing the response**\n\nIt's clear that the user's request is about access restrictions related to the client site, so I need to categorize it as \"Access.\" I should respond with a JSON object that includes this category, following the provided format. \n\nThe output should simply be:\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nEven though admin rights could be relevant, this ticket is primarily about access restrictions affecting work. I\u2019m confident that \"Access\" is the right choice here. Let\u2019s finalize it!"
