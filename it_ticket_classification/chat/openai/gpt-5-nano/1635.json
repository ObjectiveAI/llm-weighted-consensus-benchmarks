The content suggests it's related to an employee leaving, focusing on access, AD rights, and mailbox details. It seems like the \"Access\" category fits best, though \"Administrative rights\" or even \"Internal Project\" are possibilities. I'll format my response as a JSON object with the selected category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe content mentions various aspects of an employee leaving, such as their leaving date, location, mailbox, and AD rights. It seems this fits under the \"Access\" category well due to its focus on access rights and de-provisioning. Though \"Administrative rights\" is relevant, \"Access\" is more appropriate as the main category here. I\u2019ll structure my response as a single JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and ensure it meets the required format.**Outputting category object**\n\nThe system instructs me to output the category as an object, so I\u2019m going to respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I could consider adding a rationale, but the prompt only specifically asks for the categorization. It's probably best to keep it simple and just output the category as directed, ensuring I\u2019m following the provided format strictly. So, I\u2019ll stick to just that for now and make sure it\u2019s clear and concise."
