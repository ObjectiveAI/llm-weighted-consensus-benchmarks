It seems to be an instruction about adding owner permissions and additional members. The most fitting categories to choose from are \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I think \"Administrative rights\" is more specific since it pertains to granting permissions. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Administrative rights\" because it clearly relates to access control and permissions being requested.**Categorizing permissions request**\n\nThe content suggests a request to add owner roles and additional members, indicating it's about permissions. I believe this should fall under \"Administrative rights\" because it references ownership and member additions. Should I respond with a JSON object in the required format? It looks like I'll need to return a JSON object with the category field. I think I'll finalize it as {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}, but I'm still considering whether \"Access\" might be a better fit instead.**Finalizing category for IT ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"add owner possibility add additional members\" points to adjusting access control. While \"Access\" is in the available options, \"Administrative rights\" is more precise, especially given that the user mentioned adding an owner, which indicates specific permissions. In IT ticket taxonomy, \"Administrative rights\" is the correct choice for requests regarding admin privileges. I\u2019ll respond with just the JSON category: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} as required, without any extra text."
