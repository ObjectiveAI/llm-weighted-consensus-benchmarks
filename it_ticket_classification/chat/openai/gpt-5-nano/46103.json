The user seems to be having issues with reports, specifically related to refreshing and creating them. So, it may be about reporting issues. The ticket could potentially fit into categories like \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access,\" but it doesn\u2019t really seem to fit \"Hardware.\" Since it\u2019s mostly about report-related difficulties, I think \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit.**Deciding on Category**\n\nI'm evaluating the best category for this IT ticket. It seems like a generic issue, so \"Miscellaneous\" is a strong contender. \"Internal Project\" might fit if it's a specific reporting tool, but given the general nature, \"Miscellaneous\" is safer. I considered \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but there's no mention of denied access\u2014just problems with reports. The other categories, like \"HR Support,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Hardware,\" aren\u2019t relevant. Therefore, I'll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" and format the JSON accordingly: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
