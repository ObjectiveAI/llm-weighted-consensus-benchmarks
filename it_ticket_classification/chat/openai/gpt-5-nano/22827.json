I also need to evaluate whether it falls under Internal Project or Miscellaneous. Let's figure this out!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI believe \"Storage\" is the best fit for categorizing this IT ticket since it deals with data retention and automatic deletion. \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if it relates to setting quarantine permissions, but I\u2019m not so sure. The unclear part about \"new dear pm kb\" might refer to knowledge base articles or logging frequency. If I\u2019m uncertain, \"Miscellaneous\" could work, but \"Internal Project\" is also an option. I\u2019ll prepare to respond with a JSON-like format: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m working through this ticket which mentions \"quarantine,\" \"KB deleted automatically after days,\" and \"change frequency.\" It sounds like it\u2019s about email or file quarantine where items get deleted after a set period. The user might want to log retention changes, making it related to data management. So, I\u2019ll categorize this under \"Storage\" since it deals with retention and deletion. I need to respond in the proper JSON format: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. Let's deliver that!"
