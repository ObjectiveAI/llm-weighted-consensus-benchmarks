I need to ensure I format this accurately as JSON since that's what the prompt asks for, like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I also have to consider other terms in the ticket, but since the focus is on requisitioning supplies, \"Purchase\" is the best fit. I'll go ahead and finalize my output.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI need to make sure I format this properly as a plain JSON object. The prompt specifies a \"category\" field, so I\u2019ll include just that. According to the template given, the category can be one of the enumerated options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Purchase.\" Since the context is about obtaining hardware requisition, \"Purchase\" is the right choice. I\u2019ll finalize my output as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It's straightforward, and I hope it's clear!"
