Based on the ticket's focus, the Access category seems most fitting since it's about writing access. However, if it involves higher privileges, Administrative Rights could work too. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON-like object to match the required schema: {\"category\":\"Access\"} seems suitable for this ticket.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions phrases like \"write hello,\" \"write upcoming event rights,\" and \"add posts,\" indicating a request for write access and the rights to manage content. I see two potential categories here: \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" Although \"Access\" is broader, it seems more appropriate to categorize this ticket as \"Administrative Rights\" since it specifically requests elevated permissions for adding posts. My intuition leans toward \"Administrative Rights\" due to the context of managing events and posts, which likely requires higher privileges.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
