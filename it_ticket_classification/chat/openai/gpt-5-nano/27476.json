The message mentions \"providing cables wired,\" which leans towards hardware issues. While it could potentially fit under \"Purchase\" if they are asking to buy cables, the main focus on \"cables\" suggests it's hardware-related. In IT ticket triage, since the request is about needing cables wired for connections, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\"**Formulating JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object based on the ticket categorization. The schema indicates that there should be a \"category\" field among predefined options. Even though the instructions emphasize a structured response with types and properties, for this task, I think I can simplify it by just providing the essential info: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"} \n\nIt's probably best to stick with what the user needs by focusing on the category itself, rather than overcomplicating the structure.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
