The text mentions a missing submit button for a new time cards Oracle application. I have a few category options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. Since it's about an issue with the software, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the best fallback if it doesn't fit elsewhere. I wonder if it could also relate to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but it doesn't seem to be a permissions issue specifically.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nIt's clear this isn't about user rights\u2014it's more about a missing UI element. So, categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" seems reasonable. I don't think \"Internal Project\" applies here either. I need to respond using a JSON object for the \"category\" field, as the instructions specify. The category options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. Since it's about an Oracle application issue with a missing submit button for time cards, \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the right fit.**Categorizing as HR Support**\n\nThis issue is definitely related to HR time card submission, so I think it's best categorized as \"HR Support.\" The user referenced an \"Oracle application\" for time cards, which aligns with HR responsibilities. Since the task falls under HR system support, it's clear that \"HR Support\" is the appropriate category. I need to respond with the exact JSON format. So, I\u2019ll provide just this line: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"} \n\nNo extra comments since it wasn\u2019t requested!"
