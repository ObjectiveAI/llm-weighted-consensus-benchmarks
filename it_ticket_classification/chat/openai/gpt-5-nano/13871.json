The request mentions bringing cameras, so I think the most fitting category from our taxonomy is \"Hardware.\" While I considered \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project,\" those don\u2019t seem appropriate here. \"Miscellaneous\" isn't quite right either. Focusing on the cameras, \"Hardware\" seems to be the best option to categorize this ticket.**Parsing IT ticket request**\n\nI\u2019m parsing a slightly garbled request that mentions configuring and adding monitoring for cameras on Friday PM, including the term \"infrastructure.\" It seems to be an IT ticket, primarily a hardware request. Based on my analysis, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" The instructions require a JSON object format with the category field.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any extra text, as that's what the task specifies. That seems clear and concise!"
