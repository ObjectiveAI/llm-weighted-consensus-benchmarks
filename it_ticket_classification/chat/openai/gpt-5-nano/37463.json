The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since \"oracle approval notifications duplicated\" may indicate an issue with notifications, I could consider \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" However, there's no specific category for Applications or Notifications. Ultimately, I should choose the category that aligns best with the ticket's context.**Categorizing approval notifications**\n\nThe text indicates that the user experiences duplication of approval notifications, which could suggest a system notification issue. Initially, I thought of categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" since there isn\u2019t a category for \"Software\" or \"Oracle.\" However, since the notifications likely relate to access permissions, the \"Access\" category could be more appropriate. Given the repeated references to approvals in the context of Oracle, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Access\" to be more helpful and clear. Let\u2019s create the JSON output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Formatting the category output**\n\nThe instruction specifies that I need to format the output as a JSON object with a \"category\" property. It looks like I must output exactly: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The instruction to categorize the IT ticket lists specific allowed categories, so it seems that's the required approach. Even though I think a short explanation could help, the focus is clear: to produce the JSON object without additional commentary. So, let's go ahead and output it: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
