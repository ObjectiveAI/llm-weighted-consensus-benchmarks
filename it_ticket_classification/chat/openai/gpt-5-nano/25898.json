It seems to be about needing a second monitor during a stay next week in a specific building location, related to a shared senior accountant. I have a list of categories to choose from: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", \"Administrative rights\". Since it's primarily about hardware provisioning, I think the most fitting category is \"Hardware.\" Access could be considered, but it's really about the monitor.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
