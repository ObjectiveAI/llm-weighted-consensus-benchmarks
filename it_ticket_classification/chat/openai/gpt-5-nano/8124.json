The ticket refers to help with the Oracle expense mobile app and mentions signing in. It seems clear that it's related to access issues, specifically needing assistance with login. This leads me to think the appropriate category is \"Access.\" I\u2019ll create a JSON format for that, ensuring it matches the specified structure with \"Access\" filled in.**Formatting category JSON**\n\nI\u2019m looking to format the category for the IT ticket appropriately. The platform has specified that I need to output a JSON object with a \"category\" field based on a provided schema. Usually, my task is to categorize the ticket and then output a simple string like {\"category\":\"Access\"}. However, it seems I need to structure this more formally as a complete object that includes type and properties. So, I\u2019ll ensure it adheres to the schema while including the chosen category value.**Providing category response**\n\nI'll respond with the category in the required JSON object format, including the \"category\" key and the chosen category value. So, it will be straightforward like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to keep it concise and clear without adding extra explanation or details about the schema unless absolutely necessary. Let's go ahead and provide that!"
