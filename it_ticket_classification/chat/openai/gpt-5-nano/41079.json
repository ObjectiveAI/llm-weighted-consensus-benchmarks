The ticket discusses timecard submissions, approvals, and guidance, which relates more to administrative processes rather than technical issues.\n\nIt seems that the best fit would be \"HR Support,\" since it revolves around HR processes regarding timecards. Calling it \"Administrative rights\" wouldn\u2019t make sense here. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as an HR Support ticket.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
