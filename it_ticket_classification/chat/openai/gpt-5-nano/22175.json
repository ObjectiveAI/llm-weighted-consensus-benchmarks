I see mentions of \"alter role,\" \"switch,\" and \"signed papers,\" which hints at a human resources process. It seems like an HR-related situation, so HR Support might be the best category. However, since it might also involve changing permissions in the IT system, Administrative rights could apply too. All things considered, HR Support feels most fitting for this ticket.**Categorizing IT request**\n\nThe user is requesting to \"alter role,\" which might involve changing access levels to something like \"senior\" or \"PM role.\" The phrase mentions \"job title change\" and \"signed papers,\" indicating an HR process rather than an access request. Implementing a role change would generally require administrative rights, which falls under that category.\n\nHowever, since this ticket concerns a job title change and job description, the best category is clearly \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll prepare the category in the correct JSON format.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nThe user is asking for a JSON object representing the category of the ticket. I see that the expected format includes a schema with a specific structure. But here, I just need to focus on providing the \"category\" value.\n\nSo, I should output the JSON in this format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It looks like I need to comply with that structure while ensuring that the category is correctly identified as \"HR Support.\" I'll make sure it\u2019s accurate and ready for the user!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
