The user\u2019s ticket seems to involve deleting wrong epics and issues related to project management and linking stories, which could fit \"Internal Project\u201d or maybe \"Administrative rights\" if they need permission for deletion. Overall, it looks like it primarily concerns deletion operations in the issue tracker.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s request suggests they want to delete wrong epics and related issues, which aligns with internal project management tasks rather than hardware or HR categories. Since \"Administrative rights\" might apply to access permissions for deletion, but it seems more fitting to categorize this under \"Internal Project.\" I agree that I should respond with a JSON object formatted properly to reflect this category. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I'll make sure it contains no extra text.**Confirming category response**\n\nI need to make sure that the category I provide is \"Internal Project,\" and the capitalization must match exactly. So, when I respond, it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It's important to double-check that I've followed the required format and used the correct category designation. I feel good about this response!"
