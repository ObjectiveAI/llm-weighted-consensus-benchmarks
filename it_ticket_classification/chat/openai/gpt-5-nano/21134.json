They mention the compute types, OS installations, a backup plan with incremental snapshots, rollback options, and automatic shutdown and restart features. I\u2019m interpreting \"bring back\" as the startup process. It's a bit unclear, but I should clarify those details.**Classifying IT Ticket Further**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a request about accessing machines and a potential VPN or tunneling policy. The mention of \"head architecture\" likely refers to the host architecture and \"ext\" could imply extension. The ticket could fit into several categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, since it's primarily about provisioning two machines with specific requirements like an OS, backup plans, and access policies, I think it best fits \"Internal Project,\" as it involves planning infrastructure. It also touches on \"Storage\" with the backup features mentioned.**Assessing Administrative Rights**\n\nI\u2019m considering the possibility that \"Administrative rights\" might be relevant if they need permissions to create the machines, though it's not explicitly stated. I need to parse the request further. It mentions two machines with specific requirements: compute type, OS installed, backup plans with incremental snapshots, rollback options, and automatic shutdown features. The unclear \"tunneled policy\" could relate to SSH tunneling. Given all this, I think \"Internal Project\" fits best, as it\u2019s about building those two machines with the necessary policies. I should produce a JSON-like category object for this.**Preparing Category Output**\n\nI need to classify the IT ticket using the provided categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the details, I'll output the category as a JSON-like object: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. \n\nSince the user's prompt specifically asks for categorization, I won't ask clarifying questions. Instead, I'll just return the category without any extra text. This will keep it concise and in line with the required format. So, let's finalize that JSON output!"
