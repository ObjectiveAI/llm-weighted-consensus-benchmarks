It seems to involve configuration and potentially needing administrative rights for assigning tasks to leaders. The mention of logging assignments suggests an organizational structure. I\u2019ll categorize this as an IT ticket regarding modifying dashboard analytics features. The most fitting categories appear to be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it\u2019s all about access and notifications.**Evaluating assignment logging**\n\nThe phrase \"please log assign accordingly\" suggests that the user wants to ensure proper logging and assignment of tasks. The mention of \"leaders assigned to implement improvement actions\" feels more operational rather than hardware-related. While \"Internal Project\" might seem fitting since it\u2019s about a project, it seems the focus leans more toward dashboard management and scores. So, I\u2019ll need to think about how best to categorize this request without losing sight of its operational aspect.**Parsing user request**\n\nIt looks like the user is discussing enabling notifications when scores drop below a certain threshold. I notice a mention of \"overall satisfaction score has dropped,\" which likely relates to some customer feedback metric, probably something like NPS. They want to access the dashboard to insert results and analyze them collectively to come up with improvement actions. There\u2019s also a directive towards leaders assigned for implementing these actions. Overall, it\u2019s about enhancing scores based on analyzed feedback.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking this ticket might fit under \"Internal Project,\" since it\u2019s about implementing processes like enabling notifications and defining thresholds to improve satisfaction scores through the dashboard. However, the categories seem quite broad, and \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant since enabling notifications might require changes to system settings. The user is focused on enabling notifications when scores drop below a threshold, which could involve permissions. The main action revolves around analyzing results and implementing actions to improve scores, so I\u2019ll weigh those options carefully.**Categorizing as Internal Project**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the best category for this ticket. It focuses on monitoring scores and implementing actions to improve them, so \"Internal Project\" feels most appropriate. It\u2019s not about hardware or software but involves a change request for system notifications. The content suggests actions like enabling notifications and assigning leaders, which aligns with a process improvement task. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and respond with the required JSON format. Here it goes:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
