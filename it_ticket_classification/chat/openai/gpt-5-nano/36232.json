Now, I just need to respond in the required JSON format, like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Formatting IT Ticket Response**\n\nThe prompt indicates I need to categorize this IT ticket and provide a category. The required response format is a JSON object containing a single key called \"category\" with an appropriate value. The options available include categories like Hardware, HR Support, and Access. Since the user is experiencing access issues, I'll go with \"Access.\" So my output should simply be {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll ensure there's no extra commentary, just the requested output."
