Terms like \"nomination,\" \"nominee,\" and \"feedback\" indicate it falls within HR-related matters. So, I should categorize it under \"HR Support\" in a JSON-like format.**Deciding on category**\n\nIt seems \u201cHR Support\u201d is the most fitting category since the ticket mentions nomination, award, nominee, approval, review, and feedback. The other categories like hardware, access, storage, purchase, and internal projects don\u2019t apply here. Administrative rights don\u2019t seem relevant either. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and respond with the required JSON-like format for the category object, simply stating it like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That keeps it clean and straightforward!"
