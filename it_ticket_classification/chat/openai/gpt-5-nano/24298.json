The user's message is quite messy but mentions an audit on AD groups, which leads me to think it's related to Active Directory. It seems to relate to permissions and group management, so \"Access\" is a possible category. However, it could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" due to the focus on permissions. I'm not entirely sure, though!**Categorizing IT request**\n\nIn the IT ticket, the \"Administrative rights\" category is typically for requests to change admin privileges, but this ticket is focused on auditing and creating AD groups, which suggests it's more about access control and group management. I think \"Access\" is the best category since it directly relates to managing access control for AD groups. I need to format my response in JSON, saying: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, consistent with the required schema. Let's keep it clear and straightforward!"
