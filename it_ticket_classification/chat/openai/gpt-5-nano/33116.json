It seems to mention changing hardware and accessing a form, which suggests it might relate to onboarding. The repeated terms like \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"change hardware\" point towards it being about HR Support or Hardware. I\u2019ll need to analyze it further to accurately categorize this request.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm looking at the categories for this IT ticket. The mention of a \"starter form\" could suggest access provisioning, while requests for hardware are indicated by phrases about \"change hardware\" and \"obtain faster.\" This sounds like it might be an onboarding request, so I need to choose between categories like Hardware and Access. Given that it's related to a new starter and involves essential provisioning, it seems to fit either of those categories best.**Categorizing IT ticket for JSON output**\n\nThe text mentions a \"starter form,\" along with phrases like \"change hardware obtain faster,\" suggesting it\u2019s mostly hardware-related. I have to categorize this IT ticket properly, sticking to the required JSON format with one of the allowed categories. Given the focus on hardware and the context of a \"new starter,\" it seems most fitting to categorize it as \"Hardware.\" However, the mention of forms and administration hints at potential access needs, though it\u2019s less about account creation. So, I'll opt for \"Hardware.\"**Deciding category based on context**\n\nLooking at the text, the reference to a \"starter form\" could imply an HR onboarding form, but there's no category for that; only \"HR Support\" is available. The mention of \"change hardware obtain faster\" strongly indicates a focus on hardware procurement. Given the urgency and specific request for hardware, it seems safest to categorize this ticket as \"Hardware.\" The user is likely trying to expedite hardware for a new starter, hence the urgency.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe category for this ticket is clearly \"Hardware,\" so I'll respond with the JSON format. The prompt specifies that I need to output a structured JSON object that includes the category. While there might be other possibilities like \"Access,\" I believe \"Hardware\" is the best fit based on the user's request. So, I\u2019ll prepare the final answer as the JSON object: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nNo additional commentary here; I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and deliver just the response."
