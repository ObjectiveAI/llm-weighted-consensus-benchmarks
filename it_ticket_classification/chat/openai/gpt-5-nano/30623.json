It seems like the ticket is about personnel changes and access management, especially related to a leaver. Given these aspects, it\u2019s likely that \u201cAccess\u201d is the most appropriate category. The safe choice here is to categorize it as \u201cAccess\u201d since it's focused on access rights. I should provide a JSON object output including the category field too.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nThe system requires the category to be in a specific string format from an allowed set. So, I should provide the JSON output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. While I could mention my rationale for this choice, the instruction only asks for categorization, so I'll keep it simple. The prompt was clear: \"Categorize this IT Ticket.\" Therefore, I\u2019ll just respond with the required JSON object and not include any extra explanations unless specifically asked."
