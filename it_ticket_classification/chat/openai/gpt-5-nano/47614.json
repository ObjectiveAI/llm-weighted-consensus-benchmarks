The user is looking for a category from the provided list: options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019m inclined to set the category to \"Hardware.\"**Defining the Ticket Category**\n\nThe user mentions, \u201cphone into computer able be utilized,\u201d which suggests an issue with a port not being active. This could refer to a hardware port on the device (like a PC) or a network port. It seems they want to connect their phone to the computer, and a working port would allow that. Since it\u2019s a hardware issue involving a physical port, the best fit is \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll format this as a JSON object with the category field set to \"Hardware.\"**Generating JSON Output**\n\nThe prompt specifies a JSON structure that includes a category property. I need to ensure I create a valid JSON object with the category set to \"Hardware.\" Since the wrapper type is just metadata for the tool, I\u2019ll focus on returning just the category object. I realized I shouldn't include any extra spaces, so the correct output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to keep it clean and straightforward!"
