It\u2019s garbled, but I think the best fit for the primary category is \"Hardware\" since it involves hardware procurement and installation. It could also relate to \"Purchase\" regarding cables, but \"Hardware\" seems more appropriate overall. I\u2019ll finalize the category as Hardware since it covers the mentioned items adequately.**Outputting category as JSON**\n\nIt seems the user only wants the category label in JSON format. The instruction indicates a specific schema for this. So, I need to generate a JSON object that simply includes \"category\": \"Hardware\". I\u2019ll ensure it follows proper formatting and contains no extra text. Although there was a possibility of categorizing it as \"Purchase,\" the focus is mainly on hardware items like hubs and cables, so \"Hardware\" is definitely the right choice. Here we go!"
