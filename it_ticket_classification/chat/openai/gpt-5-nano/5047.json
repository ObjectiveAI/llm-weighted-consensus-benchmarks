The phrase \"please snow amend\" might relate to ServiceNow, suggesting it\u2019s related to ticket handling. The keywords might indicate it's about updates with disk images, potentially tied to Storage or Hardware as well. I'll need to choose the best-fitting category from the list provided.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket based on its content. It seems like there's no explicit hardware involved, which might indicate it's more of an internal IT project related to automating the quarterly image review process. \"Internal Project\" is likely the best fit since it addresses ongoing changes, while phrases like \"snow amend automatic logged\" suggest automation in ServiceNow. However, this could also come under \"Miscellaneous\" due to its ambiguity. Responding with a JSON object seems appropriate here.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
