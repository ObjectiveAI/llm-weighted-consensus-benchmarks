I'll focus on finding the right category. Given the context, it seems mainly about access, specifically permissions. So, the best fit would be either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I'll likely go with \"Access\" since it highlights the core issue of permissions in this situation.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nThe content references terms like \"permissions,\" \"granted rights,\" and \"access,\" which point clearly to the category of \"Access.\" I need to respond with a valid JSON-like object, specifically categorizing under one of the allowed types. The ticket focuses on permissions related to an Excel file and visitor cards. While \"Administrative rights\" is a more specific option, I think \"Access\" is broader and better fits the context. Thus, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
