They might need assistance with the starter form, which suggests \"Access\" could be the right category since it involves account setup or access provisioning. So, I'll go with \"Access.\"**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering the categories for the IT ticket. The message suggests that they need help filling out a form related to a new starter, which could relate to onboarding. \"Administrative rights\" is a subcategory for privileged access, while \"HR Support\" also fits onboarding. However, since this is specifically an IT ticket and involves provisioning access, I think \"Access\" is the best category. It reflects the need for setting up a new user's login and credentials.**Outputting JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to format it as a JSON object based on provided categories. The message refers to filling a \u201cstarter form,\u201d which could hint at onboarding. While \"HR Support\" could fit, I think \"Access\" is safer because it relates to creating access for a new starter. Since onboarding indicates that IT support will be needed for access, I'll go with \"Access\" as the category. So the JSON will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
