The key phrases suggest they want to move forward with the closure and recognize ongoing costs for another activity. After parsing through, it looks like \u201cInternal Project\u201d is the best fit since it's about closing a project. It doesn\u2019t seem to fit any other categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Purchase.\"**Finalizing category output**\n\nIt looks like \"Internal Project\" is indeed the best category for this ticket. I should respond in a JSON format, using the required structure. The output will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I'll keep it concise without any extra explanations, just presenting the information clearly as requested. Let\u2019s go ahead and deliver that cleanly!"
