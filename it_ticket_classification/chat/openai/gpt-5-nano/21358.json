The text is a bit chaotic, mentioning dates and attachments, which suggests it's related to onboarding. \n\nIt could fit into \"Administrative rights,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Access.\" If it involves filling out a form for onboarding, then \"HR Support\" seems appropriate. However, if it\u2019s about access rights for the new starter, then \"Access\" might be the better choice. I\u2019ll decide between these categories.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the text about a \"new starter,\" dates, and requests to fill out attached forms. This sounds like it involves creating user account details and provisioning access, which leans toward the \"Access\" category.\n\nWhile \"Administrative rights\" refers to elevated privileges, the message doesn't suggest that; it's more about onboarding. \"HR Support\" is also a possibility, but the request seems IT-specific. Given this context, \"Access\" might be the best fit for this ticket.**Categorizing IT ticket response**\n\nThe message indicates there's an attached filled form, and they want someone to fill out the enclosed forms for a new starter date. It doesn't explicitly mention access, but since onboarding typically involves provisioning access, I think \"Access\" is the best category here.\n\nI also considered other categories like \"Administrative rights\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" but they don\u2019t fit as well. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll return the response in the required format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
