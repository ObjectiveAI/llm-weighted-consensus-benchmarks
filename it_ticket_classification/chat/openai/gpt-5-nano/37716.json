The ticket content focuses on timecards, specifically mentioning issues with their accuracy, submitting cards for approval, and seeking help with the recorded times. Given this, it seems appropriate to categorize this under HR Support since it relates to employee time management. Let's make sure it reaches the right team for assistance!**Categorizing Timecard Issues**\n\nI\u2019m dealing with timecards related to approval submission, validation, rejection, and corrections. There are errors when logging calendar views for certain periods that affect timecard statuses. It seems that the ticket is mainly about HR and payroll workflows. Given the nature of these issues, \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category. I\u2019ll structure the output as a JSON object with the category field set to \"HR Support.\" This should help in directing it to the right assistance!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
