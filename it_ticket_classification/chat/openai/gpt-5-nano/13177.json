The user mentions details about accessing mobile networks, testing a mobile app, and references to proxies and secure hosts. It feels like this is primarily about accessing a network and testing the application, so I\u2019m leaning toward the Access category as the best fit. I\u2019ll make sure to focus on the key points to get this right!**Choosing the right category**\n\nI see the ticket mentions network access, proxies, and testing, which makes me consider the Internal Project category because it's about testing a mobile app. However, Internal Project usually relates to specific internal tasks. It feels like the user's request for help suggests they\u2019re involved in a project over a longer duration. Still, since it's all about app testing and network access, \"Access\" might fit better, primarily due to the mention of network access issues. Maybe \"Internal Project\" fits as it relates to broader testing efforts.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nIt looks like I need to categorize the IT ticket based on typical taxonomy. Since the text mentions \"mobile app needs testing,\" \"testing duration months,\" and references to secure hosts and proxies, it strongly relates to project tasks rather than general IT support. I\u2019m deciding on \"Internal Project\" because it involves setting up test environments. I\u2019ll provide the output in JSON format, ensuring no extra text is included. The final response will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
