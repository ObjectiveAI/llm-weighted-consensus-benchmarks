It seems to reference making adjustments to a board \u2014 possibly a Kanban board \u2014 and mentions adding a couple more items and splitting an existing board. \n\nI could categorize this under options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It definitely doesn't fit into hardware, HR, or access. So I'll go with \"Administrative rights\" as the closest match.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI have a list of categories to choose from: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. From the user's message, it looks like they\u2019re requesting adjustments to a board, which might relate to either an Internal Project, Miscellaneous tasks, or possibly Administrative rights if permissions are needed.\n\nThey seem to want to adjust the board, add items, and split it. I feel \"Internal Project\" is the closest fit for this situation.**Formatting Response in JSON**\n\nI need to respond with the category for the IT ticket in a JSON format. The instruction clearly asks for the category, so I\u2019ll need to create a JSON object that looks like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.\n\nThe allowed values include \"Internal Project,\" and since we\u2019ve determined that's the best fit, I'll make sure I provide it exactly as required without any extra commentary. The output will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nI\u2019ll keep it clean and straightforward!"
