The user mentions an error when trying to run a release job due to access rights, particularly in pushing to a remote repository.\n\nGiven this context, it looks like the ticket fits into the \"Access\" category, as it concerns access rights to the repository. It might also be classified under \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Access\" seems more fitting overall.**Outputting IT ticket category**\n\nI see that the user's message indicates an access issue with the repository, likely causing a \"permission denied\" error. This clearly falls under the \"Access\" category.\n\nNow, I need to format my response as a JSON object containing the category. The schema directs that it should look like this: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I\u2019ll just stick to that without adding any extra commentary since the instructions specify to respond with just the categorization. Here it goes:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
