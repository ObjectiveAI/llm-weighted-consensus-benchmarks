It\u2019s mentioning terms like \"purchased,\" \"receipts section,\" and \"log installation,\" which makes me think it\u2019s likely related to purchasing or administrative rights. Given that it's about mandatory receipts and order details, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Purchase.\" The user is asking for assistance with this item, so it\u2019s important that I classify it correctly.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions installation, receipts, and orders, which leads me to think \"Purchase\" is the right category since it focuses on items bought and receipt handling. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" don\u2019t fit here. I consider \"Hardware,\" but there aren\u2019t specifics about hardware installation. So, I\u2019ll determine it as \"Purchase.\" I need to respond with a JSON object, specifically this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\u2014just the required output and nothing extra. Let's go with that!"
