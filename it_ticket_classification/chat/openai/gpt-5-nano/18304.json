The possible categories I have to work with include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Considering the mention of client connection and guest wireless, it seems like \"Access\" is the best fit. I'll need to output a JSON object containing the category to match the system requirements.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis ticket is focused on network access, especially regarding guest wireless and connections. While there are some references to cables, the main concern revolves around connectivity issues, making \"Access\" the best fitting category. I need to format my response as a JSON object, specifying the category as \"Access.\" The final output should simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll ensure it's valid and avoid adding any unnecessary commentary, as the user requests only the category."
