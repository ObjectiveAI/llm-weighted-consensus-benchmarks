The main focus is on access for all staff to this document. It looks like the best fit would be \"Access\" since it's primarily about permissions. However, I also see a case for \"HR Support\" since it relates to an HR policy. I have to decide which category best aligns with the request.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm working on categorizing an IT ticket related to employee policy access. It seems most appropriate to tag it as \"Access\" since it's about obtaining access to HR policy documents. The phrase about accepting or declining requests points to permissions but doesn't change the main focus on access rights. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply, I believe \"Access\" aligns best with the overall request for access to the referral policy. I'll prepare the JSON object with the category accordingly.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nThe user asked to categorize an IT ticket, and it seems we need to return a JSON object indicating the category as \"Access.\" The format specifies a property called \"category,\" so I'll prepare the output as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's important to confirm that \"Access\" is a valid choice from the allowed categories. While I could add a rationale, the focus here is on providing just the JSON. I'll make sure there\u2019s no extra text, sticking to the plain JSON format simply."
