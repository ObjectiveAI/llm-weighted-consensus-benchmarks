The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given that the user needs help with accessing a connection, it seems best to categorize this as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format the output in JSON, creating a category object with the corresponding value. Let's get this sorted!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to review the ticket text where the user describes connection issues and mentions a special installation for a client visit. This definitely points to an \"Access\" issue since they're unable to connect now. They also mention planned leave, which suggests they might need help during that time. The main takeaway is that it's about permissions and access. So I'll categorize this under \"Access\" and format my response as a JSON object as requested.**Finalizing the JSON Output**\n\nBased on the instructions, I need to output a JSON object that represents the category for the IT ticket. The relevant category for this case is \"Access.\" Even though it seems like they usually want just the string, the schema specifies that it should be in an object format. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and clearly present this as: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}` without any extra commentary. Let's wrap it up!"
