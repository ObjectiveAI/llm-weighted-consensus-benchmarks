The ticket mentions an issue related to \"adding to the project new PAS\" and trouble adding a member. It's a bit jumbled, but seems to imply that they're having trouble with access or adding someone to the project. So, I\u2019m thinking this definitely relates to an access issue that needs investigation.**Categorizing access issues**\n\nThe issue here involves adding a member to a project, which suggests a concern with access rights. The phrasing is a bit jumbled, mentioning \"starting view\" and confirmations, but the crux seems to be about permissions. Therefore, I believe the most fitting category is \"Access.\" I\u2019ll need to categorize it accordingly, as it aligns with the need for access control and permissions for the project. I\u2019ll return a JSON object with the category field set to \"Access.\"**Preparing final output**\n\nI\u2019m ready to craft the final output for the ticket. It should be a JSON object with the property \"category\" set to \"Access.\" I need to ensure that the text is exactly as required since the category must match the allowed values, including the capital \"A\" in \"Access.\" I'll go ahead and deliver this formatted correctly. Here we go: {\"category\":\"Access\"}!"
