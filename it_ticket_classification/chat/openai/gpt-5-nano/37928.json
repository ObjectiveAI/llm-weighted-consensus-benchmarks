The instructions clearly say to provide a category only. Since the required format is JSON, I need to stick to just outputting the category. It\u2019s essential that \u201cAccess\u201d matches exactly with the enum label, and I think I will stick with that. So, I\u2019ll output:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}  \n\nNo extra text needed, just the JSON format is sufficient here!**Finalizing categorization**\n\nIt looks like the user wants a categorization instead of clarification. While I could suggest clarifying questions, that doesn't align with their request. They specifically asked for a category, so I should focus on that. I'll finalize my response and make sure it meets their needs without adding unnecessary details or options. I'm sticking strictly to categorizing as requested!"
