The user mentions they can connect some way, possibly to a file server, but there are connectivity issues involved when accessing files. They reference an error, and it's unclear what \"ext mob en glee your zone\" means. It could be related to external mobile access or enablement. I really need to extract the core issue from this garbled message.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to classify an IT ticket based on the user's description. They refer to issues with a domain controller and file server access, which clearly indicates this is an \"Access\" problem, particularly involving login or permissions. The category \"Access\" fits best here since it\u2019s explicitly listed. I should simply output a JSON object with the \"category\" property set to \"Access\" and avoid any unnecessary comments. Let's keep it straightforward!{\"category\": \"Access\"} \n\nI want to ensure the capitalization is correct, and \"Access\" is exactly how it appears in the enum. While \"Administrative rights\" seemed like a possible category due to the domain controller aspect, the main focus is on access issues with the file server. So \"Access\" is definitely the right choice here. I\u2019m all set to produce the JSON output!"
