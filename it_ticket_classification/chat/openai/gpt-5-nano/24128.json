The main ideas here are \u201cnew purchase,\u201d \u201cinstallation,\u201d and \u201creceipts.\u201d It seems this ticket fits best into the \u201cPurchase\u201d category due to its focus on procurement processes. Even though it has some ambiguity, it's clear enough to confidently categorize it as \"Purchase.\"**Formatting category output**\n\nI need to create a JSON-like object for the category based on the instructions. The required format includes a \"category\" key with the value \"Purchase.\" I want to make sure to stick to the guidelines, as this needs to be in a final deliverable format. Since the request is straightforward, I\u2019ll just output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep it clean without extra text. So, this is my concise response."
