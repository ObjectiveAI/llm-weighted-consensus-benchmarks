This ticket focuses on topics like AD accounts, termination agreements, internships, maternity leave, and various employment statuses, pointing to access control. While \"HR Support\" could fit due to termination agreements, \"Access\" seems most suitable since it's about provisioning and deprovisioning accounts. I'll categorize it as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
