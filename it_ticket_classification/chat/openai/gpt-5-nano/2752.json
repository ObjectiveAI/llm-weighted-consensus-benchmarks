The ticket mentions terms like satisfaction, notifications, and complaint tickets, and I need to fit it into one of the categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. It seems like it relates to processes and assignments. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Miscellaneous,\" but I should reconsider \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" as options too.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nIt seems the ticket is more about IT processes and routing than hardware or access. With mentions of \"change and complaint tickets,\" \"assignment,\" and \"feedback queue,\" it could fit \"Miscellaneous\" for process issues. Alternatively, it might be \"Internal Project\" if related to adjusting ticketing processes. Since the user requested a categorized response in JSON format, I'll choose \"Miscellaneous\" to reflect its nature and structure my answer according to the required JSON schema.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project\" instead of \"Miscellaneous.\" The ticket discusses automatically logging feedback in the queue and adjusting the workflow, which seems like a significant internal change. It also mentions low scores and updates about kudos, indicating a potential project focused on improving the ticketing system. Therefore, it makes sense to classify it as \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll provide the response strictly as the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
