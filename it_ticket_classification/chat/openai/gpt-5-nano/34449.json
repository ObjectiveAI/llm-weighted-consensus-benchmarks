The user mentions problems with connectivity, which likely falls under \"Access,\" as that typically involves network access issues. It could also be considered \"Hardware\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but since the available options don't explicitly include \"Networking,\" \"Access\" seems like the closest fit. I'll go with that, ensuring I\u2019m aligning with the provided categories for proper classification.**Outputting IT ticket category**\n\nThe user's ticket is about a wireless connection issue, which feels more generic, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" While it could also relate to \"Hardware\" if it's the adapter, the wording points more toward network access. According to the instructions, I should respond with a JSON-like object containing the category. So, I\u2019ll structure it clearly as follows: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let\u2019s ensure no extra content is included and that the formatting is correct."
