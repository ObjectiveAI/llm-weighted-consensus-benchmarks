They\u2019re asking for step-by-step instructions on creating, running, and maintaining reports, with options for inputting dates and showing where engineers have logged their work. Since this covers IT support and reporting, I have to choose one category from options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. This ticket is a bit tricky!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing content about Oracle reporting and the steps involved in creating, running, and maintaining reports, including exporting to Excel. It doesn't seem to fit \"hardware,\" \"HR,\" or \"access,\" though it does mention engineers logging their work, which raises a question about access issues. Still, it feels more aligned with \"Internal Project\" since it relates to internal reporting. I\u2019ll classify this ticket and prepare the output as a JSON object, specifying the proper category.**Classifying support request**\n\nThe user's request focuses on Oracle reporting, asking for help with creating, running, and maintaining reports, as well as exporting to Excel. It seems to fall under application usage support, but it doesn\u2019t fit \"Administrative rights.\" So, \"Internal Project\" appears to be the best category for this. I\u2019ll follow the required format and respond with the JSON object, ensuring it has the correct key and string value for \"category.\" Let's finalize that response!"
