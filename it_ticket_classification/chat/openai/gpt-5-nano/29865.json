The request mentions installation and the importance of logging receipts associated with the order. This definitely relates to hardware procurement and installation aspects. I think the best category here would be \"Purchase,\" since it's primarily about ordering and logging rather than just hardware. However, \"Hardware\" is also relevant, but I\u2019ll stick with \"Purchase\" as the main category.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user's text refers to a request for a new purchase order related to a monitor. It mentions logging installation and mandatory receipts. This definitely fits within a procurement workflow, which leads me to categorize it as \"Purchase.\" I need to ensure that my output adheres to the specified JSON format. According to the schema, I'm going to output just the required JSON object with the category labeled as \"Purchase.\" Here we go!"
