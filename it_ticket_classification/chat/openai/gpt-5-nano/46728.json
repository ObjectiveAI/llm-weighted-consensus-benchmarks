The ticket mentions lost permission to reassign for approval and confusion about their options, which seems to indicate an access or permission issue. \n\nConsidering the allowed categories in the system, it likely fits under either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Both categories address the user's concerns about permissions, so I need to determine which one to choose.**Categorizing Access Rights Issue**\n\nThe ticket discusses a lost permission to reassign for approval, indicating it's likely an access rights issue. I need to choose between categories, specifically \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" Since it relates to permission for an action, \"Access\" seems more appropriate, as it covers general access rights. The user's issue is about permission within the Oracle system, so I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" \n\nNow, I\u2019ll format it as a JSON object reflecting this category choice!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
