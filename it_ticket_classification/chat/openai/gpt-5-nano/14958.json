It seems like the main focus is on access control for the secure area in the tower. Given this context, the most fitting category appears to be \"Access.\" Although administrative rights could be considered, the ticket is more about managing access rather than specific rights. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as Access.**Categorizing access request**\n\nThe user\u2019s request is clear: they want to restrict access for Friday PM to a secure area in a tower. Based on this, \"Access\" seems to be the right category. I need to respond with a JSON object containing just the category. According to the guidelines, I'll structure it to simply say {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The provided schema outlines a format, but it mainly indicates that we need to focus on the string for the category field. So, I\u2019ll stick to the essential output.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nMy final response will be a JSON-like object with just the category field, which will look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to avoid adding any extra text to keep it straightforward. I briefly considered if it could be \"Administrative rights,\" but since the request is to restrict access to a secure area, \"Access\" is definitely the right choice. I'll ensure everything is neat and returns as plain JSON. So, here we go: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
