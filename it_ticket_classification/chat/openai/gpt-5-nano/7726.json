The relevant categories to choose from are \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" If it\u2019s just a hardware issue, I\u2019d lean toward \"Hardware.\" On the other hand, if it's about procuring the items, I might consider \"Purchase.\" Overall, I see it as a request for hardware.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm determining the appropriate category for an IT ticket requesting a second monitor and a \"floor tower,\u201d likely referring to a PC tower. I\u2019m leaning toward \u201cHardware\u201d since it\u2019s about devices, but there\u2019s a chance it could fall under \u201cPurchase\u201d if they want to acquire these items. However, they didn\u2019t explicitly request to buy them. Given the context, I\u2019ll go with \u201cHardware.\u201d Now, I need to format the response as a JSON object with the category specified.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to create a JSON-like object that aligns with the category required for the IT ticket. The valid options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since I'm categorizing as \"Hardware,\" I'll format the response as follows: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"} \n\nIt\u2019s important to ensure that I follow the proper structure, and I won\u2019t include any extra text\u2014just the JSON output itself."
