I likely won't use \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Internal Project.\" I think \"Access\" is the best fit for now.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's message is about an Outlook web app error, not hardware, so I won't categorize it as that. I\u2019m considering \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d or \u201cAccess,\u201d especially if accessing the account is the issue. The details aren't clear enough for a definitive choice, but since \"Administrative rights\" doesn't apply here, I\u2019m leaning toward \"Miscellaneous,\" as it seems like a general application error. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"} without any extra text.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nThe answer I need to provide is: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.\n\nHowever, the required format specifies a schema: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}. I need to ensure my output adheres to the schema, even though previous tasks typically required just a string. The format calls for a JSON object according to the schema. So, I\u2019ll stick with the standard response: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} with no extra commentary."
