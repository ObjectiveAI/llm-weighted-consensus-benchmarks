The user's message outlines issues with searching sent items related to a mailbox problem \u2014 there's urgency, impact on client invoicing, and multiple users having access issues. It looks like mailbox access and search functionality are the core issues, so I would categorize this ticket under \"Access\" for effective resolution.**Categorizing email access issues**\n\nThis ticket revolves around email mailbox access and search functionality. The user is pointing out terms like \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" which seem relevant since they mention issues with multiple users seeing different mailboxes. While \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could apply, it clearly falls under \"Access\" because that's what the user needs help with. I'll output the final answer as a JSON object with \"category\" set to \"Access.\" \n\n{\"category\": \"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
