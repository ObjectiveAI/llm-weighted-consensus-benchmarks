They mention a \"screen blank\" situation and specify needing permissions to modify forecast data. Given the predefined categories, the best fit seems to be \"Access\" since the problem is related to accessing data and permissions. I\u2019ll prepare to output a JSON object with the chosen category, likely \"Access.\"**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the category for this IT ticket focused on permission changes and the ability to modify forecast data. It could fit under either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since the issue involves insufficient access. The ticket mentions needing visibility to data and modification for several clients in Canada. Given the context, the best choice is \"Access.\" I need to format my response as a JSON object that matches the required structure.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
