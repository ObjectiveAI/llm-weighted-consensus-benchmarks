The user mentions \u201cnew purchase\u201d and \u201cpo,\u201d which gives clues about its purpose. I see elements like purchasing and allocation of devices, receipts, and links. It seems best suited for either \"Purchase,\" \"Hardware,\" or possibly \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project.\" Given the mention of a purchase order and receipts, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Purchase\" as the most fitting category.**Confirming category selection**\n\nIt looks like categorizing this ticket as \"Purchase\" makes the most sense. The phrases like \"allocation device,\" \"under user name,\" and \"mandatory receipts section\" point to that. So, I will format my response in the correct JSON structure for clarity. Following the system's requirements, I'll create a JSON object with a string field for the category. The final output will simply be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"} \n\nNo extra text\u2014just the JSON object to ensure validity."
