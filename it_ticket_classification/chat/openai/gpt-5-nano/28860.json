The focus here is clearly on the installation process itself, which makes me think it fits best in the \"Hardware\" category. I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object to reflect this, formatted exactly as requested: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there's no extra text, just the necessary information in the correct structure.**Delivering category response**\n\nI'm finalizing my response for the IT ticket by confirming the category as \"Hardware.\" I've reviewed the available categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and others. However, \"Hardware\" is the most suitable fit for this installation task. So, I\u2019ll return it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} and ensure everything is correct. It's straightforward, but I just want to make sure I'm delivering exactly what\u2019s needed!"
