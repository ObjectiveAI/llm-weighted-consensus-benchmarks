The user pasted a messy ticket, and my task is to figure out where it fits in those categories. I'll carefully analyze the details in the ticket and determine the most appropriate category for it. It's important to get this right, so I'll be thorough in my assessment!**Identifying IT ticket issues**\n\nThe message talks about Oracle issues and concerns around extending a finish date mentioned on a previous Friday in February. It highlights the importance of resolving these problems for code submissions and mentions securing additional approvals as needed. It seems there's a problem with logging where some task details are showing up blank for the user but are visible for others. This information clearly relates to IT issues, specifically around project deadlines and system functionality. I'll ensure these points are addressed properly!**Categorizing access issues**\n\nI'm considering the ticket details, especially the \"problem logging\" and the \"recognize code\" messages that indicate issues with logging in and task details appearing blank. It sounds like an access issue, so \"Access\" could be the right category. There's also a need to set a manager for approvals, which might suggest \"Administrative rights.\" However, since it also talks about extending a finish date, it could potentially fit \"Internal Project.\" I need to find the best category that covers all these aspects!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user is asking to \"set a manager\" for approvals and extend a finish date related to a code or Oracle issue. It looks like a blend of project management and IT, specifically addressing login issues and access rights. The best fit is the \"Access\" category. While \"Administrative rights\" pertains to granting privileges, this situation focuses more on workflow, so I\u2019ll choose \"Access\" for categorization. Now, I just need to output that in the required JSON format!**Selecting the right category**\n\nI'm weighing whether to categorize this as \"Internal Project\" since it involves an internal project and mentions a senior visual designer submitting details for the week. It also touches on Oracle, finish dates, and extending deadlines, which suggest a project management or ERP issue. However, the core of the ticket revolves around a login issue and task details showing up blank. So, I'll stick with \"Access\" as the most fitting category. Now, I\u2019ll just output the JSON object!"
