The text is a bit garbled, but it mentions a \"new starter\" and someone returning from maternity leave, which suggests it involves HR support. So, I should probably categorize this as \"HR Support.\" The ticket's context seems a bit unclear, but I'm leaning toward that category given the details referenced. Hopefully, this classification makes sense!**Interpreting the IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket looks like it\u2019s about HR, specifically relating to a new starter and maternity leave. I\u2019m considering categorizing it as \"HR Support\" since it mentions \"new starter,\" which usually fits there. However, it could also involve \"Access\" if it pertains to granting access for the new starter. The request seems to involve filling out a form, which further suggests it should fall under HR. I need to choose the category that aligns best with this context!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions both a new starter and someone returning from maternity leave, which suggests that we might be looking at account provisioning or needing to reactivate access. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Access\" due to the nature of the request. However, since it also touches on HR aspects, I considered \"HR Support.\" Ultimately, as it\u2019s an IT ticket, \"Access\" seems like the best fit for this JSON output. I'll go with that!**Deciding on the IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket includes HR elements, mentioning a \"new starter\" and someone returning from maternity leave. This ambiguity makes it tricky. However, I think \"Access\" is the right choice here, as it aligns with onboarding a new employee or reestablishing access for someone returning from leave. While \"HR Support\" might also fit, \"Access\" is more relevant for IT purposes. I'll provide a concise JSON output specifying the category as \"Access\": `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. That should work!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
