The terms like \"timecard submitting,\" \"annual leave,\" and \"error displayed\" suggest this is related to HR matters. So, it seems to fit best under the \"HR Support\" category since it specifically addresses a timecard submission error. I\u2019ll classify it as HR Support.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether this ticket could fall under \"Administrative rights\" since they mention \"manage cards field.\" However, the main focus seems to be on timecard submission issues linked to annual leave, which suggests it\u2019s more in the HR domain. So, I'll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" \n\nNext, I need to format the output correctly as a JSON-like object for clarity:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI\u2019ll also provide a brief summary to clarify the issue."
