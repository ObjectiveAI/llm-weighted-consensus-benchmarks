The phrase \"please deliver installation ticker\" could actually mean \"installation ticket.\" Considering all this, I\u2019ll categorize the ticket perhaps under \"Purchase,\" and then output it as a JSON object like instructed!**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on content that mentions \"purchase made,\" \"install,\" and \"delivery.\" It seems related to a hardware purchase and installation. With categories like Hardware, Storage, and Purchase available, the phrase \"purchase made\" really points towards \"Purchase.\" The reference to \"apple core flash\" might suggest a hardware item, potentially something like SSD flash storage, but it\u2019s unclear.
