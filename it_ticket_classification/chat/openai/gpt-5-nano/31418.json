It mentions a \"notification request form,\" \"migration change,\" and \"change request,\" which leads me to think it relates to change management. The possible categories could be \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The strongest case seems to be for \"Internal Project,\" given the context of migration and changes being discussed. I'll finalize the categorization as such.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m working on classifying an IT ticket and wondering about the right category. It seems to mention \"migration change,\" which could relate to an \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" since \"Access\" is also a possibility. Since a change request isn't a valid category, I should respond with a JSON object. My best guess for a fitting category is \"Internal Project.\" I'll structure my response to follow the required JSON format and include brief reasoning.**Analyzing IT ticket content**\n\nLet\u2019s break down the ticket content: it mentions a \"notification request form,\" which might indicate a new form, and \"thursday pm form,\" suggesting a scheduled event. The phrases \"please attached\" and \"both agree\" hint at discussions between parties. With \"migration change\" and \"cr today date,\" it seems to refer to a Change Request for migration. Given the lack of an explicit \"Change Management\" category, \"Internal Project\" fits well for this ticket within project tasks involving migrations.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI think \"Internal Project\" is the best categorization for this ticket. While \"Administrative rights\" could be considered if it involved admin access, there\u2019s no explicit mention of that. Therefore, I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" and format my response as a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I want to ensure it's clear and concise without extra text. The user asked to categorize, so if anything seems unclear in the future, I might consider asking clarifying questions."
