There are phrases related to HR and administrative tasks, but since this is labeled as an IT ticket, I must pick a suitable category. \n\nIt seems to relate to HR Support given the reference to sick leave and contractor forms. So, I'll classify it under HR Support, even though it\u2019s presented as an IT ticket.**Determining the category**\n\nI\u2019m working on classifying this request into the right category. It could be \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or even \"Miscellaneous.\" The text mentions \"contractor,\" \"starter form,\" and \"sick leave,\" which makes \"HR Support\" feel like the closest fit because it relates to contractor onboarding. So, I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support.\" \n\nNow, I need to format this as a JSON object like: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} to meet the system's requirements. I'll ensure it reflects the format properly.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to format my response correctly for the category. The standard output should look like this: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll ensure it\u2019s valid JSON, which is crucial. \n\nSince the instructions specify to respond with the category only, I won\u2019t add any extra notes. It\u2019s clear that the user just wants the JSON object. So, I\u2019ll respond simply with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That should do it!"
