The predefined categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I\u2019ll analyze the content and choose the category that fits best. Then, I\u2019ll format my response in JSON with the selected category field. This should help in organizing the ticket effectively.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nThis ticket discusses a virus detection, scanned directories, and infected files, which clearly indicates a malware security concern. Although there's no \"Security\" category, I have options like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Given the content, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a good fallback since it's quite generic. I considered \"Access\" due to mentions of exploits, but the focus on virus detection makes \"Miscellaneous\" the best fit. Now I'll format this in JSON according to the structure provided.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON-like object that matches the specified schema. The category I've decided on is \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll keep the response straightforward without adding any extra text. So, the final output will just be JSON in the format of {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Let's proceed with that and make sure it\u2019s neat and matches what\u2019s expected!"
