It clearly involves transferring files and guides, so it seems to fit under \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d or perhaps \"Internal Project,\" given the context of site decommissioning and migration. I'll assign the most appropriate category!**Evaluating ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m trying to determine the best category for this IT ticket. The options include \"Storage,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Internal Project.\" The ticket mentions archiving, file transfers, and a deadline, which makes \"Storage\" seem suitable. However, since it focuses on migrating and decommissioning a site, \"Internal Project\" might be a better fit. There\u2019s no request for \"Administrative rights,\" so I think I'll lean toward \"Internal Project.\" I need to submit it as a JSON object.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
