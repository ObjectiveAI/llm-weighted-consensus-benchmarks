The prompt asks to categorize the IT ticket in JSON format. Given that the ticket discusses updating Stingray by adding members without asking each one separately, \"Access\" seems like the most fitting choice. So, I'll go with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Categorizing updates**\n\nI'm considering \"Administrative rights\" since the user might want admin access to add members. They asked to update Stingray to allow adding members without individually querying them, hinting at bulk additions. While this could relate to \"Internal Project,\" it\u2019s primarily an access control request, so I think \"Access\" is the right category. The format I need to output is simply the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I won't worry about capitalization; \"Access\" looks good!**Finalizing response**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I just need to categorize the IT ticket without adding extra details. I\u2019ll respond with the category only and keep it minimal, as instructed. I think I\u2019m ready to produce the final output and follow through with what\u2019s required! Here we go."
