I'll propose a summary and assign a category based on keywords about connections, permissions, or tool features.**Classifying IT tickets**\n\nFor this IT ticket classification, I'm considering the best category. \"Access\" seems to fit best since the user mentions \"connect\" and \"how work,\" which suggests connectivity to Outlook. While \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option due to vagueness, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" since it pertains to connecting and potential permissions. I might also add a brief note that the ticket text is unclear, so clarifying questions could help. Finally, I'll respond in the required JSON format with the chosen category.**Formatting the response**\n\nThe system specifies a defined format for the output as a JSON object with a category field. I\u2019ll respond with {\"category\":\"Access\"} based on my earlier classification. The instructions emphasize that the output may need to be parsed by code, so I should provide the JSON exactly as required without any additional explanations. I've confirmed that \"Access\" is a valid category, so I\u2019m all set to respond appropriately with just that JSON object."
