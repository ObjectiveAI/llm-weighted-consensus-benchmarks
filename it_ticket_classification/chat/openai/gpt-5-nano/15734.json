Given the mentions of \"device\" and \"purchase order,\" it could fit into the \"Purchase\" category.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI think this ticket falls under the \"Purchase\" category because it focuses on purchase orders and procurement. Although the mention of \"allocation\" might suggest allocating devices to users, the phrase \"new purchase po\" clearly indicates it\u2019s about purchasing. \n\nIf it\u2019s about mobile subscription devices, \"Hardware\" could also fit, but the emphasis on \"purchase order\" aligns more with \"Purchase.\" In many IT systems, \"Purchase\" is the right choice for procurement requests. I'll categorize this as \"Purchase\" and prepare to respond with the necessary JSON format.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
