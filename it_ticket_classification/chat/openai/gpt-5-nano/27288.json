Since the user mentioned \"notify owners,\" it seems action-oriented but isn't strictly about access rights. Given all of this, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best fit as it relates to a task within an internal migration project. I think I should output a JSON object with \"category\": \"Internal Project\" as specified in the user's request.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI think we need to respond with a JSON object that aligns with the requested schema. The instruction tells us to categorize the IT ticket as \"Internal Project.\" The schema shows that the response should contain a \"category\" field. While I initially thought just to say {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, I need to ensure it matches the format provided. \n\nIt's important to stick with what is specified, so I\u2019ll go with {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} for clarity. That seems right!**Determining the Category**\n\nThe ticket indicates there's a need to move content from a Confluence space and notify the relevant owners, which is part of a coordinated project to migrate content. Since it\u2019s clear this is an \u201cInternal Project,\u201d I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I want to ensure there\u2019s no extra text, sticking to the instruction to simply provide the category in the specified format. Let's keep it straightforward!"
