I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit based on the context.**Outputting IT ticket category**\n\nIt seems the issue is likely a hardware problem since the device isn't working in the meeting room. To categorize this correctly, the required format is a JSON object indicating the category. Based on the options given, I'll classify it as \"Hardware.\" So, I'll produce the JSON object as follows:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nThis keeps things concise and meets the requested schema without extra commentary. I'll ensure the quotes are correct and deliver it as is."
