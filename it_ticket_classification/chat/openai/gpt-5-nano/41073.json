It looks like there's an internal site access issue. The user mentions they can't access the site but can connect normally when using something, perhaps a VPN. They also mention that the address is resolved, but they still can't reach it. I\u2019m trying to make sense of phrases like \"cannot access internal site from sent.\" Let's parse that to clarify!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m not entirely sure what the user meant, but it looks like they\u2019re facing an access issue with an internal site. They mention that they can't access the site from a specific location, but they might be able to when connected via VPN. There's also a chance the DNS resolves, but they still can't connect. Based on the provided categories, I think this ticket should be categorized as \"Access\" since it's about accessing the internal site.**Confirming Category JSON**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that the ticket should be categorized as \"Access\" since it pertains to an internal site access issue. There's a possibility it could relate to an \"Internal Project,\" but the primary request is just for categorization. I\u2019ll respond in the specified JSON format, which only requires the \"category\" field. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll output exactly: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra notes or explanations to ensure clarity and adherence to instructions. Yes, that\u2019s the plan!"
