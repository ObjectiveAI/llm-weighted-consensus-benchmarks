Terms like \"IE for application\" and \"problem with computer win\" suggest a Windows OS issue. Given the context, I'll likely categorize this under \"Miscellaneous\" as it doesn't fit neatly into other categories like Hardware or Administrative rights.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m faced with limited categories to choose from: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The issue stems from a software problem with Windows Explorer, leading me to consider \"Miscellaneous\" as the best fit. While I briefly thought about Administrative rights, that seems more about permissions, which isn\u2019t relevant here. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorically select \"Miscellaneous\" for this general IT issue and respond in the required JSON format.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
