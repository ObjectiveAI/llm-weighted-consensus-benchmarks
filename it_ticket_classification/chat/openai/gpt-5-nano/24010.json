It could be about scheduling meetings in December, but not HR support.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket regarding scheduling meetings. I initially thought about \"Administrative rights,\" but that doesn't fit, and \"Access\" isn\u2019t relevant either. The categories don't explicitly cover scheduling, so \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the best choice as a catch-all. \"Internal Project\" might work if it were for a specific project meeting, but it\u2019s not clear. I'll go with \"Miscellaneous\" and prepare to respond with a JSON format. The response will be: {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
