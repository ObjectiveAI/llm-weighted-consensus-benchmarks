Since it involves a mail merge, it could be \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous\" depending on whether it requires permissions. It's not hardware or HR-related, but maybe \"Access\" fits if it's about using the email system. I have to select the best category.**Determining the category of the IT ticket**\n\nIf the task is sending a mail merge to users, it might need access or permissions for distribution lists and the mail merge tool. \"Access\" seems fitting if that\u2019s the case, but the ticket doesn't mention any access issues. \n\nI also consider \"Administrative rights\" if admin privileges are needed. \"Internal Project\" could apply if it's an internal IT task. Alternatively, \"Miscellaneous\" works as a catch-all. I think the best options are \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Should I ask for clarification?**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nIn IT ticket triage, a mail merge to users typically involves sending emails to multiple users, which might need \"Access\" to distribution lists. I see that mail merge is a feature in MS Word/Outlook, so this is more of a workflow task than a problem. I believe categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" makes sense, considering it\u2019s a specific task within an internal project, rather than simply \"Miscellaneous.\" It could also be \"Access\" if permissions are needed. \n\nSo, I would output:  \n```json\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n```{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
