They mentioned wanting to create an empty project and an empty board, possibly related to a user analyst. This could tie into project management tools like Jira and might involve administrative rights. \"Administrative rights\" seems like a fit since creating projects usually requires that, but \"Internal Project\" also makes sense for setting up a new project. I'll lean toward categorizing it as an \"Internal Project.\"**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the phrase \"board where user analyst,\" which might suggest creating a board for a user or analyst role. There's also a category for \"Access,\" focusing on permissions and admin rights. Since the user mentioned creating an empty project and board, \"Internal Project\" seems like the most fitting category. The phrase about the analyst implies user assignment but doesn't quite fit any category directly. Still, \"Access\" could relate to the necessary rights for board creation. Overall, I lean towards categorizing it as \"Internal Project.\"**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket clearly requests actions about creating new resources, which aligns more with internal project management, so \"Internal Project\" appears to be the best fit. I should respond in a precise JSON format as instructed. The system specifies to return just the category without any extra text to ensure proper parsing. So, my final response will be simply:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nThis keeps everything clean and straightforward!"
