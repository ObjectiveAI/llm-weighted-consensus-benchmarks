The option \"Miscellaneous\" could apply, but \"Hardware\" feels more appropriate. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object that includes \"Hardware\" in the category field.**Providing category response**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, which means I should respond with the category value as a JSON object. Based on the system's instructions, I need to return an object formatted with the property \"category.\" In this case, since the appropriate category is \"Hardware,\" I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It\u2019s important to stick to minimal commentary, so I'll just present the response directly."
