There\u2019s some Romanian in the rest of the message, but it\u2019s a bit garbled. \"PM\" could mean \"p.m.\" or something else. The categories I have to choose from include \u201cHardware\u201d and \u201cAccess,\" which might cover network cables. I\u2019ll assign a category based on this context for the user.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's message is minimal, mentioning \"network cable\" and a location that seems garbled. I think this is likely an IT issue that fits the \"Hardware\" category because network cables are hardware. While \"Miscellaneous\" could fit due to its ambiguity, \"Hardware\" feels more appropriate here. I can respond with a JSON object, saying: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It could also help to ask for clarification about the unclear parts of the message when I reach out to the user.**Outputting JSON for IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket refers to a network cable issue, clearly making it hardware-related. The required format is just a JSON object for the category, so I\u2019ll stick with that. The instruction says to prioritize the JSON object format and avoid heavy formatting. Therefore, I\u2019ll simply output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Although I could add a brief note, it seems best to just keep it straightforward and focus on delivering the required output only."
