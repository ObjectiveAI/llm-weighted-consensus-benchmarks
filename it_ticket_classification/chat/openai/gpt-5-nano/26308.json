The text mentions steps for activating the license after installation and updates, which relates to software management. I need to figure out which category fits best. \"Access\" could be relevant since it deals with software access. \"Administrative rights\" might be a contender too, as activation may require those. \"Miscellaneous\" could also work, but others, like \"Purchase,\" don't seem to fit.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating the best category for this IT ticket. The content revolves around license activation, mentioning steps like entering a license key and the activation window. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access,\" as it relates to how license keys grant access to software. \"Administrative rights\" is another option if admin permissions are needed, but \"Access\" feels more fitting since it's about authorization. I\u2019ll respond with the category in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and consider whether to include a justification, though it\u2019s not strictly necessary.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
