Since the ticket reflects procurement language, it seems to fit best under the \"Purchase\" category. I briefly considered \"Administrative rights\", but that doesn't seem relevant here. \"Internal Project\" doesn't apply either. While it could be ambiguous and fall under \"Miscellaneous\", \"Purchase\" is clearly the best choice. I'll respond with a structured JSON object indicating this category.**Delivering JSON output**\n\nThe instruction asks me to categorize an IT ticket, and I see we need to follow a specific JSON schema format. The ticket fits into the \"Purchase\" category, so I need to return a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. The schema specifies that it must be an object, and it seems there's no need for extra explanations. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward: just deliver the required category object. So, here we go!"
