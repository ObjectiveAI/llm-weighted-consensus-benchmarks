The request mentions \"infrastructure\" and scheduling for a \"planning officer.\" I\u2019m considering categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but it's tricky. The text doesn't explicitly mention hardware, storage, purchase, or HR support. It feels like the user might be planning something for December, so I'll lean toward \"Internal Project\" given the context of infrastructure.**Choosing category for IT ticket**\n\nI think the best fit for this IT ticket would be \"Internal Project\" since it's related to \"infrastructure\" and planning. The user's request is a bit messy, but it seems to be about scheduling tasks for Tuesday in December. While \"Administrative rights\" would relate to granting permissions, and \"Access\" deals with access issues, this feels more aligned with general planning. I\u2019ll go ahead and categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" Now, let's format the output as a structured JSON object with the chosen category.**Preparing the response**\n\nAlright, I need to respond with the allowed category values, specifically \"Internal Project.\" Since this is a categorization task, I'll format it as a JSON object. I want to make sure my response is clean and concise, so I'll avoid any extra commentary or whitespace that might interfere with parsing. The final output will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
