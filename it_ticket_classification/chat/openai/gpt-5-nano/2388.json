They mentioned a \"personal laptop data wipe,\" which indicates they want to wipe data from their own device. This likely relates to data security. I\u2019m considering options like \"Hardware,\" since it\u2019s about a laptop, and \"Storage,\" given it concerns data management. Other categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Access\" don\u2019t seem to fit. My best guess is to classify it as \"Hardware\" for this request.**Categorizing IT Ticket Task**\n\nIn the context of IT ticket taxonomy, I see that wiping data aligns with hardware tasks. The user\u2019s request to \"schedule his cleaned\" indicates they want this scheduled. While I'm considering \"Storage\" as it's related to data handling, the phrase mainly involves device action. Thus, I'll primarily categorize it as \"Hardware.\" To summarize, I'll note that this request involves wiping data from a personal laptop and suggest confirming privacy compliance, OS, encryption, and backup methods. I'll provide this as a JSON-like output for clear categorization.**Outputting Category in JSON Format**\n\nThe prompt specifies that I need to provide a category using a JSON-like format. I\u2019ll output this as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} since that fits the request. \n\nWhile I could add notes about scheduling the wipe for Thursday or confirming the device owner, the main instruction is to produce just the category. I'll follow this strictly to maintain the required format, ensuring the key is exactly as specified and the value is one of the allowed enumerated strings."
