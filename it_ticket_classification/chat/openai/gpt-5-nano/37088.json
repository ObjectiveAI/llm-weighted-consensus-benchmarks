The prompt gives options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The user mentions an issue with Oracle where they can't record data for the past week due to errors about location details, despite filling required fields. It seems relevant to Oracle HCM, so it may fit into the HR Support category. I'll categorize it accordingly.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm trying to decide how to categorize the IT ticket. The categories include Access, Administrative rights, Internal Project, and Miscellaneous. It doesn't seem to fit Hardware, Storage, or Purchase. If the user\u2019s issue relates to Oracle HR, it might be HR Support, but since it\u2019s unclear, Miscellaneous seems best. However, the mention of not being able to record could suggest Access or Administrative rights. Since the categories are limited, I might consider asking clarifying questions to ensure the correct categorization.**Formatting category classification**\n\nThe instruction is to categorize the IT ticket and provide a response in JSON format. The prompt outlines valid categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. I need to format my response as a JSON object with \"category\" as a key. Based on the information, I think \"Miscellaneous\" could be a default choice. However, since the user's issue involves permissions to record, maybe \"Access\" would be more fitting. I'll have to decide on the best category for clarity.**Categorizing user request**\n\nThe user mentions an issue with an Oracle application where they can't record anything for the past week due to an error regarding location details, even after filling required fields. This might relate to \"Administrative rights,\" but I'm not completely sure. Since the request isn't clearly about hardware, storage, or HR support, the safest choice seems to be \"Miscellaneous.\" The instruction says to provide a JSON response with just the category, so I'll output {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} without any extra text."
