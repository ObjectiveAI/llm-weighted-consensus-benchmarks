It's all about making sure I align the ticket with the right category to streamline the process! So let\u2019s take a deeper look at the specifics of the ticket.**Organizing Leaver Form Details**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a jumble of information related to a leaver form that includes various aspects like the leaving date, location, employee's name, and several administrative details. This seems to involve things like a roaming profile, AD rights, the personal mailbox, and the approver's role. There are mentions of inventory storage, tokens, mobile phone subscriptions, and other accounts, alongside notes about automatic changes and responsible parties. I need to sort through this to clarify the main points clearly!**Determining IT Access Category**\n\nThis is about access changes for an employee leaving, so I should classify it under \"Access.\" The content covers various access aspects like AD rights, mailbox, roaming profile, tokens, and mobile phone subscriptions, focusing on access removal. While \"Administrative rights\" might be relevant, it seems more appropriate to categorize this under \"Access,\" considering it's about user access termination. The user asked to categorize the IT ticket, so I'll go with a JSON-like output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
