I\u2019ll analyze the content closely to determine which category is the most appropriate for this ticket. Let\u2019s make sure we get this right!**Analyzing a pen test request**\n\nI need to categorize a request regarding a third-party penetration test within the network. The content is quite messy, mentioning various elements related to the pen test, like testing from inside the network, remote access, and issues with configurations. It\u2019s crucial for me to parse through the information to accurately categorize it. My aim is to find the most fitting category from what\u2019s provided, making sure to address the user\u2019s needs. Let's get this right!**Categorizing security request**\n\nThis request relates to security and compliance. I\u2019m looking at categories like \"Access\" for network access and \"Administrative rights,\" but those may not fit perfectly. The request seems to focus on enabling a third-party penetration test, including remote access and compliance requirements. The best category appears to be \"Access,\" as it specifically addresses access to the internal network. I could also consider adding sub-notes about the penetration testing details, but my primary choice here is \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
