The request seems to be about deactivating visitor cards, which relates more to Access, as it involves access control. Even though \"Administrative rights\" and \"Hardware\" might seem relevant, they're not applicable here as the focus is on revoking access. The user clearly asks to deactivate the visitor cards, so I\u2019ll classify this ticket under the Access category.**Providing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI realize that \"Internal Project\" isn't relevant here, and while \"Hardware\" could apply if we're talking about physical cards, the phrase \"deactivate cards\" clearly relates to access control. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as Access. It seems like I should respond using a JSON object, which must only include the category since the user simply asked for a categorization. I\u2019ll just format it like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That\u2019s clear and concise!"
