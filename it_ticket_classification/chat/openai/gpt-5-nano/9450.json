The phrase \u201chow installed\u201d implies they need installation instructions. It could possibly fall under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" if it\u2019s an internal ticket. Admin rights might be necessary for installation. I'll need to return a JSON-like category response based on my reasoning: since Parallels is virtualization software, I'll decide to categorize it as \"Miscellaneous.\" However, the user's intent regarding lead generation isn't entirely clear.**Determining category for ticket**\n\nThe user refers to \"lead generation,\" which might indicate a specific use case. If it's an \"Internal Project,\" that could fit, especially if they're implementing software for that purpose. However, since the phrase \"lead generation\" is directly mentioned, I wonder if they want to install Parallels for that task. The most suitable generic category appears to be \"Miscellaneous,\" while \"Administrative rights\" could apply for installations, but the user didn\u2019t specify. Thus, I\u2019ll stick with {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
