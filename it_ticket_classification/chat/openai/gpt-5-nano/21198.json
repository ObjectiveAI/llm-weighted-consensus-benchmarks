The options are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Considering its focus on automation, it seems to fit best in \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" This task doesn't relate to hardware or storage directly, so I\u2019m leaning toward \"Internal Project\" since it involves IT operations.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI need to choose the right category for the IT ticket based on the user's request. The options are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The mention of \"assign queue lead\" suggests it relates to workflow or process, pointing toward \"Administrative rights.\" However, since it involves the Black Duck environment and automation, \"Internal Project\" seems more fitting here. To be precise, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" in the required JSON format.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category as \"Internal Project.\" The required format is clear, so it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. The schema indicates that this content should fit within the guidelines, and I'm ensuring that the category string matches perfectly with the allowed values. There shouldn\u2019t be any extra text in the response. I\u2019m ready to finalize the output as a succinct JSON object. Here it goes: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
