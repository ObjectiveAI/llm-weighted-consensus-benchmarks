The user\u2019s request mentions updating various metrics and tasks, which suggests it relates to project or task management. I'll need to decide among categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" It sounds like the most fitting choice would be \"Internal Project\" since the focus is on managing tasks and updates within a system. Let's get that in the required JSON format!**Determining the right category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the request regarding workflow/status and user permissions related to moving task statuses. \"Access\" could work here since it involves allowing users to shift tasks back, but the ticket also mentions \"update metrics\" and \"types tasks sub tasks,\" leaning towards something more internal. The \"Internal Project\" category seems most suitable for this ticket, focusing on project management changes. It relates to system updates within a project management tool, reflecting internal processes.**Choosing the appropriate category**\n\nAfter considering the user's request, I feel \"Internal Project\" fits best. While there\u2019s an \"Administrative rights\" category, the main focus here is on updating metrics and the movement of task statuses, which implies a permission change. Although \"Access\" could work since it deals with user access permissions, the request doesn\u2019t pertain to granting admin rights. It\u2019s more about general project management, so I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" and respond with the JSON object showing that category.**Finalizing the response**\n\nI need to prepare my final output, which should be in the JSON format. I\u2019m confirming that the required structure includes the \"category\" key with the value \"Internal Project.\" I'll keep it straightforward and only include the necessary JSON object without any extra commentary. So, my final response will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It's time to deliver this!"
