This could likely fit under \"HR Support\" because of the time card submission or \"Access\" if it's about permissions. There\u2019s also the potential for \"Administrative rights,\" but I\u2019m leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the best fit.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user appears to be reporting that Oracle can submit timecards, possibly related to permissions for submissions on Monday. It looks like I need to categorize this IT ticket based on the provided schema. Considering the description, \"oracle can submit time card sent monday can submit card,\" it seems to involve HR functionalities related to payroll. Therefore, the best category would likely be \"HR Support,\" although \"Access\" might be relevant if it's about permissions.**Classifying the ticket**\n\nThe ticket seems to be about whether Oracle can submit a timecard, which relates to its capabilities rather than just permissions. The phrase \"can submit\" implies they have permission. Since the user mentions submitting on Monday, I think categorizing this ticket under \"HR Support\" is best, as it pertains to HR processes and payroll functionalities. So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object containing the category as \"HR Support,\" formatted as:  \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
