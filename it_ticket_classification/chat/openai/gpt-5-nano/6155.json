The terms \u201cnew starter\u201d and \u201ccontractors\u201d suggest the topic relates to onboarding. I need to determine the right category from options like Access, HR Support, or Administrative rights. Since it mentions forms and joining NJ, it seems likely that this ticket relates to provisioning accounts or access rights for new contractors. But I\u2019m a bit unsure!**Deciding ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m examining a request that mentions help with completing forms for contractors to join, which might involve enabling access. I think the category could be \"Access\" because it relates to provisioning user accounts. Alternatively, it could be \"HR Support\" since onboarding is an HR function. However, for IT ticket categorization, \"Access\" seems more fitting for login credentials. The user asked for this categorization, so I\u2019ll output a JSON object with \"category\": \"Access.\"**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nI need to respond in a specific format: {\"category\": \"...\"}. The system requires that I provide a category object. I\u2019ll go with {\"category\":\"Access.\"} \n\nWhile I might think about adding a brief note, the instructions state I should only return the category. So, I\u2019ll stick with the JSON object and ensure it's valid. I\u2019ll format it like this: {\"category\":\"Access.\"} Sounds good!"
