The phrase \u201cdashboard maintenance work\u201d indicates scheduled maintenance, while \u201cdashboard unavailable\u201d suggests an outage. The message says to notify users, implying communication is needed. \"Internal Project\" seems appropriate since it's related to the internal dashboard. It doesn\u2019t pertain to external hardware, HR, or purchases. Access rights might be relevant if users are impacted, but this ticket is primarily about the maintenance issue.**Selecting project category**\n\nI'm considering whether to categorize this task as \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since this involves dashboard maintenance, \"Internal Project\" feels more accurate. Users typically expect a clear category label, and given the context with phrases like \"dashboard maintenance work\" and \"job engineer,\" it's clear this falls under internal duties. I need to format my final response as a JSON object stating the category. So, it will simply look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. No extra text needed!**Formatting category output**\n\nI need to output a JSON object with the category field. The specified format shows it should be structured like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This is a clear and concise way to convey the necessary information. I just need to make sure there's no extra text around it. My focus is on delivering precisely what's required, so I\u2019ll provide just the JSON output as requested. Let's confirm: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
