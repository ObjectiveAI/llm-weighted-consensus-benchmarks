Since it involves granting access to a new employee, I think \"Access\" might be the best fit, but I can also see the connection to \"HR Support\" due to the forms attached. Let me output it in JSON format!**Deciding the ticket category**\n\nThe user didn\u2019t explicitly request access, but for a new starter, we often need to handle tasks like account setup, email creation, and accessing systems. The ticket mentions \"new starter\" along with forms attached, which typically points to HR Support. However, since this is an IT ticket, \"Access\" feels more fitting because the new starter needs login credentials. Although \"Administrative rights\" is a separate category, it seems to fall under access rights. I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" for this ticket.**Choosing the appropriate category**\n\nFor the new starter, I\u2019d typically set up user accounts, so \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they need admin privileges. However, since the request lacks specifics, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" as the best guess. It could also be \"HR Support\" since this relates to onboarding. The phrase \"forms attached\" implies HR might handle these forms, but since it\u2019s an IT ticket, \"Access\" feels more fitting. I need to decide which category is the most appropriate.**Finalizing the category choice**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to go with the \"Access\" category as the best fit for this ticket. Now, I need to respond with a JSON object that follows the given schema: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}. So, I\u2019ll format my response like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll keep it concise since the user asked for categorization without extra explanation unless they request more details."
