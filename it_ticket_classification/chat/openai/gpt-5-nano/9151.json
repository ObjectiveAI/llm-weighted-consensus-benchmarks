The ticket mentions new interns and hardware allocation, along with a request to create credentials for accounts. Given these details, it seems to best fit the \"Hardware\" category, as it focuses on hardware allocation. There's also a bit about creating accounts, which could tie into Access, but the main focus appears to be on the hardware aspect.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThis ticket discusses accounts and credentials, which suggests \"Access\" as the best category. It involves creating credential accounts for interns, clearly pointing to access management. While \"Hardware\" could also apply due to hardware allocation, the focus here is on account creation rather than hardware itself. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" I need to format this as a JSON object with a category property, following the specified schema. This ensures clarity and correctness in the output.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
