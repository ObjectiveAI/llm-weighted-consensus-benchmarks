The most fitting category seems to be \"Access,\" though it could be \"Administrative rights\" if they're asking for admin permissions. \n\nGiven the context, I'll go with \"Access\" and prepare the JSON-like format for the category.**Crafting Response Format**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket and the required format is a JSON-like object. The system specifies that I should output a category object with specific values.\n\nGiven the context, I should return {\"category\":\"Access\"} since the main issue is the password reset expiration. While there could be multiple issues, this is the primary concern. I\u2019ll make sure to keep it concise and get ready to finalize my response."
