The user mentions difficulties with uploading a document on a site and questions if the upload button is functioning or if permissions are correct. They report no response when attempting to upload an existing file. It's unclear if they raised the issue in the right place, and they are seeking guidance. It seems the main focus is on document uploads, button functionality, and permission checks.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket related to a web application's document upload feature, focusing on permissions and the non-functioning button. The available categories include \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Internal Project,\" among others. Since this issue directly involves upload permissions, it seems the \"Access\" category is the best fit. I\u2019ll suggest categorizing it as \"Access,\" highlighting that the user is facing issues with upload permissions and needs guidance on where to raise the issue. Presenting this as JSON would be suitable.**Providing JSON format**\n\nThe prompt requires me to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category. The correct format is: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I\u2019ll focus on returning just the JSON without additional explanation, although I could consider mentioning a brief rationale in plain text. However, it seems best to abide strictly by the instruction, which emphasizes delivering only the JSON format as the response. So, I'll go ahead and deliver just the JSON object without extra content."
