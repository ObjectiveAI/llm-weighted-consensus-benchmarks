The available categories don't include \"Security\" or \"Software,\" which are relevant to virus issues. The closest options seem to be \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project.\" Given the context, I think \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit as a catch-all for this situation. It's not perfect, but it will work for now!**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering if the IT ticket should be categorized under \"Administrative rights\" since the user mentions needing more details about the virus situation. However, since the available options don't include \"Security incident,\" I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best choice. The required output format calls for a JSON object with a \"category\" property. So, I\u2019ll finalize it as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. This way, it fits all the provided requirements!**Delivering the JSON output**\n\nI need to provide the top-level JSON object with the \"category\" set to \"Miscellaneous.\" The schema confirms that the object should only include that property, so I\u2019ll simply output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. There\u2019s no need for extra explanation or commentary since the user just wants the categorization. I\u2019ll keep it clean and straightforward. Let\u2019s deliver this smoothly!"
