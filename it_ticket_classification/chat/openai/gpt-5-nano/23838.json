They\u2019re mentioning a \"change project code\" and \"annual leave requests,\" which complicates things because the request is a bit messy. It seems like they\u2019re asking for a project code change for a Friday in December and mentioning leave requests as well. I'll need to determine which category fits best among the options listed: Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the ticket. It could be \"Administrative rights\" since it mentions changing code with admin privileges. \"Internal Project\" also seems appropriate because of the project code change mentioned. However, if it's about access, \"Access\" might fit. The reference to \"annual leave requests\" is tricky since that\u2019s HR-related, and doesn\u2019t quite align with IT. I need to classify this ticket under a single category, likely leaning towards \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Finally, I'll format my response as a JSON-like category object.**Choosing the category**\n\nThe category for the IT ticket should align with allowed values, and \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best. The request explicitly mentions \"change project code,\" confirming its relevance. I\u2019ll respond with a single JSON object to keep it straightforward and clear. My response will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll double-check to ensure the JSON format is valid, as the instruction suggests that they only want the category. Let's go ahead and provide that!"
