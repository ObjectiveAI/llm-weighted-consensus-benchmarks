It seems like it could be under either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since resetting a password is primarily an access issue, I think \"Access\" might be the best fit. However, if it's about granting privileges to those users in their roles, then \"Administrative rights\" could also work. I'll contemplate which fits best!**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe user's request says, \"reset password active directory please,\" and it's a bit jumbled. I think they want to reset passwords for two users in Active Directory related to a production application engineer. Therefore, this ticket seems like an access issue. I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" The system needs a valid JSON response, so I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It looks good, and I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra text \u2014 just the JSON format!"
