There\u2019s no \u201cNetworking\u201d or \u201cSoftware\u201d category here. Although \"Administrative Rights\" could apply if it were about permissions, it\u2019s not in this case. Since the user asked for assistance with changes, I\u2019ll go with \u201cInternal Project\u201d as it aligns best with the task at hand.**Defining response format**\n\nI see that I need to respond with a JSON object that includes a category field. The valid options are listed, and I believe \"Internal Project\" fits best for this context. While \"Miscellaneous\" could be a possibility, it doesn't really capture the essence as effectively. I'll craft my response succinctly and just provide the JSON format without any extra text. Here goes: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
