There are mentions of costs and technical requirements, which suggest it relates to hardware and resource allocation. Since the emphasis on database storage and deployment is quite clear, I'd categorize it as \u201cStorage.\u201d**Categorizing IT Operations**\n\nThis ticket is related to IT operations, and I\u2019m weighing the categories, which might be \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It revolves around deploying environments, database storage, resources like CPU cores, disk layouts, and clusters. The focus on storage resources suggests that \"Storage\" is the best fit, though there\u2019s also an aspect of internal project. Given the details, I'll categorize it as \"Storage.\" \n\nHere\u2019s the required JSON response: \n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}**Producing JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nThe instruction is to categorize this IT ticket, and I need to provide the chosen category in a specific format. Given previous tasks, I\u2019ll use a simple JSON format for the category. The available categories are outlined in the schema, but what they really want is the category value.\n\nTo be safe and precise, I\u2019ll produce the JSON object with the category property. Here\u2019s the response:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
