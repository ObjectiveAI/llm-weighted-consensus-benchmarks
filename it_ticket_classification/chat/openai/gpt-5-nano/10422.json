But \"Administrative rights\" might also apply if it's about admin rights. The \"annual leave notice\" ties to HR, yet in this context, it may lean more IT-specific. It\u2019s a bit tricky!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe text mentions \"annual leave notice,\" which typically fits in HR issues, but since this is an IT ticket, I'm considering it needs a different classification. Phrases like \"code view\" and \"update codes\" suggest it's more about access rights. The repeated references to \"code view\" imply it's about granting access, likely to a repository or tool. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply, it\u2019s not explicitly mentioned. So, I think I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Access.\"**Outputting JSON Category**\n\nI want to make sure I\u2019m correctly categorizing this IT ticket using the provided categories. \"Access\" definitely seems like the most fitting choice. Now, I need to respond with a JSON object that reflects this classification, adhering to the schema. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and provide exactly: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra content, as the system will just parse this JSON. Let\u2019s go with that!"
