The ticket text seems to be about adding a new location on a platform, possibly related to project management, and mentions \"create course language.\" \n\nI'm considering categorizing it under \"Administrative rights\" due to the addition of a location, or \"Internal Project\" if it's about an internal system. The user has asked for this classification, so I'll prepare a JSON-like output with the category field.**Classifying the ticket**\n\nI need to format the output as a JSON object with a \"category\" property aligned with the allowed categories. The user\u2019s request involves adding a new location on a platform. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem to relate to hardware, HR, or access, although granting access might play a role. Since this appears to modify the platform, it could be categorized as an \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" if admin access is needed. I'll finalize my category choice based on these considerations.**Determining the category**\n\nSince the request involves modifying the platform and adding a new location, I'll categorize it as an \"Internal Project.\" Alternatively, it could be \"Administrative rights\" if it requires elevated access, but the text doesn't specify that.\n\nIt seems to fit better as a feature request for the platform. The phrase \"create course language\" could suggest multi-language support, still relating to internal changes. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll go with the JSON object output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll make sure this is clearly stated, with no extra text."
