Each category likely addresses a specific need, so it\u2019s important to analyze the ticket details carefully. I need to ensure I select the most appropriate category to facilitate a quick resolution. Let's think through the ticket's content and decide which category it best fits into!**Analyzing User Input for Reference Issues**\n\nI see a long, messy input that seems to be about a user having trouble logging into a referral platform. They mention issues with the referral process and want help to resolve it, particularly to make things less tedious. It looks like this input is related to HR or recruitment, focusing on referrals and technical guidance for accessing positions. I need to extract the key concerns and respond effectively to assist them in resolving their issues!**Categorizing Login Issues**\n\nThe user is trying to resolve a login issue related to a referral platform. They mention needing technical support and refer to instructions on how to access certain parts of the platform. I\u2019m considering categorizing this as \"HR Support\" since it involves human resources, but it also fits under \"Access\" due to the login aspect. Given the prominent login issue, \"Access\" seems to be the most appropriate category for this ticket. Let's classify it accordingly!**Finalizing Ticket Categorization**\n\nThe user is asking for help solving a login issue related to a referral platform, which definitely falls under \"Access.\" While \"HR Support\" could apply since it involves recruitment, the main concern here is about system access. I\u2019ll categorize the ticket as \"Access\" since that aligns best with the login problem. Now, I need to output a JSON object to clearly define this categorization. I must ensure it matches the required format. Let's do that!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
