There\u2019s a messy security issue mentioned that relates to access to sensitive documents. I should read the text carefully to determine the right category. The text talks about security, access to documents containing sensitive information, and the need for confidentiality. This sounds like an Access or Administrative rights issue.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on key points about access control and the storage of confidential documents. This seems relevant to categories like Access, Storage, or Administrative rights. The content emphasizes who can access these documents and safety regarding their storage. I think \"Access\" fits best since it specifically addresses who can access the documents, but \"Storage\" could also work because of the emphasis on safe storage. Additionally, it touches on permissions related to document ownership, suggesting \"Administrative rights\" could be an option too.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the provided categories for this IT ticket. \"Administrative rights\" might work for requests on user permissions, but the user is a clearing analyst addressing a security issue. It revolves around who can download documents and access specific sections. \n\nI think \u201cAccess\u201d is the best fit since it emphasizes access control and restrictions. \u201cStorage\u201d could apply too, but I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" due to the focus on who can access sensitive documents. I should summarize my recommendation with a justification to support my choice.**Formatting the output**\n\nI need to output the category in the required JSON format, which includes a category object with a \"category\" property set to the string enum. In this case, it should be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI should be careful not to add any unnecessary formatting or extra text beyond what\u2019s needed for this instruction. It's straightforward: just provide the category JSON as specified. The emphasis is clear\u2014keeping it simple and direct."
