I think the best fit could be \"Purchase\" since it relates to reimbursements, but \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" might also apply\u2014though \"Access\" feels less relevant unless it specifically mentions system access.**Mapping categories for IT ticket**\n\nI'm mapping the categories for the IT ticket. \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" aren't relevant here. \"Access\" could apply if it involved Oracle access, but there's no mention of login details. \"Administrative rights\" might fit since they're approving their own expense report, but it\u2019s not clearly about rights. \"Storage\" is out too. The \"Purchase\" category is the best fit because expense reports relate to purchasing. So, I'll categorize it as \"Purchase\" and format it as a JSON object.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
