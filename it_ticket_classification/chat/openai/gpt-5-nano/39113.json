Looking at the predefined categories\u2014like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, and others\u2014this seems to fit under \"Access\" since it's related to email security. However, \"Miscellaneous\" could be appropriate too, given the situation. It\u2019s a bit tricky since there isn\u2019t a category specifically for security or email issues!**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nI think the best category for this IT ticket is \"Access\" since it involves blocking an email address, which relates to access control. The instructions are clear that I need to provide this in a JSON format, so I\u2019ll respond with a simple object reflecting that: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I should keep it concise and ensure no extra text is added. If there\u2019s any ambiguity, asking clarifying questions could be helpful, but here it feels straightforward!"
