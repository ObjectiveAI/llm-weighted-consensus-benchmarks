It seems they are having access issues with a system or service referred to as \"eel com.\" Since they\u2019re asking for help accessing it, the category is likely \"Access.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could also fit since it might pertain to rights, it's more about general access. Therefore, I'll go ahead and assign it to the \"Access\" category.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI need to provide the output in JSON format according to the specified schema. The user wants me to categorize the IT ticket, which fits into \"Access,\" so I should return a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra commentary or formatting, just the clean JSON, as requested. Validity is key, so I'll ensure the structure matches. Overall, keeping it straightforward like that is the best approach!"
