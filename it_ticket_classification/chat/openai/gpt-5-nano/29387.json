I\u2019ll classify it under one of the allowed categories, possibly \"Access\" or \"Internal Project.\" The output should be a JSON object. I know the response format requires me to use the correct structure, so I need to ensure my output aligns with what's expected.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm figuring out the best category for this ticket, which seems to be about requesting Oracle access, specifically mentioning \"fixed assets.\" The use of \"PM\" might refer to permissions or People Management, but it\u2019s definitely about accessing Oracle. Since it doesn\u2019t fit into categories like hardware, storage, or HR, I believe it falls under the \"Access\" category. Although \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, they\u2019ve clearly requested access, making \"Access\" the most fitting choice.**Classifying the ticket**\n\nThis ticket is a bit ambiguous, but it seems clear that it\u2019s about obtaining access to Oracle. I think \"Access\" is the best classification because \"manage access\" aligns with that category, rather than \"Administrative rights.\" While both could fit, the phrase \"oracle access\" and \"pm\" hint at Oracle Procurement Management or Project Management. For safety, I\u2019ll stick with \"Access.\" \n\nSo, I need to respond with the correct JSON format: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nI\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text, just the JSON object."
