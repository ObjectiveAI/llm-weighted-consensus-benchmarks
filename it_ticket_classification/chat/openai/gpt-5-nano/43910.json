The user provided a messy text that likely contains IT ticket content, mentioning Oracle and HR processes. It talks about removing direct reports, weekly submissions, and maternity leave. Given all these HR-related elements, the \"HR Support\" category seems to fit best. However, I also need to consider if \"Administrative rights\" could apply here.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThis IT ticket mentions \"remove from Oracle,\" indicating it might involve updating the Oracle HR system. It seems to be related to employees, leave, maternity, and direct reports, confirming its HR nature. The best fit for categorization is \"HR Support,\" as it's about HR processes and submitting weekly updates for approval. I need to format my response as a JSON object according to the guidelines provided, so I\u2019ll output it simply as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Finalizing category output**\n\nI see that the category is \"HR Support,\" which has a space in it. I need to make sure that when I output this, there's no extra whitespace to keep it neat and correct. So, my focus is on getting that exactly right. After confirming everything is in order, I\u2019ll produce the output as it is, ensuring it looks just right! Here\u2019s the final answer without any extra fuss."
