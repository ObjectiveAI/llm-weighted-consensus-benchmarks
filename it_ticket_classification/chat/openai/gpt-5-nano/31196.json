The ticket mentions \"outlet\" and \"plugging second monitor,\" which suggests a hardware issue. Since it's about connecting a second monitor, it looks like it falls under the \"Hardware\" category. The repetition of \"outlet\" hints at a possible power outlet or electrical issue. I'll finalize the category as \"Hardware\" and prepare the JSON object to reflect that.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm interpreting the ticket as needing hardware support to plug in a second monitor. The other phrases seem irrelevant for categorization, so I\u2019ll focus on that primary issue. Based on the context, the category is clearly \"Hardware.\" Now, I need to construct the JSON object according to the system's requirements. Following the template, I\u2019ll respond with the specific classification:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"} \n\nThis matches what is needed without any extra commentary!**Confirming category output**\n\nI'm finalizing the output as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} because the mention of \"second monitor\" clearly points to a hardware issue. I did briefly consider if it could fit under \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but those don't align with the problem at hand. It seems straightforward, so I\u2019ll stick with the hardware classification. I\u2019m ready to deliver that JSON output confidently!"
