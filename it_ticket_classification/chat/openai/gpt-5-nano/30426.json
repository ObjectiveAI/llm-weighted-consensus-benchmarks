The text seems focused on hardware memory (RAM) that needs installation, with mentions of purchase orders and receipts. This looks like a request for installation and allocation, which makes me think the most fitting category is \"Hardware,\" since it pertains to physical memory modules. Alternatively, \"Purchase\" could work since they mention purchase orders, but \"Hardware\" feels like the best fit.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s request seems focused on allocating IT resources, specifically memory installation following a purchase. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this as \"Hardware\" since it directly involves hardware installation. Although \"Purchase\" could apply because they mention the procurement process and mention receipts, the main action is about physically installing the memory. I don\u2019t think categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Storage\" fit well here. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate category.**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nThe main action in the ticket is about installing memory after purchase. It seems the user is requesting this installation via an administrator, mentioning \"administrator phone\" as well. Since they\u2019re asking for memory allocation, I\u2019m torn between categorizing as \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" However, because the focus is on installation, which falls under hardware responsibilities, I\u2019ll opt for \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll output a JSON-like object containing the category as a single string."
