The message is about reviewing annual leave requests, which hints at it being HR-related. I should lean towards \"HR Support\" since it primarily deals with leave management rather than any rights access. Also, there's a mention of an internal system for requests, which solidifies my choice. I'll format this output as a JSON-like object specifying the category.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m assessing the best category for an IT ticket, considering options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Access.\" However, these don\u2019t quite fit since the issue is reviewing annual leave requests within an HR system. The most appropriate category is \"HR Support,\" as it relates directly to human resources processes. Therefore, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the category specified. It will be {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} to ensure clarity."
