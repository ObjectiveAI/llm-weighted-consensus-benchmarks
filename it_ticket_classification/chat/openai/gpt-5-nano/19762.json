However, I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" since it's somewhat broad and captures the software issue.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize a ticket, and I\u2019m thinking \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d could be the best fit. I considered \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d if the missing button were about permissions, but that doesn't seem applicable here. \u201cAccess\u201d might work if it relates to submission rights, but there\u2019s no mention of that. \u201cInternal Project\u201d could apply due to the engineering context, but ultimately, the content seems more aligned with a generic software bug, so I think \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d works best.**Parsing the IT ticket**\n\nI need to make sense of the input that mentions a \"missing submit button.\" It seems like a jumbled string, but it's clear this is about some tool-related issue. Since \"Engineering\" isn't a separate category, I wonder if I can use \"Internal Project\" for this engineering-related task. The system needs me to format my response as a JSON object. So, I\u2019ll categorize it and output the chosen category in the specified format.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
