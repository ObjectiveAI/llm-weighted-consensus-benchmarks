The text mentions a \"new purchase PO,\" installation of a monitor, and references to mandatory receipts. This seems to fit best under the \"Purchase\" category since it primarily discusses purchasing and purchase orders. However, since it also concerns installing hardware, I could also consider \"Hardware\" as an option. Given the emphasis on the purchase order, \"Purchase\" feels like the most appropriate category for this ticket.**Finalizing Purchase Category**\n\nThe category that fits is \"Purchase,\" as the ticket focuses on a new purchase order. I\u2019m also considering if \"Hardware\" could apply since there\u2019s a request to log installation. However, the core content leans more towards purchasing and receipts, making \"Purchase\" the most appropriate choice. I need to respond with a JSON object specifying this category, following the required format. So, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Let\u2019s get this finalized!"
