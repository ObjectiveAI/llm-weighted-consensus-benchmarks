It could also relate to \"Storage\" if \"SD area\" refers to storage. Overall, I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" being the right category.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nThere are phrases like \"sd area isolated\" and \"red sockets functional\" that make it seem like this isn't simply about SD cards. Although \"sd\" might hint at \"storage\" or \"SAN disk,\" I'll focus more on the context. Given the outage and references to hardware infrastructure, I think the best match for categorization is \"Hardware.\" \n\nI'll format my response as a JSON object, sticking to the schema provided. The final output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
