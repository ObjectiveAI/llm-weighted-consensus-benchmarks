It mentions a \"new project PM\" and seems to involve task assignment for colleagues, suggesting it might relate to project management. I'm considering categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, it could fit into \"Miscellaneous\" as well. I'd lean toward \"Internal Project\" because it's focused on a project and task assignment. Let's decide!**Choosing IT Ticket Categories**\n\nI need to find the best category for the IT ticket based on the user's phrase. The mention of \"new project\" and \"assignment of tasks\" relates to project management tools. \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they're adjusting permissions, while \"Access\" might be for granting project access. However, it seems like this request focuses on project management settings. Given that, the \"Internal Project\" category is likely the best fit since it's about setting up a new project where colleagues can assign tasks to themselves.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this ticket based on the details provided. While \"Administrative rights\" might work if they need permissions to assign tasks, there\u2019s no direct mention of that. Since it talks about colleagues assigning themselves different tasks, it hints at needing some level of access control. However, the safest choice to fit this request is likely \"Internal Project,\" which covers setting up new projects. I\u2019ll note it as a request to set up a new project with permissions for self-assignment."
