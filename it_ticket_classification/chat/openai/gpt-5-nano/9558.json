So, I\u2019ll reply with the required format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. No extra text is necessary, just the category.**Providing category response**\n\nThe user wants to categorize, so I should respond with a JSON object including a category field, following the specified format. The requirements indicate that I should select one of the available categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. Given that the category is likely \"Purchase,\" I\u2019ll format my response succinctly as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll ensure there's no extra commentary, just the required output."
