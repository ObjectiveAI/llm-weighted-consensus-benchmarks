It seems the main concern revolves around access rights due to problems with logging in and password issues. Although it could fit into \"HR Support\" concerning time card approval, it feels more accurate to label it as \"Access\" given the focus on logging in.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user mentions issues with time cards for December and a recent password change, hinting at a login problem. They\u2019ve asked for urgent help, which confirms this is an access issue. Therefore, I need to categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" The system instructions tell me to reply with the category in a JSON format. I\u2019ll ensure it\u2019s properly formatted, so my response will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nI won't add any extra commentary beyond that!"
