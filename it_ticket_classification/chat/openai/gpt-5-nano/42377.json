It seems they're unable to contact the server, which points to a potential network or authentication issue. Given the details, this could fit into \"Hardware\" for the new device or \"Access\" due to authentication problems. However, \"Access\" seems more appropriate, since the user can't connect to the server due to authentication concerns.**Deciding on category for IT ticket**\n\nI notice the category options are quite broad, so I need to pick the most fitting one. The user's ticket mentions a \"new device network error,\" and they want to address connectivity issues for a device in the SAN meeting room. The \"SAN\" likely refers to Storage Area Network, which makes me think the ticket relates to storage issues. Given these clues, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket under \"Storage,\" as it seems to fit the context perfectly.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize this ticket under \"Hardware\" since it mentions a new device network error. However, given the explicit reference to SAN, which stands for Storage Area Network, it seems \"Storage\" is the most suitable category. I\u2019ll respond with a concise JSON object indicating this category as \"Storage.\" The output will be structured with the key and property in a clear format. Here\u2019s what I'll provide:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
