The ticket mentions problems accessing a documents folder, as well as some related correspondence. I\u2019m thinking the best fit for this ticket would be the \"Access\" category since it\u2019s primarily about access issues. While it could also fit under \"Storage,\" \"Access\" seems like a more direct choice.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe ticket includes mentions of being \"fully approved\" and needing an update on a contract, but the main issue is clearly about \"VA documents location not accessible.\" This leads me to categorize it as \"Access.\" I need to ensure the format is correct according to the schema provided\u2014specifically, delivering the JSON object. I'll output it simply as `{\"category\":\"Access\"}` confirming that the access issue to a directory is what really matters here."
