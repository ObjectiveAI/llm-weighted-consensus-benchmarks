The ticket describes a problem but is a bit unclear in parts. I\u2019ll need to choose from allowed categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It seems to be related to software, so possibly \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" would be appropriate here.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the allowed categories: \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" The ticket mentions \"cells editable\" and \"forecast,\" likely in the context of a spreadsheet or project management tool. Given that it's about a project forecast, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit. However, it could also be \"Miscellaneous\" if there's ambiguity. I\u2019ll need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category, so I\u2019ll say: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This seems clear!**Providing the category only**\n\nI realize the user has asked me to categorize, so I should keep it straightforward and avoid any extra information. The tool specifically needs the category and nothing more. I\u2019ll ensure I output just the category for clarity and conciseness. It\u2019s all about getting straight to the point here. Let\u2019s make sure the response is clean and focused!"
