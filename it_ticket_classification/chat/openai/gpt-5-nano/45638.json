It\u2019s important to select the right category to ensure it gets addressed efficiently. I'll take a moment to analyze the details of the ticket to make the best choice, as putting it in the wrong category could delay resolution. Let's decide carefully!**Identifying ticket category**\n\nI have a long text from an IT ticket mentioning difficulties logging into Snow. Based on the content, it's clear this falls under the \"Access\" category since it's focused on issues related to logging in. I'll specify that it's about access issues, likely linking to a software system. Choosing the right category is essential for efficient handling, so I'll confirm this categorization to ensure it gets directed to the right team.**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize this IT ticket as \"Access\" since it\u2019s about a login issue. The required response is to provide the category in a JSON format according to the specified schema. \n\nThe correct structure should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra text \u2014 just the JSON object. It's essential to adhere strictly to the expected format, so I\u2019ll deliver that cleanly. Here it goes: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
