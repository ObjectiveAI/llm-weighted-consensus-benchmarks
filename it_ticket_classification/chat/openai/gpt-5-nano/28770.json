Given that context, I think the best category for this ticket would be \"Access.\" I\u2019ll prepare the JSON output accordingly!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing this ticket, which mentions \"shared mailbox queue\" and seems to relate to access or permissions. The most appropriate categories are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the focus on accessing a queue and the need to add someone due to annual leave, \"Access\" fits best. Although \"Administrative rights\" could apply, it's mainly about queue access. I\u2019ll prepare the JSON response with the category set to \"Access\" as instructed!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
