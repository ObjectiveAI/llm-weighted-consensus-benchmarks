Let's sort through the text to accurately assign it to the right category!**Interpreting expense issues**\n\nThe user is explaining problems with their expense submission, particularly regarding meal documentation. They mention a last meal with a client that usually requires confirmation but are experiencing access issues since the middle of last week. They've had people attempting to resolve this but need further confirmation on the process. It seems this is largely about access issues and possibly the approval of expenses related to those meals. I want to make sure I address this correctly!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nBased on the user's description, it seems the main IT ticket category should be \"Access\" due to their mention of access issues since the middle of last week. I need to categorize it as such and return a JSON object in the required format. So, I\u2019ll create a response formatted as: {\"category\": \"Access\"} without any extra content. It\u2019s important to ensure that the JSON is valid and adheres strictly to the guidelines!"
