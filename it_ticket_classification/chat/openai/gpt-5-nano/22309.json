The ticket mentions a \"change of PM role,\" which likely refers to a project manager position, but it\u2019s a bit ambiguous. It seems they're requesting help regarding these changes. Based on the context, it could relate to \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project,\" especially since it hints that someone else has taken over the role. I\u2019ll need to analyze it further to choose the right category.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket using specific options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. The mention of a change in the PM (project manager) role suggests it could fall under \"Internal Project,\" as it relates to project management. There\u2019s also a possibility it ties into \"Administrative rights\" if new permissions are needed. Since the details are a bit unclear, I should either propose multiple categories or decide on one based on my best guess, perhaps \"Internal Project.\"**Assessing ticket category**\n\nIf someone is changing the PM role, it might relate to permissions in a project management system like Jira. This suggests it could fall under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" due to the nature of role changes. The repeated phrase about changing the PM role indicates they need help, likely implying they'll need admin rights. While \"Internal Project\" might fit since it's project-related, the focus is on changing roles, leaning towards \"Administrative rights\" for the categorization. I\u2019ll output this as a JSON object containing the selected category.{\"category\":\"administrative rights\"}"
