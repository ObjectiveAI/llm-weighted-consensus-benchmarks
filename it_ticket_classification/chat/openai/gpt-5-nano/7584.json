While \"Administrative rights\" is relevant as a subtopic of access control, the user clearly asks to \"gain board view detail,\" which leans more towards direct access. They also mention reviewing, closing, and adding tasks, indicating it's project-related but centered on access. Given this, I'll assign the ticket to the \"Access\" category, as that's the main request.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
