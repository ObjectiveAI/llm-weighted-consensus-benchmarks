The ticket is about investigating device performance and involves actions like approving requisitions and logging performance issues. It requires details on the device, pricing, and specifications for a replacement, especially since the current model is older and doesn\u2019t meet requirements anymore. Overall, it clearly falls under the \"Hardware\" category due to the focus on device performance and requisition approval.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm deciding whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Purchase,\" \"Hardware,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket discusses investigating device performance and approving a requisition for a replacement hardware asset. It includes terms like \"replacement,\" \"specification,\" and \"older than years.\" Given that it focuses on approving a purchase, \"Purchase\" seems to be the most fitting category. It could also fall under \"Hardware\" due to the performance aspect, but since it explicitly mentions requisition approval, I\u2019ll choose \"Purchase.\"{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
