Alternatively, \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they're requesting administrative privileges. The mention of \"pm\" suggests it relates to scheduling as well. This is a bit tricky, but I think \"Access\" seems right!**Selecting a category for the IT ticket**\n\nThe categories are fairly broad, so I need to find the best fit for the user's request. The message indicates a consultant is requesting to add new users, likely on Tuesday afternoon. This suggests it relates to user access or possibly administrative rights. Since they mention \"adding users,\" I\u2019m inclined to categorize it as \"Access.\" It makes sense to provide a JSON object with the category set to \"Access,\" matching the expected schema. Let's keep it clear and aligned!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
