The provided categories include various options, but given the context, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit. I\u2019ll format my response in the required JSON object, noting that it needs to align with the provided schema.**Providing JSON response**\n\nI need to submit a JSON snippet with the selected category. Based on past tasks, the right format is just to list the category value. So I\u2019ll provide: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. \n\nI want to make sure it perfectly follows the schema without any extra explanation. Keeping it simple and straightforward is the goal here. So, I\u2019m ready to deliver this clean JSON object!"
