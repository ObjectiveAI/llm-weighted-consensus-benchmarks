It seems to be a software problem since the user can't select anything after the data is loaded. The ticket mentions \"oracle com,\" suggesting it's connected to Oracle Commerce. This doesn't relate to hardware, storage, purchasing, HR, or access issues. So, I'm leaning towards categorizing it as a technical issue within the \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" category.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering categorizing this IT ticket as \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Internal Project.\" It seems to relate to a bug in a software module since the user mentions issues with the application, specifically about not being able to select items after loading task details. There\u2019s no reference to access rights or permissions, making it more of a software issue. Since there's no specific \"Software\" category, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the best choice. I'll create a JSON object with {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
