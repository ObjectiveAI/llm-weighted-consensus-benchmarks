They've mentioned access issues related to booking rooms, and it seems they\u2019re experiencing a busy status that\u2019s affecting their work. The wording is a bit garbled, but it looks like they need help with access to a booking system. I think the best category for this ticket would be \"Access\" since it\u2019s focused on access problems related to reservation systems.**Returning JSON category**\n\nLooks like I should categorize this IT ticket as \"Access,\" since the request is about getting access to booking rooms. I might have considered \"Administrative rights\" if they were asking to grant permissions, but the focus is clearly on access. The required output format is a JSON object, so I need to format my response according to that schema. Ultimately, my response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That seems straightforward!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
