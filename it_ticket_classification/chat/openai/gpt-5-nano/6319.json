It seems to concern setting up a secondary approver in Oracle, focusing on approval workflows and access permissions. They\u2019re discussing roles, thresholds, and the overall flow of approvals. Since it involves managing who has access and control over the approval process, I think it aligns most with \"Administrative rights.\" However, \u201cAccess\u201d might also be relevant.

This seems to fit under \"Administrative rights\" since they will need privileges to change approval settings. While \"Access\" might be considered for login issues, this situation isn't about that; it's focused on the approval process. I think \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit.
