The categories we have are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The unstructured text seems to revolve around issues with sending emails and notifications, mention of restrictions, and some issues regarding planned works and permissions. This might fit best under Access or Administrative rights due to the permissions context and sending issues.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions issues like \"permissions,\" \"notification did not reach,\" and \"granted permission.\" It seems focused on problems with sending notifications and potential \"email sending restrictions\" or \"mailing lists.\" I think it could fit in the \"Access\" category since it deals with sending messages to recipients and access restrictions. However, the \"Administrative rights\" category is also relevant for permissions. Overall, it relates to failed notifications for planned works, so I need to decide between \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\".**Analyzing ticket content**\n\nAlright, let\u2019s break this down. The message mentions issues with sending notifications, specifically citing \"restrictions set for sending.\" This seems to relate to problems with \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" because it's about the ability to send messages. The whole text is a bit messy, but its focus on sending restrictions suggests it should fit into the Access category. I need to ensure I capture the main issue accurately while categorizing it effectively.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI usually think of \"Administrative rights\" as related to permissions for tasks on systems. The \"Access\" category would cover issues like accessing systems, email accounts, or sending capabilities. Since this ticket is about sending restrictions and permissions, I could categorize it as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The content suggests escalation and investigation into these sending restrictions, implying a need for permissions to send emails. Given the phrase \"granted permission,\" I'd lean towards \"Administrative rights\" as the more fitting choice.**Deciding on the category**\n\nThe user is asking if restrictions exist and if permissions can be granted, which suggests \"Administrative rights\" is the right category. There\u2019s also a mention of planned works notification, but that doesn\u2019t seem to fit here. I need to respond with a categorized JSON object for the IT ticket. The text mentions \"restrictions set for sending,\" indicating it\u2019s more about the ability to send messages, so \"Access\" could apply too. However, since it\u2019s directly related to permissions, I'll go with \"Administrative rights.\" Thus, I\u2019ll output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
