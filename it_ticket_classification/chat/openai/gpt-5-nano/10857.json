The user message about the ticket seems a bit garbled, but it mentions a \"new starter\" and \"Oracle.\" This suggests it could relate to onboarding. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" for their Oracle system, but \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" might also fit. HR Support doesn\u2019t seem to be the main focus.**Determining the category**\n\nI think the best category for this IT ticket is \"Access,\" as the new starter needs access to the Oracle system. The phrase \"log matter tracking purposes\" implies they want to register the ticket. The mention of \"four forms\" hints at attachments which could relate to access requests. Although \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant, the focus on provisioning a new user account suggests \"Access\" is the most fitting. I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object with this category.{\"category\": \"Access\"}"
