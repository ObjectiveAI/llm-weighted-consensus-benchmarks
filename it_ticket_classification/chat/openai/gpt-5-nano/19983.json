They mentioned requesting new headphones, which sounds like it falls under a hardware issue. It also suggests a purchase because they're asking to buy new equipment. On top of that, there's a mention of problems with the old headphones. So, I'm thinking this ticket could be categorized either as \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase,\" but given the clear request to buy new ones, \"Purchase\" seems most fitting.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI need to determine the best category for the IT ticket requesting new headphones. It\u2019s pretty clear this fits under \"Purchase\" since there's a procurement request involved. Although there's a mention of \"Software developer,\" that's not really relevant to the categorization. So, I'll stick with \"Purchase\" as the category. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object to meet the requirements. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
