I should decide which category fits best based on this context.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe user mentions \"approver\" and \"starting December,\" likely indicating their role as an architect. It seems they want to change the approver related to some permission or approval workflow starting in December. I'm considering whether to categorize this as \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" The ticket suggests it's more about modifying access or an approval chain rather than just admin privileges. Since \"Access\" is more general and fits better, I\u2019ll classify it under that category.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nIt looks like I need to format my response as a JSON-like object with a category string from the allowed values. The instruction is clear: \"Categorize this IT Ticket.\" I must include a category field, and based on the details, I'll go with {\"category\":\"Access\"} since it aligns with changing approvers and permissions but isn\u2019t specifically about admin rights. I\u2019ll make sure to keep my response concise and limited to just showing the JSON. So here we go: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
