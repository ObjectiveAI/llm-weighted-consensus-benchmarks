It seems appropriate to classify it like this due to the communication about notifying users. I'll create a JSON object with \"category\": \"Internal Project\" to ensure clarity. The schema defines the requirement, so I'll stick to this format. There's also a slight chance for \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Internal Project\" feels more fitting based on the ticket context.**Deciding on the category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for this issue, especially since it\u2019s about the dashboard being unavailable. It could have been \"Access,\" but it\u2019s not a login issue. \"Internal Project\" or \"Maintenance\" could work, but those aren't available categories. Therefore, I'll go with \"Internal Project\" for clarity. I\u2019ll format my final response as JSON to ensure it's structured correctly. Let's finalize that and make sure it aligns with the requirements!"
