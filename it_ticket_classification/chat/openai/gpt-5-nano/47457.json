                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket, but the user\u2019s message seems a bit garbled. It mentions \u201ctime icon missing\u201d and \u201cOracle,\u201d which likely indicate an issue related to a missing time icon. The phrase \u201chave tried submit for week\u201d suggests they\u2019ve attempted to submit something but are encountering a problem. I\u2019ll infer that this is related to missing icons in Oracle or issues with a web protocol. I think the most fitting category is \"Miscellaneous.\"**Categorizing IT ticket again**\n\nI think \u201ctime icon missing\u201d likely refers to a calendar or time icon issue in Oracle EBS. The categories available are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Since the issue is unclear, it probably fits best under \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d The user asked for a category, so I should suggest that. While it could be related to an internal project, \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d seems more appropriate for a general icon problem. So I\u2019ll respond with: Category: Miscellaneous.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket refers to a missing time icon in Oracle, along with some unclear details about web icons and submission issues. Since the user asked for a category, I\u2019ll suggest \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d because it\u2019s not directly related to hardware, access rights, or other specific issues\u2014this seems like a UI or feature problem. I could also ask clarifying questions like which system the icon is missing from, the exact icon name, and whether it affects multiple users, but I should keep it simple for now. So, I'll respond: Category: Miscellaneous.**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to format my response as a JSON object because the prompt specifies that. The required output should look like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. While it might be helpful to provide reasoning, the instruction clearly states to respond with only the JSON object containing the category. I also considered whether \u201cInternal Project\u201d could fit, but it seems this issue is more of a UI problem in Oracle. So, I\u2019ll stick with: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Delivering the response**\n\nIf I want to be extra helpful, I can suggest a follow-up for clarity, but since the guidelines specify that I should only provide the JSON format, I\u2019ll keep it concise. The instruction is clear that I should stick to the required format, so I\u2019ll focus on delivering the response with the proper category in JSON format. I\u2019ll go ahead and provide the necessary information without any extra commentary."
