It appears the ticket involves accessing goods or services at reception.**Analyzing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm interpreting that \"Oracle\" likely refers to Oracle ERP, and the phrase \"wants goods view accept decline requests\" probably relates to purchasing tasks, like handling purchase orders. This could fit into \"Access\" since they want to access a system, or \"Purchase\" if it specifically deals with procurement. \"Accept decline requests\" hints at the need to approve requests, aligning with \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context, the category seems to lean toward \"Access\" or possibly \"Internal Project\" if it's project-related.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI think without additional context, the best category for this IT ticket would be \"Access,\" since it involves gaining access to the Oracle Goods view and handling requests for goods. If the user needs administrative rights to manage those requests, \"Administrative rights\" could also fit. Given the prompt, I should respond in JSON format. It looks like I would output something like {\"category\":\"Access\"} as it aligns with the user's intention to access and manage requests in Oracle.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
