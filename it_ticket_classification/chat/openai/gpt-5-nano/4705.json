It mentions \"leaver notification,\" which seems HR-related, along with details about resignation and job title. This strongly suggests it falls under HR support, but it also might involve IT support since it talks about replacing the notification. The mention of \"mailbox receive messages\" indicates it could be relevant to IT. So, I think \u201cHR Support\u201d is likely the best fit for this ticket.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s message talks about reviewing a position that needs to be posted, suggesting that this ticket is relevant to HR Support. While there's an aspect of access management related to de-provisioning for leavers, the main focus is on leaver notifications and vacancies, which leans more towards HR. Given the context, I think categorizing this ticket as \"HR Support\" is the best fit. I'll prepare a JSON object with that category for clarity.**Finalizing category JSON**\n\nThe prompt indicates that I need to respond with a JSON object that includes the category field. Since we've determined that \"HR Support\" is the correct category, I'll format my response as: \n\n{\"category\": \"HR Support\"}\n\nIt's clear that I shouldn't add any additional text beyond the JSON. I must ensure the string is correctly formatted with quotes. So, I'm ready to finalize this response!"
