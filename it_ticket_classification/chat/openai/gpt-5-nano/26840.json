The user provided a messy ticket relating to a new starter in Atlanta needing a PC and a mobile phone. It seems to be about onboarding and provisioning equipment. I see potential categories like \"Hardware\" for the devices, \"Access\" for accounts, and \"Purchase\" for ordering equipment. Given it's a new starter, \"Hardware\" seems like the best fit.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket, and it mentions ordering a mobile phone and equipment for a new starter. The task seems focused on supplying a PC and mobile phone with onboarding details, like the starter form and office location in Atlanta. I can choose \"Hardware\" for the equipment provisioning or \"Purchase\" for ordering. Importantly, \"HR Support\" is an option too, which fits well since this involves onboarding. Thus, I think it could also qualify under \"HR Support.\"**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering categorizing this IT ticket as \"HR Support\" since it's related to onboarding a new starter and completing necessary forms. However, it also mentions hardware and mobile phone provisioning. The emphasis on \"new starter\" and form completion suggests \"HR Support\" is the best fit. On the other hand, \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware\" could apply for the procurement side since there are mentions of costs and equipment. Ultimately, I lean towards \"HR Support\" for this onboarding context.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
