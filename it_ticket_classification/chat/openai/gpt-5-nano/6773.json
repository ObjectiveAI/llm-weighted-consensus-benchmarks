It looks like it could fall under \"Storage,\" especially since backups relate to storage. It could also fit with \"Administrative rights\" if there's a permissions aspect. However, given that it explicitly discusses backups, I'll go with \"Storage\" as the most fitting category. The response in JSON will be: {\"category\": \"Storage\"}.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to make sure I'm providing the category object in the correct JSON format. The prompt clearly indicates that it should be structured as an object with \"category\" as an enumeration. So, my response will simply be the JSON representation: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. It's important to stick to the format specified in the directive and ensure it's appropriate for the user's request. I'll go ahead and finalize that output now."
