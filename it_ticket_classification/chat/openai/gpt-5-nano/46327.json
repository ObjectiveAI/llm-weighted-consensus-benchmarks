The ticket discusses nominations, approvals, and a line manager blank field, which seems tied to HR processes. I\u2019m considering categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" Since \"HR Support\" is listed as a category and fits the context, I'll likely select that one for categorization.**Interpreting the issue**\n\nThe user has a nomination that they're unable to process, mentioning both previous and current attempts to approve it have failed due to a blank field under the line manager. They can view the approval tab but need help. I think this points to an issue with the HR system that's blocking nomination approvals because of the blank field. It\u2019s likely best categorized as \"HR Support,\" although \"Administrative Rights\" could apply if it's related to permissions.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI think the best category for this IT ticket is \"HR Support\" because it deals with HR processes related to nominations. The user has requested that I categorize the ticket, and it\u2019s important to make sure the classification is accurate for proper routing. I need to output a JSON object that fits the required schema, ensuring all formatting is correct. I\u2019ll provide just the JSON with \"HR Support\" as the category and nothing extra. Here it is: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
