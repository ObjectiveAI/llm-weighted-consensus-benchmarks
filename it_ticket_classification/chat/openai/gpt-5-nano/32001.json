The provided text looks a bit jumbled but suggests it relates to a wireless mouse installation. The categories I can use are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the content, it seems to fit the \"Hardware\" category best. I should respond with a JSON object indicating this, like: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Parsing IT ticket information**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket details. It mentions a \"wireless mouse\" and asks to \"log installation,\" which suggests it's related to purchasing and setting up this device. There\u2019s a reference to an administrator and some legal terms about liabilities for subsidiaries, but the main task seems to focus on the wireless mouse installation. I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing this as \"Hardware,\" since it's about a device, although \"Purchase\" could also fit. Overall, \"Hardware\" appears to be the best choice.**Providing JSON response**\n\nThe category for this ticket is \"Hardware.\" I need to respond only with the JSON object as per the instructions. It looks like the user expects a specific format, so I'll provide it exactly as required: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nThe content clearly implies a \"purchase order\" and requests installation for the wireless mouse, confirming that \"Hardware\" is the correct category. I won't include any extra text\u2014just the JSON output. Let's go with that!"
