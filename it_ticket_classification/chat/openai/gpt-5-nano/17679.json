This hints at the need for some HR support and possibly hardware assistance. Based on the categories available\u2014like Hardware, HR Support, and Miscellaneous\u2014I think HR Support fits best since it focuses on onboarding and personnel matters. The urgency is clear, and they\u2019re asking for help with hardware that seems critical for someone starting.**Categorizing IT Ticket Again**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the request about the \"new starter form for former employee,\" which mentions hardware needed and seems urgent. It feels like it involves providing hardware, leaning toward the \"Hardware\" category. Even though there are hints of access requirements or administrative rights, the primary focus is on the hardware needed. So, it makes sense to categorize it under \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll respond in the specified JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Formatting the JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with a properly formatted JSON object for the category. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. While I could provide reasoning, the instruction just says to categorize. So, I guess keeping it straightforward without explanation is best. Still, adding a brief line might help clarity, but it's not strictly necessary. Ultimately, I\u2019ll stick to the clear format needed for the response. Alright, I\u2019m ready to do that!"
