They describe some weird behavior when exploring their web portal and mention random issues starting since Monday. \n\nLooking through the predefined categories, this seems to fit best under \"Access,\" since they\u2019re experiencing issues related to their network behavior during browser sessions. I\u2019ll classify this ticket accordingly!**Classifying Network Issue**\n\nThe user is facing a network question tied to changing behavior, mentioning \"change address during the same browser session.\" This might relate to IP address changes and sounds like a network issue. The available categories don't explicitly include \"Network,\" so I need to choose carefully between \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project.\" Given that it\u2019s a general IT issue, I think classifying it as \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit, but \"Access\" could apply if it's about session problems.**Outputting IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to provide a JSON-like object with a category field. Looking at the allowed categories, \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" seem like the best choices. The user's message discusses network behavior that affects access to a web portal, mentioning random changes in address during the same session. Since this relates to access issues and session problems, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" Now, I\u2019ll craft the output accordingly!**Responding with Category Structure**\n\nI need to keep the response concise and provide just the category structure as the user requested, which is to categorize the IT ticket. Since the prompt specifically asks for a JSON object, I'll format it correctly with the category field. The best fit here is \"Access,\" so my response will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nNo additional text or reasoning is necessary, just the proper JSON format. Let's stick to that!"
