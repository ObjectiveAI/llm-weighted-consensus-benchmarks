The ticket mentions details like \"purchase request\" and \"supplier prices.\" I think the most fitting category is \"Purchase,\" as it's specifically about purchasing information. While \"Hardware\" is also relevant, \"Purchase\" more accurately reflects the focus on purchase details. So, I'm leaning towards outputting: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}` as the most appropriate choice for this ticket.**Categorizing IT requests**\n\nIn IT ticket systems, requests for hardware usually fit into the \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware\" categories. The ticket says, \"information purchase request for a laptop,\" which clearly indicates it's about purchasing, including details like prices and suppliers. I think \"Purchase\" is the most appropriate category here. Following the instructions, I'll format the output as a JSON object with the category field, so the response will be: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}` without any extra commentary."
