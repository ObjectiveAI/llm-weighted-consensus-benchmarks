I think the best fit for categorizing this could be \"Internal Project\" if it's about internal software. Other options like \"Miscellaneous\" could work too, but it doesn\u2019t fit in hardware, HR, or access issues. The user mentioned UI bugs related to comments not showing in PAS reports, which reinforces the internal nature of this issue.**Choosing the correct category**\n\nI think the best category here is \"Internal Project\" since it relates to a development issue within internal software. The alternative, \"Miscellaneous,\" is broader and doesn't pinpoint the specific nature of the problem. The issue regarding PAS reports and comments not showing is certainly tied to code behavior. So, my final answer will categorize this IT ticket as \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll also format the response as a JSON-like object reflecting the system's requirements.**Finalizing the JSON output**\n\nIt seems like the format only requires a \"category\" field, so I'll stick to that for the JSON object. Although I initially thought of adding a short justification, the instructions are clear that only the category matters. Therefore, my final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to quote it properly, without any extra text, as the system likely expects a plain output. Let's proceed with that!"
