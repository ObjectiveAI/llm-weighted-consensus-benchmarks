The content mentions a job-related issue with something like Jenkins, Maven job, and Bitbucket repository. It looks like they\u2019re asking for help with configuration details regarding build steps and triggers. I need to determine the best category from the available options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. This really seems to fit under \u201cInternal Project.\u201d**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering options for categorizing the IT ticket. It could fit under \"Internal Project\" since it discusses a CI job, Maven, and a Bitbucket repository. \"Miscellaneous\" might work if it doesn't fit other categories. \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" wouldn't apply here since there are no login or permission issues. Based on the content, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best choice. I also need to format this as a JSON-like object with the specified structure.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
