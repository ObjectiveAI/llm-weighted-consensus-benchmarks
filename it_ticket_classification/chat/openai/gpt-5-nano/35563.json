The user is having trouble logging into Oracle and mentioned issues related to selecting the sign-in option. They checked their browser, cleared cache, and cookies, and hinted at a possible expired Active Directory password. It seems this falls under the \"Access\" category due to the login troubles. While it could relate to \"Administrative rights,\" it doesn't seem to be about password changes. So, I'll classify it as \"Access.\"**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with a valid JSON object categorizing the IT ticket. The appropriate category based on the user's issue is \"Access.\" It's essential to format this correctly, so I'll provide: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to ensure this is valid JSON and not include any additional commentary since the instruction clearly asks for categorization. Even though \"Oracle\" is an enterprise app, it still fits under \"Access,\" so I'll stick with that for my response."
