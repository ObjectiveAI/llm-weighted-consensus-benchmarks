The natural choice might be Administrative rights or Internal Project, as it doesn\u2019t fit well with access or HR. However, there isn't a Scheduling category, so I'm trying to decide what fits best among the available options.**Categorizing a ticket request**\n\nThe user's message seems to be a request to \"add to Tuesday PM,\" which likely pertains to a work task. It might fit into the \"Miscellaneous\" category since the task is unclear. I could also consider \"Administrative rights\" if it's about permissions, but there's no direct mention of that. The use of \"head\" might imply it relates to a supervisor or project leader. Overall, the best approach seems to be selecting \"Miscellaneous\" due to its ambiguity, but \"Administrative rights\" could be valid as well.**Formatting the ticket category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I'll need to provide a response in a JSON-like format. The required output should include a \"category\" field with specific options such as \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Given the unclear nature of the ticket, it seems best to categorize it as \"Miscellaneous.\" I want to ensure my response is concise and strictly conforms to the format, avoiding any additional commentary. Here\u2019s the response: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
