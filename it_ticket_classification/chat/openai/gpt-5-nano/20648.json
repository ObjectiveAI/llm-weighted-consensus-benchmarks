The user mentions removing owners and assignees from notifications and talks about held tickets and release dates. This suggests a request related to access since they want to manage who gets notifications. Thus, I think \"Access\" is the most suitable category for this ticket! I'll make sure to clarify that later.**Evaluating ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket based on the user\u2019s messy text. It could fit into \"Access\" since they\u2019re asking to modify who receives notifications, like owners and assignees. However, it might also relate to \"Administrative rights\" if they intend to change admin privileges. Since both categories overlap, I'll lean towards \"Access\" because the request focuses on notification access rather than administrative tasks. Parsing this text is tricky, but I want to get it right!**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nIn this ticket, the \"Access\" category is relevant for changes regarding permissions and notification settings. The text mentions modifying owners and assignees, which aligns more with user access than administrative rights. Even though it discusses removing notifications, that still falls under access/permissions. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and format my response as a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I think a brief justification would help clarify my choice!**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, and I need to provide the output in a JSON format. I'll respond with just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I noticed they spelled \"snow,\" which I think was meant to be \"ServiceNow,\" but I don't need to include that in my response. Just focusing on delivering the correct categorization is the priority here. Alright, I'm ready!"
