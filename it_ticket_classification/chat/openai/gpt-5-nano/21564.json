It seems to involve folder accessibility and restrictions, which points towards the \"Access\" category. Although \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, my best guess is that this ticket primarily fits under \"Access\" since it deals with folder permissions. The user only wants a categorization, not a resolution.**Responding with category label**\n\nI need to provide a category label for the IT ticket, likely \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket content mentions things like \"folder restriction,\" \"folder accessibility,\" and \"sensitive information,\" which clearly relates to access control. \"Access\" seems to be the best fit as it's more general, while \"Administrative rights\" could work if it's specifically about permissions. I'll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"} to ensure it meets the expected format. Let's finalize that!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
