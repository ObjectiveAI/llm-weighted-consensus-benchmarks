To respond effectively, I\u2019ll format my output as a JSON object, specifying the appropriate category based on the keywords provided. This should help organize the request properly!**Categorizing IT request**\n\nThe instructions indicate that I need to provide a category based on the user's text. Given the keywords like \"project setup oracle,\" \"attached code,\" and \"test strategy,\" it seems clear this fits into the \"Internal Project\" category. It doesn't match with \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Hardware.\" I should format my response accurately as a JSON object, specifically stating: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I want to make sure everything checks out before I send it!**Classifying the ticket**\n\nI think \"Internal Project\" is the right category since the ticket involves project setup, a test strategy, forecasting, and budget concerns. Although the ticket is a bit messy, this classification seems reasonable. The instructions specify that I need to respond with JSON format, using the enumerated \"category\" field. So, my response should concisely be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll make sure everything is correct before delivering that!"
