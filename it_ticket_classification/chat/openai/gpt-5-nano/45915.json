However, since the user can't start or close any browsers, it could also fall under \"Access.\" Given the potential for malware, my inclination is towards categorizing it as \"Hardware.\" Let's go with \"Hardware\" for now!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe issue appears to be a device problem, likely hardware-related, so \"Hardware\" seems to fit best. While \"Access\" might also apply since the user is having trouble with browsers, the main symptom is the mouse pointer moving by itself. I've ruled out categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Storage,\" and others, as they don\u2019t apply here. Therefore, I'll respond with a JSON object as required: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Formatting final answer**\n\nThe final answer needs to be a JSON object, as per the system instructions. The required format is: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I need to make sure the formatting is correct and that I\u2019m providing just plain text with the JSON. There\u2019s no need for any additional content. So, I'll simply deliver: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That should meet the requirements perfectly!"
