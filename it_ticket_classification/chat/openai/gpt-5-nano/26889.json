Since the ticket is specifically asking for access, it likely fits best under \"Access.\" It seems that Tudor and Friday November could be two individual users needing access, which further supports that classification. So, \"Access\" seems to be the right call!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nLooking at the phrase about helping with access, it strongly suggests that this ticket is about IT access provisioning. The category \"Access\" seems most suitable since it doesn't specifically mention \"Administrative rights.\" Although \"Administrative rights\" could apply if there were explicit references, the focus appears to be on general access to \"Fusion.\" I should provide a JSON format for the output, containing just the category. So, I\u2019ll prepare that structured response now!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
