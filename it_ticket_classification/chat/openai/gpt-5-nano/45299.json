This suggests a monitoring or IT infrastructure concern, likely pointing to \"Hardware\" since it's about hosts and their outages. The categories seem generic, though, so it could potentially fit \"Miscellaneous\" if it's not a straightforward hardware issue. I need to ensure that I format my output correctly, adhering to the schema that requires the \"category\" field to be in JSON with \"Hardware.\"**Providing the category in JSON**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize the ticket correctly. The prompt indicates that my response should be a JSON object with a \"category\" field. The valid options are listed as \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the content mentioning host issues and monitoring, \"Hardware\" seems to fit best. I'll stick to the required format and respond only with the JSON: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
