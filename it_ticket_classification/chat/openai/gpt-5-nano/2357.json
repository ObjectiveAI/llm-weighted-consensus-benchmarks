The ticket seems to involve requests for new starter accounts and changes to credentials for candidates accepted into an internship program. It likely fits into categories like Access for account credentials, Administrative rights for permissions, or HR Support for new hires. I want to ensure I choose the best category.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nIt seems this ticket is about IT access for new starters, asking to change credentials for candidates who have accepted internship positions. The clearest category here seems to be Access, but it could be Administrative rights as well if it's about permissions. The ticket is probably related to onboarding, with requests to reset passwords and change statuses from internship to permanent. While HR Support might make sense too, it feels more aligned with IT responsibilities.**Finalizing JSON Response**\n\nGiven that the content revolves around IT tasks like accounts and credentials, I believe \"Access\" is the best category. The request is simply to categorize an IT ticket. So, I'll respond with a JSON object. The format needs to follow the schema provided: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nIt's straightforward, and I want to make sure I stick to the exact JSON format without adding any extra commentary. I\u2019ll ensure that my response aligns perfectly with these instructions."
