It initially feels like it could fit into \"Hardware\" because of the hardware components involved\u2014like terminals and circuits. \"Internal Project\" might work if it's a task for telecom equipment, but that seems less likely. Ultimately, I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit as it directly concerns physical upgrade aspects of maintenance tasks. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll format it as a JSON-like object with the category clearly defined.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
