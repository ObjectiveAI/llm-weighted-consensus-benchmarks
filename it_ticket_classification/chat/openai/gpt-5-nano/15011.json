Since that isn't an option, \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the catch-all. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" and respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I want to make sure there\u2019s no extra text outside of that format.**Delivering category output**\n\nI\u2019m aiming to ensure the output is concise and straightforward. I\u2019ll provide the JSON object as requested: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. It\u2019s essential to keep it clean and clear so that it meets the requirements perfectly. Let\u2019s make sure there\u2019s no extra information outside of that. I feel good about delivering what\u2019s needed without any frills or fluff\u2014just the data that\u2019s required!"
