The content mentions something about rejecting logged time off and seems related to annual leave. \n\nFrom the provided categories, it looks like this ticket is mainly about HR Support or possibly Administrative rights. Since it discusses annual leave, I think HR Support is the best fit here. This ticket doesn't seem to pertain to hardware or other categories.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing an IT ticket to find the best category for it. The ticket involves annual leave and logged days, which aligns most closely with HR Support. While \"pm\" could suggest time slots, that doesn\u2019t seem relevant here. It might be tempting to consider Access or Administrative rights, but the \"reject\" indicates a need for HR involvement in leave approvals. Therefore, HR Support fits best. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object with the chosen category.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
