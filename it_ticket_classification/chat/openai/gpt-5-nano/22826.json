They provided specific categories to choose from: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Taking into account the content of the ticket, I should classify it appropriately. Let\u2019s determine which category fits best based on what they\u2019ve mentioned!**Determining ticket categorization**\n\nI need to parse through the content of this ticket, which mentions issues like \"space on database,\" cleaning up backups, and different error procedures. It seems to focus mainly on storage and managing backups, which makes \"Storage\" a fitting category. However, there might be references to \"Administrative rights\" if they talk about deleting or accessing files. But overall, storage management seems to be the primary concern here, so I\u2019ll go with that!**Preparing the response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object for the category, specifically formatted as required by the user's request. It should simply look like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I must avoid adding any extra text or context, just deliver the JSON object itself. Since the user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, I want to make sure I quote everything correctly and present it in the exact format they specified. So, I'll confirm the response is ready to go!"
