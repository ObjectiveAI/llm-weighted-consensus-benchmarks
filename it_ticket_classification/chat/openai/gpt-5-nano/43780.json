While I considered \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access,\" the primary focus is hardware, particularly the data wipe. Therefore, the best fit is \"Hardware,\" as it involves operations on devices rather than access privileges.**Formatting output correctly**\n\nI need to output in the specified JSON format with just the essential information: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I should avoid adding any extra text because the prompt is clear, asking to \"Categorize this IT Ticket.\" It\u2019s important to keep it simple and straightforward. So, the final answer will just be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nAlright, that seems like it's all set!"
