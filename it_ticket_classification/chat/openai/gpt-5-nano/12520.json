It's a bit unclear, but I think \"Hardware\" might be the best fit.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories which include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Based on the information about a laptop being returned and rebuilt, it seems this falls into the Hardware category. Now, I need to format the final output correctly as a JSON-like object. It should read: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Keeping it straightforward and ensuring no extra commentary makes sense since the user requested a clear categorization.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
