However, I'm thinking it doesn't fall under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\". It could be \"Hardware\", \"Miscellaneous\", or \"Internal Project\". Since it's related to help with a Christmas party, I should categorize it more towards event support. I\u2019m leaning towards classifying it as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}, considering it's not strictly about devices.**Categorizing Event Support Request**\n\nThe request seems to ask for help tomorrow regarding a Christmas party's technical needs around 7 pm. Since this touches on scheduling IT support rather than a hardware issue, it classifies as an operational request. There's no specific category for \"Event support,\" but \"Miscellaneous\" fits well. Therefore, I'll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" and provide the JSON output in the required format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. This should keep things clear and straightforward!"
