The user mentions sending a reminder and some feedback issues, indicating potential access problems. Based on the content, \u201ccannot log\u201d suggests that it likely falls under the \u201cAccess\u201d category. I should log this ticket appropriately for further investigation to help resolve the user's issue efficiently.**Outputting IT ticket category**\n\nThe user mentions issues filling out a customer feedback survey, which hints at possible application problems. However, the primary issue seems to be related to access, specifically login difficulties. Since the ticket revolves around \u201ccannot log,\u201d I think the best fit is the \u201cAccess\u201d category. Given the guidelines, I need to respond with a JSON object formatted like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s important to ensure that I follow this format exactly!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
