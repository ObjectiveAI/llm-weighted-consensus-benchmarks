                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket based on the user's unclear request about adding and deleting components related to \"cab infrastructure.\" It seems they might be referencing the Change Advisory Board (CAB) with terms like \"add cab\" and \"delete snow.\" \"Snow\" could refer to ServiceNow, which complicates things. So, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this ticket under \"Administrative rights\" as it likely pertains to changes in infrastructure related to CAB.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI'm trying to categorize an IT ticket, and I'm considering if it should be \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project.\" The mention of \"cab amendment\" hints at a change management process, but there's also a focus on \"infrastructure.\" It seems like the request could be a change request in ServiceNow. Since there's no specific category for \"Change Management,\" I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" since it's about altering a project, though \"Administrative rights\" could apply too if it involves user access.**Analyzing CAB amendment**\n\nI\u2019m considering how the term \"CAB amendment\" relates to the Change Advisory Board and change management. The best category might be \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It could also be about \"Access\" if they're looking to add a user based on their request to \u201cadd cab infrastructure.\u201d However, it\u2019s not entirely clear. Parsing their phrase about \"delete snow pm cab amendment\" suggests there might be some typographical errors, and \"Snow PM\" could refer to a product, but I'm not certain.**Categorizing ServiceNow request**\n\nI'm analyzing the user's request that mentions \"SNOW,\" likely referring to ServiceNow. The \"PM\" might mean \"Problem Management\" or possibly \"Program Manager.\" Their phrase about \"delete snow pm cab amendment\" is puzzling, but they clearly want to \"add cab infrastructure\" and possibly \"add him,\" likely referring to a person. I need to categorize this correctly, weighing options like \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Administrative rights,\" although \"Access\" might fit better if it's about user permissions.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"add him\" implies a request to add someone, which leans towards an Access request. However, the mention of \"cab amendment\" and \"infrastructure\" points to a Change Management context, but there\u2019s no specific category for that. Given this, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best choice since it relates to internal processes. Since the user asked for a category, I\u2019ll provide a simple JSON-like object. I'll respond with: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nGot it!"
