The categories provided are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nFrom the text, it seems the ticket is about distributing docking stations and monitors after someone left. Key phrases like \"purchased cost redistributed\" and \"other members received\" suggest a hardware or procurement issue. I'll narrow it down to the most relevant category.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm examining this IT ticket, which seems focused on hardware inventory management and asset redistribution. The provided categories are \u201cPurchase,\u201d \u201cHardware,\u201d \u201cInternal Project,\u201d and others. Since the ticket revolves around docking station and monitor allocation changes after someone left the company, it relates primarily to hardware. \"Purchase\" could be relevant due to mentions of cost redistribution, but ultimately, the main focus is on hardware distribution among remaining members. So, I'll classify it as \"Hardware\" and format it as a JSON object accordingly.**Responding with Category JSON**\n\nI need to respond with a category for the IT ticket, specifically as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.\n\nI want to double-check if \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" might be better options. However, this ticket focuses on hardware allocation, making \"Hardware\" the most suitable choice. The instructions say to respond only with the category JSON, so adding extra notes isn\u2019t necessary. I\u2019ll keep it concise and simply provide the required format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Let\u2019s go ahead with that!"
