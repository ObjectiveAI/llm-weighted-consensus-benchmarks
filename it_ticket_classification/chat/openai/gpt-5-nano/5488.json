I see two potential categories: \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The \u201cAccess\u201d category is more general, while \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d would apply if elevated privileges are needed. Given that the request is about granting write access, it might be better categorized as \"Administrative rights.\" It\u2019s all about the specifics of user permissions!**Classifying IT ticket for access**\n\nThe user is requesting write permissions for reports related to locations, which falls under access control. I\u2019m considering whether to label this as \"Access\" since it's about control over permissions. However, if \"Administrative rights\" is a separate category for elevated access, it could apply here, but the user didn't explicitly request admin privileges. Still, since they're looking for write access to reports, it seems appropriate to categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll output a JSON object with that category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
