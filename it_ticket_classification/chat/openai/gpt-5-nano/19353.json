The options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket mentions integrating an external git repository, self-signed certificates, and client credentials, which doesn\u2019t fit hardware or HR. I think \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or potentially \"Administrative rights\" could be appropriate choices. \"Miscellaneous\" might work too, but it seems something more specific fits better.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ve determined that this ticket is not about purchasing but rather involves git integration, access to repositories, and certificates. \"Internal Project\" seems like a fitting category since it relates to internal tasks. \"Access\" could work too, given the focus on credentials and connection to the repository, while \"Administrative rights\" is an option if it\u2019s about access rights. I think \"Internal Project\" is the best label here, and I'll format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let's make sure everything is exact!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
