The categories I want to use include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" Each of these categories seems important for organizing tickets properly and ensuring that they get to the right support teams. This way, we can streamline the process and improve overall efficiency. Let's get this list finalized!**Classifying survey rollout**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to classify the survey rollout. It might fall under \"Administrative Rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The text talks about survey management issues, like log updates and rejected surveys, which makes me lean toward \"Internal Project\" because it's focused on an internal process. It doesn't fit hardware, HR, access, storage, or purchase categories. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object that includes \"Internal Project\" as the category. This way, I\u2019m sticking to the required format!**Formatting response correctly**\n\nI need to respond with the JSON format for the category. It should be `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}` without any additional explanations. I\u2019ll make sure the string matches exactly as specified, paying attention to capitalization. I've confirmed that the schema indicates \"category\" is a string and should not be nested. So, the final output will definitely be: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. I\u2019m all set to deliver that!"
