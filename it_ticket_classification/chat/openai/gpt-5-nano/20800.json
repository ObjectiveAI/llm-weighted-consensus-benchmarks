The user clearly asked me to categorize this ticket, and I see some terms like \"remove from client,\" \"leavers,\" \"holidays,\" and \"approver.\" I think it might fit under \"Access\" due to the mention of access control and offboarding. Alternatively, \"Administrative rights\" could apply, especially if \"change code\" relates to permissions. I\u2019ll choose one of these categories accordingly.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m working on categorizing an IT ticket based on the user's request. The content suggests \"remove from client,\" which implies removing someone related to HR or offboarding. Words like \"approver,\" \"holidays,\" \"link,\" and \"change code\" also come up. This all feels like it pertains to \"Access,\" since it deals with user access changes. While \"Administrative rights\" could be involved, it's a separate category. So, I'll select \"Access\" as the best fit and output the required JSON format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
