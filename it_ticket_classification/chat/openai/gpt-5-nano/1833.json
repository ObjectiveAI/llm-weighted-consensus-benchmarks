It mentions a \"new purchase,\" \"log allocation after receiving the item,\" and \"mandatory receipts,\" which implies it's about purchasing and handling hardware logistics. I\u2019m trying to decide between the \"Purchase\" and \"Hardware\" categories. \"Hardware\" fits because it involves a lightning cable, while \"Purchase\" relates to the procurement process. I think I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase,\" since that seems more aligned.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm looking at the content related to purchasing and receipts, and it seems clear that I should categorize this ticket as \"Purchase.\" This is due to mentions of purchase orders, receipt numbers, and logging allocation for items. While \"Administrative rights\" was considered, it doesn\u2019t fit here. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. It\u2019s important to format it correctly as the system expects a straightforward output. So that's what I will provide!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
