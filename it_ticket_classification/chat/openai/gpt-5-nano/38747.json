The user mentioned issues around bug satisfaction scores and access requests. Given that \"Access\" is specifically mentioned, it seems to be the most fitting category. However, I also need to consider if it could fit into \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative Rights,\" but \"Access\" feels like the right choice here!**Classifying Ticket**\n\nThe ticket is about a bug involving satisfaction scores related to an access request, specifically asking for verification of negative scores while also noting high satisfaction. Since it fits well within the context of access management, I believe the category should be \"Access.\" However, there's also an aspect that could be considered \"Miscellaneous\" due to its focus on satisfaction metrics. Still, \"Access\" feels more specific, so I'll respond with the JSON category object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
