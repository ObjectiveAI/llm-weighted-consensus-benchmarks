The user's message is about needing access related to nodes and instances, mentioning git checkout and repository details. It\u2019s a bit garbled, but it seems clear this relates to access issues. So, I\u2019ll assign the ticket to the \"Access\" category since that aligns best with the content.**Categorizing access requests**\n\nThe user provided a message that mentions needing access to a node and instance, involving git checkout and repository details. A key part is \"node needed access,\" which clearly falls into the Access category. There are some unclear phrases that might relate to internal projects or permissions, but since the main focus is on access, I think categorizing this as Access is the most appropriate choice. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON category.**Formatting the response**\n\nThe prompt includes a schema for categorizing the IT ticket, and I need to output it in the required format. Specifically, I\u2019ll return a JSON object that indicates the category, which I\u2019ve determined should be \"Access.\" The instructions say to keep it simple, so I won\u2019t add any extra text or justifications. The response will strictly follow the schema: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Alright, I'll stick to that format!"
