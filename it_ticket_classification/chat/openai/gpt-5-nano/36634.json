The ticket mentions issues regarding dashboard contacts that were uploaded to Survey Gizmo but aren\u2019t appearing or being updated. It asks to check the imports and the respondents' list, as well as to verify if the contacts are being imported correctly for other accounts. I need to categorize this ticket based on the allowed list, perhaps as \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing a software-related issue regarding a dashboard and Survey Gizmo, which has now rebranded. The problem centers around data import issues. I have several categories to choose from: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" might fit best, but it could also relate to \"Access\" since it involves correct contact imports. However, the focus seems more like an IT project, making \u201cInternal Project\u201d the most appropriate.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm considering the category for an IT ticket related to a bug with Survey Gizmo contacts not updating on the dashboard. \"Administrative rights\" could apply if permissions are needed, but the issue mainly involves logging the incident. I could choose \"Miscellaneous\" if nothing fits perfectly, but guidelines might favor \"Internal Project\" for such software features. Ultimately, I think I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and will provide a brief justification in the response. I'll need to format it as a JSON object too!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
