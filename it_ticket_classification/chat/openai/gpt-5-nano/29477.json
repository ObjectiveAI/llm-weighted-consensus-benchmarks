It seems to involve access rights and administrative tasks. I'm considering the possibility of \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" as the best categories since it deals with ownership transfer and editing rights during site migration.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe user is requesting to transfer ownership, change site owners, and edit rights for access to an old site. I think \"Administrative rights\" fits best since it covers changing permissions and ownership. \"Access\" could also work, but the task seems related to an internal site migration project. Since the ticket involves user access rights and permission changes, I'll classify it as \"Administrative rights.\" So, I should respond with a JSON object, like this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
