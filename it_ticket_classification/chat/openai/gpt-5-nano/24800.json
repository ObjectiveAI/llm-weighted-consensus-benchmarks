I'm considering categories like Storage, Administrative rights, Access, or Miscellaneous. It could be Storage for the upload or Administrative rights if permissions are needed. Access might apply if they want to ensure visibility on a shared drive or portal. I\u2019ll find the best fit!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering categorizing this ticket as \"Access\" since it involves making a document visible to employees and uploading it. However, I'm not entirely sure. The categories I'm looking at are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Uploading the document could fall under \"Storage,\" but it\u2019s likely better suited for \"Access\" due to permissions. Ultimately, if this is about visibility settings, I'll lean towards \"Access\".**Choosing Category for Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this ticket as \"Access\" since it\u2019s about granting visibility for employees. The user specifically mentions making the document visible, which relates to access permissions. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply, it's more about granting admin privileges\u2014which doesn't quite fit here. So, I think \"Access\" is the best option. Now, I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object to match the specifications, and I'll include:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nI might want to add a brief note for clarity!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
