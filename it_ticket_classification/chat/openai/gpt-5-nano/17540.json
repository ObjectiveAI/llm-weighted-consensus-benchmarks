Access doesn\u2019t appear to be relevant here either. So, I'll focus on Storage or Internal Project for this classification.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI think the best fit for this IT ticket might be \"Internal Project\" because it involves a planning upgrade and task assignment. But there\u2019s also a lot about \"create snapshot\" and \"upgrade fails,\" which suggests storage-level operations. \n\nThe user mentions various phrases like \"creating snapshot,\" \"snapshot restored,\" and \"application upgrade.\" It seems like a multifaceted issue. Ultimately, I should probably categorize it as \"Internal Project\" due to the focus on upgrading the application and technical planning.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIn triaging this IT ticket, I'm considering that upgrade tasks likely fit under \"Internal Project.\" However, the mention of \"snapshot\" points towards a storage-related task. Since the instructions ask for a JSON-like object for categorization, I need to choose between \"Internal Project\" and \"Storage.\" \n\nWhile \"snapshot\" is crucial for storage operations, the ticket mainly focuses on upgrading an application. So, I think I'll go with \"Internal Project,\" as it aligns best with the overall content.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
