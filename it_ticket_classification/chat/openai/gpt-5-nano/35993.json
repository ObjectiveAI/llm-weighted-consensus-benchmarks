Given phrases like \"computer not working\" and \"keep reconnecting,\" it seems to be a hardware issue, but it could also relate to network access. I think I'll go with \"Hardware\" as the category.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm looking at a somewhat confusing string about issues the user is experiencing: \"open not working open working hello open currently working computer used before worked keep reconnecting print screen open thank you.\" It seems they want me to categorize this ticket. Based on the content, it most likely falls under \"Hardware,\" especially since it's about a computer issue. I could consider other options like \"Miscellaneous,\" but I think \"Hardware\" is the right choice. I'll present it in a JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nI need to provide a simple JSON object to categorize the IT ticket. The instructions specify the format for the response includes a \"category\" property with allowed string values. Given the user\u2019s input, my best guess is to say it's \"Hardware.\" I want to make sure I follow the schema exactly, so I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll avoid any extra text or formatting, keeping it straightforward. The part about \"keep reconnecting\" could suggest a network issue, but it still relates back to hardware, as I see it."
