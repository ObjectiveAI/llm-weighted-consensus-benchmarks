Since they want to place an order, I think the appropriate category would be \"Purchase\" rather than just \"Hardware,\" which deals more with hardware issues. I need to respond in the correct format, so I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. This matches the specified structure!**Finalizing category output**\n\nI need to make sure I output the correct category as a JSON object, which will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. The user has requested categorization of this IT ticket, so I\u2019ll keep it simple and avoid heavy formatting, just as the instructions suggest. Although I wondered if I should provide additional context, it seems the key is to deliver just the category. Given everything is about a hardware purchase, I\u2019m set to proceed with that output."
