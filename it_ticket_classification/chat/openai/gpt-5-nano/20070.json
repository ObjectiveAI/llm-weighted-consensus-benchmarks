Maybe it falls under \"Administrative Rights\" since it hints at access, or perhaps \"Miscellaneous\" due to its generic nature.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nIt looks like there's no explicit category for \"Scheduling\" or \"Meetings.\" The closest one might be \"Internal Project,\" but that feels risky. I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best choice since it's common to default to that when the request is vague.\n\nThe user asked to categorize the ticket, so I should format my response as a JSON object. Based on the schema provided, I'll go with this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} \n\nI considered if it could relate to \"Administrative rights,\" but that doesn\u2019t quite fit. \"Miscellaneous\" remains the safest option.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
