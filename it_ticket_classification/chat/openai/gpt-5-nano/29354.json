I'm considering categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Storage.\" The details mention various attributes like labels, statuses, and descriptions, which seem related to setting up this new issue type. It's an interesting request!**Evaluating IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe user is discussing fields related to configuring a custom issue type, including defaults, labels, and statuses. It definitely sounds like they\u2019re working on an issue-tracking board, which makes me think it could fit the \"Internal Project\" category. There's also a mention of HR-related fields, so \"HR Support\" might work too. The question about \"how best accomplished\" indicates they seek guidance on implementation. Overall, it sounds like a process-oriented IT task related to recruitment tracking on a board!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the category for this IT ticket, and the user's mention of a recruiter name and lead person makes me think \"HR Support\" could fit. However, it seems more focused on software configuration. Given the fixed categories, \"Internal Project\" stands out as the best option because it relates to building or configuring a board. I should also provide a brief justification and maybe suggest a refined subject and description. Since the user asked for a categorization, I\u2019ll decide whether to respond in text or JSON format.**Formatting the response correctly**\n\nI need to format the response based on the category object schema provided. According to the prompt, I should output a JSON object with the category set to \"Internal Project.\" The directive specifies responding exclusively in that format, so the value should match the allowed string exactly. However, I can include an explanation if I want. For this task, I\u2019ll stick with the required format and just provide:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nNo extra commentary\u2014just the JSON as specified!"
