Since they mentioned logging a ticket and setup, it\u2019s likely about access issues. I should assign this to either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Categorizing access issues**\n\nThe phrase \u201cemployee do not have setup\u201d likely refers to issues with Active Directory accounts. \u201cSetup\u201d pertains to access or permissions. This leads me to categorize it as \u201cAccess,\u201d considering it involves employee IDs and permission setup. While \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could be relevant to privileges, the focus is clearly on access issues. It\u2019s best to go with \"Access\" for clarity.
