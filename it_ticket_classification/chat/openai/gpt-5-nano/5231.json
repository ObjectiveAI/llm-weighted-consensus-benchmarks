The content suggests it's about a \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" \"contractor,\" and related terms, which seem to point towards HR onboarding and access provisioning. From the categories available, it looks like HR Support is the best fit since it deals with onboarding and completion of forms related to hiring a contractor. I'll choose that category.**Determining the IT ticket category**\n\nI'm looking at the categories to categorize this IT ticket. \"Access\" is a common one for granting permissions, but \"HR Support\" isn't available, which complicates things. I\u2019m considering \"Administrative rights\" since the ticket concerns onboarding forms and potential access. The text mentions a new starter contractor and the need to fill out a starter form, making it sound like a request for onboarding assistance. I'll categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" since it fits best overall.**Categorizing an onboarding ticket**\n\nThis ticket appears to be about an onboarding form for a contractor. It might imply a need for \"Access\" to systems, even though that's not explicitly stated. In IT, onboarding usually falls under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" Among the available options, \"Access\" is the closest since it's related to enabling a new starter's access. Despite it focusing more on HR processes, I will categorize it as \"Access\" since it involves granting access for the new starter. \n\nI can respond with the appropriate JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
