The categories to choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. It seems appropriate to categorize this under \"Access\" or possibly \"Administrative Rights\" since it relates to approvals that likely require certain access rights. I'll format my response as JSON with the selected category.**Determining the right category**\n\nI\u2019m considering categorizing the ticket based on the user\u2019s message, which emphasizes \"cannot approve change\" and mentions Oracle and line manager changes. Both \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights\" seem relevant. However, since the message revolves around the capability to approve changes, the best fit is likely \"Access.\" Administrative rights are more about granting permissions, making it a subtopic. So, I'll go with \"Access\" for this classification, as that aligns best with the user's request.**Selecting the right category**\n\nThe ticket states \"cannot approve change,\" indicating a need for authorization\u2014likely linked to administrative rights. I need to pick a category, not propose subcategories. While both \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights\" are relevant, \"Access\" seems more accurate since it pertains to permission issues. The mention of \"Oracle\" suggests it's about access to a system. I'll categorize it as \"Access,\" following the provided instructions, and respond with the JSON structure for the category field accordingly.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
