The categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since this isn't about hardware or HR support, it might fall under Access, given that it's about software usage. It could also fit under Miscellaneous, but since access to the tool is a primary concern, I think \"Access\" is the best choice.**Categorizing technical difficulties**\n\nThe user is having technical difficulties with a referral tool, and I think this likely relates to access or usage issues. Therefore, I should categorize it as \"Access.\" The taxonomy often uses \"Access\" for login or access issues and \"Administrative rights\" for permissions that need elevation. Since the description doesn't mention needing admin rights, \"Access\" seems like the right choice. \n\nSo, my response should be a JSON-like object stating: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
