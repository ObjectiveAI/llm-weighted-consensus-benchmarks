Since it relates to hardware, \"Hardware\" seems to fit best. However, it could also be \"Purchase\" if it's about buying the phone. I'll weigh these options carefully.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m determining the correct category for the IT ticket. \"Internal Project\" doesn\u2019t fit, and \"Administrative rights\" isn't relevant. I think \"Hardware\" is the best option since it relates to a mobile phone for a new employee. I need to respond using the specified JSON format, so I'll format it like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It\u2019s essential to follow the schema requirements. Overall, my final output will be {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Yes, that covers everything!"
