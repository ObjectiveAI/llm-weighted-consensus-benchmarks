Although there's mention of storage, the primary concern is about access and policy compliance.**Categorizing an IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the potential categories for this IT ticket, which includes \"Storage,\" but the content primarily discusses file storage and sharing. While \"Administrative rights\" might relate to policy control, the focus doesn't seem to specify requesting those rights. \"HR Support\" and \"Purchase\" don\u2019t apply, and \"Miscellaneous\" feels too vague.\n\nGiven everything, \"Access\" stands out as the most fitting category, aligning with the compliance focus mentioned.
