The ticket mentions a new starter in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, who is completing a form related to their onboarding process and a compliance officer. Given this context, it seems most relevant to classify it under \"HR Support.\" I should then format the output in JSON as required, providing the category like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket references a \"new starter\" who is an \"android developer engineer\" joining a team and mentions a \"compliance officer\" as well as completing forms. While it could imply access issues or seating arrangements, it strongly suggests it's about onboarding, which makes \"HR Support\" a likely category. However, there are categories like \"Access\" which might fit if the ticket involves provisioning. Ultimately, it seems best to classify this ticket as \"HR Support\" based on the context of a new starter's onboarding process.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions a \"new starter\" in Bogot\u00e1 who is an \"android developer engineer\" and talks about completing forms and seating arrangements, potentially reflecting onboarding tasks. It seems a good fit for \"HR Support,\" though there might be an access component if it was about setting up accounts. However, the lack of explicit access terms solidifies \"HR Support\" as the best option. I\u2019ll prepare the final response in proper JSON format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
