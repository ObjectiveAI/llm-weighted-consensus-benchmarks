The user provided a string that mentions leaves and maternity leave, which seems HR-related. It\u2019s ambiguous, but since the terms are about leave management, I think \"HR Support\" is the right category. It doesn\u2019t fit hardware or access issues. So, I\u2019ll respond confirming the ticket will be categorized as \"HR Support.\"**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON-like object following a specific schema format, which includes a \"category\" key. The instruction prompts me to categorize this IT ticket, and it sounds like \"HR Support\" is the chosen category. \n\nI have to ensure that my output matches this schema: the overall type should be \"object,\" containing \"properties\" for the category, which has allowed enum values. \n\nSo, I will output a valid JSON object that reflects this as:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}**Delivering the JSON response**\n\nI see that I need to create a response that matches a specific schema. The example output should look like {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}, which indicates the category is \"HR Support,\" and I must ensure it's spelled correctly with a space.\n\nAlthough including a justification is tempting, the instructions emphasize being succinct. Since the user simply asked to categorize, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and deliver just the category:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
