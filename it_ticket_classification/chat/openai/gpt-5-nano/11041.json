I\u2019m ruling out other categories since they don't fit.**Categorizing IT ticket as JSON**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket, and it mentions \"service now,\" which is an ITSM system. The terms in the ticket refer to an HR process like transfer forms and job offers. So, I determined the appropriate category is \"HR Support.\" Now, I'll format the response according to the given JSON schema. The output should simply be: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra text and just provide the JSON. Done!"
