It seems like it may not fit neatly into categories like \"Access,\" \"Hardware,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019m thinking \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d might work, given that it describes a problem but not specifically. It's tricky! Ultimately, I want to follow the category schema for proper output in JSON. I'll just need to be clear and accurate in my classification.**Choosing an IT category**\n\nI'm trying to categorize an Outlook connection problem. The available categories are limited, and \"Miscellaneous\" feels too generic. \"Access\" could be relevant since it involves connection issues, but it usually pertains to login or permissions. The problem is more about network or service connectivity. Since none of the categories fit perfectly, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a more precise label. Ultimately, I\u2019m focusing on finding the best fit for this ticket!**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize the IT ticket about an Outlook connection issue. \"Access\" seems to fit well since it relates to login and connectivity problems. \"Administrative rights,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Internal Project\" don\u2019t apply here, and \"Miscellaneous\" feels too vague. Given the context, \"Access\" makes the most sense, especially since it covers authentication for Outlook. I\u2019ll format my final answer as a JSON object to meet the requirements."
