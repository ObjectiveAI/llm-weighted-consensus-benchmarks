The user is experiencing a problem where the report generates a blank spreadsheet. It seems to primarily relate to HR reporting functionality, which suggests that \"HR Support\" is the best category. However, it could also fit into \"Access\" if they are unable to reach the date options for the reports.**Choosing category for ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket. The user is asking about an issue with running reports, which fits into \u201cHR Support\u201d or possibly \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d The content definitely points to an HR reporting feature issue, so \u201cHR Support\u201d seems most fitting. I realize the output needs to be in a specific JSON format. So, I'll deliver just the required object as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That way, I\u2019m following the instructions clearly!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
