The ticket concerns issues with approving holiday requests in the Oracle system, which suggests it relates to HR or Access. The phrases \"cannot approve holiday requests\" and \"investigate why\" indicate it's likely an access issue within HR support. Between the two categories, HR Support and Access seem most relevant. I should determine which option fits best for this situation.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket discusses an issue with approving holiday requests in Oracle, which relates to access and permissions. While \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant, it aligns more with an HR access issue because they mention not being able to approve holiday requests for a specific manager. This suggests it\u2019s more about access permissions, making \"Access\" the most precise category. I need to output this as a JSON object formatted correctly without any extra text.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket, and I\u2019ve decided on \"Access.\" This choice fits since the issue revolves around permissions to approve holiday requests. While the instruction is clear, I considered whether a clarifying question might be warranted. However, since the user specifically asked for categorization, I\u2019ll stick to delivering just the category without any extra content. So, I will output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
