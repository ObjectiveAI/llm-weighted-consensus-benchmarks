The mention of hardware components leads me to lean towards \"Hardware\" as the category. While \"Purchase\" could be possible since there's a request for assignment, it seems clearer that this concerns hardware assignment. So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object indicating the category as \u201cHardware,\u201d following the required format.**Delivering JSON response**\n\nI need to respond by providing just the category as a JSON object, specifically formatted without any extra text. So I'll ensure the response is clean and straightforward. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Following the instructions carefully is key here, so I'll deliver it exactly as specified, making it clear and concise. This will meet the user's requirement perfectly!"
