It seems the user is struggling to use a project code, which might suggest an \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" category, depending on the specifics once clarified.**Interpreting IT Ticket Issues**\n\nThis ticket seems to be about a user having trouble with project codes and card attachments. The text hints at the user\u2019s inability to use a project code for \"small projects\" which could suggest it falls under \"Internal Project.\" There's also the mention of \"card,\" which might refer to either card access or a credit card issue tied to administrative activities. I think suitable categories might include Access, Administrative Rights, or Internal Project, depending on further clarification.**Analyzing User's Ticket**\n\nThe user says, \"cannot use project code\" and mentions \"small projects task admin activities,\" indicating this issue is likely within an internal project management system. There's a mention of attaching an \"old card\" and a \"new card,\" which could be confusing. The \"card\" could refer to a project card or a kiosk card, but I'm not sure. It might fit under the \"Access\" category if it's an issue with access rights or \"Administrative Rights\" if it's tied to running admin tasks.**Clarifying User's Issues**\n\nLet\u2019s take another look at the user's message. It sounds like they can't use a project code for small projects due to incorrect task details. They mention trying to use an \u201cactivities\u201d option and wanting to attach an old card. I'm unsure if \"card\" refers to a credit card for account purposes or possibly a Kanban card used in project management. This confusion might be central to their issue, as the attachment process seems problematic.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI think this issue revolves around an Agile or Kanban board problem where the user can't attach an old card to the \"activities\" option. Based on the context of project codes, small projects, and admin activities, it seems that \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category. While there may be access-related concerns, it doesn\u2019t seem explicitly tied to system access or logins. I should respond with the category in the required JSON format: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. No extra commentary is necessary."
