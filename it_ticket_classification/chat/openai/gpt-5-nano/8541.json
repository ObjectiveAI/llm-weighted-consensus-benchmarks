It includes phrases about passwords expiring, changes, resets, and instructions which complicate things a bit. The allowed categories are \"Access\", \"Administrative rights\", among others. Since the ticket refers to password expiry and account access, it seems to fit best in the \"Access\" category. However, if it's more about admin rights, it could also go under \"Administrative rights.\" Overall, \"Access\" feels most appropriate.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nSome phrases like \"fax,\" \"surrey kingdom,\" and \"technical committee official\" seem irrelevant to the ticket. The main issues are password expiry and instructions to reset, which clearly indicate it's an \"Access\" concern. Now, I need to create a proper JSON response following the required format. It should look like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nI just need to ensure there's no additional text or noise in the response and stick to the JSON output.
