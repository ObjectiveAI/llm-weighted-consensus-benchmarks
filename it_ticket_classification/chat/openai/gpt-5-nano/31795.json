The user provided a string that's sort of garbled but references an \"oracle project code change\" and mentions absence and annual leave. This seems mostly about a project code change, so I think it could fit under \"Internal Project.\" However, if it involves access issues, \"Administrative rights\" might also be relevant.**Categorizing IT ticket details**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"absence,\" \"leave,\" and \"log.\" I need to decide which category fits best: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. \n\n\"HR Support\" could cover leave and absences, but since it involves an Oracle project code change, it\u2019s more likely an \"Internal Project\" task. The key phrase focuses on the code change, while the other details seem like additional chatter. So, I think I'll classify it as \"Internal Project\" and provide a JSON-like category format.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to provide the response in a specific JSON format that includes a category. The schema indicates it should look like this: \n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}\n\nThe ticket focuses on an \"oracle project code change,\" which suggests it's primarily an \"Internal Project.\" Although it does mention \"annual leave\" and \"absence,\" which lean towards \"HR Support,\" the main focus is on the code change. So, I\u2019ll finalize the response as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
