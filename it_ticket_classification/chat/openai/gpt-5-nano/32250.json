Mentions of \"permissions\" and \"admin rights\" are there, but the main topic is clearly about hardware. I'm thinking it should be categorized as \"Hardware.\" So, the response will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Clarifying output format**\n\nThe prompt specifies a category format that looks like this: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}. I\u2019m wondering if I should just provide the category string or the entire object. The instruction clearly says to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" which implies I should provide the category. Based on the requirements, the output will be a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I'll keep it straightforward with no additional commentary."
