Given the frequent mentions of \"license,\" it points toward a purchase request. Let's go with \"Purchase\" since it's about ordering a license.**Determining ticket category**\n\nIn IT ticket taxonomy, the \"Purchase\" category typically focuses on procurement tasks. However, categories like \"Access\" relate to user permissions and software license management. The user mentions things like \"snow remove service now license starter\" and \"order license today,\" which suggests they\u2019re looking for access for a new user. I see it mainly as access provisioning to grant a ServiceNow license. So, the best category would be \"Access\" since it's about enabling access to the system.**Parsing the ticket request**\n\nLet\u2019s break this down: the phrase \"snow remove service now license starter\" seems to refer to a ServiceNow license for a new starter. The rest of the text, while a bit garbled, suggests they want to \"order a license today\" to enable the new user. I see the main action is procurement, which fits the \"Purchase\" category. However, many organizations might classify this as \"Access\" for user provisioning. Given the content, \"Software License Provisioning\" could also apply, but I lean toward \"Purchase\" for licensing tasks.**Finalizing the ticket category response**\n\nGiven the limited categories, \"Purchase\" is the best match for the license request. The prompt asks for a specific format, so I need to respond with a JSON object that has a \"category\" property. The correct output should be:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}  \n\nI want to make sure there\u2019s no extra text or commentary. The final answer will be just this JSON object to meet the requirements. Let's finalize it!"
