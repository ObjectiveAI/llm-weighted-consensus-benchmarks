It appears they want to reshape how daily reports are handled.\n\nHmm, since \"Change Management\" isn\u2019t an option, I might consider \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d if it relates to approvals\u2014or perhaps \u201cInternal Project\u201d or \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d I'll weigh my options based on how they fit the content. This is a bit tricky!**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering categorizing this IT ticket based on the user's notes about change approvals and daily reports. \"Internal Project\" seems like a strong fit due to the focus on process improvement. \n\nI also think about \"Administrative rights\" because of the approval aspect, but it doesn't align perfectly. Given that their details don't match other categories like hardware or access, I feel \"Internal Project\" is more appropriate. I'll output the selected category in the required JSON format.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
