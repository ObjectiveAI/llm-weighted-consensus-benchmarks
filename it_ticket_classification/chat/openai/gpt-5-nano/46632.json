The mention of \"agile manager\" suggests it's related to an Agile project. Since it talks about access and ownership, I'd lean toward \"Access\" instead of hardware issues. The user indicates ownership has transferred but approvals are still linked to the previous owner, which indicates a permissions issue. I think calling it \"Administrative rights\" might be too specific since the focus seems more on approvals rather than changing admin rights.**Delivering category response**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket, making sure to follow the instructions closely. The output should strictly be a JSON object with the \"category\" field. Based on the allowed values, I should respond with this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s important to avoid any extra content\u2014just the category object in the specified format. So, I'll keep it simple and deliver that response precisely as instructed."
