The categories available are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given that it mentions users unable to tag and that everything is working fine in someone's profile, this likely relates to access rights. The primary concern is about the users' ability to tag, so I think \"Access\" might be the most appropriate category for this issue.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI think the issue fits into the \"Access\" category. Let\u2019s break it down: they mentioned sending permission changes on Wednesday and that customers are unable to tag users. The grammar is a bit messy, but it seems like they\u2019re trying to ensure that all users have similar permissions, particularly around tagging. While \"Administrative rights\" usually pertains to admin-level changes, this seems to be more about general access rights. So, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" and return it in JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
