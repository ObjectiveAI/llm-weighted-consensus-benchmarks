They've asked me to \"categorize this IT ticket,\" and the specifics in their request indicate they're likely seeking a replacement for an old headset. \n\nSince procurement requests often go under \u201cPurchase,\u201d and their message strongly suggests this need, I\u2019ll decide to categorize it as \"Purchase\" to best reflect their intention.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
