The ticket is messy, mentioning \"map,\" project management, budget, approval, and various fields. It seems to center around an internal project regarding a career map request. I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since it relates to project creation and budget. Other categories like \"Purchase\" or \"Administrative rights\" could apply but aren\u2019t as relevant.**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm seeing a lot of details about codes, budgets, and project kick-offs, which strongly suggest this is an internal project. The ticket specifies things like approval and setup forms that support this idea. So, I\u2019ve decided the correct category is \"Internal Project.\" I need to format my response as a JSON object, ensuring it matches exactly with the required capitalization of \"Internal Project.\" The final output will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
