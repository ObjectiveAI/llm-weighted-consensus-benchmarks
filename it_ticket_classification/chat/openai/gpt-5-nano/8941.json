The text mentions onboarding a new starter and references returning from maternity leave, possible ID and image concerns too. My best guess is that this should be categorized under \"Access,\" since it likely involves granting access for a new employee and reinstating access for someone returning from maternity leave. It's important to clarify these details to categorize accurately!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket might also fit under \"Administrative rights\" if it's about granting those privileges for a new starter. However, it seems more related to onboarding, which leans towards \"Access\" since it involves creating or reinstating user accounts. The mention of \"returning maternity leave\" suggests reactivation of access, and \"ID image\" likely points to scanning an ID. Given all this, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" and format it as a JSON object for submission.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that clearly indicates the category as \"Access.\" Since the instructions specify only to categorize, there's no need for additional notes or explanations, and I want to keep it straightforward. So I'll just format it as {\"category\": \"Access\"}, ensuring \"Access\" is precisely as required with a capital A. Alright, let's produce that JSON object!"
