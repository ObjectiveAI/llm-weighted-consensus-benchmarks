It looks like it's related to user access or permissions due to mentions of a \"generic user bot\" and possibly creating privileged accounts. I'm considering the \"Access\" category since it pertains to user access, but it might also fit into \"Administrative rights\" if it involves more specialized permissions. So, it\u2019s likely the ticket fits best in the \"Access\" category.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m debating how to categorize this ticket. It mentions creating user accounts, which might fit into \"Administrative rights\" since that involves managing spaces. But there's a lot of focus on creating a \"generic user bot,\" leading me to think it's more about access permissions and provisioning. Typically, this falls under \"Access\" for account provisioning, but sometimes it might be considered \"Administrative rights.\" I think the safest choice here is to classify it as \"Access\" since it's primarily about user access to Confluence.**Crafting response for ticket**\n\nThe user requested to \"create a generic user bot\" for Confluence spaces, which leans toward access permissions rather than admin rights. I think it\u2019s best to categorize this under \"Access.\" I\u2019ll keep the response concise and follow the required format by outputting a JSON object that includes the category field. The response will simply be {\"category\":\"Access\"}, making sure there\u2019s no extra content. That seems straightforward!"
