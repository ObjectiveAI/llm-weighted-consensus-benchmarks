The ticket content is a bit jumbled, but it looks like the user is experiencing an Oracle issue related to displaying annual leave hours instead of the leave booked. Since it seems to relate to HR or payroll, specifically with annual leave, I think the best fit for the category would be HR Support.**Categorizing IT Ticket as JSON**\n\nThe IT ticket seems to fall under \"HR Support\" since it's about annual leave in Oracle. It's clear that the user is asking to fix an issue with how leave is displayed\u2014showing hours instead of days. Based on the category schema provided, I\u2019ll create a JSON object with the \"category\" property set to \"HR Support.\" This is what the user needs for the categorization. I'll ensure the final output is strictly the JSON object without any extra text. Here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
