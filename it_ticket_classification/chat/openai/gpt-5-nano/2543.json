The phrase talks about \"impediments at logging time,\" which might suggest there's an issue with logging in. It mentions high activity and deleting something that takes almost a minute. So, I think it could fit in the Access category, or possibly Administrative rights or Miscellaneous. I\u2019ll decide on the best category based on context.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to categorize this IT ticket since it\u2019s related to login issues. The \"Access\" category seems most appropriate for login problems, while \"Administrative rights\" pertains to permissions. Other categories like \"Storage,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Purchase\" don\u2019t fit. I should suggest categorizing it as \"Access\" and provide a reasoning that the user reports delays during login, possibly due to high activity. The output needs to be in JSON format like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering if \"Miscellaneous\" could work because of the unclear text. However, the phrases like \"impediments at logging time\" suggest a login issue, and \"high activity\" indicates there's some latency. So, I believe \"Access\" is indeed the right category. I\u2019ll respond with just the category in a JSON object, like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It seems straightforward enough, so let\u2019s go with that!"
