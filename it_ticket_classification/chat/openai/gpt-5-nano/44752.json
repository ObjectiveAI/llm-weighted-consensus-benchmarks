Although I'm unsure what PAS means\u2014maybe it's related to \"Pipelines as code\" or \"PaaS\"?\u2014it's clear the issue doesn't strictly relate to access or permissions. So, I\u2019m weighing the category options as \"Miscellaneous\" for general IT problems. It's reasonable since the issue doesn't fit neatly into other categories.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI'm considering whether this could be categorized as \"Internal Project\" if it relates to a project feature. However, since the user is asking for a workaround for a bug and there\u2019s nothing specifically about hardware, storage, or purchases, I think \"Miscellaneous\" fits best. I'll craft the JSON for the category, ensuring it's formatted correctly. So, it will simply be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Just that, with no additional commentary needed."
