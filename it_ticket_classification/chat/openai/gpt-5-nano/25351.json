The user said something like, \u201cshare documents new Tuesday November PM wants share want share accept decline.\u201d It seems related to sharing permissions or accessing documents. The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. I\u2019m thinking it fits under \"Access\" for sharing permissions, but \"Storage\" is also a possibility. It sounds like the user might be requesting certain access rights to share documents.**Choosing the Category**\n\nIt seems like \u201cAccess\u201d is the best category for this IT ticket. \u201cAdministrative Rights\u201d relates to privileges, but \u201cAccess\u201d covers permissions for sharing documents. If it were specifically about storage space, I might consider \u201cStorage,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t seem to be that. The user likely needs access for sharing. I'll respond in JSON format, using the structure provided to indicate the selected category. The final output will simply be: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
