Although \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if it involves admin permissions, I'll primarily categorize it under \"Access.\" Now, I'll format the response accordingly!**Determining category schema**\n\nI see the need to categorize the IT ticket according to a defined schema. The options are clearly stated: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the ticket relates to a locked account, it's logical to select \"Access\" as the category.
