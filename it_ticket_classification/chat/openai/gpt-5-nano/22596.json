It contains several messy requests, such as adding a \"project manager column\" to the utilization report and mentions of both a \"senior engineer Wednesday pm utilization report\" and \"timecard.\"\n\nLooking at the provided categories, this ticket seems to relate more to HR support tasks about reports and timecards. It might fit best under \"HR Support,\" but I\u2019m also considering \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Evaluating IT ticket categorization**\n\nI'm focusing on categorizing this IT ticket, which mentions \"timecard\" related to HR/payroll. I realize that the main issues involve adding a column to a report, which suggests it could fall under \"Internal Project\" if it's for project management. \"Administrative rights\" seems irrelevant here. \"HR Support\" might fit due to references to \"staff utilization report,\" but I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. I might consider \"Miscellaneous\" if it's still unclear, but I need to choose one category.**Parsing ticket phrases**\n\nI\u2019m looking at all the phrases from the IT ticket, like the request to \"add project manager column\" to the staff utilization report and multiple mentions of \"utilization report\" and \"timecard.\" It seems there are many requests wrapped up here. Since this is mainly about internal project reporting and timecards, I don't think it fits under hardware or access. I believe \"HR Support\" could be relevant due to the timecard reference, but \"Internal Project\" seems like the best category overall. \"Administrative rights\" doesn't apply, so I'm settling on \"Internal Project.\"{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
