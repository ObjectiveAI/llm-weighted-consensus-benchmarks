It seems to involve a purchase order for a laptop riser and also mentions installation. I have options for categories like \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" The emphasis on both a purchase order and installation suggests it fits into both. However, since the main action revolves around the purchase order for the laptop riser, I think the best categorization is \"Purchase.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nWhen categorizing an IT ticket, the request to log an installation doesn\u2019t fit under \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Storage.\" It likely falls between \"Purchase\" and \"Hardware.\" Since the ticket is mainly about a purchase order for a laptop riser, I think \"Purchase\" is the most suitable category. While it involves a hardware item, the focus is on procurement. For the required output format, I\u2019d provide {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Finalizing ticket response**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether this might be classified as \"Miscellaneous,\" but the more precise category is definitely \"Purchase\" since it pertains to the purchase order for a laptop riser. For the response, it\u2019s important to maintain the required JSON format. The instruction clearly states that I should respond with the category object.\n\nSo, the output will be exactly:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nNo extra text here; I\u2019ve got it!"
