The text they provided mentions \"bulk leavers,\" interns, and forms, which suggests it's related to HR processes concerning employee leave. Among the available options, the most fitting category seems to be \"HR Support.\" \n\nI\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object, writing `{\"category\": \"HR Support\"}` since that aligns best with the content of the ticket about employee leave forms.**Determining the category**\n\nIt seems the ticket is HR-related, and \"HR Support\" feels like the right category. While there are other options like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" they don't quite fit since the ticket is mainly about interns and a bulk leaver form. The mention of an \"administration officer\" and \"upcoming annual leave\" further points to HR support. \n\nSo, I'll categorize this ticket as \"HR Support,\" since it aligns perfectly with managing departing interns and their associated processes.**Finalizing the category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the \"Access\" category since the ticket mentions the bulk leaver form, which could relate to revoking access. However, the text indicates it's primarily about processing employees leaving, specifically interns and their annual leave. Given the context, it leans more towards HR functions. So, I conclude that \"HR Support\" is the best fit. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object: `{\"category\": \"HR Support\"}` and ensure there\u2019s no extra text."
