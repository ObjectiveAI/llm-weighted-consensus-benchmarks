They mention needing Snow (ServiceNow) to check attachments since they keep getting duplicate notifications, making it hard to manage things. It sounds like this belongs in the \"Access\" category due to notifications and approvals.**Categorizing IT Support Issue**\n\nI'm working on categorizing this IT support issue. It's clear it's not related to hardware, storage, HR, access, purchase, or internal projects. It seems to center around ServiceNow notifications causing duplication issues with Change Request (CR) approvals. Given there\u2019s no explicit mention of access or rights, the best fit seems to be \"Miscellaneous.\" There\u2019s no specific category for ServiceNow or IT Service Management, so I'll format the final answer in JSON with the appropriate category.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
