The user wants to add a new member to what seems to be a \"managers list,\" which could relate to a distribution or mailing list. The context suggests that \"Access\" fits better, as it focuses on adding users rather than permissions. The mention of timing implies they're planning to do this on a Friday in October in the PM.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about the ticket for the internal project. \"Miscellaneous\" is too broad, so I want to be specific. Since the ticket is about adding a new member to a list (the managers list), the category \"Access\" seems most appropriate, as it indicates access to that list. I need to format my response correctly, so I\u2019ll output it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll keep it minimal, as it's all that's needed!"
