It seems to focus on access control and managing admin rights, so I\u2019m considering the categories at hand. The key phrases I'm seeing lead me to think that \"Administrative rights\" fits best since it directly addresses admin accounts and management of access rights, while \"Access\" also seems relevant. I'll go with \"Administrative rights.\"**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and it looks like I should respond with a JSON-like object. The schema indicates that I need to include a category property. I believe \"Administrative rights\" is the most fitting choice since it focuses on disabling admin accounts, which was a key part of the ticket's content. So, I'll format my response like this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} and ensure there\u2019s no extra commentary. Just a clean, concise JSON object is what's needed."
