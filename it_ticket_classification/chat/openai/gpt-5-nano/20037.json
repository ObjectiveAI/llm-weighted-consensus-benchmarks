The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\"\n\nThe ticket seems to mention Zephyr and includes a lot of procedural language, indicating it could be linked to test management. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Internal Project,\" potentially \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" too, but I'm considering the context carefully.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering the right category for this IT ticket. \"Internal Project\" seems the best fit since it relates to test cases, scripts, and procedures. \"Administrative rights\" isn't suitable since there's no clear access request, and \"Purchase\" could apply if it involved add-ons, but that's not explicit. \"Miscellaneous\" is a catch-all, yet I want to choose the most accurate. The content points to \"Internal Project,\" especially because of the references to Zephyr and test management. So, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and prepare a JSON output.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
