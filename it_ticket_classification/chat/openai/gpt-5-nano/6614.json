They mention \"wallet sonar\" and ask for resources related to an attached document. This could mean they\u2019re looking for help with hardware or software, but it doesn't specify anything like hardware or storage directly. I\u2019m thinking it might best fit into categories like \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll choose the most suitable one based on the context provided.**Deciding on an IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the user\u2019s request about resources, and I'm unsure if \"resources per attached\" means human resources for \"HR Support\" or something else. The term \"wallet sonar\" is unclear, but I see categories like \u201cInternal Project\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could fit depending on what they're asking. Since they mention resources related to an attachment, it might belong to \"Purchase.\" If nothing fits perfectly, I might label it \"Miscellaneous.\" Clarifying with the user would be a good idea, considering they want a specific category label.**Choosing an IT ticket category**\n\nThe phrase \"resources per attached\" sounds like a common procurement request. The user's message seems to be a bit off grammatically, likely meaning to say, \"Hi, please provide resources per the attached document. Important, add if possible. Thanks.\" It may imply they're asking to allocate resources for an attached plan. Since they didn\u2019t clearly request admin rights, I'm considering categories like \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I think I should propose \"Purchase\" as the primary category, explaining that it relates to resource procurement, while also mentioning \"Internal Project\" as a possible alternative.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI think we can streamline our response by categorizing the request primarily as \"Purchase,\" considering it relates to procuring resources mentioned in the attachment. If the attachment is about a project resource plan, \"Internal Project\" could also fit. If they're after access rights, then \"Access\" would be appropriate, but I think it leans more towards procurement in this case. I\u2019ll suggest a standardized message for confirmation, asking them to clarify: \"Please confirm if this is a procurement request for hardware/software resources per the attached document.\" Now, I should format this in the required JSON-like structure as well!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
