Since the main focus is access, I\u2019ll choose the \"Access\" category. I should format my response as a JSON object indicating the category as \"Access\" to meet the specified prompt requirements.**Confirming IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe system specifies that we need to provide a response in a specific category format. I\u2019ll go with the category \"Access\" since the ticket is about trouble accessing folders remotely, which fits best under that label. While I briefly considered \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" the context indicates it's an IT issue. I'll stick to the concise format and just provide the necessary JSON object as follows: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra commentary needed."
