They mentioned things like \"Windows installation,\" \"memory issues,\" and \"add solid drive.\" This seems to touch on hardware, storage, and some software installation aspects. I\u2019m thinking the best fitting category could be either Hardware, Storage, or Miscellaneous. Since they're trying to resolve memory issues possibly with an SSD, I'll lean towards the Storage category for the final classification.**Determining the category for IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like this IT ticket is mostly about hardware, including RAM and storage. The \"Hardware\" category could work well, as it encompasses memory and SSD installation. There's also the \"Storage\" category, which fits since it's about adding a solid drive. However, \"Windows installation\" suggests some software or OS deployment too. If I have to choose one, \"Hardware\" seems best because it covers the relevant upgrades, even though storage aspects are present as well.**Formatting the response in JSON**\n\nI need to deliver the response as a JSON-like object based on the provided schema. The structure indicates that the response should have a \"category\" field with a value chosen from specific strings. Therefore, something like {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} is what I should provide. The user asked to categorize this IT ticket, so I'll focus on delivering only that category as specified in the instructions. I\u2019m set to go ahead with \"Hardware.\""
