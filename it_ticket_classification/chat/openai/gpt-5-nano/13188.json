This sounds like it might fit under \"Administrative rights\" since it involves permissions and settings within an application. Alternatively, it could be classified as \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project,\" but it doesn\u2019t seem to relate to hardware, HR, or access. I think \"Administrative rights\" makes the most sense here!**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize an IT ticket related to a \"duplicate options for severity field\" and issues with the order of severity levels. It could be classified as \"Internal Project\" since it's about an internal tool. I also considered \"Administrative rights,\" but that's more about access management, and this is more of a UI/UX issue. \"Miscellaneous\" feels a bit too vague. Ultimately, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit here since it reflects the task accurately!**Formatting JSON category**\n\nI need to create a JSON-like structure for the category of an IT ticket. The instruction is clear: I need to output it in the specified format. Since the category is \"Internal Project,\" I'll format the response as follows:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nIt\u2019s essential to ensure it's exactly correct; the enum must match the allowed categories. There shouldn\u2019t be any extra text, just the JSON response as expected by the application. So I\u2019ll go with this structure!"
