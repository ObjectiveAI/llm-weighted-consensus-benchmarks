It mentions elements like \"new purchase PO,\" \"keyboard,\" and \"installation,\" which indicate a request related to procurement and hardware. I'll focus on these components. Given the context, this ticket best fits under the category of \"Purchase,\" as it relates to the procurement of a keyboard and the process involved in its installation.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm thinking this IT ticket can fit under two categories: \"Purchase\" since it discusses a new purchase order, and \"Hardware\" because it involves a keyboard and its installation. The ticket emphasizes logging installation and receipt submission. However, since it specifically mentions \"new purchase PO,\" I believe \"Purchase\" is the most appropriate category. It seems the user needs this categorized for an internal system, so I'll go with \"Purchase.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket seems to indicate a request for a new hardware purchase order and installation, so \"Purchase\" feels like the most fitting category. Options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" and \"Storage\" aren't relevant here. I\u2019m sure that \"Miscellaneous\" could be a possibility, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best choice. Therefore, I'll go with \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Let's keep it simple!"
