The phrases \"new starter center\" and \"starter form\" suggest this is related to HR onboarding. While it might touch on Access or Administrative rights due to mentions of forms to fill, the presence of \"HR Support\" in the categories makes it seem the most appropriate choice. I'll categorize it under HR Support, as it directly relates to onboarding processes.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating a ticket that likely falls under \"HR Support\" due to its focus on new starter forms and related processes. Phrases like \"new starter center\" suggest it\u2019s about onboarding. While it might also hint at \"Administrative rights\" depending on access requests, the main theme appears to be HR-related. I need to categorize it correctly, so I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I want to avoid misclassifications!**Finalizing category output**\n\nI\u2019ve concluded that this ticket is mainly about HR and onboarding, so it should be categorized as \"HR Support.\" I\u2019m going to present the response straightforwardly in a JSON format without any extra commentary. The required output will simply be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Keeping it clear and concise is the goal here! Now, I\u2019ll deliver that JSON object as instructed."
