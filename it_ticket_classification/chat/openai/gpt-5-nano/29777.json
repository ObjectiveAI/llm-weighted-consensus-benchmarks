The ticket likely relates to HR since it mentions a maternity leave form and an administration officer. I can eliminate categories like Hardware, Storage, and Access because they don't fit. The most fitting category here is \"HR Support,\" as the ticket seems directly connected to HR matters and the user's request for assistance.**Confirming Category Selection**\n\nI\u2019m tasked with categorizing an IT ticket for a maternity leave form, which is clearly related to HR. While categories like \"Internal Project\" and \"Administrative rights\" are available, \"HR Support\" perfectly fits the context. The specified output format is crucial since it needs to be a JSON-like object. So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It seems straightforward; this category aligns well with the user's request about maternity leave forms and administration officers.**Finalizing Category Response**\n\nThe user's message includes details about maternity leave and mentions an administration officer. I initially considered if it might fit into \"Administrative rights,\" but that doesn't align well with the context. The proper category is \u201cHR Support,\u201d so I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. While there's an option to provide reasoning, the instructions specify only the required category should be given in the final response to satisfy the API. So, I\u2019ll stick with just the JSON format."
