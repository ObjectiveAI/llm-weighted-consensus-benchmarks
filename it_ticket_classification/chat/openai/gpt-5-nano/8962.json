I see terms like \u201cinfrastructure architect\u201d and \u201cpipeline automation engineer\u201d which suggest this ticket is centered around IT hardware procurement. It seems to be all about planning, so I\u2019ll need to classify it accordingly.**Categorizing IT ticket correctly**\n\nIt looks like the user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket with the title \"it hardware forecast.\" Given the mention of job titles and roles, there might be an HR aspect, but the primary focus seems to be on hardware. The logical category would be \"Hardware.\" I should respond with a JSON object format, specifically: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, ensuring I stick to the assignment's requirements without any extra text.
