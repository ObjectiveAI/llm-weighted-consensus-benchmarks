It mentions updating the owner for servers and refers to tickets and confluence. It\u2019s definitely necessary to clarify the ownership of the servers in this context.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket references \"analyst ext hub,\" which could hint at needing \"Administrative rights,\" but I'm not sure that fits perfectly. It focuses on ownership changes and access rights, and might belong in several categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights.\n\nThe mention of updating server ownership connects to access control, likely fitting \"Access\" due to logins and tickets. However, there\u2019s also a focus on ownership related to maternity leave, making \"Access\" seem most appropriate. Still, \"Administrative rights\" could apply for granting admin privileges.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I think the best fit is \"Access\" because it's mainly about ownership and server access. I'll respond with a JSON-like object that adheres to the required format, making sure to use the exact casing for \"Access.\" \n\nSo, I\u2019ll present it simply as `{\"category\":\"Access\"}` without any additional text, as per the user's request to keep it straightforward and strictly formatted."
