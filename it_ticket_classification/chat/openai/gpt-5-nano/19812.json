The ticket mentions Oracle issues related to technology and requisitioning. It seems to involve problems with selecting entity options and something about COP and rates. Although the text is a bit garbled, it seems like it relates to an ERP purchase requisition. Therefore, I'll classify it as a Purchase issue.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI see that this ticket is mainly about the purchase process and the Oracle system, specifically mentions \"requisitioning,\" \"entity option,\" and \"rate.\" It looks like a \"Purchase\" category issue since it directly relates to requisitioning. However, I also consider \"Administrative rights\" if it pertains to access or entitlements. But due to its focus on Oracle purchase requisition issues, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase.\" Now, I need to structure it correctly in JSON format for the response.\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
