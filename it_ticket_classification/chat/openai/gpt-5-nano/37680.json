The possible categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.\n\nParsing through the text, it talks about a disk increase notification, change requests, and pending approvals. It seems related to Storage due to the disk mention, but it could also fit other categories like Administrative rights or Internal Project. I'll assess it further!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing a Change Request that mentions \"CR\", a \"disk increase,\" and some tools. This ticket is related to logging issues in ServiceNow. I have categories to consider: Hardware, Storage, Purchase, Administrative rights, Internal Project, Miscellaneous, Access, and HR Support.\n\nSince it discusses a \"disk increase,\" it seems to point towards Storage, but the mention of \"server\" raises some questions too. I think the best fit is still Storage, so I'll respond with a JSON-like category value: \"Storage.\"{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
