It could potentially fit under multiple categories: Hardware for servers and workstations, Access for rights, and Administrative rights for permissions. But I wonder if we must choose just one category.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe task is to categorize an IT ticket about the need for servers. It seems to focus on computing resources. I\u2019m considering categorizing it under \"Hardware,\" since there\u2019s a request for servers and workstations. However, it could also fit \"Access\" if rights are needed. But since I need to choose just one category, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware,\" given the context. So, I\u2019ll respond with the required format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I need to make sure it\u2019s exactly as required."
