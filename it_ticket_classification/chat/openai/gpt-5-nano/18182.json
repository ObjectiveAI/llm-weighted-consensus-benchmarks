The message is a bit messy, and I have to choose from categories like \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the user mentions accessing the library and related forms, it seems this fits best under \"Access\" as it\u2019s about resource access. I'll format the output as a JSON object focusing on that category.**Categorizing IT access request**\n\nThe user is trying to access the leadership library, which likely involves permissions. They mention wanting to \"write file\" and reference related forms, so it sounds like an access request. I see phrases like \"admin rights\" or \"Administrative rights,\" which relate to user permissions and suggest that this could fall under \"Administrative rights.\" However, since it's more about access to a resource, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll output this as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
