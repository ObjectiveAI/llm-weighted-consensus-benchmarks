There's confusion, but it seems to center around a potential IT issue. My best guess is to classify it under \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" The phrase \u201clead twitter en\u201d is unclear; it might relate to the issue but I can't be certain about the context.**Analyzing email issue**\n\nIt seems like the user is requesting help with emails, possibly because something hasn't been working since Wednesday. The phrase \"not working on sent\" likely refers to issues with sending or accessing emails. There's mention of \"current certificates,\" which might indicate problems with TLS certificates. Given my limited categories, I think \"Access\" would be a good fit if it involves certificates. It could also fall under \"Administrative rights\" if elevated access is needed to resolve it. The ticket is quite unclear, though!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIn the context of IT ticket taxonomy, \"Access\" generally refers to login and permissions, often linked to certificates for server access. It seems to hint at needing \"Administrative rights\" if updates to TLS certificates are necessary. I guess \"Miscellaneous\" makes sense due to the lack of clarity. But because the user mentioned \"not working\" and \"certificates,\" I think \"Access\" could fit since it involves access-related issues. However, since certificates alone don't represent access, \"Miscellaneous\" will be my final choice. I'll respond with the category in JSON format: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
