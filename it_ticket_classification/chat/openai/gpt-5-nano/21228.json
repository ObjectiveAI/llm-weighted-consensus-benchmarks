Since the request is specifically for an extension cord, it aligns well with Hardware but could also fit under Purchase, as they are asking for a supply item. Since it involves a necessity for a hardware item, I\u2019ll categorize it under Hardware in my JSON output.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nFor this IT ticket request about an extension cord, I'm considering whether to categorize it as \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" Since it specifically asks for an extension cord, which is a hardware accessory, I'll choose \"Hardware.\" Although \"Purchase\" might make sense if it emphasized buying, the request doesn't mention cost or purchasing \u2014 it simply says the item is needed. So, I'll format my JSON object as {\"category\": \"Hardware\"} to address this."
