It also includes instructions like \"press ctrl alt delete\" that suggest it\u2019s about access. Given these details, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket under \"Access\u201d since it clearly addresses a password issue for an external user.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to confirm the category for this IT ticket. Given that it primarily revolves around a password change for an external user, I'd label it as \"Access.\" While there could be mentions of \"Administrative rights,\" the focus is clearly on accessing those passwords. The user's request does include terms like \"confidential,\" but my main job here is to categorize. So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object indicating the category as \"Access.\" Here\u2019s the output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
