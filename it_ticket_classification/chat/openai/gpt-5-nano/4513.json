The message is a bit unclear but mentions \u201cProject Tudor\u201d and \u201cmirroring resources,\u201d which could relate to data mirroring. It sounds like the user wants this ticket to fall under a specific category. I\u2019m leaning toward \u201cInternal Project\u201d since it refers to a project, but \u201cStorage\u201d could also fit if the resources relate to data. I need to determine the best fit.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI see that I need to categorize this IT ticket, and while I can ask for clarification, I want to make my best guess first. The message indicates something about mirroring resources, potentially involving \"discipline lead,\" likely referring to project governance. The phrase \"to project Tudor\" suggests it\u2019s related to Project Tudor. If it's about data mirroring, that could fit under \"Storage\" or \"Internal Project.\" I also need to consider \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" if they need extra permissions. It\u2019s a bit nuanced!**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI realize I need to finalize the best category for this IT ticket. Clearly, \"HR Support\" doesn't fit, and \"Miscellaneous\" is too vague. It seems \"Internal Project\" is the best option since the ticket relates to Project Tudor, making it more project-focused. The user\u2019s mention of \u201capplication discipline lead\u201d suggests they want to reach out for help related to this project. I'm focusing on presenting the category in the required JSON format, which should clarify the classification."
