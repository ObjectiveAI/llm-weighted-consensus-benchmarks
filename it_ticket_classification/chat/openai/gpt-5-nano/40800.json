They mentioned a \"problem joining meeting\" for induction, which sounds like an access issue with a virtual meeting system. Given the context, it seems best to classify this under the \"Access\" category. This fits since they\u2019re likely experiencing difficulty accessing the meeting rather than a hardware or any other issue. So, \"Access\" is my final choice!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for this IT ticket. While \"Administrative rights\" might relate to access permissions, the phrase \"problem joining meeting\" indicates that the user likely has access issues. So, \"Access\" is the most fitting category. I need to format my answer as a JSON-like object to meet instructions, specifically including the required \"category\" field. After careful thought, my response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s clear and straightforward!"
