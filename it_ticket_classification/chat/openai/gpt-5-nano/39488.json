Since the main issue revolves around a hardware request, \"Hardware\" seems to be the best fit. While \"Purchase\" could also apply, the focus is on the hardware aspect. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" for the output.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object following the system's \"category\" schema, which states the required format. The category I'll be using is \"Hardware.\u201d It's clear that the user requests categorization for the IT ticket and instructs an exact output in JSON format.\n\nI should check the formatting, but it seems that the application's requirement is to provide just the object without additional wrapper information. So I\u2019ll go ahead and output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I'll keep it simple and precise!"
