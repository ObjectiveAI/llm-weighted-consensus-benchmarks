My goal is to fit this ticket into one of several categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It's crucial to pick the right category based on the content. I'll carefully parse through the details to make sure I choose the appropriate one! Let's get started!**Analyzing job requirements**\n\nThis text is quite a mix, discussing various aspects of Jenkins jobs and tools like the test results analyzer, Protractor tests, copy artifact, Git, and the publisher. It looks like it's focused on installation and configuration requirements, including job parameters, logs, and how to handle outputs efficiently. There are mentions of enabling console output and various template setups. I need to sift through it carefully to extract the key requirements and details for each job. Let's get to work!**Determining category for ticket**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize the ticket, and it could fall under several options like \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it discusses \"job rights installed\" and mentions \"permissions,\" the \"Administrative rights\" category seems relevant. However, the ticket primarily focuses on requirements for CI/CD jobs, so \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit. I can rule out others like \"Hardware\" or \"HR Support.\" Let's go with \"Internal Project\" for clarity!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
