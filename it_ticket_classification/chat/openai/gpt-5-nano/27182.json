The key phrases include \"maternity leave,\" \"access card,\" and \"maternity starter form.\" It seems to relate to HR, but the mention of \"access card\" leans toward IT. \n\nI\u2019m deciding between \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights\" as possible categories. Since this seems to focus on forms associated with maternity leave, I think \"HR Support\" might be the best fit.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the ticket since it involves \"HR\" forms like \"maternity leaver form\" and \"maternity starter form.\" The available category is \"HR Support,\" which fits well. While \"Access\" could apply because of the mention of an \"access card,\" the main focus here is on HR-related maternity leave processes.\n\nGiven the ticket primarily involves HR forms, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and prepare to respond with a JSON object like: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize this IT ticket, and I'll keep it straightforward. I need to provide the final response as a JSON object, specifically following the required schema. \n\nThe possible categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and more. Based on the context, I've decided on \"HR Support.\" So, I\u2019ll format my answer like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It\u2019s essential to stick to the specified structure!"
