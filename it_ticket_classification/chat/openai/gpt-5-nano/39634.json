The ticket text mentions submission processes and manager notifications, which suggest it's likely HR-related or administrative. Since it specifically involves timecard submission, the most fitting category would be \"HR Support.\" Other options exist, but \"HR Support\" seems the most applicable based on the content about processes and approvals. I'll go with that to help clarify the issue!**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to categorize an IT ticket focused on a timecard error and process compliance. The most appropriate category is \"HR Support.\" It doesn't really fit under \"Access\" due to login issues. I need to format the response correctly as a JSON object. According to the instructions, I will output: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}` without any extra content. It\u2019s all about clarity and following the required format!"
