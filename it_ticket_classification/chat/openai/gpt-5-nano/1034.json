This involves recurring tasks, but \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Projects\" don't fit well. The category options are limited, so I might lean toward \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s indeed about a recurring task in SNOW.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT ticket. The text is pretty messy, mentioning things like \"operational summary restart\" and \"reboot task.\" Part of me thinks it could fit under \"Administrative rights,\" but that's not quite right. The \"Operations\" category isn\u2019t available, and \"Hardware\" doesn\u2019t apply either. \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a safe choice for this ambiguous ticket. So, I\u2019m leaning toward outputting the category as \"Miscellaneous.\"**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m weighing whether to categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project\" or if \"Miscellaneous\" is a better fit. The mention of \"new recurrent task\" and \"operational summary\" makes me think it relates to automation, which usually falls under \"Internal Project.\" However, since that category might not be specific enough, I think the safest bet is \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll provide the result in the specified JSON format as follows: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Sounds good!"
