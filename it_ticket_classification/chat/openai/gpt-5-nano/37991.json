They mention \"attachment snow is not being sent,\" which might refer to the ServiceNow tool. I should classify this ticket into one of the defined categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context, I think \"Miscellaneous\" might fit best, but I'm still piecing it together, so I\u2019ll be careful.**Analyzing IT Ticket Content**\n\nI think \"attachment snow is not being sent\" likely refers to issues with attachments in ServiceNow not being sent. The phrase \"contractor starter start date be created\" suggests they're asking for a start date for a contractor. I'm considering whether this falls under \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\" On one hand, it could relate to creating access or permissions for a contractor; on the other, it's possibly an HR-related IT task. I need to choose the best fit.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"starter start date be created\" likely indicates that the user wants to set a start date for a contractor, which points toward HR onboarding or access provisioning. The ticket could fall into the \"Access\" category since it deals with access rights and account provisioning. However, it does have strong HR relevance too. I'll need to select the best fitting category, keeping in mind that I can only choose one. It's a bit tricky!**Parsing IT Ticket Content**\n\nLet's break this down: \n\n\"Attachment snow is not being sent\" suggests that attachments, possibly from ServiceNow, are not included in notifications. Then we have \"contractor starter start date be created,\" indicating they likely want to establish a contractor's start date. \n\nThe phrase \"hi trying send usual but being sent\" might mean they\u2019re attempting to send something, but it\u2019s not working. \n\nThe ticket references the request, pointing to issues with attachments and the start date creation. I'm torn between categorizing this as \"Access\" or \"HR Support,\" but \"HR Support\" seems appropriate for onboarding tasks.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user's IT ticket indicates that \"contractor starter start date be created\" could relate to onboarding for creating a contractor's account and determining a start date. Typically, this falls under the \"Access\" category for account creation and permissions.\n\nWhile there's a mention of attachments not being sent, which isn't usually linked to access provisioning, the need for a contractor's start date strongly suggests that \"Access\" is the best fit.\n\nSo, I'll output the required JSON object as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
