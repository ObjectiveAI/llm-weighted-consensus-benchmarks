The ticket talks about creating a new starter\u2019s testing account and their access rights. Since it's about creating credentials, I think it fits best in the \"Access\" category, though \"Administrative rights\" could apply if elevated permissions are needed. Overall, it leans more towards Access. I'll prepare a JSON-like category object based on this.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
