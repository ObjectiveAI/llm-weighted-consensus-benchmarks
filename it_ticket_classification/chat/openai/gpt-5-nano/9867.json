The content suggests that it's related to access rights for those on maternity leave, which makes me think \"Access\" could be the right category. However, since it also touches on HR matters, \"HR Support\" is another suitable option. There's even a mention of \"administrator\" at the end, which might point to \"Administrative rights\" too. It's a bit tricky!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket text mentions \"maternity leaver access cards,\" which implies a request related to access provisioning or revocation for an employee on maternity leave. It seems the user is asking to handle access cards for someone who's leaving. I believe the \"Access\" category fits best since it's specifically about access cards. The output should be a JSON object reflecting this, with the correct format as required. So I'll prepare a JSON-like response indicating the \"Access\" category!**Finalizing JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with the JSON object reflecting the category as \"Access.\" The proper structure is outlined, but it seems I ought to just include the category field based on previous tasks. So, my response will be straightforward: I'll provide the JSON object without any additional text. Just to be clear: it should be in the format {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's make sure it's clean and free of any extra formatting."
