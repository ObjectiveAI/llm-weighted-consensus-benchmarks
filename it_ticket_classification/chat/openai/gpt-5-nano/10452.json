Based on its content, it seems to be related to hardware since it talks about monitors. It could also fall under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but I think \"Hardware\" fits best. Since the user asked for a specific category, I'll respond in JSON format with the most appropriate category being \"Hardware.\"**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI'm looking at the schema for the IT ticket categorization, which tells me to output a JSON object with a category field. While I could consider \"Miscellaneous\" because the request isn't clear, the repeated mention of \"monitor\" really points to it being hardware. So, I'll just go ahead with the category \"Hardware.\" It's crucial to format this correctly, so I'll ensure to respond with just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
