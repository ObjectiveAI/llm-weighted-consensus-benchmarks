However, considering the user's role as an engineer asking for assistance, I think \"Access\" fits best, especially regarding account logging and server file transfers.**Categorizing IT Ticket Further**\n\nI'll consider that \"Storage\" could fit if it's about transferring files to server storage, and \"Internal Project\" is unclear. However, the user's message suggests it's mostly about accessing an account and file transfer on a server. So, I think \"Access\" is the primary category here.\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object following the specified format. The output should look like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This matches the defined schema, so I'll make sure to present it correctly!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
