They mention things like \"cannot find staff pass\" and possibly requesting help with some access codes, among other things. It seems like they're experiencing access issues, which might fit under the \"Access\" category. There\u2019s also a mention of a programme portfolio officer, so I\u2019ll lean towards categorizing it as \"Access,\" since that seems most relevant.**Categorizing Access Requests**\n\nI\u2019m determining the right category for this user ticket. It looks like \"Access\" fits best since the user mentions \"pass,\" \"code,\" and adding someone - likely referring to permissions. The term \"programme portfolio officer\" might be linked to their role. I need to format my output correctly as a JSON object according to the schema provided. I\u2019ll keep it simple and respond with just the category as: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without adding any extra text."
