Given this information, I\u2019ll need to classify it under one of our categories. From what I see, it's primarily about purchases and receipts. The best fit would be \"Purchase,\" but I also wonder if it could fall under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project.\" However, I think \"Purchase\" is the most appropriate category here.**Responding with category**\n\nI\u2019m confirming that the best fit for the ticket is \"Purchase.\" I ruled out categories like \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project.\" I need to respond with a JSON object for clarity and follow the required format. Since the instructions specifically ask for the category, I\u2019ll keep it succinct and straightforward. So, I\u2019ll present it as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} and ensure it meets the request without extra explanation. I'll go ahead and finalize that response."
