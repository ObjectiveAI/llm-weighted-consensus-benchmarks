The content seems to point towards onboarding, which might fit into the \"Access\" category, considering it likely involves permissions or forms needed to get started. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object with the appropriate category selected. This should streamline handling the user\u2019s request efficiently!**Deciding on the category**\n\nIt seems like the user\u2019s request could fall under \"HR Support,\" especially since they referenced a \"starter form,\" which is likely related to onboarding. While \"Access\" might come to mind for provisioning, the context leans more towards HR tasks. Given the clues like \"new starter\" and the purpose of the form, I\u2019m deciding to categorize this as \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object without any extra text, just: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Finalizing the categorization**\n\nI\u2019m double-checking the categorization again. While \"Administrative rights\" could be considered since they mentioned filling out a starter form, I believe \"HR Support\" is still the better fit, especially given the context of onboarding. The specific mention of \"Bucharest Thursday November PM\" doesn\u2019t seem crucial for categorization. So, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object indicating the category. Keeping it straightforward, it will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
