It's poorly worded but seems to concern a meeting room not connecting, with repeated problems and cable connections checked. \"MR\" likely refers to \"Meeting Room.\" So, the key issue appears to be a problem with the meeting room projector or AV connection. I'm considering categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project,\" but I need to focus on the main connectivity problem.**Assigning IT ticket category**\n\nI have a list of categories for the IT ticket: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given that the problem is about hardware or AV equipment connectivity in a meeting room, \"Hardware\" seems to be the best fit. It could also be \"Access\" if there are login issues, but it mainly revolves around the projector and related equipment. So, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Hardware,\" and respond accordingly with the output structured as a JSON-like object.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
