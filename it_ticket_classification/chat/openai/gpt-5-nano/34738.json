I realize they expect a proper JSON object format, specifically returning something like: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} since it seems the right choice. I need to ensure the format matches their requirements, with \"Hardware\" spelled exactly as specified. I'll settle on that as my response!**Delivering final category**\n\nGot it! I need to provide just the category line without any extra text since the user asked to categorize an IT ticket, not for reasoning. The final response should be exactly: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I also need to keep it clean and straightforward, avoiding heavy formatting, as the system may parse it directly. So, I\u2019ll make sure to deliver that JSON object alone without any fluff!"
