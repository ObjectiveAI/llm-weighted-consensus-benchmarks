It seems to mention infrastructure, queries, and costs related to moving machines. The potential categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" I\u2019m leaning towards \"Internal Project\" since it focuses on infrastructure planning and costs, but \"Purchase\" and \"Storage\" also seem plausible due to the mention of costs and hardware. It's a bit tricky!**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the categories for the IT ticket. The options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. \u201cInternal Project\u201d fits well since it relates to planning an infrastructure move, but there\u2019s also a possibility of it being categorized as \u201cPurchase\u201d due to costs. The main focus is on infrastructure planning, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \u201cInternal Project\u201d and respond with a JSON object that includes the category field.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
