The ticket is unclear, but it seems to be about adding everyone to Active Directory (AD) on Friday PM. Given the mention of AD access, Access seems the most relevant category. Administrative rights could also be relevant, but it doesn\u2019t seem like an Internal Project. Omitted transition users might suggest some user changes involved too.**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nThe main action in the ticket is the request to \"add to everybody ad,\" which points to access management. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as Access. While I wonder if Administrative Rights fits, it seems more about provisioning access to AD rather than granting admin privileges. I need to output a JSON object for the system\u2019s category field. The user is likely expecting just the category value, so I'll provide: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. Let's keep it clean."
