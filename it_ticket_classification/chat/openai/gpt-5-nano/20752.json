The ticket mentions a \"new purchase,\" which leads me to think it should fall under the \"Purchase\" category. The mention of \"hi pro retina intel kb\" potentially relates to a MacBook Pro Retina keyboard, while \"please create installation\" suggests they want installation by an administrator. I'm piecing this together from the somewhat jumbled message. Let's settle on \"Purchase\" for the category.**Parsing IT ticket details**\n\nThe ticket states \"new purchase Thursday February pm\" and includes a jumble of terms. It seems they\u2019re asking for the installation of a new hardware item, likely a MacBook Pro or its keyboard. The reference to an \"administrator\" suggests they might need admin rights for installation. Since the ticket mentions \"new purchase,\" I believe the most fitting category here is \"Purchase.\" Although \"Hardware\" and \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, I'll settle on \"Purchase\" as the primary category.**Determining ticket category**\n\nLet's break down the categories we have: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The user's mention of \"new purchase\" clearly points to the \"Purchase\" category. While it could also relate to \"Hardware,\" procurement requests like this fit best under \"Purchase.\" Now, I should format the response as a JSON object containing the category. So, it should be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to stick to that specific format without any extra text!"
