The categories to consider are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" as it involves permissions. \"Access\" suggests it's about control, while \"Administrative rights\" pertains to overall rights. There might also be relation to \u201cInternal Project\u201d if it\u2019s linked to ongoing tasks. The mention of \u201cowner\u201d hints at cross-functional permissions for task management.**Deciding IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m trying to decide between categorizing the IT ticket as \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" The user wants to modify ownership, which relates to access control. While \"Administrative rights\" specifies admin privileges, \"Access\" is broader and indicates granting permissions. Since the request is about adding an owner, I\u2019m leaning toward \"Access\" as it captures the essence of granting permission. Ultimately, \u201cAccess\u201d feels more suitable here to reflect the change in ownership control."
