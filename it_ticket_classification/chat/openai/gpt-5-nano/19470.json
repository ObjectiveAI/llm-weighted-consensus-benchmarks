They mentioned things like \"new purchase po\" and \"purchased cable,\" which hints that it's about buying a cable. The content also includes details about logging an installation and receipts. So, I'm evaluating between the \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware\" categories. Since it emphasizes the purchase order and receipts, I'll go with the \"Purchase\" category as the most fitting choice.**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket and respond in a specific JSON format. The instruction clearly requires a \"category\" field, and I can designate \"Purchase\" as the category based on the user's request. I\u2019ll ensure that my response is structured properly, so it looks like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I should keep it concise and avoid adding extra commentary since the format specifies just the JSON object. Alright, let\u2019s deliver that response!"
