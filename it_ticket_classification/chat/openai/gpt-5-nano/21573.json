The user mentions \"retain installed machine,\" which I think means to keep the existing machine. Since \"Infrastructure\" comes up, it could relate to the hardware department. I also see references to \"Administrative rights,\" but that\u2019s not explicit. \"Purchase\" might suggest buying a new machine. However, to be safe, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Hardware\" because of the mention of machines and installation.**Delivering IT ticket response**\n\nI'm going to respond with a JSON object that includes the category as \"Hardware.\" The instruction is clear to output just the category object, so I'll keep it straightforward. It might be nice to add a brief note for clarity, but since the instructions specifically say only to provide the object, I\u2019ll stick to that. So, my final response will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
