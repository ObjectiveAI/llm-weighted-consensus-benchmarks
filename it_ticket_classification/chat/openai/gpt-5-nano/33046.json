It looks like it's asking for access to \"Projects Oracle,\" implying this is related to Administrative rights or Access. I'll assign an appropriate category based on that understanding.**Categorizing access request**\n\nThe user wants to categorize a request involving adding all projects to Oracle Projects. This could imply they need access or administrative rights for the system. \"Internal Project\" seems more about IT tasks, while \"Administrative rights\" covers admin privileges for accessing the system. Since the ticket's goal is categorization, it\u2019s not fully clear, but \"Administrative rights\" aligns more closely with enabling access. However, \"Access\" could also fit as it's a related category, so I\u2019ll choose the best match.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe request \"add all projects to projects oracle\" likely means adding all projects to Oracle Projects, which is a bulk operation needing admin rights to modify the system. Since the user is asking me to categorize this ticket, the best fits might be \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" If it's related to an internal IT project, \"Internal Project\" could work, but since it\u2019s unclear, \"Miscellaneous\" might also be appropriate given the vagueness of the request.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nTo categorize the ticket correctly, I see it\u2019s about adding all projects to Oracle Projects. This seems more like a request for \"Access\" or an administrative action. \"Administrative rights\" is a more precise choice among the allowed categories. Since the prompt specifically asks for a category, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object, ensuring the format is correct. I\u2019ll provide this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} without any additional text."
