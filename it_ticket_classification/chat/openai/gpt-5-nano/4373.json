They\u2019re asking for help with \"ServiceNow automatic notifications\" and other specific terms like \"EMS resolution procedure\" and \"tool limitations.\" So, it seems this ticket might fit into a specific category. The available options are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I'll choose the most appropriate category based on these terms.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket seems to focus on IT service management, primarily involving ticket workflows and notifications that close automatically after resolution. The categories available don\u2019t include \"ITSM/ServiceNow\" or \"Operations,\" which makes it tricky. I\u2019m considering options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access.\" Since it involves workflows and permissions, \"Administrative rights\" might be the best fit. I\u2019ll have to weigh these possibilities carefully to choose the most appropriate category.**Parsing the IT Ticket**\n\nLet\u2019s break down this ticket topic. It talks about \"service now automatic notifications\" and mentions several aspects like \"resolve notification to be changed,\" \"EMS resolution procedure,\" and the process of amendments. There are phrases about response times, automatic closures, and tool limitations that hinder users' ability to respond. It seems crucial to identify the areas where corrections should be allowed after closure. I need to consider how best to classify this ticket based on these details.**Categorizing ServiceNow Ticket**\n\nThis ticket focuses on changing automatic notifications in ServiceNow, specifically regarding notifications sent when a case is resolved and the implications of automatic closure. It also touches on timeframes for resolution, tool limitations, and ensuring users can respond effectively. I\u2019m contemplating the right category\u2014though \"Administrative rights\" relates more to permissions, it doesn't quite fit the notification focus. While \"Internal Project\" might work for change requests, \"Access\" could be appropriate since it mentions users' ability to respond. I'll consider those options carefully.**Finalizing Category Assignment**\n\nThis ticket isn\u2019t about access rights or categories like \"Purchase,\" \"Hardware,\" or \"Storage.\" It seems \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d is a possibility since it involves changes to notification rules. However, for typical IT categorization, \u201cInternal Project\u201d fits better since it concerns process improvements in ServiceNow. Therefore, I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project.\" I'll respond with a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\u2014keeping it concise and ensuring it matches the required formats. Let's keep the explanation minimal and follow through!"
