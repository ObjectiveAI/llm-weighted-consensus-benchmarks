It could fall under \"Administrative rights\" if it focuses on permissions for adding admin contributions. However, it might also fit under \"Access,\" which is a more general category. Given the phrases \"contribute rights\" and \"add pages,\" this suggests a request for editing permissions. I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"Administrative rights\" because it's specific to rights and permissions, despite \"Access\" being a safe choice too. Ultimately, I\u2019ll choose \"Administrative rights.\"**Formatting IT ticket category**\n\nI need to properly format this in a JSON object based on the category schema. I\u2019m debating between two categories: \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The term \"contribute rights\" suggests permissions tied to content rather than admin-level controls, making \"Access\" feel more fitting. The user's request mentions \"add pages,\" which leans towards editing rights rather than administrative capabilities. So, it seems clear that I should categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
