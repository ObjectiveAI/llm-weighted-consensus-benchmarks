This likely falls under the \"Access\" category since that\u2019s about login problems. However, \"Administrative rights\" might also apply. The mention of \"manager\" indicates it could be forwarded to management-related support as well.**Proposing category for IT ticket**\n\nSince the issue relates to logging in, \"Access\" seems like the best category. I\u2019ll propose: Category: Access, with a brief justification that the user can\u2019t log in and is looking for a solution from their manager. If needed, clarifying questions could include whether they see an error message, which system they are using, if they are blocked by a password, using a VPN, or part of the corporate network. However, the main response will just be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
