There's mention of \"discipline,\" which could relate to design workflows or internal projects. It might also indicate HR support if it's about designers. Since the term \"discipline\" is repeated, it may signal a naming issue, possibly suggesting a request to add it to a category. I need to find the best fit for classification based on this context.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm considering that the mention of \"designers\" might relate to a specific team. The phrase \"tickets designers\" could mean either design tickets or that the tickets are created by designers. The note \"thank specialist\" suggests appreciation towards someone\u2014though it feels a bit unclear, so asking for clarification seems wise. However, since the instruction is to categorize, my best guess is \"Internal Project,\" given the context of new discipline and designers. I'll go ahead and output a JSON object with that category.**Formatting the response**\n\nI want to make sure I'm following the required format correctly. It looks like I just need to output a JSON object with the category \"Internal Project.\" The instructions indicate that it should be presented as plain text, which simplifies things. So, my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I'm ready to proceed with that! This should meet the requirements perfectly."
