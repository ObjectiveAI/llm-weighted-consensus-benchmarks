The ticket mentions \"access to folders\" multiple times, which signals it's likely about access permissions. Phrases like \"joiner today\" could indicate onboarding, and \"head tax treasury\" might refer to a specific department. \n\nConsidering these elements, I think the most fitting category would be \"Access.\" However, if the request leans more towards permissions, \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI think access generally refers to grants for using folders, while \"Administrative rights\" is about specific admin access. Since the user specifically mentions \"access to folders\" and not \"admin rights,\" it\u2019s clear that the right category is \"Access.\" This ticket appears to be an IT request for provisioning access for a new joiner today. So, I\u2019ll output the category in the required JSON-like format as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}  \n\nThat feels good to deliver concisely!"
