I have a list of options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I need to think about the details of the ticket to see which category fits best. Each option has its own context, so I want to get this right. It\u2019s important to clearly define the issue to ensure it\u2019s directed to the right team!**Categorizing IT ticket content**\n\nI need to categorize the user's input as an IT ticket regarding a meeting room phone issue. The description mentions problems with ports, extensions, and logs, alongside details about checked devices and cables. It seems pretty complicated, but I want to ensure I place it in the right category. The user's concerns about the meeting room's functionality need proper attention to get things resolved efficiently, so accurately categorizing this is essential for the next steps!**Categorizing as Hardware**\n\nThis issue is primarily about hardware, specifically the phones and network ports. So, categorizing it as \"Hardware\" makes the most sense. While there are some mentions of \"log queue site\" and \"environment print,\" the main concern is that the meeting room phone port isn't working. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object that aligns with the required format. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, ensuring no extra text is included. Here\u2019s the output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
