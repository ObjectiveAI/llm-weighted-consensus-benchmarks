The content mentions \"requisitions\" a few times and includes phrases like \"generic update\" and \"clearing analyst.\" It seems related to purchasing or procurement, so the \"Purchase\" category might be the best fit. Since the user asked me to categorize this ticket, I need to create a JSON object with the selected category. I\u2019m ready to finalize this!**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether this ticket fits into \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\", but based on the content, it mentions \"address requisitions\" and \"generic update.\" It seems they want to add \"generic requisitions,\" so \"Purchase\" appears to be the right category since requisitions relate to buying. It seems unlikely to be \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" based on the information. So, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} and confirm that format!**Responding with JSON**\n\nThe instruction clearly states that I need to respond with a categorized object, and it might be best to output only the JSON. It mentions that the output may need to be parsed or displayed in an app and that the \"category\" format is expected. I\u2019ll ensure to provide the response in the exact JSON format without any extra details. So, let's go ahead and keep it straightforward with the necessary JSON!"
