The prompt highlights categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. The user's description includes terms related to repairs and equipment, including mentions of a personal computer, a keyboard not working, and damage from a tea spill. It seems clear that this issue is related to hardware, particularly a keyboard replacement or repair.**Confirming the category**\n\nThe category for the IT ticket is clearly \"Hardware.\" I should generate a JSON object with that category as the output. The system expects a specific format that includes defining \"type\" and \"properties,\" but it seems I just need to return the category without extra text. Thus, I\u2019ll produce the JSON structure simply as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, which aligns with the expected schema. It seems I'm all set for the output!**Finalizing the response**\n\nThe final answer should definitely be in the format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I'm double-checking to make sure there isn't any ambiguity, given the ticket mentions \"repair,\" \"replacement,\" \"keyboard,\" and \"PC\" due to a tea spill. The \"Hardware\" category is indeed appropriate. While I might want to provide a brief explanation, the instructions specify that I should keep it concise and focus solely on the category. So, I'll stick with just the category response."
