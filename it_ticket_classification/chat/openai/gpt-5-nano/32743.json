It mentions elements like \"link holiday requests\" and \"pm level,\" which could relate to IT project management or administrative rights. Since they want to update the project code, I\u2019m leaning toward \"Internal Project\" or \"Access.\" If it's about changing access rights or admin tasks, \"Administrative rights\" could also fit.**Analyzing ticket categories**\n\nI'm evaluating the user's request to change a project code. It seems to fit into the \"Internal Project\" category because it's about system changes, and there's no hardware or purchase involved. HR Support is irrelevant, and \"Access\" doesn't quite apply since it's not strictly about permissions. However, \"Administrative rights\" might work since changing the code may require special privileges. I need to decide whether to classify it as \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket. The content mentions \"change project code\" and \"link pm level,\" indicating it's likely related to an internal project management system. Therefore, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best category. I\u2019ll need to output a JSON object that fits the schema provided. The required format is straightforward, so I\u2019ll stick to that and respond with exactly: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. No additional commentary needed!"
