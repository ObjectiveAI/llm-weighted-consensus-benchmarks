The user ticket describes an error related to tasks that aren\u2019t submitting correctly, specifically mentioning \"pre sales\" tasks. This likely falls under an Internal Project or similar issue. I need to read through the information and decide the most appropriate category.**Evaluating Ticket Categorization**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket, which mentions \"add pre sales tasks code,\" \"cannot resolve,\" and \"end month,\" focusing on terms like \"submit\" and \"tasks.\" I can rule out categories like Hardware, HR, Access, and Storage. \"Administrative rights\" doesn't apply either. \"Internal Project\" stands out as the best fit since it seems to relate to a system for entering tasks. It may involve a bug in an internal project management tool. \"Miscellaneous\" could also be an option, but \"Internal Project\" seems most appropriate.**Determining Category for Ticket**\n\nI'm considering whether this ticket could fit under \"Access,\" since it mentions errors with task submission. However, it doesn't seem related to access rights since tasks can be entered, but submission fails. The most appropriate category appears to be \"Internal Project,\" given that it's about project management and task submission issues. \n\nI'll output the category in a JSON format as required: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}` without any extra text, to keep it clear and straightforward.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
