Considering these key topics, I think it fits best under the \"Access\" category. The reference to \"new PAS\" indicates it's about accessing a new system.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe category for this ticket should likely be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" as they're requesting access to something. They mention \"new PAS,\" which sounds like a new system, along with terms like \"old right\" and \"urgency.\" Since they're specifically asking for access to something, I think \"Access\" is the best fit. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply, it doesn't seem explicitly requested here. So, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" \n\nThe output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
