The content mentions \"starter forms,\" \"new starter,\" and \"intern,\" which suggest it's about HR onboarding. Phrases like \"fill starter form\" and \"attached filled starter forms\" further point to HR Support as the main category. I should probably place this ticket under HR Support since it seems related to onboarding processes. Access might also be relevant, but HR seems to be the primary focus.**Categorizing IT ticket content**\n\nI'm looking at the categories, and this ticket seems to be about onboarding forms for a new starter, based on phrases like \"starter form\" and \"intern.\" The closest match would be \"HR Support.\" There is a possibility it could also relate to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but given its frequent mention of forms, \"HR Support\" feels like the best fit. This ticket is primarily about onboarding, so I think categorizing it under HR Support makes the most sense.**Deciding on category response**\n\nThe content focuses on onboarding forms rather than access rights, so I am leaning toward categorizing it as \"HR Support.\" The system expects a response in a JSON-like format, and based on the prompt to categorize the IT ticket, I think the final output should simply be {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This keeps things clear and meets the format required. I\u2019ll make sure to follow this structure and deliver just the category value in the final response.**Finalizing category output**\n\nThe instructions are clear that I need to produce the category in a specific format. Since the schema indicates that the answer should be a JSON object with a \"category\" property, I\u2019ll follow that approach. The safest route is to provide a simple JSON object like {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I'll make sure not to include any extra text or trailing spaces to keep it neat. So, I\u2019ll respond with just that JSON object."
