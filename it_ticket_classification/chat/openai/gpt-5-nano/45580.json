It seems like this could fit into \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" because of the focus on approvals and access to the contract system. However, \"Internal Project\" might also apply since it involves contract workflow. I need to decide which category best fits the content.**Categorizing IT ticket issues**\n\nThe user provided a message with a lot of grammar issues, discussing an approval flow and reasons for contracts approaching approval. It looks like a request tied to \"Purchase\" since it mentions contracts and SOW (statement of work) related to procurement. It could also fall into \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" if it\u2019s about changes to approver settings. I need to decide which category makes the most sense based on the context given.**Interpreting approval flow issues**\n\nThe user's message suggests there's a problem with the approval workflow. It mentions a lead appointment for contract SOW work and requests clarification on why the contract goes for approval even with an approver set. I\u2019m considering if this fits best as \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project.\" It seems related to project workflow, so \"Internal Project\" might be a better fit. However, since it involves workflow configuration, \"Administrative rights\" could apply too, but that\u2019s a bit broader. \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option if it doesn\u2019t fit neatly.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
