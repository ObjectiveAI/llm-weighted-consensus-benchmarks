Since there's no \"Networking\" category, the best choices seem to be \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Hardware.\" Given it's likely a software/driver issue, I'll lean towards \"Miscellaneous,\" which captures general IT problems that don't fit neatly elsewhere.**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering which category to assign for an IT ticket about wireless connection speed issues after a Windows upgrade. It could be categorized as \"Hardware\" if it's viewed as a hardware issue related to the wireless card, but since the concerns stem from a software driver problem, \"Miscellaneous\" seems more appropriate. I'll provide the required JSON format for the category. So, my output will simply be: `{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}`. I might also offer to add notes, but the focus is just on delivering that JSON."
