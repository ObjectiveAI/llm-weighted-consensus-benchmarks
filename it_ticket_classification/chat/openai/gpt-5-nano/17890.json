The categories I can choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The input isn't well-structured, but it seems to pertain to access or ownership on the web development side. I'm leaning towards categorizing this ticket under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\"**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"add owner lists interviewers,\" which hints at adding owners to some distribution lists. It could relate to assigning a new owner to web development lists as well. The date \"Tuesday PM\" is included, but what stands out are the categories to choose from. \"Administrative rights\" covers ownership assignments, while \"Access\" deals with granting access to resources. Since it appears to lean towards adding a new owner or distribution lists, I might consider those two categories most relevant. I need to output this as a JSON object with the appropriate category.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nI need to create a JSON object to categorize the ticket, which might be \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" Let's break down the ticket text: it looks a bit messy and likely comes from a user note. Phrases like \"new owner to web development lists\" suggest assigning a new owner, while \"Tuesday PM\" indicates timing. The repetition of \"owner lists\" and \"interviewers\" might imply adding an owner for the lists or even for interviewers. The \"lead\" part might refer to a project lead as well.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nWhen looking at typical IT ticket categories, \"Administrative rights\" involves changing admin permissions, while \"Access\" pertains to granting access. \"Internal Project\" covers project management tasks, and \"HR Support\" is related to human resources. Here, the best fit seems to be \"Access\" since the ticket discusses adding an owner to web development lists, which involves granting permissions. Although \"Internal Project\" could be relevant, the focus on \u201cowner\u201d strongly suggests permissions. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
