There's a lot about delegation, centralizing tasks, and troubleshooting scripts related to permissions and user roles. It seems like it would best fit into the \"Administrative rights\" category due to recurring themes around access and permissions.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, and it really boils down to two options: Access or Administrative rights. The ticket discusses permission management, authentication, and access control, which seems essential to the issues presented. However, since it's mainly about granting and revoking admin rights as well as dealing with permissions across systems, I think the best fit is \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nSo, I'll format my output as a JSON-like object with \"category\" designated as Administrative rights.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
