The ticket requests a new Confluence space for the infrastructure discipline and includes various permissions and member additions. I need to find the best category from the options available, which include \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Internal Project.\" It seems like \"Access\" might fit well since it deals with permissions, but \"Administrative rights\" also matches, and it could be related to an internal project. Let's clarify this!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to choose the most suitable category for this IT ticket, which involves creating a new Confluence space and managing permissions. The options include \"Access,\" which relates to permissions and adding members, and \"Administrative rights,\" which fits well since it specifically mentions creating spaces. Given that there's a specific category called \"Administrative rights,\" that seems like the right choice. I\u2019ll prepare the response in a JSON format to align with the requirements.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
