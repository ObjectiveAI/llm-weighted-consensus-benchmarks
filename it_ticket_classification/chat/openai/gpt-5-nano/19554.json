Considering the phrases like \"latest updates locked\" and \"unable to make needed changes,\" it seems like an access issue. While \"Internal Project\" could apply since there's mention of a contract, this mainly revolves around access rights to update something. So, I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate category here.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI see there's an \"Administrative rights\" category separate from \"Access,\" so I need to figure out where the ticket fits best. The user is asking for updates on a contract, but those updates are locked. This indicates a permissions issue. Since \"Administrative rights\" focuses on the permissions to edit, that might be the right fit. However, \"Access\" covers overall access problems. I'll lean towards \"Administrative rights\" since it's more specific to the permissions needed for these updates.**Classifying ticket category**\n\nThe user's message includes terms like \"updates locked\" and \"cannot make needed changes,\" which indicates a permission issue. They seem to be asking for updates that they can't perform themselves, likely due to access restrictions. While \"Access\" is a common category for such problems, I think \"Administrative rights\" is more appropriate since it specifically addresses the absence of permissions necessary to edit the contract. Although there\u2019s also a mention of contract details, it doesn\u2019t strongly point to \"Internal Project.\" So, I'll classify it as \"Administrative rights.\"{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
