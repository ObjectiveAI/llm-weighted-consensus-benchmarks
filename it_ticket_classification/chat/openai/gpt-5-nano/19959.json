It\u2019s a little tricky, but I\u2019m figuring it out!**Clarifying IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nThe user's request to \"please add mobile\" might relate to adding a mobile device or user access. The text is unclear, mentioning something like \"am mobile SN Thursday March.\" I think we should consider categorizing this ticket under \"Hardware\" if it's about a mobile device, or \"Access\" if it pertains to user permissions. It could help to ask clarifying questions, but since the user requested a category, I'd choose \"Hardware\" as it seems most fitting for this situation.**Outputting IT Ticket JSON**\n\nThe ticket refers to a \"serial number\" and requests to \"add mobile.\" Based on this, I think \"Hardware\" is the right category. I need to output a JSON object in the required format, as the instructions suggest. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. While \"Access\" might apply if it meant adding to a user account, \"mobile SN\" indicates it's more about managing a hardware asset. I should skip additional commentary and just provide the JSON object to meet the schema requirements. Let's generate that!"
