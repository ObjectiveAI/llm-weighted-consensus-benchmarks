I'll map it to appropriate categories such as Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. Considering the mention of the access card, it likely falls under the Access category. The final output should be a JSON-like object specifying this category.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe text I\u2019m looking at seems a bit jumbled but includes mentions of \"access card,\" \"updates,\" and \"workstation.\" It points towards the Access category, as it's clearly about managing access with cards. While \"Administrative rights\" or \"Hardware\" could make sense, \"Access\" seems the most appropriate here. I need to respond with a JSON object formatted exactly like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's crucial to stick to that format in my final output."
