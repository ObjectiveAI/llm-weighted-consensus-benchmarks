It mentions problems like accessing a feedback survey, cache clearing, and a license request. The categories provided include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Since the primary issue is about not accessing the feedback survey, I think \u201cAccess\u201d is the most suitable category. I\u2019m wondering if the license part fits under Purchase or Internal Project, but Access feels right overall.**Choosing JSON format for categorization**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to go with \"Access\" as the main theme because the text mentions being \"unable to access feedback survey sent Tuesday.\" It fits the Access category perfectly. The response format requires using JSON to output the category as a string, so I need to format it correctly according to the provided instructions. I'll create a JSON object that looks like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Keeping it concise is essential, with no extra commentary."
