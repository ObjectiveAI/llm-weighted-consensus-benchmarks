Since it talks about displays that are logged as unavailable, it seems related to hardware, specifically AV equipment. However, it could also fall under \"Access\" because of the restricted nature of the room. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" for now.**Categorizing IT Issue**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this ticket, from options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. The issue involves a meeting room where displays aren\u2019t working, which clearly points to a hardware problem. However, it\u2019s possible there\u2019s a need for access to a restricted room, which could suggest \"Access\" or even \"Administrative rights\" if they need permission. But since the displays are unavailable, I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit. I should format my response as a JSON object.**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nThe ticket states that the \"logged displays are unavailable,\" which definitely points to a hardware issue. So, I'm deciding to categorize this as \"Hardware.\" I need to make sure I'm following the response format correctly, which should be a JSON object with the category field. I don\u2019t think \"Miscellaneous\" fits here at all. So, I\u2019ll finalize my answer as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to keep it concise and clear."
