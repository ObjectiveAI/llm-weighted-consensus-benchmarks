So, I should respond with a JSON object that clearly states the category: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to follow the exact schema provided!**Confirming ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the ticket details, which include phrases like \u201cassigned to purchasing team,\u201d \u201cpurchase category,\u201d and \u201curgent purchase description.\u201d It clearly relates to buying something, confirming it falls under the Purchase category. I momentarily considered if it could be \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" but that's irrelevant here. So, my final response needs to be a JSON object stating the category as \"Purchase.\" I'll avoid any extra commentary to keep it succinct!"
