The ticket text is about giving rights to users and modifying attributes, which suggests it relates to Active Directory. It could fit under \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d or \u201cAccess.\u201d Since it's specifically about requesting admin privileges, \"Administrative rights\" seems like the best choice, but \"Access\" might work too for a more general approach.**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nSince the ticket is about modifying attributes in Active Directory, it seems to relate to administrative rights. I\u2019m deciding between \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d and \u201cAccess.\u201d While \u201cAccess\u201d is more generic, the specific mention of \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d indicates it\u2019s the better choice.
