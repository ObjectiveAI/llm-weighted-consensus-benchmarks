The \u201cInternal Project\u201d category seems the most fitting since it aligns with project management tasks. While \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d is also relevant, it\u2019s more focused on access control. Since the message is somewhat ambiguous, I think \"Internal Project\" is the safest bet, but \"Miscellaneous\" could also work for the unclear cases. I\u2019ll format the response in JSON as required.**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nThe system requires the output of a JSON object with a category value from specified options. For this ticket, I\u2019m selecting \u201cInternal Project\u201d as it relates to board changes and approvals relevant to internal management. I want to confirm that the format will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. While \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could also fit due to mentions of an \"administrator board,\" the ticket focuses more on changes rather than access. Thus, \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems most suitable for clarity.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
