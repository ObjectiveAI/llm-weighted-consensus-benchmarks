However, there are no specific categories for those. \"Miscellaneous\" seems the most fitting because it\u2019s a general request that doesn\u2019t align with the established categories.**Deciding on category format**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize an IT ticket that might involve supplier statements. \"Purchase\" seems relevant since it relates to procurement. However, the user asked me to categorize the ticket, so I need to provide a JSON object with the format specified: it should include a \"category\" field. Given the options, I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous\" as the safest choice. The final output will be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} as instructed."
