The categories I have to work with include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It seems the phrases mostly revolve around access issues and policies, so I\u2019m thinking this ticket likely falls under the \"Access\" category. After determining the most suitable category, I should output a JSON object reflecting that choice.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI need to classify the ticket based on the phrases provided. It talks about \"allow access to resources via wireless,\" \"add policy,\" and other IT management tasks. The main theme seems to be around access control and wireless access. Given the context, I think the \"Access\" category fits best because it revolves around accessing resources on the network. Although \"Administrative rights\" also seems relevant, my best option is to categorize it under \"Access.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the ticket content, which has phrases about \"computer hosts file,\" \"adding policy,\" and \"administrative rights.\" It could be related to granting permissions or modifying files, but there's a strong focus on access issues. Since the main theme is about allowing access to resources via wireless, I think the best category here is \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format my output as a JSON object with the category set to \"Access.\" This should clarify things for the user!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
