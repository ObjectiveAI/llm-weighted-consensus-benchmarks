The focus seems to be on a mailbox that is full, and they're asking to increase the mailbox size or reduce items. This clearly falls under the Storage category due to the mention of storage quotas. So, I\u2019ll classify the ticket as Storage. My response will be formatted similarly to a JSON structure for clarity.**Formatting the Response**\n\nI need to create a JSON object that includes a field called \"category\" with the value based on the ticket details. Since the ticket is clearly about mailbox storage, I'll respond with this specific output: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I should ensure there\u2019s no extra commentary or notes in the response since the instructions emphasize providing only the required format. So, it's straight to the point with the exact JSON object."
