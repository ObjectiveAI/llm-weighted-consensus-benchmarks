It likely relates to network hardware, mentioning \"configure port for controller\" and \"port switch which connect phone.\" Based on the content, it seems simplest to categorize it as \"Hardware,\" but \"Internal Project\" could work too.**Formatting category response**\n\nThe instruction is to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to respond with a JSON-like object that includes a category field. The structure should be exactly as specified: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.\n\nI must ensure that the response is valid JSON and follows the format outlined. The allowed categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and more. Since \"Hardware\" is valid, I'll keep the response concise and straightforward. So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. No extra commentary here!"
