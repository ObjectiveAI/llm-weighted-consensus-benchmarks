The main points are about requesting a new virtual machine for testing purposes, mentioning \"cost\" and \u201cenvironment.\u201d \n\nGiven the categories available, it seems like it should fall under either \"Purchase\" due to requesting a new machine or \"Internal Project\" since it relates to an internal environment. However, \"Access\" doesn't really fit here. Overall, it leans more towards \"Purchase.\"**Categorizing IT requests**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing available categories like Hardware, Purchase, Access, Internal Project, and others. The request is for a new virtual machine, which makes me consider its categorization. Although a VM has software aspects, it seems more appropriate under \"Purchase\" since the user mentions \"cost.\" Their request indicates they want to acquire a new VM for testing an old, slow environment. While \"Internal Project\" might also apply, I lean towards \"Purchase\" because it directly relates to obtaining a new resource.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nThe user wants to replace an old, slow environment for testing, which suggests an internal project. However, the main request is for a new virtual machine and associated costs, indicating a procurement request. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase.\" \n\nI need to prepare a succinct response: the category will be \"Purchase,\" justified by the request for a new VM for a testing environment. I should output a JSON object with the category value, specifically: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
