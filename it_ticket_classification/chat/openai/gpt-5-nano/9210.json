The user seems to be reporting an issue with connecting a laptop in a conference room, mentioning plugs and cables. Their message is a bit garbled, but it looks like they are facing connectivity issues, potentially with a display or projector. Given the context, this ticket will likely fall under the \"Hardware\" or \"Miscellaneous\" category, as it's related to equipment setup in a conference room.**Delivering category in JSON**\n\nThis issue relates to hardware in the conference room, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" While it could be \"Miscellaneous\" if details are unclear, \"Hardware\" seems more appropriate. Now, I need to format the response as a JSON object. The required format is straightforward: it should simply be {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I'll avoid adding any extra commentary to keep the response clean and correct, focusing on delivering just the necessary information. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
