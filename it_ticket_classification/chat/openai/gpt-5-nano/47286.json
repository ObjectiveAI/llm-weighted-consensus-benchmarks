It sounds like they\u2019re facing access issues and encountering an error when loading them, which points towards an \"Access\" category since it's primarily about permissions. While \"Storage\" could be a consideration, the mention of an access error makes \"Access\" the most fitting choice. \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant if it's specifically about rights, but I think \"Access\" is the best call here.**Finalizing IT ticket response**\n\nThe text doesn\u2019t mention rights or permissions specifically, just that the user can\u2019t access the documents, so \"Access\" is definitely the right category. I\u2019ll format the response as instructed and provide it in JSON, following the required schema. The output will simply be a JSON object with the \"category\" field labeled as \"Access.\" There\u2019s no need for extra text since the directive specifies this format. Here we go: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
