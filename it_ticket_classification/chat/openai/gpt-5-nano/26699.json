With terms like \"duplicates detection\" and various frameworks, I\u2019m leaning towards classifying it under \"Miscellaneous\" since it doesn't fit neatly into the other categories.

While it could also relate to \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" \"Purchase\" is clearly the best choice.
