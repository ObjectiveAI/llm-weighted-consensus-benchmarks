It seems to revolve around new hardware purchases and installation, which likely fits into the category of \"Purchase.\" The items mentioned point clearly toward purchasing new equipment, so I\u2019ll select the \u201cPurchase\u201d category to keep things organized.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"new purchase,\" \"PO,\" and various items like \"notebooks\" and \"headset.\" I think the best category is \"Purchase\" since it focuses on ordering and logging installation for new items. It could also fit under \"Hardware\" since it includes physical items. However, the explicit mentions of purchasing and PO make \"Purchase\" the clearer choice. I'll structure the response as a JSON object, ensuring to follow the specified format with the category information.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
