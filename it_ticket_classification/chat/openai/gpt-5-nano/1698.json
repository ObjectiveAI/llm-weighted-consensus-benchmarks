The IT ticket relates to changing credentials and permanent status. I need to decide between the \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" categories, but it seems like access management fits better for credential changes. The mention of \"permanent status\" could link to HR, referring to elevating employee status. It looks like I should choose the \"Access\" category for IT.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on its primary focus. I think \"Access\" is the best option since it relates to changing credentials. However, there\u2019s also mention of a \"new starter\" and an \"internship program,\" which might lean towards \"HR Support\" because of onboarding. Yet, since the ticket specifies changing credentials, it feels most appropriate to stick with \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format my answer according to the specified JSON-like structure for clarity.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
