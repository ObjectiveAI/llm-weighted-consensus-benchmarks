This seems like it involves instructions on changing the address and updating records. It could fit into either HR Support or Administrative rights, but there's no mention of privileges, just updates. So, I think the best fit for this request is HR Support, as it's mainly about updating individual records.**Selecting Appropriate Category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the best category for the IT ticket, which could be \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The string mentions \"Belgrade new address\" and includes updating internal records, likely relating to HR. Since \"HR Support\" is in the allowed categories, that's my top choice, considering it involves updating an employee's address in the HR system. Another option was \"Administrative rights,\" but I believe this is more about HR. So, I'll categorize it as HR Support.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nIt looks like I need to respond with a JSON object indicating the category of the IT ticket. The system's instructions specify that the category should be presented in a certain format. Since I\u2019ve categorized the ticket as \"HR Support,\" I\u2019ll structure the response accordingly. The only property I need to include is \"category,\" using double quotes. So, my final output will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nThat's it!"
