The relevant categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The user is reporting that they are unable to connect Excel to Oracle while trying to prepare important client reports since yesterday. The core issue seems to be the connectivity between Excel and the Oracle database, and their location is Frankfurt Main.**Clarifying IT ticket categorization**\n\nIt seems like this is an Access issue because the user mentioned they can't connect Excel to Oracle, which relates to accessing the data source. The allowed categories include \"Access,\" so that fits. While \u201cUrgent client reporting\u201d indicates a business intelligence task, it primarily revolves around the connectivity issue. Given that, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" \n\nI'll format the response in JSON as required: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, ensuring it adheres to the specified structure without any extra content.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket and to output it in the required format. I see that the instructions specify a category object schema that I need to follow. So, I'll stick to that and respond precisely with the category. I\u2019ll make sure to present it exactly as instructed without any additional content. Let\u2019s do this step efficiently, ensuring accuracy in the format!"
