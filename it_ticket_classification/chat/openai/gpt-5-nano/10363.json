The message is quite jumbled, but it references a \u201cnew starter,\u201d which typically relates to onboarding a new employee. That could fit under \u201cHR Support\u201d or possibly \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d They mention an \"attached return form\" and \"empty part,\" which indicates there are missing fields that need assistance. I'll pinpoint the best category for this ticket based on those clues.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the right category for the IT ticket. While \"Internal Project\" doesn\u2019t seem fitting, \"new starter\" suggests a focus on access provisioning for a new user account. This aligns with \u201cAccess,\u201d which covers system access and account creation. \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they need elevated privileges too. The mention of an attached form leans toward onboarding, making \"HR Support\" another contender. However, I think \"Access\" is the best fit since it relates directly to the new starter's access needs.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis is an IT ticket categorization task, and typically, I\u2019d place this under \"Access,\" especially since it's about new starter provisioning. The phrase \"new starter kale building Wednesday PM\" suggests a request related to onboarding a new user named Kale. The user message indicates a need to complete a form for this new starter. Since this primarily relates to provisioning accounts, I think categorizing it as \"Access\" is the right choice, although \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant. \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nIt looks like I've settled on categorizing the ticket as \"Access.\" The user just needs that clear classification, so I'll provide the JSON format only without additional explanations. Following the required format ensures I stick to the instructions. Here's my response:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
