The content refers to external clients viewing projects they aren't assigned to, which brings up issues of access control and permissions.\n\nGiven the available categories, \"Access\" appears to fit best, as it relates to user permissions and what projects they can see. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant since it concerns controlling access. I should lean toward \"Access\" for clarity.**Responding with access category**\n\nThe ticket focuses on access control, particularly relating to external clients viewing projects they aren't assigned to. It seems clear that this fits in the \"Access\" category, which is about user permissions.\n\nI think \"Administrative rights\" isn't quite the right fit since that's more for admin roles, while this content centers on user access. So, I\u2019m planning to craft a JSON object with the category value as \"Access\" to respond correctly. I'll ensure the output is in the proper format without additional commentary."
