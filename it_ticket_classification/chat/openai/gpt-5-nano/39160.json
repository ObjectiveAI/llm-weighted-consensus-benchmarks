The ticket mentions a license activation failure, which doesn't quite fit neatly into any of the categories but may lean towards \"Access\" since it might require administrative rights. However, \"Miscellaneous\" could also work, especially since there's no specific category for Software or Licensing. I'll go with \"Access\" as the more appropriate choice.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize an IT ticket where the issue is a license activation failure. The categories available include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since licensing doesn't neatly fit any of these, I\u2019m considering \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d as the catch-all for issues that don\u2019t clearly belong elsewhere. \u201cPurchase\u201d could work too, but it\u2019s not really about buying.
