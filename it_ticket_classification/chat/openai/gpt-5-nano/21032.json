The ticket mentions various aspects like \"approval speed,\" \"events category,\" and \"visibility.\" I have a list of categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It might fit into \"Access\" since it relates to visibility and linking. However, it could also be \"Administrative rights\" if it focuses on approvals. I'm considering \"Internal Project\" too.**Examining ticket details**\n\nI'm looking through a messy ticket where the user is asking for faster approval on events, mentioning specifics about visibility and links. They note that content sometimes becomes visible quickly and mention colleagues involved. It seems there\u2019s high importance placed on this issue, which could indicate either a need for \"Access\" rights concerning visibility or \"Administrative rights\" if it\u2019s about approvals and permissions. This wording makes it quite tricky; I'm considering all angles!**Analyzing event approval request**\n\nThe user is asking for faster approvals for events in the \"events\" category. There\u2019s mention of \"blockers thousands,\" suggesting many approvals could be delayed. Words like \u201clink visible\u201d point to publishing and access issues. This could link to a content management system problem. I\u2019m torn between categorizing this as \"Administrative rights\" for permissions or possibly \"Internal Project\" since it relates to event management. Ultimately, it might best fit under \"Access\" due to the focus on visibility and permissions.**Parsing event approval workflow**\n\nThe ticket mentions the \"Events category,\" indicating it might relate to a specific module in a content management system. It looks like there\u2019s an issue with how quickly content becomes visible after approval, pointing to a Content Publishing workflow. However, there's no explicit \"Content management\" category, so I\u2019m considering \"Administrative rights\" for permission issues or \"Miscellaneous.\" There\u2019s also \"Internal Project,\" focusing on deployment. If I had to categorize it, I'd likely say \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" makes sense since it involves approvals for publishing events.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
