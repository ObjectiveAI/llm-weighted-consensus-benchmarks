I\u2019ll make sure to format it as JSON with the appropriate \"category\" field.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether the category could be \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" but it doesn\u2019t seem about access control. \"Purchase\" fits best. I need to respond with a JSON object categorized as \"Purchase.\" \n\nThe instructions clarify the correct schema, which shows that I should output just {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} rather than including extra details. This keeps it short and concise, which I think is perfect. I'll finalize that response now!"
