The user mentions phrases like \"new purchase po,\" \"galaxy mobile subscription,\" and \"received items,\" which leads me to think it relates to purchasing hardware, specifically a mobile device.\n\nI have categories to consider: Hardware, Purchase, and Administrative rights. Based on their content, I'd lean towards \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" Let's find the best fit between those!**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket seems to focus on a purchase order, equipment allocation to a user, and receipts. The most appropriate category might be \"Purchase,\" since it heavily mentions a new purchase PO and receipts. \n\nHowever, I also see \"Hardware\" being relevant due to the devices involved. If I have to choose a single category, \"Purchase\" feels like the best fit. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object, keeping in mind the schema provided by the system.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
