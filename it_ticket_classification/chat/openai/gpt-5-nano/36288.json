They're mentioning \"oracle and codes expired,\" \"absence leave annual leave have expired,\" and \"we cannot log any off.\" It looks like they're reporting an issue with the HR or absence system, specifically regarding expired codes, possibly connected to Oracle. They\u2019re requesting urgent attention on the issue, especially with regards to planned days off. Parsing this carefully is crucial.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize a ticket based on the user\u2019s message about \"Oracle,\" \"codes expired,\" and issues with absence leave. It's clear they're dealing with an HR system issue, suggesting it fits best under the \"HR Support\" category. However, they mention not being able to log time off, which might touch on \"Access\" due to expired codes. Despite considering \"Administrative rights,\" the most accurate fit remains \"HR Support,\" as it directly relates to absence management in the Oracle system.**Delivering category response**\n\nThe instructions specify a \"Category\" schema where I need to provide a JSON object indicating the category. Here, \"HR Support\" is the right choice based on the user\u2019s message about expired codes related to absence management in Oracle. Even though I briefly considered \"Access\" due to their logging issue, it's clearer that this pertains more to HR. So, I\u2019ll keep it concise and deliver the correct output as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
