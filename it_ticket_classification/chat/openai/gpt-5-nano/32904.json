The request for a \"change approver\" and \"PM allocation\" sounds like it falls under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" because it relates to modifying configurations rather than standard HR support.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI'm considering if this ticket should be categorized under \"HR Support\" since it deals with maternity leave and resource reallocation. However, it's focused on modifying the system. The user is asking for guidance on proceeding with changes in Oracle Fusion due to this leave, which might indicate an \"Internal Project\" category since it relates to project management. So, I\u2019m weighing the options for the most appropriate category. It\u2019s a bit tricky!**Analyzing user message**\n\nThe user's message appears to be a jumble of multiple requests about PM allocations due to maternity leave. They need to update these allocations, add specific dates, and mention urgency related to assignments for the upcoming holidays in July. There\u2019s a bit of confusion about adding \"two codes\" since they can\u2019t seem to add them themselves. It looks like they\u2019re asking for assistance with how to proceed in Oracle Fusion, which is quite important!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the user's request, especially the phrase \u201ccannot change herself,\u201d which suggests they need someone else to handle changes due to maternity leave. This might mean they require \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" for changing the approver. The user also referenced an attached user guide. Given that they're working with Oracle Fusion, I think \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit for categorizing the ticket since it involves modifying system settings and roles. \"Internal Project\" doesn\u2019t seem applicable here.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
