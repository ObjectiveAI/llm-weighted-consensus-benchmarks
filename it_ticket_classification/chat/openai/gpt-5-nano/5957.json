However, since it mentions a request for items, it could also imply a procurement category. When in doubt, I often lean towards categorizing such requests as \u201cHardware,\u201d but \u201cPurchase\u201d may also fit depending on how the organization views it. It's a bit ambiguous!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, and since it's about hardware items, I\u2019m leaning towards \u201cHardware\u201d as the category. The request specifically mentions a keyboard and an extension cord, which are hardware, not just about the purchasing process. While both \u201cHardware\u201d and \u201cPurchase\u201d could fit, \u201cHardware\u201d seems more straightforward from the context. So, I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object with just the category:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
