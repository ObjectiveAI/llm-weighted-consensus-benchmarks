It might fall under categories like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Storage.\" Since IT ticket categorization often uses \"Access\" for permissions, that seems like a fitting choice.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI need to decide on a category for this IT ticket. It could fit under \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Storage.\" The mention of \"shared ownership\" suggests it might be about access permissions to shared folders, which leans toward \"Access.\" In IT ticket taxonomy, \"Access\" is often used for permissions. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also apply if it's about owning resources. Ultimately, \"Access\" seems like the most fitting category based on the provided details.**Responding with JSON**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object containing just the category. The category will be \"Access\" based on the previous analysis. Following the required format from the initial instructions, I\u2019ll ensure the JSON structure is correct, without any extra text. \n\nIt's important to capitalize \"Access\" specifically as indicated. So, the final output will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nThis keeps things clear and meets the user's requirements perfectly!"
