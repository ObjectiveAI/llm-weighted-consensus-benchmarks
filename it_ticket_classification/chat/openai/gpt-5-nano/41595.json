The user's message includes phrases that indicate submission, and I realize \"annual leave\" clearly connects to HR management. There\u2019s a category for \"HR Support,\" which seems fitting. I need to respond with a JSON object including this category. The expected format is clear, so I\u2019ll ensure I provide the correct JSON structure as required!**Finalizing the category response**\n\nI'm preparing to respond with the category for the IT ticket, which we've determined should be \"HR Support.\" The JSON object format is essential, and I want to ensure it contains the proper structure. I'll provide it as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} because this follows the schema correctly. Additionally, I think it\u2019s best to note that this matches the user\u2019s request for categorization. I\u2019ll make sure to finalize everything for the user now!"
