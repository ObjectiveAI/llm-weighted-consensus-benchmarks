Although it might also relate to \"Administrative rights\" if admin access is needed, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best category choice here.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nFor this IT ticket with the content \"new project code oracle fusion urgent urgent setup please today enter projections thanks,\" I need to classify it quickly. It's likely about setting up a new project code in Oracle Fusion, so \"Internal Project\" seems the best fit. Although \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if they need admin access, I feel it\u2019s safer to stick with \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019m going to output just the JSON format, as instructed. Here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}**Confirming Category Output**\n\nI've concluded that the category \"Internal Project\" fits best based on the ticket details. The phrase \"urgent urgent setup please today\" emphasizes how quickly they need this setup, but I won\u2019t use urgency for classification. I want to make sure the output is clean and straightforward, with no extra spaces or comments, to ensure it\u2019s easily parseable. I\u2019ll respond with just the JSON format. Here\u2019s the final output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
