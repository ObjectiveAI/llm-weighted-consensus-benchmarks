It seems related to either \"Purchase\" due to the need for approval of purchase orders or possibly \"Administrative rights\" if the user is facing permission issues that prevent approval. The content is a bit messy, with repeated phrases about errors in the purchasing workflow, so I need to pinpoint the best category while considering all this!**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing the appropriate category for this IT ticket based on the user's input. The possible categories are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.\n\nGiven the context of approvals and costs not being recognized, it seems most relevant to categorize it as \"Purchase.\" Although there are mentions of permissions, the focus on approvals suggests it's related to purchase requisitions or invoices. So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object stating the category as \"Purchase.\"**Finalizing the category output**\n\nI need to output just the category in the specified format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It's crucial to ensure that the final channel prints this JSON object correctly according to the schema.\n\nI want to make sure nothing extraneous is included; I\u2019ll focus solely on returning the category.
