It sounds like it could fit into \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The mention of a \"new starter\" suggests onboarding, which typically involves tasks like access provisioning and account creation. Given that it's primarily about filling out a form for HR, \"HR Support\" seems to be the most fitting category.**Clarifying IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the categories for this IT ticket context. While \"HR Support\" seems fitting for onboarding tasks, the user specifically asked for an IT category. I need to produce a JSON response with the appropriate category. The ticket discusses a new starter and a starter form. Although \"Access\" might work for account provisioning, there\u2019s no clear mention of access specifics. \"Administrative rights\" could fit if it involved creating rights, but it\u2019s vague. Perhaps \"HR Support\" can still be an option, even though it's not purely IT-related.**Choosing Onboarding Category**\n\nI believe the best fit for onboarding tasks is \"HR Support\" in the IT ticket classification since the term \"starter form\" indicates HR-related forms. I could also consider \"Access,\" especially if this form is used for setting up the new starter's account. That would relate to access provisioning. However, \"Internal Project\" doesn\u2019t apply here, and \"Miscellaneous\" feels too generic. Since the user specifically asked for a categorization, I'll go with \"HR Support.\"**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket's content suggests someone is asking for help with a starter form for a new starter at school. Given the attached form details, I\u2019m weighing the options between \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" and \"HR Support.\" Since it mostly relates to onboarding, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit. I'll format my response as a JSON object with the required schema: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This will keep it clear and succinct, just as instructed!"
