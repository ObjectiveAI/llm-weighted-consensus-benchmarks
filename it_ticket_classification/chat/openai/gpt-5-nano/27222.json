That could suggest categories like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it involves admin permissions. But since the ticket specifically states \"create file shared folder,\" it leans more toward \"Storage.\" The repetition of \"file shared folder creation\" makes it clear. I'll categorize it as \"Storage\" and format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Storage\"} as requested.**Delivering category response**\n\nI see that the system prompt instructs me to respond with a category object based on the provided enum, which includes options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and more. Given that the ticket discusses a shared folder, I'll output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}\n\nI want to make sure I'm correct without adding extra explanations since the request was simply to categorize. So, that's the final response! Let\u2019s deliver it."
