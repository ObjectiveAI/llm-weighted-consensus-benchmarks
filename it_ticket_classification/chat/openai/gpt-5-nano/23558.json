It could also relate to \"Purchase,\" but it focuses more on approving expenses and receipt submission. I see that \"Administrative rights\" falls under access rights. Since the issue is about being locked out, I\u2019ll go with \"Access.\" So, I\u2019ll output the final response as a JSON object with the category set to \"Access.\"**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to make sure I format my response exactly as required by the system, using a JSON-like object that fits the \"category\" schema. Since the final output should be clear and precise, I\u2019ll present it as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text around it since that\u2019s essential for it to be recognized correctly. Alright, let\u2019s finalize this output!"
