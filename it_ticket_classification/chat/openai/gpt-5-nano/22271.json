Since the user is looking for a JSON response, I\u2019ll carefully choose the most fitting category.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions an app issue with terms like \"expenses app\" and \"issue app,\" suggesting an application concern. However, the available categories don't specifically include \"Software\" or \"Application Support.\" I consider \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" The \"digital product strategy\" might hint at an internal project related to product strategy. Based on the content, \"Internal Project\" seems the best category since it relates to app development, even though \"Purchase\" doesn't fit.**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nThe string \"tuesday pm\" seems irrelevant, focusing me on crafting the right response. I need to use the category \"Internal Project,\" which fits the context of the ticket. The system likely expects a simple JSON object format that precisely follows the schema. So, I'll keep it clear and concise. The output will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} to match the required format without any extra fluff. This approach ensures I\u2019m adhering to the expectations.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
