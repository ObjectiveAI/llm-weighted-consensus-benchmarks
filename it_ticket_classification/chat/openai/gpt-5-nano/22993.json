It seems there's a bad version that needs to be deleted, created by a failed job run. This situation focuses on development artifact management within a release workflow. I think categorizing this as \"Internal Project\" is fitting. However, it could also fit under \"Administrative Rights\" if deleting versions involves specific permissions. I'll need to clarify if that's necessary.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket requires categorization, and I think \"Internal Project\" is the best choice because it\u2019s about project repository management. While \"Storage\" could also work since it deals with content repositories and image versions, it seems less suitable overall. The main focus is on deleting wrong versions resulting from a failed job run, linking it to CI/CD artifact management. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, as that fits the schema provided for the task.**Finalizing the response**\n\nI\u2019m going to respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. While it could be useful to add brief reasoning, the instructions simply say to categorize, so keeping it concise seems best. Since there's no need for an explanation, I'll stick to just outputting the required JSON. This way, I ensure I\u2019m following the guidelines while providing the necessary information. Here we go!"
