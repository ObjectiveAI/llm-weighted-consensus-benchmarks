They mentioned not being able to open details related to an issue from Tuesday in December. Looking at the categories, it seems like this could fit into \"Access,\" as it likely involves permission or login issues. While it might seem related to an internal project, \"Access\" clearly covers the inability to open specific details. I'll output the categorization in JSON format.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the ticket and initially thought \"Miscellaneous\" could fit if things aren\u2019t clear. However, it\u2019s more straightforward to categorize this as \"Access\" because it's about not being able to open details, likely due to access or permissions. I see the mention of \"design lead,\" but that doesn\u2019t change the primary categorization. So, I'll stick to the output format and respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text since that's what the user requested.**Determining final category**\n\nThe user mentioned \"design lead,\" which might imply a design lead is asking for details. However, the phrase \"cannot details number\" could suggest they\u2019re missing a ticket number. Still, the main issue points to access. I'll finalize the category as \"Access,\" even though it could relate to an \"Internal Project\" if it's about an Oracle issue within a project. But I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" and will format the output properly as plain JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
