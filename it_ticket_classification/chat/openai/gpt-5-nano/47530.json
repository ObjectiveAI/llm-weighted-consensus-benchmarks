It seems to mention a \"leaver mail account\" and issues with an \"address book\" in Active Directory, which suggests it's connected to someone who has left the company. Since it's about offboarding and account visibility, I think the best category could be \"Access.\" However, \"Administrative rights\" could also be a fit. Let\u2019s lean toward \"Access\" for clarity.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for this IT ticket. It's discussing access issues linked to a terminated user, like a mailbox still appearing in the address book and in Active Directory. While \"HR Support\" might seem relevant, this is specifically an IT access issue. I think \"Access\" is the most fitting, as it covers visibility and accounts. Although \"Administrative rights\" could apply, it\u2019s more about rights rather than lingering accounts. I'll respond with the JSON: { \"category\": \"Access\" }.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
