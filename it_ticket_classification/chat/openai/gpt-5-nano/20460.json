Given that the ticket mentions \"request access\" and remote access, it clearly aligns with the Access category. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the \"category\" field set to \"Access\".**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the user's request. It mentions \"request access\" and talks about remote access and daily tasks, which clearly points to the \"Access\" category.
