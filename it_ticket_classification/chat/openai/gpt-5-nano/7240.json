The system requires a JSON-like structure, which includes a \"category\" field with specific options. \n\nThe user's ticket seems messy and involves issues with contract variations, UI prompts, and duplicates. I\u2019m thinking it's most related to IT. It could fall into categories like \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d or \u201cInternal Project,\u201d but I need to decide which fits best.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m narrowing down the category for this IT ticket. It\u2019s not related to hardware, storage, purchase, or HR, so I'm left with \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\nThe ticket mentions software issues with contract variations and problems with saving prompts. \"Internal Project\" feels like the best fit since it covers internal tools and software issues. While \"Miscellaneous\" could work, I think \"Internal Project\" is more appropriate due to the software bug regarding contract variations. Now to finalize that choice!**Creating JSON Output**\n\nI need to craft an answer as a JSON object with the category \"Internal Project.\" The instruction is clear: it should just be this category in the specified format.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll output it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI briefly considered including an explanation, but the instructions say to keep it simple and just categorize. So I\u2019ll stick to the required format and respond with just the JSON. That seems right!"
