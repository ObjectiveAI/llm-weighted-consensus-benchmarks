The user mentioned issues with RAM memory related to performance and the need for additional memory for automation testing. This clearly touches on hardware upgrades, so I think it fits primarily in the \"Hardware\" category. I'll construct a JSON object with the required \"category\" field set to \"Hardware,\" as that aligns with the schema provided. Let's proceed with this categorization!**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to categorize the IT ticket correctly. The request mentions RAM memory for performance issues, which suggests a hardware upgrade. While \"Purchase\" could fit since they want to procure memory, the simplest and most direct category seems to be \"Hardware.\" Given the instructions, I'll output this categorization in the required JSON format as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It doesn't appear I need to add any subcategories or notes, so this should work perfectly!**Outputting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to focus on following the user\u2019s instructions precisely. The instructions say my output should be in a format that may not support any special formatting. Since I need to respond with a JSON-like object containing the category, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward. To stay safe, my final output will simply be {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I won\u2019t add any extra commentary unless requested, so I'll stick to providing just the JSON!"
