The options I have are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the details about moving equipment within the office, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit. While \"Hardware\" could fit too since it involves computers, it's more about logistical support than hardware repair. I'll lean towards \"Internal Project.\"**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI think the best category for this IT ticket is \"Internal Project\" because it involves relocation tasks in the office. The message makes it clear that assistance is needed for moving computers and tables within a floor. While \"Hardware\" could apply since we're moving equipment, it feels more fitting as a logistical project. So I\u2019m set on categorizing it as \"Internal Project.\" I'll wrap this up in a JSON-like format for the response.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
