Since this seems related to a software application issue, I think the best fit would be \"Access\" since the user is experiencing a submission error that likely requires further access resolution. I'll format that as a JSON object accordingly.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out which category to assign to an IT ticket from the options provided. The descriptions mention \"submit time entries\" and \"error submission entries,\" along with a prompt to contact the administrator. It doesn't seem to be a permissions issue, but it could relate to administrative rights if an admin needs to address it. However, since none of the categories are directly about software or IT support, \"Miscellaneous\" seems the best fit. I\u2019ll finalize that with the JSON: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
