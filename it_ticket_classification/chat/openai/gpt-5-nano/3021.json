However, there might be some touches of \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" too. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket is focused on hardware allocation, equipment return, and possibly an internal transfer. While \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" might fit, they don't seem ideal here. Given the specifics, \"Hardware\" appears to be the most suitable category for this request. \n\nI'll format my response as a JSON object containing the category as \"Hardware\" and ensure there's no extra text, just the category as requested.
