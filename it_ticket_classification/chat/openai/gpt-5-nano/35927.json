The provided options include categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. This issue seems related to financial management rather than IT. I'd consider \"Miscellaneous\" for its general nature or maybe \"HR Support,\" as expense reports often involve HR and finance. However, since this is from an IT system, perhaps \"Access\" is relevant, considering it might relate to approval access. It's a bit tricky!**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI see the content discusses an approval workflow glitch in the expense report system, and it might relate to access to approvals. The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. While \"Purchase\" could apply since expenses relate to purchasing, they mention \"approvers list,\" which complicates things. I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as it's the safest catch-all, especially since it doesn\u2019t fit neatly into the other categories like hardware, storage, or admin rights. It's a bit of a puzzle!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
