It seems the user is asking about assigning more details to two different menus. There are fragments that look like they could be Romanian, along with mentions of dropdowns. It's unclear what exactly they need, but they might want help with the information displayed in the menus. I could categorize this as \"Miscellaneous,\" \"UI/UX,\" or \"Access.\"**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories available: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since this ticket is vague, \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d seems to be the best fit for such user questions. \u201cAccess\u201d might apply if it relates to dropdown menus. The user\u2019s message also has some Romanian phrases, but it\u2019s unclear. They mention \"drop down,\" which further indicates it pertains to the user interface. So, I\u2019ll go with \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe user is discussing differences between dropdown menus, possibly wanting to assign more details to something related to views. They mention being a discipline lead and refer to a specific question about internal systems or projects. Given that context, it might be better to categorize this under \"Internal Project\" rather than just \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the ticket revolves around UI issues related to project specifics, \"Internal Project\" fits best. I'll provide the final categorization in JSON format with that category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
