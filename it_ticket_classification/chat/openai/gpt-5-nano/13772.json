The instructions say to output a JSON object with the category field. So, I\u2019ll categorize the ticket properly in the JSON format. It seems this is related to onboarding, so \"HR Support\" fits best.**Interpreting the Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket that says: \"new starter hi please fill starting July further assistance needed side let thank.\" It seems like they're asking for something related to onboarding a new starter in July. Since this is an IT ticket, and new starters often need system access, the best category might be \"Access.\" It\u2019s likely they\u2019re requesting help provisioning access for the new starter starting in July, and they might need some additional assistance with that.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
