I think \"bad connection\" suggests a network issue, so it might fit under the Hardware category. I need to ensure that I output a JSON object with the right category. I'll go with the category of \"Hardware.\"**Interpreting IT Ticket Categories**\n\nI'm trying to categorize the IT ticket based on the details provided. The phrases suggest that it's about network connectivity issues, specifically \"bad connection at en station.\" In terms of categories, \"Access\" relates to access rights, and \"Hardware\" covers hardware issues, which might be suitable for network hardware problems. However, since there's no explicit \"Network\" category, I should probably lean towards \"Hardware.\" If I'm unsure, \"Miscellaneous\" could be a safer choice.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT ticket about a bad connection. It might refer to an \"Enterprise Network (EN) station.\" Since it's a connectivity issue, I have to decide between \"Hardware\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Hardware\" seems appropriate because it could be about a device problem, like a network adapter. I just need to output the category as a JSON object. So, I'll go ahead and finalize it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
