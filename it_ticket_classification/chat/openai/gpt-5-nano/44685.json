So, I\u2019ll prepare to respond with just the category formatted as a JSON object.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nI need to ensure the output is in the correct JSON format, like {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. The ticket text mentions a defective monitor, which clearly identifies it as a hardware issue and seems to request a replacement. So, yes, \"Hardware\" is definitely the right category. I must remember to respond with just the JSON object and avoid any extra words to keep it clean and precise."
