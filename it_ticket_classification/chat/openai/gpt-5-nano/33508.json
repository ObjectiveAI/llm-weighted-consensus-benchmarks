This suggests a relationship with IT hardware. While I initially considered \"Administrative rights,\" it doesn't quite fit. Similarly, \"Internal Project\" feels off. I\u2019m thinking the best match here would be \"Hardware,\" as it aligns closely with the subject matter of assets in the IT context. \"Miscellaneous\" could also fit but feels less precise.**Formatting category response**\n\nThe user\u2019s ticket clearly deals with \"assets\" compliance, which I\u2019m identifying as related to hardware. So, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" The instructions specify that I need to format the response as a JSON object with a \"category\" key, following a specific schema. I need to ensure that the value is correctly capitalized as \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll keep my response concise by providing only the JSON without any extra explanations. Great, the final output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
