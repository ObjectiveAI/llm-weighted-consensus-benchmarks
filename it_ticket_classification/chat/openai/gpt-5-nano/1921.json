The content mentions storage growth due to a big file or transaction, which clearly relates to increasing mailbox quota. From the options given, the \"Storage\" category seems the most appropriate because it's about managing mailbox size. I'll prepare the JSON response that reflects this category choice. It should be a simple structure indicating the category as \"Storage.\"**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI'm going through the options for categorizing the IT ticket. It's not related to hardware, HR, or access, but it does mention \"mailbox explode\" and \"increase size.\" That makes it clear it's related to Storage. So, I\u2019ll create the JSON object as required: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I just need to ensure it's in the correct format, and since the user only asked for the category, I\u2019ll keep it simple without extra text. Ready to respond!"
