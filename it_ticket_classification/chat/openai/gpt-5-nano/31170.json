They\u2019ve expressed a need for a keyboard\u2014most likely an ergonomic one\u2014and a bigger monitor to prevent neck strain. So, I\u2019m considering the categories available. The ticket clearly aligns with hardware since it relates to physical devices needed for their workspace. I\u2019ll classify this ticket under the \"Hardware\" category to ensure it gets the appropriate attention.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket and it\u2019s pointing clearly towards hardware support since it mentions needing a keyboard and monitor. While \"Purchase\" could work since it's about acquiring new equipment, that category usually connects to procurement processes. The focus of this request is about workstation optimization to prevent neck injury. Given all that, I'm inclined to categorize this ticket under \"Hardware\" since it\u2019s primarily about the actual devices being requested.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to respond with the right justification in a brief and clear way. The instructions say to provide a JSON output for the category of the IT ticket. The schema specifies that I need to use exact terms from the allowed list. Since the ticket clearly falls under \"Hardware,\" I'll keep it simple and straightforward. The final JSON object will look like this: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. This way, it adheres to the required format perfectly!"
