They mentioned terms like \"new starter\" and \"credentials per attached form.\" Given the categories provided, I think \"Access\" fits best since it's about access provisioning. While \"Administrative rights\" is related, it's more specific to admin privileges, which doesn't seem necessary here. So yeah, \"Access\" is probably the most appropriate category for this ticket.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"new starter tower thursday assistants starter,\" which got me thinking\u2014could \"tower\" refer to a desktop computer? While that\u2019s possible, the main request is to create credentials per the attached form. It seems like the primary action is about provisioning a user account. Given the provided categories, \"Access\" is the best fit. I considered \"Hardware,\" but since the focus is on credentials, I'll classify it as \"Access\" and respond with a simple JSON format. \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
