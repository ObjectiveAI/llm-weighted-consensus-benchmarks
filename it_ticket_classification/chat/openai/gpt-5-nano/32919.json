It mentions a new starter, onboarding details, and has loads of HR-related information like contracts, job titles, and personal details. Considering the categories available like \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights,\" I think the most appropriate category is \"HR Support.\" Since the focus is on new starters and contracts, that aligns with HR processes.**Evaluating IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm realizing this ticket seems more related to HR and administrative tasks rather than IT. It includes requests to draft contract terms and liaise with a candidate, which doesn't fit well in IT categories like Access. Maybe \"Administrative rights\" fits better, as it could relate to granting access for the new starter? However, it still feels more HR-focused. The ticket discusses onboarding, which makes me think \u201cHR Support\u201d might be the best category after all.**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nLooking closely at the text, it's clear that it revolves around drafting contractual terms and liaising with a candidate, which is fundamentally HR and administrative. While there's a category for \"Administrative rights,\" this ticket fits more into \"HR Support.\" I see that it's listed as one of the categories, perfect! Since it pertains to onboarding a new starter with contract discussions, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"HR Support\" and format the output as a JSON object accordingly.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
