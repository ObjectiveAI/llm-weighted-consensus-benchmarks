The available categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nThe user's request is about moving an opportunity\u2014this sounds like it could relate to CRM data or opportunity management. It might fit under \"Administrative rights\" if ownership or permissions are changing, or \"Internal Project\" if it's part of a larger initiative. It doesn\u2019t really seem to fall under the other categories.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket since it's about moving an opportunity within the CRM system. It could possibly fit as \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" if it\u2019s unclear. The user\u2019s request is clear, and I need to provide a JSON object with an appropriate category. Given mentions of \"importing opportunity\" and \"opportunity ID changed,\" it seems best to classify it as \"Administrative rights\" due to potential access requirements. I\u2019ll structure the output accordingly.**Clarifying IT ticket categorization**\n\nIt seems there's no explicit mention of permissions, as this is more about an operation in CRM. The closest category is \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option if it's unclear. I want to be specific, so I'll go with \"Administrative rights\" since it involves moving opportunity ownership, which is a permissions action.\n\nI'll format the response as JSON according to the instructions, making sure it has the proper structure with the \"category\" wrapper. So, that should look like: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
