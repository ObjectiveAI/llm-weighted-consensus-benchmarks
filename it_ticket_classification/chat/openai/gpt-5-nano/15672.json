I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most fitting category, but since it also involves access rights, \"Access\" could be another option. Ultimately, I\u2019ll choose \"HR Support.\"**Determining the Right Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket that references a \"maternity leaver form\" and an \"access card.\" It seems to be an IT ticket involving the granting or retrieving of an access card for someone on maternity leave. I need to select the most appropriate category. While \"Access\" fits best due to the focus on access cards, \"HR Support\" could also apply because of the maternity aspect. However, since it's primarily an IT request, I\u2019ll go with \"Access.\"**Formatting the Output**\n\nBased on the prompt, I see that we need to produce a JSON object with the specified schema. The category value I determined is \"Access.\" Therefore, the correct output should look like: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI need to be precise with my quoting to avoid any errors. Although I could add notes or suggestions, the guideline is to keep it focused on the category. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and deliver that exact output."
