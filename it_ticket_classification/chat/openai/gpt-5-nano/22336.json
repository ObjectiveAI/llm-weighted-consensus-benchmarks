The ticket content is a jumble of phrases related to onboarding and offboarding processes. Given the context, it seems to fit either the HR Support category for HR processes or Access for account access issues. I think \"HR Support\" might be the most appropriate choice here!**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to output a JSON object with a category value. Considering the terms in the content, like \"leaver tickets\" and \"starter tickets,\" it seems these relate to access provisioning. While \"HR Support\" could fit due to the employee context, \"Access\" is more appropriate since it's primarily about accounts and onboarding/offboarding. Therefore, I\u2019ll produce the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's straightforward with no extra text needed!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
