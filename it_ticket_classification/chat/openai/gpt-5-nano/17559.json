Given the content about \"load,\" \"cost,\" and \"planning analyst,\" it could fit as \"Internal Project,\" \"Purchase,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I think I might need to ask the user for clarification because it\u2019s not clear cut!**Parsing IT Ticket Message**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the message: \"march load pm march load hi please proceed load cost cost march period version please pm thanks planning analyst.\" It seems a bit nonsensical at first glance. My first thought is it could relate to an \"Internal Project\" due to the mention of a planning analyst, but there's no clear request for IT support. It might lean towards \"Miscellaneous\" since it\u2019s vague. I'm also considering \"Purchase\" because of the cost reference, yet no specific purchase request is made.**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nI think the safest bet for this ambiguous ticket is to categorize it as \"Miscellaneous.\" However, it could also fit as \"Internal Project\" since it mentions a \"planning analyst\" along with terms like \"version\" and \"load.\" This might suggest it's about a project report. While \"Purchase\" seems possible due to \"cost,\" the repeated mention of \"load cost\" makes me lean toward \"Internal Project.\" So, I plan to output it as JSON with the category: \"Internal Project.\"**Delivering IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nI\u2019m ready to deliver the categorization for the IT ticket. The system requires a specific category string, and \"Internal Project\" fits perfectly within the provided options. I\u2019ll respond with just the JSON object format containing the category. Since the user specifically asked for the ticket to be categorized, a brief note isn\u2019t necessary. I\u2019ll finalize my response as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Simple and straightforward!"
