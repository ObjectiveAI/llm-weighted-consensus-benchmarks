The message from the user seems a bit jumbled, mentioning things like \"new purchase PO,\" \"wireless controller,\" and \"please log allocation.\" It appears to relate to a purchase, likely for hardware. So, my best bet is to categorize it as \"Purchase,\" possibly also \"Hardware\" based on the content.**Classifying the ticket**\n\nThis ticket is clearly about procurement and receipts, mentioning \"log allocation\" and \"mandatory receipts section.\" It seems most appropriate to categorize it as \"Purchase\" since it involves a new purchase order and necessary receipts, rather than access or HR topics. While it also refers to a \"wireless controller,\" which suggests \"Hardware,\" I think \"Purchase\" is still the best fit overall. Given the context, I\u2019ll output the classification in JSON format, focusing on the category \"Purchase.\"{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
