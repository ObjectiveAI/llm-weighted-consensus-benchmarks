It appears to mention \"monthly reports\" and implies some kind of control or access. \n\nGiven my category options, I\u2019m contemplating whether this fits as \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or even \"Access,\" depending on whether it's about permissions for sending reports. There\u2019s a lot to unpack here, especially since the wording is quite ambiguous!**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking to categorize this IT ticket, but I notice there's no direct \"Reporting\" option. I\u2019m considering whether it fits under \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or maybe even \"Miscellaneous.\" The ticket mentions setting up monthly reports, which may indicate some automation or scheduling needed. It\u2019s unclear if the user requires permissions, which could point to \"Administrative rights.\" If the description is ambiguous, classifying it as \"Miscellaneous\" is often the safest choice. There\u2019s definitely a lot to unpack!**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning toward categorizing this IT ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it seems related to generating monthly reports. Among my available categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights, the latter could be relevant if permissions are needed for automation. However, without a clear request for admin rights, \"Internal Project\" seems the most appropriate. It\u2019s about setting up automated distribution, which feels like a project task. I plan to output this in a JSON-like format.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe spec indicates that I should respond with a JSON object featuring a \"category\" field that includes a string. Based on my earlier assessment, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" \n\nI need to ensure my output matches the required format exactly, so my response will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. There shouldn\u2019t be any extra text, just the JSON object. Keeping it simple and direct is key! So, here goes: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
