They\u2019re asking about ticket raising, erasing holidays, and naming prefixes. It seems to refer to internal project issues around content governance, possibly leaning towards \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but it might fit \"Internal Project\" if it's about system changes.**Analyzing the IT ticket category**\n\nThis content discusses changing and erasing calendar holidays, along with naming conventions and prefixes. It\u2019s clear it's not about hardware, storage, purchase, or HR support. \"Administrative rights\" might apply if they want to change admin privileges for holiday edits, but it's not definitive. \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fit since it doesn't match other categories. If it's about an internal application calendar component, \"Internal Project\" might work, particularly since they're discussing calendar data editing across various calendars.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering categorizing this IT ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it focuses on application functionality. The options include hardware, HR support, access, miscellaneous, storage, purchase, internal project, and administrative rights. It seems to be a process-train issue about holiday naming across calendars. \"Administrative rights\" could apply if editing is needed, but the ticket isn\u2019t explicitly asking for access. Given the context and its mention of application support, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Internal Project\" for this ticket.**Finalizing the category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided on \"Internal Project\" as the final category. Now, I need to create a JSON object according to the schema provided. The instructions specify that I should return the category in the specified format, which looks like this:\n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}\n\nSo, I\u2019ll output just the JSON: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, making sure there\u2019s no additional information since the required format only allows the category."
