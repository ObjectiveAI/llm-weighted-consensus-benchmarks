The options I have are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since it combines aspects of HR processes and hardware, I'm leaning towards labeling it as \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, it could also fit under \"Hardware\" since it's about retrieving hardware for someone leaving.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI have several categories to choose from: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The user's request to \"Categorize this IT Ticket\" involves a ticket about hardware retrieval for a maternity leave employee. While it could fit under \"HR Support\" due to policies around maternity leave, it's most directly about hardware, which leans me toward categorizing it as \"Hardware\" since that's the actionable item for the IT team.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
