It mentions \u201cwho referred candidates\u201d and \u201cfurther information attached,\u201d so it sounds related to HR or hiring processes. The best fit appears to be \"HR Support,\" which is indeed an option in the category list. The user signed off as \"specialist,\" so it reinforces that connection. I'll categorize this ticket accordingly to help address their issue effectively.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize this ticket as \"HR Support\" or \"Internal Project.\" The user mentioned an issue with a referral tool, which is used by HR to track referrals. It seems clear that this tool isn\u2019t related to hardware or storage, so it makes sense to lean toward \"HR Support.\" The user's reference to a \"specialist\" and the specific issue highlights a potential bug with the software. This indicates that they want assistance with the referral functionality directly.**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nI think the best category for this ticket is \"HR Support\" since it directly relates to HR software. However, if the IT team is dealing with this as an internal tool, they might categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" I don\u2019t see it fitting as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since those pertain to permissions, and it\u2019s not a hardware or storage issue. The user's request to categorize the IT ticket suggests that I should return a JSON object with the selected category.**Finalizing JSON Response**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the ticket as \"HR Support\" since it pertains directly to an HR system issue. The response needs to be in JSON format, so I\u2019ll respond clearly with:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nIt's crucial to ensure that the string matches exactly, especially with the space in \"HR Support.\" While I could add a brief justification, the user mainly requested to categorize, so I\u2019ll keep it succinct without any extra commentary. Thus, the output will strictly be the JSON object as instructed."
