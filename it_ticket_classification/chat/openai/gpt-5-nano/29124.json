Since \"storage\" is also mentioned in the ticket, it seems like the best fit. So, I'm leaning toward categorizing this as either Hardware or Storage, but \"Storage\" might be the more precise choice here.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user wants to categorize an IT ticket, and I\u2019m weighing my options between \"Hardware\" and \"Storage.\" The ticket includes hardware tasks like desktops and refers to \"mechanical hard drives,\" which suggests storage assets. If there's a specific \"Storage\" category, that could be more accurate since it aligns with the request to prepare hard drives. I need to output a JSON object with the chosen category, either {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} or {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I think \"Storage\" might be the right choice here.**Choosing category for ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned preparing \"two OS mechanical hard drives,\" which might imply two hard drives for installing an operating system. The text also references desktop preparation, hinting at a plan for setting up a desktop with these drives. Although \"mechanical hard drives\" clearly relate to hardware, they\u2019re also part of storage provisioning. Given there's ambiguity, if I had to choose, I would lean toward the \"Hardware\" category since it encompasses the broader context of hardware procurement. But it\u2019s tricky!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket. A safe choice might be \"Hardware\" since it encompasses all physical devices, including hard drives. However, since \"Storage\" is an option, it seems more precise for describing storage hardware like hard drives specifically. So, I'm leaning towards selecting \"Storage.\" I\u2019ll prepare my final response as a JSON object with the category set to \"Storage\" to meet the system's requirements.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
