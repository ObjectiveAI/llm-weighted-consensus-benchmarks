Given the mention of HR onboarding, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit. However, there are also elements that could relate to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" due to the focus on access and compliance. Ultimately, HR Support is the most appropriate choice.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe content mentions onboarding a new starter in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, along with references to a compliance officer and completing forms. This suggests that the relevant category is \"HR Support.\" I need to respond by formatting this information as a JSON object with a category field. The correct output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI'll keep it straightforward and avoid additional commentary since the instruction emphasizes a specific response format."
