The user is asking for booking rights for meeting rooms, so I need to decide if that falls under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the mention of \"booking rights,\" it seems to relate to access permissions for using the booking system. My best guess is to choose \"Access\" for this ticket and format the response as JSON with the appropriate category.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI'm thinking about categorizing an IT ticket for booking rights. Administrative rights might suggest some sort of admin privileges, but it\u2019s really about access to booking rights. Given that, I believe \"Access\" is the right choice. I need to ensure that I respond in the correct format as a JSON object, reflecting this category with proper casing. Therefore, my response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Just keeping it straightforward without extra commentary!"
