The most relevant categories seem to be \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" They didn't specifically mention rights, just access, so I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the main category. However, I should weigh the \"Internal Project\" option as well.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe ticket refers to \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The phrase \"access Thursday\" suggests they're asking for access on that day to two links. \"Access\" seems most appropriate here. However, if admin rights are needed to access something, then \"Administrative rights\" could fit too. It sounds like they're requesting access to resources related to automation workshops for a software tester. So, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Access\" and respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
