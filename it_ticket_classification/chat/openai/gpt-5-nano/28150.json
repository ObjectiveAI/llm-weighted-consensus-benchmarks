It seems garbled but mentions hardware allocation, canceling accounts, and employment status, so it looks like it\u2019s about offboarding procedures. The references to \"coming employment\" and \"AD\" might relate to Active Directory, suggesting actions needed for user account management. Overall, this ticket should be categorized under \"Access\" since it's about disabling or closing accounts for someone who is leaving.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m working on categorizing an IT ticket based on the provided details. The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Given that the ticket discusses account cancellations due to employment ending, and includes elements of access management, the most fitting category is \"Access.\" While HR Support seems relevant, it\u2019s primarily about IT processes. I\u2019ll respond in the required format: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nJust to be safe, I\u2019ll add a brief note as needed.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
