The issues include not being able to submit due to populated task details and not being able to select field values. This seems to be primarily about the internal project management software. The best fit for this issue appears to be \"Internal Project,\" though \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could work too. However, \"Internal Project\" feels most appropriate.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether the IT ticket falls under \"Access\" since it mentions not being able to select values. However, the user indicates there's a bug related to populated task details, pointing more toward an issue with the internal project management system. So, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit. \n\nNow I'll prepare a JSON response with just the category. I'll structure it as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Although \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d could be an option if there\u2019s ambiguity, I feel confident in choosing \"Internal Project.\"**Preparing the JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m ready to create the final output as a JSON object. The schema expects just the category property, so I\u2019ll structure it like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to follow the format precisely, without any extra commentary. It\u2019s also important to ensure proper JSON formatting, avoiding any trailing spaces and using double quotes. With that in mind, I\u2019ll finalize that now!"
