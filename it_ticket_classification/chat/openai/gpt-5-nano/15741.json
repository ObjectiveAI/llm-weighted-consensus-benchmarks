The ticket mentions a WebSockets issue for Confluence, involving collaborative editing and synchronization issues. It seems to relate to accessing configurations and proxy settings. I\u2019m thinking this could fall under \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or potentially \"Administrative rights.\" Since it\u2019s primarily about access issues, I\u2019ll likely lean towards choosing \"Access\" as the category. Let's see if that fits!**Identifying IT Ticket Category**\n\nThis looks like an IT support ticket focused on a WebSockets issue with Confluence and related access problems. I'm considering which category fits best: \"Access\" seems a likely choice since it deals with permissions and connections, but \"Internal Project\" might also work since it's about a specific project with Confluence. The user mentioned things like collaborative editing and proxy rewrite rules, and there's an error during an unexpected response code, usually indicating an HTTP issue. I'll lean toward \"Access.\"**Classifying the IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that the issue about WebSockets for Confluence points towards an \"Access\" category since it involves accessing Confluence via a proxy and authentication. However, the ticket also mentions an internal project, which could mean \"Internal Project\" fits too, especially since it\u2019s about collaboration. The dataset probably follows a helpdesk taxonomy, so I need to choose carefully. Since it's specific to Confluence configurations, \"Internal Project\" might be more appropriate, but \"Access\" remains a strong contender.**Parsing the IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the user's message about a WebSockets issue affecting Confluence. It looks like the engineer wants to facilitate WebSocket requests in the production environment after enabling collaborative editing with Synchrony. They\u2019ve set up proxy rewrite rules, which work when bypassing something, but not normally. Since it primarily concerns network and proxy access, I'm thinking \"Access\" is the most fitting category. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and prepare to provide the response in JSON format.**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nI see that the task is to categorize this IT ticket, and it seems they expect a JSON object with a category property. The categories given are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Based on my analysis, \"Access\" is the best fit for the issue at hand. So, I\u2019ll format the response as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI'll keep it straightforward and avoid extra commentary since they just want the categorized output. Let's go!"
