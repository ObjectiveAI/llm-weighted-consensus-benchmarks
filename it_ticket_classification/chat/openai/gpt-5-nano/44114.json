The options I have are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. I want to keep it organized and make sure it goes to the right place. Choosing the right category will help streamline the process and ensure the user gets assistance faster! Let's get this sorted!**Categorizing ticket about adapters**\n\nThe ticket mentions a request to review adapters for meeting rooms on a specific floor in Bucharest, indicating some are broken or not functional. It seems clear this involves hardware, likely related to HDMI or other types of adapters. I feel confident this ticket should be categorized under \"Hardware.\" This way, it will be directed to the right team for proper handling. Let's make sure the user gets the support they need!**Determining final category format**\n\nI\u2019m digging into whether this ticket could fit under other categories like \"Administrative Rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Purchase,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" But really, it\u2019s best categorized as \"Hardware\" since it's all about reviewing adapters in meeting rooms. So, I need to output it in the correct JSON format as specified: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. I'll make sure it strictly follows the required structure without any extra text. Time to deliver this neatly!"
