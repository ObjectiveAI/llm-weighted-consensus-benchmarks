The categories given are specific, including \"Access,\" which seems to fit since the content mentions wanting access to documents. Other categories like \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase\" don't apply here. I'll format my response as a JSON object according to the schema, specifying that the category is \"Access.\" It\u2019s essential to get this right!**Deciding on category for IT ticket**\n\nI'm determining the appropriate category for the IT ticket focused on accessing documents. The ticket mentions \"access documents\" and \"confidential information,\" which strongly suggests the \"Access\" category. Although \"Administrative rights\" could also apply if permissions are needed, it seems most fitting to classify it as \"Access.\" Since I need to stick to the required JSON format, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s important to follow the structure exactly!"
