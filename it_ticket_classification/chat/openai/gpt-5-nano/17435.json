Phrases like \"invalid permission\" and \"administrator\" point towards issues with Access or Administrative rights. Given the context of access management and the specific mention of permissions, it seems appropriate to categorize this ticket under \"Access.\" That aligns well with the user\u2019s concerns about rights and permissions.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI'm deciding between categorizing the IT ticket as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The focus is clearly on user permissions related to a requisition system, which suggests an access control issue. The mention of \"administrators\" indicates that contacting an admin may be necessary. The error \"requester invalid permission requisition error\" further points to an access problem rather than hardware or other categories. Given this context, I lean towards \"Administrative rights\" as it aligns with the need for specific elevated permissions. However, \"Access\" is also a suitable category.**Confirming category output**\n\nThe phrase \"Administrative rights\" might suggest a request for admin privileges, but this situation relates to a requisition process in an Oracle system. Thus, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" The response will be in JSON format with the category field containing \"Access.\" I\u2019ll ensure it\u2019s properly structured, sticking to the required format without extra commentary. So, the output will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
