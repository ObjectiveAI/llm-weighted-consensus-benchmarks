The text talks about being denied access to a shared location and needing write access. This points me toward either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Both categories touch on permissions, but since it specifically mentions needing write access, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" as the best fit. It's about permissions to access shared locations!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user is submitting an internal IT ticket regarding permissions. The request mentions \"access denied on shared location\" and a need for \"write access.\" Although \"Administrative rights\" could seem fitting for modification abilities, the focus here is on access control. Given that the issue directly relates to permissions for a shared location, categorizing it as \"Access\" makes the most sense. I\u2019ll prepare the final output as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
