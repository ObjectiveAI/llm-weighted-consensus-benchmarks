The prompt provides a schema with categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. The user describes a problem with data not loading, even after reinstalling the suite. This could indicate a software issue, but there\u2019s no specific category for that. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too generic, while \"Access\" relates to permissions. I think \"Storage\" might make sense if it's related to a storage issue. The options are pretty limited!**Classifying IT issues**\n\nI'm working on classifying an IT ticket. The user keeps mentioning \"loading data\" and stated they tried reinstalling the suite, which suggests a software issue. However, there's no category for \"Software.\" The closest option is \"Miscellaneous,\" but I\u2019m considering \"Administrative rights\" if access is an issue, although that's not clear. \"Internal Project\" doesn't fit, and \"Storage\" could apply if it\u2019s a storage failure but isn\u2019t explicit. I think I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous\" in the JSON object format, as it best covers the ambiguity.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
