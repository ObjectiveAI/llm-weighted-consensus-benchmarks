They\u2019re asking to deactivate the lost card and create a replacement. Considering the available categories, it seems to fit best under \u201cAccess\u201d since it's related to security and access control. There\u2019s a chance it could be classified as \u201cHR Support,\u201d but typically, lost badges are categorized as \u201cAccess.\u201d So, I'll respond with {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Formatting output correctly**\n\nI need to make sure there's no extra text and provide only the required JSON object. The instruction emphasizes that it should be parsed by code, so I'll avoid heavy formatting. The category object I've decided on is good, and all I need to produce is {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's straightforward, and I just want to follow those instructions precisely. That's all I need to do here!"
