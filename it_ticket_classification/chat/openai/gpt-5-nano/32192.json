The user mentions \"open ports\" and \"migration solution implementing physical ports,\" which indicates it's likely about network infrastructure or hardware requirements. Terms like \"mobile team\" and \"available ports\" suggest they\u2019re looking into network ports, possibly for device connection. Therefore, I'll fit this into the \"Hardware\" category, as it aligns closely with the needs of physical infrastructure and port management.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s ticket mentions \"physical ports,\" which definitely points to hardware. However, since it's about a migration solution for a team, it leans more toward \"Internal Project.\" The request to categorize aligns with the taxonomy provided, and I should consider that \"open ports\" and \"documentation\" could also fit under \"Access,\" especially if it involves network permissions. Still, the strongest match remains \"Internal Project,\" as it deals with a specific implementation\u2014possibly hardware-related\u2014within an IT project. I\u2019ll settle on that for now.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe term \"physical ports\" likely refers to hardware ports like USB, but the phrase \"open new ones for all mobile team\" suggests it might be about network ports to support mobile services. This leans towards network planning. Since \"Networking\" isn't a category, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit, especially with the emphasis on process documentation in phrases like \"documented somewhere.\" \n\nI\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like object, categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" and keeping it simple. The response will be formatted like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
