The main focus appears to be on a software problem. It could potentially fit under \"Internal Project,\" given that it deals with an internal system, but \"Miscellaneous\" might also be applicable as a catch-all. However, none of the options perfectly define a \"software issue.\" I'll weigh my options carefully before categorizing it.**Selecting category for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories available: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given that this ticket is about a software bug in what seems to be an internal project, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best fit. While \"Software\" would be more accurate, it's not listed. So, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" \n\nI'll respond in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to follow the system's required response format, which is a JSON object that includes a category property. So, I'll write my response as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It\u2019s important to make sure there\u2019s no extra text included since the instructions call for just the JSON output. I\u2019ll ensure that I follow this accurately so the user gets exactly what they need! Let\u2019s go ahead and finalize that JSON response."
