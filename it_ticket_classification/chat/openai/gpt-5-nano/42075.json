The allowed categories are somewhat limited; although options like \"Hardware\" or \"Access\" could fit, the focus seems to lean more towards hardware since it involves the physical connection. There's no specific category for \"Networking,\" so I'll categorize it as \"Hardware\" because that seems the most appropriate for a wired connection problem.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the ticket about a connection issue, which relates primarily to network connectivity. Without a specific \"Networking\" category, I'll choose \"Hardware\" because it deals with physical connections. There's also a potential \"Access\" angle, but there's no mention of logins or permissions, and \"Administrative rights\" isn\u2019t applicable. So, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware\" and ensure the output matches the JSON format specified, focusing on just the \"category\" property.**Constructing the final output**\n\nI need to focus on delivering just the JSON object without any extra commentary. So, I\u2019ll construct the object as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. There\u2019s no need to factor in \"Urgent\" or \"High importance\" for this output. I\u2019ll make sure everything is clear and straightforward before finalizing my response. This step is all about being precise, so I\u2019ll go ahead and provide the final version now."
