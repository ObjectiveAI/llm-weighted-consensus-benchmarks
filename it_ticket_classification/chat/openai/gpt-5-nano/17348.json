I need to determine which category fits best, weighing if it's more about HR issues or access-related concerns.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm handling an IT ticket that mentions various topics like reports, timecards, updates to personnel records, and absence leave. Given these details, it seems most appropriate to categorize it as \"HR Support\" because it relates to HR processes. However, there could be elements suggesting \"Administrative rights\" too.
