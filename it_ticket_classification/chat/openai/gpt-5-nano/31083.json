The ticket content is quite noisy, but it seems to revolve around \"PM changes Oracle Wednesday PM,\" \"production hosting,\" and \"mobile hosting.\" It could fit into categories like Access, Administrative rights, or Miscellaneous. It seems like a request regarding \"production changes\" in Oracle related to hosting.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the available categories: Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights, Access, Hardware, Miscellaneous, and HR Support. The ticket seems to fit into Access, Administrative rights, or Miscellaneous. The user\u2019s message suggests they might want to change \"PM\" in the production Oracle environment on Wednesday. It looks like they could mean changing permissions or something related to a public manager. Given this, I think categorizing it as Administrative rights is best, as it pertains to access changes in the production environment.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe categories available don't specifically include \"Access change,\" but \"Access\" is relevant if the user wants to change their access. The phrase \"change pm production\" suggests they might be asking about permission changes in the production environment. This leans toward Administrative rights or Access. Since the request seems most aligned with changing access levels, I think the \"Access\" category fits.\n\nI'll keep my response minimal and provide the JSON format for clarity: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
