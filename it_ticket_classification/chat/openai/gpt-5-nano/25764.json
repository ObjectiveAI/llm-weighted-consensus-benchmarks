For HR processes, the IT category labeled \"HR Support\" definitely covers offboarding tasks, but contract extensions fall under HR. However, since the system is focused on internal IT ticket categorization, it seems offboarding would involve both HR and IT. The best fit for categorization appears to be \"HR Support.\" Also, is this ticket multi-lingual?**Analyzing HR categorization**\n\nThis message is a bit messy, but the main points are clear: it seems to discuss \"leaver forms,\" interns, and signed contracts extending someone's stay until December. There's mention of employees leaving or staying, with the \"bulk leaver form\" indicating an HR process, while \"accounts closed\" suggests an IT action. Given this context, the right category for this is \"HR Support.\" \n\nI\u2019ll respond with a JSON structure:  \n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}  \nSo the category value will be \"HR Support.\"**Finalizing JSON format**\n\nThe system expects a specific format, and the instructions clearly state to respond with the correct JSON structure. The category I need to use is \"HR Support.\" \n\nAccording to the prompt, I should represent this in a more structured way, like a JSON object. However, I can safely output it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nThis captures the required information concisely. Now, I'll make sure that\u2019s final and ready to go!"
