If the user is asking to remove a recurring meeting, it seems like it might fit under \"Administrative rights\" since it involves calendar permissions. Alternatively, if it's a bit unclear, I could also use \"Miscellaneous.\" I wonder if there's a chance that \"Access\" could apply too, but since the user hasn\u2019t explicitly stated any lack of access, \"Administrative rights\" could be the way to go.**Parsing meeting requests**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize a request related to removing a recurrent meeting from a calendar. \"Internal Project\" doesn\u2019t quite fit, and \"Miscellaneous\" might be too vague. The user mentions they want a colleague\u2019s recurring afternoon meeting adjusted, and it seems there could be updates needed due to \"jabber ramping down,\" possibly referring to Cisco Jabber. They likely want the calendar revised to reflect room availability for rescheduling. This clearly relates to scheduling and calendar management rather than hardware or access issues.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
