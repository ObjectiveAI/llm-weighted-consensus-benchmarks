So, I\u2019ll respond with:\n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}\n\nThis maintains consistency, aligning with the instructions!**Delivering IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize the IT ticket asking for \"Categorize this IT Ticket:\". I\u2019ll follow their instructions closely.\n\nI see that they have a schema indicating a wrapper, but I believe they\u2019re expecting just the category value. To be safe, I\u2019ll respond with a minimal JSON object that fulfills their request without unnecessary elements. So, I\u2019ll simply output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra text and that \"Access\" is properly capitalized."
