The ticket is a bit unclear but mentions adding a server and inventory related to a recent upgrade. \n\nSince server creation involves hardware, it seems that \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category. The mention of adding inventory could relate to an \"Internal Project\" as well, though it doesn't fit neatly into the provided categories.\n\nOverall, I'll settle on categorizing this ticket under \"Hardware\".**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a ticket that mentions adding a server and inventory related to a recent upgrade. It seems like this could fit the \"Internal Project\" category, but since the key task is the server addition, \"Hardware\" is likely the more accurate choice since servers are hardware. \n\nThe mention of inventory doesn\u2019t have a clear category, so I\u2019ll stick with \"Hardware\" for clarity. I'll finalize this decision by formatting my response as a JSON object with the category set to \"Hardware\".{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
