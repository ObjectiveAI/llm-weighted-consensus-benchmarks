It looks like this is related to onboarding a new employee, so I should consider categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" Since it's specifically about onboarding, I believe \"HR Support\" fits best. I'll go with that for the ticket categorization!**Categorizing IT ticket message**\n\nThe message seems to be instructing us to fill out a form for a new starter PM. While it could fit several categories like \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights,\" it definitely looks like an onboarding form, so \"HR Support\" seems most appropriate. I need to respond with a JSON object that matches the required format. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Adding an explanation is tempting, but it seems best to stick to just the category for now.**Providing IT ticket category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, and I need to respond with just the category in a JSON object. Based on the content, I'll go with \"HR Support.\" The required format is straightforward, so my response will simply be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll make sure not to add any extra text or formatting around it, just the clean JSON object as specified."
