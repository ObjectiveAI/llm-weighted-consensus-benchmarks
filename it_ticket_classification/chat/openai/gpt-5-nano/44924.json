This seems to fall under the \"Access\" category because it relates to permissions or accessibility in their Outlook account. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object with \"category\": \"Access\".**Categorizing IT access issue**\n\nThe user has a ticket stating they can\u2019t open someone else's calendar in Outlook, while they can access their own. The mention of an error suggests there\u2019s an issue with permissions. This situation fits best under the \"Access\" category, as it involves access rights to another user\u2019s calendar. Since this isn't related to hardware, I'll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, without any additional text."
