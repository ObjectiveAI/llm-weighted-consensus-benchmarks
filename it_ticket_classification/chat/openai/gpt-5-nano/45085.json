The text mentions leave days from last year, which implies it's more HR-related. The allowed categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I think \"HR Support\" fits best because the request pertains to leave days, even though it's in an IT ticket context.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nI need to categorize the request about an annual leave issue regarding days carried over from last year. Although it feels more HR-related, it was submitted as an IT ticket. The most fitting category is \"HR Support.\" I also noticed the format requires a JSON object, which should include this category. So, I'll respond with the following JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That should meet the user's needs and follow the format provided.**Finalizing JSON Response**\n\nI need to ensure I format the output correctly in JSON for the category. The user's content pertains to an annual leave issue, which clearly falls under \"HR Support.\" While I could provide a justification, the main instruction is just to categorize, so I\u2019ll keep it succinct. I\u2019ll respond in the designated \"final\" channel with just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This way, I provide exactly what\u2019s requested without any extra text."
