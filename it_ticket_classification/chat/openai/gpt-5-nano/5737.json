The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the context of the text, it seems to touch on permissions and access issues related to experiments, which leans towards the \"Access\" category. I'll respond in JSON format, matching the structure outlined in the instructions for code parsing.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI need to figure out the right category for this IT ticket. The provided text is a bit jumbled, but it mentions phrases like \"restore rights,\" \"station permission,\" and \"cannot install,\" which suggests issues related to permissions and access for installations. It seems to be pointing towards \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" since the user might be requesting admin rights to install drivers for their experiments. I think \"Administrative rights\" will be the best fit here, as it's a specific category.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing the content of the ticket, particularly phrases like \"restore rights,\" which indicates that the user is looking to regain permissions. This seems to point towards the \"Administrative rights\" category. While \"Access\" could also work since it relates to access rights, \"Administrative rights\" feels more explicit. The ticket primarily focuses on rights and installation restrictions, so \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
