This is a bit tricky!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nIt turns out \"Access\" is an allowed category. The message includes \"please assign,\" which might mean they want to allocate a task or a license. It also mentions a \"contracts module,\" suggesting it could be tied to some internal system. Since they signed off as \"tester,\" it's possible they're requesting access for that person. I think \"Internal Project\" fits best since this is related to a module, documentation, and billing\u2014elements of an internal initiative. I\u2019ll categorize it in JSON format as requested.**Formatting the category response**\n\nThe prompt includes a JSON schema for the category, which I need to follow. I should choose one of the allowed categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. Given the message about \"documentation billing\" and \"contracts module,\" it seems likely related to some internal project. Although \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" are mentioned, they aren't explicitly requested. Since \"Internal Project\" fits well, I\u2019ll categorize it as such and provide: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I'll keep it concise!"
