The ticket content is quite jumbled, mentioning approvals, planned start dates, logging, task assignments, and change references. This indicates there could be multiple topics present. I\u2019ll need to parse through the jumble carefully to determine the best fit for categorization within the provided allowed values.**Determining ticket categories**\n\nI'm exploring how to categorize an IT ticket based on the allowed categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The content hints at being related to an \"Internal Project,\" possibly involving requests about task changes or summaries. While there\u2019s a mention of \"administrative rights\" and \"approval required,\" it doesn't clearly indicate access control. It seems the best fit is \"Internal Project\" due to its focus on development and task management. I'll categorize it accordingly!**Formulating JSON output**\n\nI need to create a JSON-like object with a \"category\" field based on the provided schema. The valid categories include \"Internal Project,\" which seems to fit the ticket's content best since it mentions libraries and a view link, indicating a software feature for an internal project. The user simply asked me to categorize the IT ticket, so my output should be clean and straightforward. I'll ensure it follows the expected format precisely, like this: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}."
