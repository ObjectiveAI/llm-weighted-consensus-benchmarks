The message seems to contain specific details, so I should ensure I understand what the user needs and how to properly classify the request. It\u2019s important to accurately categorize it to streamline the process for the user and anyone who will handle this ticket later. Let's get this sorted out!**Identifying change request**\n\nI\u2019m looking at this content, and wow, it\u2019s pretty tangled! It seems the user is asking for a Change Request (CR) related to a survey system. They mention issues like reminders affecting response rates and users struggling with input, which caused duplicate responses. The goal is probably to streamline the survey process to enhance user experience and increase responses. I need to make sure I capture all the relevant details clearly to support their request effectively.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants to raise a Change Request (CR) regarding a survey for December, focusing on improving survey completion and addressing reminders. This ticket includes details about response rates being cut in half and a proposed solution for users. I need to categorize this ticket appropriately. Given that it involves surveys, reminders, and internal processes, I\u2019m thinking it fits best under \u201cInternal Project,\u201d or possibly \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d since it doesn\u2019t align with the other categories like HR or Access.**Deciding on category**\n\nIt looks like \u201cInternal Project\u201d is the closest fit since this is about a change request for an internal survey system. The user asked to categorize the IT ticket, so I'll respond with a JSON object that includes the category property set to \"Internal Project.\" However, I'm also considering if \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d might be more suitable since it involves improvements to reminders within the survey system. Ultimately, though, it aligns closely with ongoing internal projects. So, I\u2019ll stick with \u201cInternal Project.\u201d**Finalizing category response**\n\nI\u2019ve confirmed that this is a change request for a survey system for December. It doesn\u2019t relate to hardware or access, but rather an internal process improvement. So it fits best under \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll prepare my response as a JSON object, which simply states the category. Following the request, I won\u2019t include any extra explanations. I\u2019m ready to deliver the output as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
