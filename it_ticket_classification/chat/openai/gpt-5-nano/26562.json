The message is a bit garbled, but it mentions a purchase order (PO) and seems to refer to a TV stand installation. Among the provided categories, it looks like it best fits under \"Purchase.\" So, I'm going to format my response as a JSON object indicating the relevant category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m working on an IT ticket that mentions a \"new purchase PO\" which likely refers to a \"purchase order\" along with installation requests. It includes terms like \"tv stand\" and \"log installation,\" which points to hardware and purchasing aspects. Given the mention of new purchases and the need for installation, I think the best fit for this ticket is the \"Purchase\" category. I just need to format this as a JSON object.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing an IT ticket that includes some confusing phrases like \"negro meters\" and \"tv male male.\" They might be typos, perhaps referring to a \"TV mount\" instead. The mention of \"inclination\" could indicate the angle of the TV stand. However, since the core of the ticket revolves around a new purchase order and installation, I think the safest category is \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll format my final response as a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
