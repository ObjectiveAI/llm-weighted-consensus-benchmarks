It likely falls under \"HR Support\" since it relates to hiring and onboarding. There are mentions of automatic hires and templates needing updates. While it talks about a mailbox and receiving messages, it's not really requesting access rights. Therefore, I\u2019m concluding it fits best under \"HR Support.\"**Categorizing response**\n\nThe phrase \"welcome message to complete\" and \"joined position developer\" clearly indicates this is related to HR onboarding. So, I need to categorize it as \"HR Support.\" Now, I should craft a concise response in the required JSON format. The instructions specify that I need to output a JSON-like object with \"category\": string values. Thus, my response will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I'll make sure to deliver that succinctly!"
