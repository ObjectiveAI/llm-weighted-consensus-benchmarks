The available categories are \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase.\" Since the request specifically mentions changing a hard drive, it fits best as a hardware issue. However, it also relates to storage upgrades. Given that the main issue is the slow performance tied to changing the drive, I think \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate choice.**Deciding on Category for IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket where the user wants to change their hard drive. The options include \"Hardware\" and \"Storage,\" but since it\u2019s specifically about upgrading the hard drive, \"Storage\" seems most appropriate. I should format the output as a JSON object, which aligns with the requirements. So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I\u2019ll keep the explanation minimal, just focusing on delivering that structured response. Let's get that sorted!**Confirming Output Format**\n\nI need to ensure that the category is formatted correctly and matches the expected capitalization. The proper response should be exactly \"Storage\" for clarity and consistency. So, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. It feels reassuring to confirm this \u2014 the structure is clear, and I'm meeting the requirements. Let\u2019s go ahead and get that output finalized!"
