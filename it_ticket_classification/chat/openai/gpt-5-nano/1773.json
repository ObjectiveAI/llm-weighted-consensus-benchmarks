It seems related to IT operations and difficulties with builds, so it might fit \"Internal Project\" since it discusses deploying changes and jobs. That seems like the best option. I'll respond with a JSON object, setting the \"category\" value to \"Internal Project\" in the required format.**Creating JSON for Ticket Category**\n\nI need to respond with a category in a specific JSON format. The instruction indicates I should output a JSON object and include the category key. Based on the ticket's references to \"environment,\" \"deploying changes,\" and \"jobs,\" it seems to align best with \"Internal Project\" rather than \"Miscellaneous.\" So, I\u2019ll craft the response as simply: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This should be straightforward, ensuring there\u2019s no extra commentary, just the final JSON."
