It mentions \"new starter,\" \"contractor starter form,\" and specific dates, which points to onboarding. This makes me think it falls under \"HR Support\" or \"Access,\" perhaps even \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" depending on the broader context. Typically, onboarding includes tasks like access provisioning, hardware, and accounts. I\u2019ll have to decide the most fitting category.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nIt seems like \"Access\" is the best fit for provisioning accounts for a new starter. The user's message includes repetitive phrases that suggest they\u2019re asking about a \"contractor starter form date.\" Since this relates to onboarding and access requirements, I\u2019ll select \"Access.\" It could have been \"Administrative rights,\" but the focus seems less on admin privileges. I'll prepare the final output as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Sounds good!"
