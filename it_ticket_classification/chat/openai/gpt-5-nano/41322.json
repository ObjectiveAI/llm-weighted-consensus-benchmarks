The user mentioned \"reoccurring profile issues\" and \"unable to access files,\" which seems to suggest problems with their profile and files. Since this involves user access, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" Although roaming profile issues often fall under \"Profile/Access,\" \"Access\" is the closest match in this case. So, I\u2019ll finalize it as {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
