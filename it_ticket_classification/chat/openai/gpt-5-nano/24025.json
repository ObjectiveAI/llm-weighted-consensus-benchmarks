It's quite messy, but there are key phrases like \"had trouble accessing meetings\" and \"connecting.\" Given this content, it makes sense to fit it into the \"Access\" category since it primarily deals with connectivity issues and invites. Also, it references \"resources\" which supports this classification.**Categorizing as Access**\n\nI see that the issue revolves around accessing meetings and invites, which clearly ties into the \"Access\" category. I need to format this response as a JSON object according to the specified structure. It should look like this: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. It's important to avoid including extra text and make sure the format is valid. I'll stick to a single category in my final output, so this will be straightforward!"
