It seems to touch on \u201capprover role,\u201d delegation, and termination, which indicates it's mainly about access. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Access,\" although \"HR Support\" might be relevant too. Overall, I'll pick \"Access\" since it focuses on access rights.**Determining the Appropriate Category**\n\nThe text mentions terms like \"termination,\" \"approver tasks,\" and \"delegate,\" indicating it's likely about offboarding. It could fit under \"Administrative rights\" since it involves approver privileges and delegating tasks. But there's also the option of \"Access,\" which covers user accounts and permissions more broadly. However, since this ticket focuses on updating approver roles and permissions due to departures, I'm thinking \"Administrative rights\" is the clearer choice for this situation. It seems to fit best!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
