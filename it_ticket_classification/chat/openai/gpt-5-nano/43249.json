It's important to get this right so that the ticket can be addressed effectively. I'll have to think carefully about which category best fits the ticket's nature and ensure it doesn't end up misallocated. Let\u2019s tackle this categorization step by step.**Analyzing feedback survey ticket**\n\nI have a ticket that discusses issues with a feedback survey, specifically related to rating rules. It mentions concerns like rating one\u2019s own ticket and the need to possibly remove those ratings. There\u2019s also a request to raise an exception when the person closing the ticket is the same as the one who raised it. I need to carefully go through this to ensure all the points are understood and addressed appropriately. Let\u2019s break this down step by step!**Categorizing survey issue ticket**\n\nI need to address a ticket about checking what happened with a feedback survey, deleting grades, and raising an exception if the ticket closer is the same as the raiser. This seems to touch on internal processes and policies related to the survey system, making it tricky to categorize. It\u2019s not about hardware, HR, or access. It feels like it falls under \u201cInternal Project\u201d or possibly \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d since it relates to changes in survey rules. Let\u2019s clarify this!**Deciding on category for ticket**\n\nI see there's a \"Miscellaneous\" category for issues that don't fit elsewhere, but since this ticket is specific to internal processes, \u201cInternal Project\u201d feels like the better fit. It relates to the survey module of the internal ticketing system. The mention of a \"requirements sheet\" hints at internal tasks, reinforcing that. I\u2019ll go with \u201cInternal Project\u201d for the category and craft a concise JSON response to reflect that choice. Let's finalize it!**Creating JSON output for ticket category**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket by producing a JSON object according to the specified format. I will set the category to \"Internal Project,\" but I must ensure it matches the required structure. The schema suggests I should provide a full JSON object. While typically, I might just provide the category value, I\u2019ll adhere to the prescribed format. So, I'll finalize it as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let\u2019s keep it straightforward!"
