Their text is a bit jumbled, but it indicates issues with recovering contacts and adding external contacts. They mention key terms like \"contacts,\" \"recovery,\" and \"developer,\" which will guide my categorization. Given the available categories like Hardware, HR Support, and Access, this ticket doesn't fit neatly into hardware since it's about a software issue related to contacts.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm trying to figure out the right category for this IT ticket regarding missing contacts. It could relate to \"Administrative rights\" if the issue involves needing access to a contact list. The \"Access\" category also makes sense because they might be facing permission problems. Since the ticket is about recovering data, it might fit into \"Storage,\" but that typically relates to files or hardware. \"Miscellaneous\" is a backup option, but I think \"Administrative rights\" or \"Storage\" are the best fits.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing a user message that hints at missing contacts, likely related to \"Outlook\" or \"Exchange.\" Since this is a data recovery situation, I'm thinking it fits best under \"Storage\" because it's about restoring data rather than hardware issues. \"Miscellaneous\" could apply if the system isn't clearly defined, but \"Storage\" seems the most appropriate. I\u2019ll respond with the category as a JSON object, ensuring I follow the format exactly as required. Here goes:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
