It seems like a UI/UX issue that doesn't clearly fit in any specific category. I think it could be \"Miscellaneous\" since it covers general issues, but also \"Access\" if it's about login or permissions. Given the focus on navigation and language settings, \"Miscellaneous\" feels most appropriate, as we don't have a \"Software\" category for such bugs.**Formatting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking through how to categorize this IT ticket related to navigating a career search and changing languages. I considered \"Administrative rights\" but that's not quite fitting, and while \"Internal Project\" could apply if it's about an internal careers page, it doesn\u2019t seem right either. I need to format my response in JSON as required, using \"Miscellaneous\" based on the overall context. So, the output would be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m assessing potential issues with a careers page and its language toggler. It\u2019s clearly an internal site issue, so \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the right category. I briefly considered \"Access\" for language change, but that doesn\u2019t quite fit either. Since the instructions specify I should just provide a categorized response, I\u2019ll stick to delivering the JSON object without additional text. The final response will be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
