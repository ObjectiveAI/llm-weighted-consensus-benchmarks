The terms \"owner\" and \"add rest members\" imply that it could be about administrative rights or access control. Therefore, I think the best category for this ticket would be \"Administrative rights.\"**Determining the Ticket Category**\n\nI need to decide if this IT ticket should be categorized as \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" The mention of \"owner\" and \"add rest members\" suggests it\u2019s related to granting access or adjusting membership. Based on the ticket text, which seems to indicate a request to list owners and add members, it feels appropriate to categorize it as \"Access.\" If it were specifically focused on admin rights, I might consider \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Access\" seems to fit best here.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize this IT ticket as \"Access\" since it involves permission changes. Now, I need to construct the output in the required JSON format. I'll create the JSON object as {\"category\": \"Access\"}. I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no additional text, just the necessary output. Let\u2019s finalize that and present it in the requested format now."
