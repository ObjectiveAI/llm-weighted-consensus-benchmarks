It seems mainly related to HR onboarding, so \"HR Support\" comes to mind. But there's also a mention of \"access,\u201d which may imply they need system access for a new contractor. However, since this concerns IT, I\u2019ll classify it as \"HR Support\" since that fits best for their request.**Classifying Ticket Content**\n\nThe user's request about the \"new starter form\" seems to involve onboarding, possibly requiring access provisioning or account creation. However, since they specifically ask for help with completing the form, rather than account setup, it leans towards \"HR Support.\" Another possibility could be \"Administrative rights,\" if they're referring to contractor access. But overall, the category that fits best is \u201cHR Support.\u201d I\u2019ll ensure to format this as a JSON object with the appropriate category.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
