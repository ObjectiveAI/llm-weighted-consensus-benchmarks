So, it seems like it falls into the \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" categories.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nThe text refers to \"permissions granted,\" \"cancel existing approvals,\" and \"alter existing approvals,\" with a focus on software request flows and licensing. Given that this involves granting permissions and altering approvals, I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as \"Administrative rights.\" However, \"Access\" could also fit since it addresses access rights and approval workflows.\n\nConsidering the specifics of the requests, \"Administrative rights\" seems the most accurate choice, but I\u2019m wondering if \"Access\" might be a better fit too. I\u2019ll go with \"Administrative rights\" for clarity.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
