It fits into either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since the ticket specifically involves modifying access rights for employees, \"Administrative rights\" seems like a more precise category. However, given that \"Access\" typically refers to user access issues, I need to consider that too. I'll lean towards \"Administrative rights\" for clarity.**Formatting the JSON response**\n\nThe request to \"remove access right to secured area\" indicates this is about user permissions, which makes \"Access\" the appropriate category. The user might want this for ticket routing, so I'll format my response as a JSON object. The required format has me specify the category as a string. I\u2019ll ensure the correct format is: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. The instructions say to respond with the category object only, so I won't add justification here. I'll stick with delivering just the JSON.**Responding with JSON format**\n\nI see that the required format is a JSON object with a specific structure. The system instruction tells me that the \"category\" should be a string and can take specific values. Since the task is about removing access rights, \"Access\" seems to be the right choice. Therefore, I\u2019ll structure my response as: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. It's clear and concise, fulfilling the requirement to deliver just the category information in the right format like that!"
