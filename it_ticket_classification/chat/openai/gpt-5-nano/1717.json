Let's get this right to ensure the ticket gets to the appropriate team for a quick resolution!**Understanding offboarding details**\n\nIt looks like the content relates to an employee offboarding process, specifically a leaver form. This includes crucial aspects like Active Directory rights, mailbox access, roaming profiles, inventory storage, mobile phone subscriptions, and tokens. It seems the form is filled out with information about the employee\u2019s name, location, leaving date, and various approvals needed. I\u2019ll need to ensure all necessary details are captured correctly for a smooth transition, so nothing gets overlooked during the offboarding process!**Categorizing offboarding requests**\n\nThis is about offboarding and removing access, so I think the category to choose is \"Access,\" since it involves things like AD rights, mailboxes, and roaming profiles. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit, it\u2019s more focused on deprovisioning tasks. The ticket also mentions leaving details and comments, reinforcing that it's related to access removal. Given the options available, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" and format my response in the required JSON-like format!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
