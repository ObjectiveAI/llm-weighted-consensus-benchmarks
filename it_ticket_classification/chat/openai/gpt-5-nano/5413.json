The options are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights. The ticket clearly indicates they want to upgrade memory due to performance concerns, so \"Hardware\" seems like the best fit. It might also touch on \"Purchase,\" but the main issue is hardware-related. Responding with a JSON object for the category is the way to go!**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nThe expected output format is a JSON object containing a category property. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. The schema specifies that it needs a type object with specific category string values. I need to ensure that the output is strictly formatted as JSON, without any extra commentary. \n\nI could consider \"Purchase\" if they are looking to buy new RAM, but the main issue seems to be related to hardware. Therefore, I'll classify it as \"Hardware\" and respond with {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Delivering IT Ticket Classification**\n\nThe user mentioned \"upgrades\" and \"memory,\" which suggests a request for a hardware upgrade. While it might also fit under \"Purchase\" if they're looking to acquire new components, the more straightforward classification here is \"Hardware,\" as it focuses on the upgrade itself. Since I'm instructed to categorize the IT ticket, I'll prepare the output as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Time to deliver this clear and concise response!"
