It seems like a hardware issue since they're having problems with USB or HDMI ports. While \"Internal Project\" could be a consideration if it relates to a specific project, it looks more like a hardware malfunction overall. So, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware\" and output a JSON object stating the category.**Structuring Response**\n\nI need to respond with the category in a structured format using the defined JSON schema. The response should be strictly in the format: {\"category\":\"...\"} where I choose from the enumerated types. Since this is about a hardware issue, I\u2019ll use \"Hardware\" as the value. I\u2019ll ensure to be concise and provide just the JSON output without any extra text. So the final response will simply be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
