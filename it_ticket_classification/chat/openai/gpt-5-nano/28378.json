Looking at the categories, the issue seems to relate to hardware, as it primarily concerns audio equipment. While it could fit under Purchase since they're requesting it, the focus remains on the hardware aspect. Therefore, I'll categorize this as Hardware to reflect that it's an audio hardware request specifically. Let's prepare the JSON object now!**Outputting JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nThe content mentions \"echoing too much noise,\" which relates to the microphone issue at hand. While it could possibly fit under \"Internal Project,\" it's clearly a hardware request. I\u2019ll categorize it as Hardware. \n\nNow, according to the required format for the JSON object, I need to ensure it matches the specified schema. The output should look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll stick to that without any extra text. Let\u2019s deliver it!"
