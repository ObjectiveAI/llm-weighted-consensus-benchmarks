It's tricky to sort through, and it might fit into \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll have to choose carefully!**Categorizing IT ticket further**\n\nI'm noticing the mention of \"staging environment,\" which likely ties into IT, suggesting this ticket could be labeled as \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" The reference to \"document proposal\" and including a perspectives component adds to the content focus, which aligns with an internal project. The \"holiday notice\" makes me question if it fits into \"Administrative rights,\" but it feels more like an internal task. Given all this, the \"Internal Project\" category seems like the best fit!**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m seeing that I need to respond with a JSON object based on the category schema: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. The prompt specifically says to categorize the IT ticket and indicates that the output should be in this format. It seems clear that I should provide just the JSON without any additional commentary, focusing solely on meeting the requirements. I'll craft my final answer to ensure it matches exactly, using proper capitalization for \"Internal Project.\""
