I\u2019m considering classifying it as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it highlights permissions, I think it leans more toward \"Administrative rights,\" which focuses on who can change these permissions. The user mentions \"new permissions\" and references their own management of these changes. Overall, it's about access control, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" for clarity in managing permissions effectively.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
