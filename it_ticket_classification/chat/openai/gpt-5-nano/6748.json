The ticket mentions \"request monitor keyboard,\" which indicates it's related to hardware. There are two categories available: \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" It seems more appropriate to categorize it as \"Hardware,\" since it's specifically about equipment. However, \"Purchase\" could also fit if it's about acquiring new items. Ultimately, \"Hardware\" is likely the best choice for this ticket.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nSince this is a hardware request, I need to decide whether to categorize it as \"Purchase\" due to procurement. However, the phrase \"request monitor keyboard\" suggests the \"Hardware\" category fits better, likely as peripherals, although that specific subcategory isn't available. My best option is to categorize it as \"Hardware\" and note it\u2019s for provisioning. I'll format the output as a JSON object with the required \"category\" property set to \"Hardware.\" So, my response will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
