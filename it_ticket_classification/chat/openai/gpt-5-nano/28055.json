Overall, it feels most aligned with the \"Hardware\" category.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket text mentions a \"monitor request\" and refers to \"adapter connect monitor needed,\" which suggests it's about hardware setup. If I have to choose just one category, I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit since it involves monitors, adapters, and connecting mobile devices.\n\nIt could potentially relate to \"Internal Project\" due to automation tests, but the primary focus seems to stem from a hardware need. Plus, I need to format my response as a JSON object.\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m ready to output the category as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nHowever, I\u2019m wondering if \"Purchase\" could fit since they\u2019re requesting a monitor. The ticket mentions \"monitor request\" and indicates the need for an adapter to connect mobile devices, possibly for running automation tests on Android devices.\n\nWhile \u201cPurchase\u201d is an option, it primarily concerns hardware resources, making \"Hardware\" the best choice. So I\u2019ll stick with the categorization as \"Hardware.\" Returning final output now!"
