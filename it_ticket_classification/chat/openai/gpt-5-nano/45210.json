The content indicates it's mainly about HR processes, so \"HR Support\" seems to be the best fit. There are aspects of access and visibility too, but since \"HR Support\" directly relates to assistance with leave management, I think that\u2019s the most appropriate classification. I'll format the output in JSON correctly.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI see that the issue revolves around the visibility of annual leave days, access rights to the leave system, and it's marked as high priority. While \"Access\" seems relevant due to permissions, the \"HR Support\" category is more directly applicable since it focuses on HR processes. The mention of liaising with teams for updates points to an HR or payroll system issue, so I\u2019ll classify the ticket under \"HR Support.\" I'll ensure to format the output correctly in JSON."
