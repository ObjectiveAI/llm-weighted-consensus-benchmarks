While \"Administrative rights\" could be a secondary option if permission issues arise, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" as the best fit. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON-like object to match the required structure.**Formulating the JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on the output format for the category field. The instruction clearly requires a JSON object that matches the specified schema. The correct response should simply be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI need to make sure I don\u2019t include any extra wrappers or text; just the category itself is needed. I\u2019ll keep it concise and straightforward, ensuring there\u2019s no additional formatting. So, my final output will just be that simple JSON object."
