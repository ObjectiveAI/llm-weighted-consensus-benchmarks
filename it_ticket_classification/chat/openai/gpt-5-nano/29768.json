They mention creating a new project and storing scripts in Git, so \"Internal Project\" seems like a fitting category since it focuses on project creation. There\u2019s a possibility it could also be \"Storage,\" but it centers more on the project aspect. Ultimately, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best choice for this ticket, as that's the main focus of their request.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nOkay, the text seems to focus on creating a new project and a Git repository, alongside storing scripts. \"Internal Project\" fits best out of the options since it revolves around that aspect. \"Storage\" could work, but it's less specific about hardware. For output, I need to format the response as a JSON object with the category. So my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let's make sure it's correct before I send it!**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI've been considering if \"Administrative rights\" might be appropriate since the request involves creating a new project and Git repo, which could need those permissions. However, the ticket clearly states it\u2019s about creating an internal project, making the \"Internal Project\" category more fitting. I\u2019ll format this as a JSON object as instructed. So, the final output will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. No extra commentary is needed here!"
