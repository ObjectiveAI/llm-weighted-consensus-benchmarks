They mention a \"new starter\" and \"tower starter,\" which likely refers to hardware setup, possibly a PC tower. However, the main request is to change the candidate's credentials to permanent status, indicating it's about access rights. So, it seems like the focus is on onboarding and granting access. Given the options, I think \"Access\" is the best category for this ticket.**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nI realize that \"Administrative rights\" falls under the \"Access\" category. The user wants to change a candidate's credentials to permanent status, which could involve HR elements. However, since this is an IT ticket, \"HR Support\" would likely be for more straightforward HR issues. The emphasis here is on provisioning access credentials. Therefore, I think \"Access\" is the appropriate category. I need to respond with a JSON object indicating this, setting the category to \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
