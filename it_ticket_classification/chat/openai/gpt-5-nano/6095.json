Since it primarily discusses clones in the production environment, I should place it in a relevant category, likely focusing on the \"Access\" or \"Internal Project\" options. Let's make sure I'm clear and accurate with this classification.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis ticket is likely about software environment cloning and provisioning. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Storage,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since cloning production environments relates to data provisioning, \"Storage\" feels like a solid choice. However, I could also see \"Internal Project\" fitting, given the internal nature of the task. \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" might apply, but there's no clear access mention. Ultimately, I think \"Storage\" is the best fit for this IT ticket. I'll categorize it as such in the output.**Justifying the Category**\n\nThis IT ticket is focused on deploying, restoring, or cloning production environment copies, which typically relates to storage provisioning. It discusses scheduling clones and source/target environments, making \"Storage\" the most suitable category. I need to ensure I respond correctly with a JSON object that includes the property for the category as a string. Following instructions, I will output exactly: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. No additional commentary is necessary, so I\u2019m ready to deliver that format."
