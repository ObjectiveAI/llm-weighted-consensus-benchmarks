The text includes various elements related to a leaver, such as forms, dates, mailbox details, approvals, and information about equipment like mobile phone subscriptions and access rights. It\u2019s a bit chaotic, but I\u2019ll pull key details together to understand what categories might fit best, maybe focusing on aspects like leaver processing, approvals, and inventory management. It\u2019s a matter of organizing this mess into coherent categories!**Determining Category Type**\n\nI\u2019m tasked with categorizing this IT ticket based on the provided options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket focuses on a leaver's details, mentioning things like a leaver form, leave date, and mailbox access. It seems to relate to deprovisioning access rights, especially with all the references to \"AD rights\" and \"access.\" I\u2019m leaning toward \"Access,\" but \"Administrative rights\" might be suitable since it pertains to specific admin privileges. Ultimately, \"Access\" may be the best fit.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions terms like \"approver,\" \"inventory storage,\" and \"token,\" indicating it\u2019s centered around user offboarding. This involves tasks like disabling access, retrieving devices, and managing mailboxes. Although \"HR Support\" could apply, this ticket feels more IT-related, focusing on offboarding tasks like disabling AD and reclaiming various resources. I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as \"Access,\" or possibly \"Administrative rights\" if we focus on access control. Ultimately, I'll output this as a JSON object with the category clear. So, it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
