The message seems to mention issues regarding a \"guest\" who isn't working on the floor and an access problem. It looks like the user may be reporting a guest network or Wi-Fi issue. Since the user is asking for categorization, it seems clear this ticket should be categorized under \"Access.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm thinking the category for this IT ticket is likely \"Access\" since it involves accessing resources on the guest network or guest devices. While I considered \"Administrative rights,\" \"Hardware,\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" the content mainly points to a guest Wi-Fi or device issue. The phrase \"guest working not working on the floor for clients\" seems key here. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Access\" and note, \u201cGuest network access not working,\u201d though I just need to focus on categorizing for now. I'll output it in a JSON-like format.**Outputting category object**\n\nThe prompt requests me to categorize the IT ticket and respond with a JSON object. Following the required format, I need to include just the category field. Since the category is \"Access,\" I can construct the response as follows:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI realize the instructions indicate no additional text is needed. So, I\u2019ll stick to that \u2014 just the JSON object without any extra explanation. Let\u2019s keep it straightforward!"
