The problem involves an error message related to using a proper certificate, and they mention that using Chrome might indicate the server is down. Since this ticket is clearly about access issues, I think it fits best in the \"Access\" category. It seems straightforward, but it's important to ensure I\u2019m making the right choice!**Deciding the IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize this ticket as \"Access\" or \"Internal Project.\" The issue revolves around someone trying to access a project request form, and they\u2019re encountering error messages related to certificates and server downtime. Given these details, it definitely seems like an access issue. So, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" and respond with a JSON object like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll keep it concise, but I wonder if the user might appreciate notes. However, the instructions clearly say to output only the category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
