The user's message appears to be a jumbled request about updating contracts, covering topics like contract types, client details, and SOWs (scope of work). I\u2019m recognizing that this likely falls under contract management rather than anything related to IT hardware. I need to ensure we assign it correctly based on the context provided.**Determining ticket categories**\n\nI have category options like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and \"Purchase.\" However, none fit perfectly since \"Contracts\" isn't a listed category. The ticket discusses updating contracts, including details like SOWs and geography. It could fit under \"Purchase\" because contracts often pertain to procurement or \"Administrative rights\" if access to a system is necessary. Since categories are limited, I should consider asking the user clarifying questions to ensure accurate categorization. The response will likely need a JSON-like structure as specified.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI will categorize the ticket as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} because it concerns updating contracts and contract management, which aligns with internal projects. While \"Purchase\" could be a fit since contracts can involve procurement, it seems more focused on contract details related to project management. Phrases like \"thanks officer\" and references to SOWs emphasize internal processes rather than vendor issues. Therefore, \"Internal Project\" seems the safest choice, and it matches the expected JSON structure as required.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
