There's also a hint about administrative rights, so I might need to consider that too. However, this ticket doesn't really touch on hardware, storage, or purchases directly.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIt seems the user is asking about a new project code, so labeling this as \"Internal Project\" makes sense. There\u2019s also potential mention of \"Administrative rights\" if they're looking for permissions. The text refers to \"code automatically created due to change requirements,\" suggesting it's related to project management. To follow the instructions correctly, I need to respond with a JSON-like format containing just the category: \"Internal Project.\" This will match the specific format requested.**Responding with category object**\n\nI need to respond with the required JSON format for the user's IT ticket category. I'll simply provide: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Although I could offer a short note, the user only asked for the category, so I\u2019ll stick to just what they requested. Keeping it straightforward is best. Alright, let's go ahead and produce just that JSON response. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
