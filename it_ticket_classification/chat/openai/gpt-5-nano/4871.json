However, I also want to consider \"Access\" for permissions or logins. There\u2019s a possibility it pertains to \"Miscellaneous\" as well. Overall, I need to classify this message appropriately!**Classifying IT ticket details**\n\nI\u2019m examining text that seems to reference onboarding with terms like \u201cstarter form,\u201d \u201cjoining,\u201d and \u201clead\u201d in relation to \"Bogota\" and a specific date. It feels like it\u2019s about completing onboarding forms, which could fall under \"HR Support,\" but this is an IT ticket. I also need to consider \u201cAccess\u201d for system permissions since it\u2019s about new hires. The mention of \u201cadministrative rights\u201d might suggest that too. It\u2019s a tricky classification!**Interpreting the user's message**\n\nI\u2019m trying to make sense of a jumbled message that includes terms like \u201cnon-starter,\u201d \u201cBogota,\u201d and \u201cstarter form complete.\u201d It seems to suggest something about onboarding in Bogota, possibly indicating a new hire. This could either fit under \u201cHR Support\u201d or relate to \u201cAccess\u201d regarding system permissions for the new employee. I think \u201cAccess\u201d might be the best choice here since it\u2019s directly tied to joining processes. Still, it\u2019s tricky deciding on a single category!**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to choose \"Access\" as the right category for this IT ticket. According to the instructions, I need to respond with a JSON object in the required format, which will look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nSince the user specifically asked to categorize the IT ticket, it makes sense to keep the response straightforward and just provide this JSON object. I\u2019ll avoid adding any extra text to keep it neat and clear. Let's proceed with that!"
