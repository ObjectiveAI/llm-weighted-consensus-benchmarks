However, I'm unsure; I have to pick a category from the options available: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. I guess it could fit under Miscellaneous, but I'm still pondering.**Interpreting the IT request**\n\nI need to interpret the user's message about notifications. It seems to reference \"notifications from Planner,\" possibly asking to separate notifications by section\u2014though it\u2019s not clearly stated. The ticket doesn\u2019t fit categories like Hardware, Storage, Purchase, or Access. It might relate to changing notification settings in Planner, which is an internal tool. That could make it an \"Internal Project\" request since it\u2019s about configuring the tool, but I\u2019m still not entirely sure.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like the user's request is about \"Planner,\" so I'll categorize it as an \"Internal Project.\" That's because it's related to a configuration request for the Planner tool, which is used for internal project planning. Since I'm unsure about some details, it might also fit under \"Miscellaneous\" if needed. I need to output this as a JSON object with just the category field, like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\u2014keeping it clean and straightforward without extra information.**Producing the required output**\n\nI need to follow the instruction to reply with a JSON object. The focus is on structuring it properly since it may be parsed by code later. Based on the context, I\u2019ll go with {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} as the final answer, but I should keep in mind that it could have been \"Administrative rights\" if it involved changing notification settings\u2014though it doesn\u2019t appear to. So, I'll finalize my output as specified!"
