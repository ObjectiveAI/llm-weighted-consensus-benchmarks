The ticket mentions issues with Oracle, specifically regarding print preview and expense reports. It seems to be focused on software usage. Based on the content, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it under \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d as it seems to be a general IT issue. However, I should consider \u201cAccess\u201d if it touches on permissions. I\u2019ll finalize the category in the output JSON.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the IT ticket to determine the best category. It doesn't seem to fit under \"hardware,\" and while \"administrative rights\" might relate to permissions for printing expense reports, \"Internal Project\" isn't applicable. The closest options are \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access,\" with the ticket mentioning issues with \"print preview\" and generating reports. Since it seems more like a software issue with the Oracle Print Preview feature, \"Miscellaneous\" appears to be the best fit for categorization.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket again. \"Internal Project\" doesn\u2019t fit, and while \"Administrative rights\" might relate to access issues, the user mentioned that \"print preview\" isn't available. It sounds like they need guidance on printing expense reports. However, categories like \"HR Support\" and \"Purchase\" don't apply either. So, I'm concluding that \"Miscellaneous\" is the right choice. I'll format the output as a JSON object. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
