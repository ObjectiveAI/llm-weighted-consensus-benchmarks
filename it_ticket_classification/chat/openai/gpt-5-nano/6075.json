The categories available include \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and a few others. Since it mentions filling out starting questions, it seems to fit best under \"HR Support,\" as it focuses on onboarding processes. However, there\u2019s also a bit of IT involvement, especially if it includes access setup. So, \"HR Support\" sounds like the right fit!**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the IT ticket about a new starter asking to fill out onboarding questions for November. It looks like this fits best under \"HR Support\" since it's related to onboarding. Still, there\u2019s a chance it could involve \"Access\" because new hires may need IT access. However, the message doesn\u2019t explicitly mention that. Since the user wants me to categorize this IT ticket, I\u2019ll respond by saying it\u2019s \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll format it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
