The user mentioned that it was not available, which might point to an access issue. I\u2019m weighing options like \u201cAccess\u201d or maybe \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d but \u201cSoftware availability\u201d isn\u2019t explicitly listed in the categories. I\u2019ll likely go with \u201cAccess\u201d since it seems closest to the issue about availability. Finally, I\u2019ll structure my output in the required JSON format.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nIt looks like there isn't a specific \"Software\" category, but \"Access\" seems to fit well since it's about issues with accessing Confluence. The confusing phrase about being \"not available for minutes\" suggests some downtime. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Storage\" don't seem relevant here. While \"Miscellaneous\" might work as a catch-all, \"Access\" better describes the situation. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\": \"Access\"} and possibly include a brief explanation in the response.**Finalizing IT ticket response**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket and respond with a JSON object. The expected format is to present just the category in this way: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. Given the user's message about Confluence being unavailable, it points to an access issue. Although a user might prefer more context, the system requires JSON, so I\u2019ll stick to that format. I\u2019ll output: {\"category\": \"Access\"} as my final answer."
