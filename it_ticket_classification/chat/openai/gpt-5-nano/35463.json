It looks like this is likely HR-related, specifically falling into the \"HR Support\" category since it involves time card submission. The user's content points to an issue with submitting timesheets and mentions an error, although the last part about a reminder isn\u2019t quite clear. It's essential to organize the ticket correctly based on this context!**Categorizing IT help desk issue**\n\nIt looks like I'm dealing with an IT help desk issue related to time tracking software not allowing submissions. The typical categories here would be \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Access.\" Since there seems to be an error preventing submission, it could relate to the time tracking system specifically, which supports \"HR Support.\" The last part about \"engineer managed phone\" doesn\u2019t seem relevant, but I need to present this categorization in a JSON format, so it\u2019s clear and structured!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
