This looks like an HR-related ticket. \n\nI need to classify it into one of the available categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. Based on the content, it seems to fit best under \"HR Support.\" \n\nI\u2019ll prepare to output a JSON object with this category set.**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt looks like the user\u2019s ticket is about reviewing an email signature, possibly related to a welcome message. While \"HR Support\" might seem applicable, the overall context suggests it\u2019s more of an IT matter. \n\nI\u2019m considering classifications like \"Administrative rights,\" which doesn\u2019t quite fit, and \"Internal Project,\" which might work if it\u2019s part of updating templates. However, since the task seems vaguely defined, \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit for categorizing ambiguous requests like this.**Finalizing ticket classification**\n\nIt seems like none of the categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Hardware\" apply to this ticket about reviewing a welcome message signature. \"Access\" is a bit of a stretch too. Since the content suggests uncertainty, I think \"Miscellaneous\" fits best because it covers ambiguous requests. \n\nEven though editing signatures may require admin rights, the ticket itself doesn\u2019t clearly demand that, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous.\" The response will be in JSON format as required.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
