I don't see fits for options like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Storage.\" It doesn't seem like a \"Purchase\" either. So, my best guess is that this ticket belongs in the \"Hardware\" category, since it deals with cables.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering typical IT ticket categories like hardware, software, and access. Given the description, \u201cHardware\u201d fits best since it\u2019s about a physical cable in meeting rooms. I briefly ponder if \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d could work, but it seems too vague. They only mention a test consultant and need help with a cable. Access rights don\u2019t apply here since it\u2019s more about hardware. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \u201cHardware\u201d and respond strictly with the required JSON format."
