The content mentions issues with the \"referrals flow system,\" implying it's likely an internal system issue about workflows. The available categories are: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since it pertains to the referrals flow, it seems to relate best to \"Internal Project,\" unless it's more general, in which case I could go with \"Miscellaneous.\"**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI think the best category for this IT ticket is \"Internal Project\" since it relates to a system flow within the organization. However, \"Access\" is another option since the user mentions \"referrals flow connection\" and \"we cannot referrals,\" which suggests potential access issues. Still, the text doesn't mention anything about login or permissions. It seems more like a technical bug in the referral system, fitting \"Internal Project\" better than the other categories.**Creating JSON response**\n\nI\u2019ll put together a concise response by providing a single JSON object with the category set to \"Internal Project.\" The format should match the schema provided, which looks like this: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}. So my response will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I can add a brief justification, but the main focus is to ensure the category is clear and formatted correctly.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
