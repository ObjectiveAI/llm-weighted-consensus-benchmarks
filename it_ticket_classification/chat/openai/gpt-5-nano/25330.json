The content is somewhat unclear, but it appears to involve questions about migration guidelines and moving important map files. This sounds like it could relate to categories like Storage, Internal Project, or possibly Access or Administrative rights. Given the mention of data migration, I think it best fits into Storage or Internal Project for proper classification. It needs careful consideration!**Classifying IT ticket category**\n\nI need to classify the IT ticket based on the user\u2019s comments. The mention of \"migrate guidelines\" and \"moving related map files\" suggests this involves a migration task that fits under Storage, especially since it relates to data management. Alternatively, if this is project-focused, it could be under Internal Project. However, the goal of maintaining \"map continuity\" strongly points to Storage. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object indicating the category as \"Storage.\"**Preparing category output**\n\nI need to prepare the category object for the IT ticket. The schema specifies that it should only contain the category as a string in the correct format. So, I\u2019m crafting it as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I must double-check that the quotes are correct, which is important for valid JSON formatting. There\u2019s no need for extra text here; I just want to deliver the category clearly and accurately!"
