The categories I have are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. So, I'll be looking to interpret the user message that asks me to categorize the ticket, which might involve analyzing the long text provided. It's crucial to ensure I pick the right category for the user's needs.**Analyzing email security discussion**\n\nI see that the content revolves around email security topics, including adding domains to allowed senders, managing alerts, and dealing with quarantined messages. It mentions issues with viruses and the importance of ensuring email accounts are safe, with suggested actions like creating buttons to enable secure mailboxes. Additionally, there\u2019s a note about changing mailbox accounts every few months to maintain security. I\u2019ll summarize these key points effectively to capture the main themes.**Categorizing mail security issue**\n\nI'm trying to figure out how to categorize this IT support ticket related to mail security, specifically concerning quarantined mailboxes and allowed senders. The categories I have are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. After considering, \"Access\" seems to be the best fit since it involves mailbox access and alerts. Although \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" don\u2019t quite match the content. I\u2019ll proceed with \"Access\" for this ticket.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
