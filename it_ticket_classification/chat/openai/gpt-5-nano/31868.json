The ticket mentions induction and assistance with a form, suggesting it falls under access permissions. I see three possible categories: \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"HR Support.\" However, since the focus is on enabling the access card and not admin rights, \"Access\" seems to be the best fit for this ticket.**Categorizing access provisioning**\n\nIt seems this ticket is about provisioning access for a new starter, particularly regarding an access card and an induction form. I think \"Access\" is the proper category since it's more focused on granting access rather than just the physical card itself. While \"Hardware\" could apply to the card, it's really about access provisioning. The user asked for a category format, which I can respond with as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll ensure to present it accurately!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
