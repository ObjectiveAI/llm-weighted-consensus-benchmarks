The message concerns a new starter in Bogota who needs help with a starter form and credentials for onboarding. This seems to be about access and permissions. I think categorizing it under \"Access\" makes the most sense, as it relates to handling the necessary credentials for the new starter.**Categorizing IT ticket with JSON**\n\nI'm considering the categories for this IT ticket. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply, the text mainly discusses \"credentials permissions\" and onboarding a new starter. It seems to lean more towards \"Access\" because it's about the necessary credentials. So, I'll respond with the category as follows: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That way, I\u2019m sticking to the required format and providing exactly what's needed! Keeping it succinct is essential here."
