It mentions access to a \"library,\" likely a shared repository, and requests links as well as management settings related to this library. The user also refers to several collaboration tools that help teams coordinate and share information, discuss ideas, and manage calendars. It looks like they need help with managing resources effectively.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user is discussing access to a central storage or collaboration site, possibly something like SharePoint. The keywords involve tools for communication, decision-making, and team collaboration, implying they need permissions related to a library setup. The available categories for this IT ticket include \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the focus on access permissions and managing folders, I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category. So, I'll propose categorizing this ticket as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
