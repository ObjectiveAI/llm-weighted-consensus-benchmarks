But \"Purchase\" feels most accurate!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m weighing my options for categorizing this ticket, and \"Internal Project\" is definitely available. The user\u2019s message indicates it\u2019s about assisting with a \"habits presentation,\" focusing on hardware procurement. They mention budgets, costs, sensors, distributors, and shipping\u2014strongly suggesting it\u2019s for buying hardware for an internal project. Given the context, it feels clear this is a procurement task connected to the \"habits presentation,\" so I should select \"Internal Project\" as the category.**Selecting the category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding whether the best category for this ticket is \"Purchase\" or \"Internal Project.\" The instruction clearly states to categorize the IT ticket, and since it\u2019s about hardware procurement, \"Purchase\" explicitly fits that context for indicating procurement needs. As the user has asked me to categorize the ticket, I think \"Purchase\" is the most suitable option. \n\nI\u2019ll prepare the final response in the required JSON format: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"} \n\nIt\u2019s important to ensure the capitalization is correct!"
