I'll format the output as a JSON-like structure: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}.The required format from the prompt specifies that I need to create a JSON object. It should have a \"category\" field, which must be one of the provided options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since the appropriate category is \"Purchase,\" I\u2019ll output the JSON object exactly as required: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.
