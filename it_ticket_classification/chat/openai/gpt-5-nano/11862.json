The ticket mentions a \"new starter form\" and seems tied to HR or Access tasks. There's potential for it to fall under \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" since onboarding involves user accounts and access provisioning. The content is a bit ambiguous, so I\u2019ll need to choose the most fitting category from the provided list.**Choosing the right IT ticket category**\n\nThe phrase mentions \"new starter\" and \"form,\" suggesting they might need to fill out a form related to onboarding. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Access\" for provisioning, or possibly \"Administrative rights,\" but that's more about granting admin access. It seems best to categorize this as either \"Access\" or \"HR Support,\u201d as the \"new starter\" phrase aligns with onboarding activities. Since it's an IT ticket, it\u2019s likely about requesting system access or submitting the new employee form.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI\u2019m going to choose \"Access\" as the best category since it's a typical IT action for onboarding a new starter. \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if they need admin access, but that's not mentioned. The next step is to respond with a JSON-like object as per the provided schema. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and deliver just: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra text, just the required response to categorize the ticket accurately."
