The text is quite messy; it includes phrases like \"new purchase,\" \"po,\" and mentions a \"professional backpack.\" It seems like the user is requesting to purchase this backpack and asking for log allocation and receipts. Classifying this, I think the best fit would be the \"Purchase\" category from the provided schema. I'll prepare a JSON with that category detailed.**Classifying purchase request**\n\nThis message is clearly about buying a new item, so the category is likely \"Purchase.\" There's also mention of hardware, allocation, receipts, and ordering, which aligns with procurement processes. Typically, IT helpdesk categorizes this under \"Purchase\" or \"Procurement,\" and since \"Purchase\" is explicitly listed, that's my go-to choice. I just need to ensure I respond with the correct JSON format and only include the category object without any extra text. Here goes!"
