The ticket discusses issues with submitting working hours from the last week, mentioning tools and errors, which suggests it's about HR or a timesheet tool. I see terms like \"worked hours\" and \"submit working hours,\" so it seems to fall under HR-related issues. Given the context, I think \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category for this ticket.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket. While \"Administrative rights\" might seem relevant, it doesn't directly address the error the user encountered with the holiday app. The context suggests it's related to HR and timesheet submissions, making \"HR Support\" the most appropriate choice. Since the user expects a JSON-like response, I\u2019ll format my output accordingly with just the necessary category. I'll ensure that the JSON string uses double quotes correctly for validity. Here's my response:  \n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
