However, it could also concern an internal project or miscellaneous topics. I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate category for this ticket. Let's finalize that!**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering that \"Friday PM\" might refer to a specific tool, and the phrase around the interface is a bit unclear. The user mentions wanting different templates and materials, along with accept/decline, which hints at invitations. Given the options for categorization\u2014like Hardware, HR Support, Access, etc.\u2014the \"Access\" category seems to fit best. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply for escalated access, the user hasn\u2019t explicitly requested that. I\u2019ll classify it as \"Access\" and present it as {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Clarifying IT ticket response**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket. I should format my response as a JSON object with the \"category\" property. Based on the user's request, I'll simply respond with {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nWhile I could ask clarifying questions, the task focuses on providing just the category, which must match one of the specified types. So, I\u2019ll stick to delivering that concise response without any extra commentary. Here we go!"
