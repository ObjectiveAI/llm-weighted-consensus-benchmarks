The user's message mentions \"approval for annual leave\" and references the Oracle system, which seems connected to HR. \n\nGiven the content, it looks like it\u2019s asking for HR-related support, so it could fit under \"HR Support.\" However, it also touches on planning and resource cover, which might make \"Administrative rights\" a contender too. I'll go with \"HR Support\" as the most fitting category.**Deciding on category**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out the best category for an IT ticket about annual leave. While \"Access\" usually deals with granting system rights, this is more about an HR process, likely tied to the Oracle HR module. \"Administrative rights\" could be an option, but \"HR Support\" is actually in the list of categories. Since the ticket is related to annual leave approvals, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit. I\u2019ll go with that and prepare a JSON object to reflect it.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
