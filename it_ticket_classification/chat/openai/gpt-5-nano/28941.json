The user mentions several keywords like \"new starter,\" \"admin account,\" and \"compliance officer,\" which indicate this is connected to user access, specifically an \"Active Directory\" account. Given these references, it seems this ticket should fall under the \"Access\" category since it involves creating an account for a new employee. It's clear that access management is the primary focus here.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nLooking at the ticket, it seems clear that \"Access\" is the appropriate category. The string includes terms like \"new starter,\" \"AD admin account,\" and mentions requests for help completing an onboarding form, suggesting it's focused on account creation for a new employee. Although the language is a bit jumbled, the main point is about access and account management for this new starter.
