The ticket discusses access to the \"PO tracker folder\" and related issues, indicating that it primarily revolves around access control. So, I\u2019m leaning toward \"Access\" as the best fit, though \"Administrative rights\" or \"Storage\" could also make sense given the details about folder creation and link location.**Categorizing access requests**\n\nIt looks like this ticket is about access control changes, particularly restricting access to the PO tracker folder, and also involves discussing folder creation and subfolder structures. \"Access\" seems to be the best category since the main concern is user access to that folder. While \"Administrative rights\" might fit if we focus on granting permissions for folder creation, this is more about shared access generally, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" For clarity, I can note the folder creation tasks as well. The expected output format is a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
