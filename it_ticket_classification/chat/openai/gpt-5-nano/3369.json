Since \"Confluence rights\" typically means user access rather than admin privileges, I think this ticket fits better under \"Access.\" I'll go ahead and categorize it accordingly!**Categorizing access rights**\n\nWithout more context, I think it's easiest to categorize this as \"Access\" since it deals with access rights. The system requires a JSON object for the output, so I'll format it to include the category field. The valid response should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's interesting to consider if \"Confluence rights\" could also suggest \"Administrative rights,\" but based on the phrasing of \"provide rights location,\" I feel confident sticking with \"Access.\" So let's finalize that JSON output!**Determining the right category**\n\nI'm considering that if rights need to be granted, it might fall under \"Administrative rights.\" However, categorizing it as \"Access\" seems safer and more general. I think that keeps it clearer for any potential misunderstandings. So, I\u2019ll go with the straightforward approach and output {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's concise and communicates what I need effectively. Let's finalize that choice!"
