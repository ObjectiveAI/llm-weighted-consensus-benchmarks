I want to provide the best possible categorization!**Deciding category for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m narrowing down the appropriate category for this IT ticket. The phrase \"implemented notes\" suggests it leans towards \"Internal Project,\" since it relates to notes made by a senior engineer for a client. Although \"Administrative rights\" concerns permissions and \"Access\" is its own thing, it doesn\u2019t seem to fit here. \"Miscellaneous\" could work if nothing else does, but \"Internal Project\" feels like the safest choice for this context.**Formatting response as JSON**\n\nI think the user might want the response in a specific JSON-like format for the category. The requirements indicate that I should output a JSON object with the structure: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. The type is defined as an object with a category string, so I need to follow that precisely. I\u2019ll make sure to include only the JSON output without any extra text. I\u2019ve double-checked the spelling is correct, so the final response will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
