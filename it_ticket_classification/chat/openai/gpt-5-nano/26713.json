The message is quite jumbled but hints at a possible issue with hardware allocation. I\u2019ll provide an appropriate category based on this analysis in a well-structured JSON format.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket, focusing on phrases like \"non starter hardware allocation\" and \u201cstarter form\u201d. The message hints at issues related to hardware provisioning, which suggests the \"Hardware\" category. However, since it also mentions an \"administration officer\" and a \"starter form,\" it might relate to onboarding tasks, pointing towards \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" Overall, I think the most fitting category would likely be \"Hardware,\" but \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" are also possibilities.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants to categorize an IT ticket, and it clearly mentions \"hardware allocation.\" Based on that, I'll select the \"Hardware\" category. There\u2019s also a mention of a \"starter form,\" which could relate to onboarding, but the main focus is on hardware. I\u2019ll create a JSON object that accurately reflects this category as a string. The correct response will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} and I need to ensure there\u2019s no extra text, just that JSON object."
