The mention of \"unable to find gal\" likely refers to email issues, specifically the Global Address List (GAL). The user's references suggest they are struggling with features related to Outlook or Exchange, possibly concerning identifying contacts in Active Directory. Given the context, I think this ticket should fall under \"Access,\" as it relates to access to email contacts.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe user is asking for help to verify if a contact was added correctly in the Global Address List (GAL). This suggests an issue related to accessing email features rather than hardware, storage, or purchases. I\u2019m considering whether this fits into the \u201cAccess\u201d category for verifying access to the address book or \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d if it requires permission to modify the GAL. Since it\u2019s about accessing and confirming a user\u2019s details, I believe \"Access\" is the most fitting category.**Creating JSON output for categorization**\n\nI\u2019m going to categorize the IT ticket as \"Access.\" The required output format is a JSON object, so I\u2019ll need to include the category field correctly. The system instruction specifies the expected format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s straightforward, but I want to ensure it\u2019s properly formatted because the platform likely wants just that field. I\u2019ll deliver the response now in the appropriate JSON format, sticking to the instructions given. Here it goes: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
