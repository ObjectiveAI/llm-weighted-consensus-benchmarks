The content of the ticket is a bit chaotic, but it clearly revolves around access issues\u2014specifically related to systems and physical workspaces. Given the context about not being able to access Orion, IDs, and workspace, it seems like \"Access\" is the most fitting category, or possibly even \"Administrative rights.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI believe the main category for this ticket should be \"Access,\" as it relates to both the Orion system and physical access to space. While \"Administrative rights\" might be relevant, it feels more general to simply go with \"Access\" since it isn't solely about specific privileges. \n\nI need to format it as a JSON object for submission. The schema specifies a structure, so I'll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and ensure it\u2019s in lowercase to match the required format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
