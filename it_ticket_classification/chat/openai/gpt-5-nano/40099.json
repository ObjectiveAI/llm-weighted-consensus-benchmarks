There are predefined categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. I\u2019ll need to analyze the content to determine which category best fits the user's situation. It seems that the main focus is on connection and access issues, which likely aligns with the \"Access\" category. Let's clarify and categorize it accurately!**Categorizing access issues**\n\nIt looks like the ticket revolves around access problems pertaining to dashboards and Confluence, including details about passwords and certificate errors. Given the context, the \"Access\" category seems fitting since it highlights access and permission issues. While there are mentions of certificate errors and other related concerns, the existing categories don't specifically include \"Security\" or \"Certificate.\" So, I think \"Access\" is indeed the best choice. Now, let's format this in JSON for clarity!**Formatting the category response**\n\nI need to output the category as a JSON object, specifically like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The instructions emphasize keeping it minimal, so I shouldn\u2019t add any extra explanations or detail. \n\nThe ticket includes phrases about server certificates and verification errors, but there's no \"Security\" category provided, so I think \"Access\" is the most accurate choice. Now, I\u2019ll finalize the response in the correct format without extra content since that's what was requested. Let's do this!"
