If it\u2019s about pricing and platform, I might label it \"Purchase.\" If it discusses a feature deployment, it could be \"Internal Project,\" or if it's vague, perhaps it falls under \"Miscellaneous.\" The mention of \"per second billing\" and \"unbeatable price\" suggests it\u2019s more of a sales inquiry than a technical ticket. Given the focus on pricing and voice proxy services, \"Purchase\" seems the most fitting choice.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe text mentions \u201clearn more about how platform help add back,\u201d which is a bit ambiguous. The user is looking to categorize this ticket for triage. The best option seems to be \"Purchase\" for the procurement of a platform/service, or \"Internal Project\" if it's about implementing voice proxy. The instructions are clear: I need to respond with a JSON object that fits the provided schema. I\u2019ll confirm it should include the category, so I\u2019ll go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}**Formatting response correctly**\n\nI need to make sure I define the object properly with the \"category\" property as a string and the correct enumerated values. So my response should simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nI\u2019ll ensure there's no extra text included. Keeping it clean and straightforward is important here. Let\u2019s go ahead and respond just with that JSON."
