The user's request seems related to onboarding, specifically filling out the starter form. It looks like this is primarily an HR issue, so \"HR Support\" feels like the most appropriate category. However, if it\u2019s more about access or account permissions, it might also fit under \"Administrative rights.\" Overall, \"HR Support\" seems to be the best choice here.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe message is a request for help with filling out a starter form, which indicates it's related to the onboarding process. I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"HR Support\" since it's about entering details for a new starter. Although I considered \"Access,\" the user didn't mention anything about access or accounts; they only referenced the form submission. So, \"HR Support\" seems to fit best. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON-like structure: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to make sure my response is in the correct JSON format as specified in the system instructions. It clearly states that I should respond with a category field. I'll output it simply as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This response keeps it minimal and on point, fully aligned with the expected format. I'll go ahead and finalize this response now!"
