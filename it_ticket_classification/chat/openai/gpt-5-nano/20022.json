I\u2019m pondering the best fit \u2014 none of the categories like Access or Hardware fit. Maybe it leans toward Miscellaneous, as that might capture the variety of requests here.**Classifying IT ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m trying to classify this ticket and considering \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The content suggests it\u2019s about retiring a service and possibly involves deleting and updating a catalog, which leans toward an administrative task. \"Administrative rights\" seems relevant if it relates to performing admin actions, but there aren't any explicit permissions mentioned. \"Internal Project\" wouldn\u2019t quite fit since it\u2019s not about a specific project. I think \"Administrative rights\" is likely the best choice here."
