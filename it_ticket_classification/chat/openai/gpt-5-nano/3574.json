This indicates it\u2019s related to HR onboarding. \n\nI figure the best fit category from the given list seems to be \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. This reflects the nature of the request accurately!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering the category for this ticket and see \"HR Support\" as a potential fit. The mention of \"starter form induction\" suggests it relates to onboarding, while the request for assistance with a \"return form\" indicates HR involvement. I wonder if \"Access\" could work too since new starters often require access rights, but the text doesn\u2019t clearly mention that. So, the best choice seems to be \"HR Support,\" focusing on the onboarding aspect.**Selecting Category for IT Ticket**\n\nI believe the IT ticket is asking for help with onboarding forms and induction, so it likely belongs to \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it focuses on new starter forms and doesn't explicitly request admin rights, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support.\" The user is looking for assistance with completing a form, not necessarily access rights. \n\nI'll make sure to output the JSON object correctly: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"} to align with the system requirements!**Finalizing JSON Output**\n\nI realize that the category object schema should simply wrap the answer, so I'll provide the output as: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}.\n\nThere\u2019s a slight ambiguity since \"Access\" could also apply due to the new starter needing access provisioning. However, the mentions of \"Induction\" and \"form\" clearly connect it to HR responsibilities. Since \"HR Support\" is explicitly listed, I\u2019ll go with that. I want to keep the response clean without any extra text, just the JSON!"
