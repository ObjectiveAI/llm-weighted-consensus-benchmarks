The ticket seems to mention \"starter forms\" added earlier today, which could imply a maintenance note. Using \"Miscellaneous\" for unclear requests might help, but I should lean toward categories like \"Internal Project\" since it seems related to project management.**Categorizing internal project forms**\n\nThe text \"pm starter forms\" likely refers to \"project management starter forms,\" which fits under the \"Internal Project\" category since it concerns internal forms. Parsing the message suggests they\u2019re asking to categorize the ticket, indicating it's about \"starter forms\" added today. While \"Access\" might fit if permissions were involved, there's no mention of access issues. \"Administrative rights\" isn't relevant here. So, I'll go with \"Internal Project\" as the most suitable category.**Choosing the right category**\n\nAnother approach could be to choose \"Miscellaneous\" if the content is unclear, but it seems the instruction calls for a specific category. Given that \"pm starter forms\" likely means \"project management starter forms,\" I should categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" \n\nI\u2019ll ensure the output format matches exactly, with just the \"category\" field included. So, my final output will be: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. No extra text, just a straightforward delivery!"
