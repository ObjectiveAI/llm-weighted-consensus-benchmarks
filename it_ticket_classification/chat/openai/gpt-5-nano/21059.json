The ticket contains a lot of repeated phrases and seems disorganized. My goal is to fit it into one of the specified categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. Given its vague nature, I might lean toward \"Miscellaneous,\" but I want to ensure I\u2019m making the right choice based on the content. Let's sort through it clearly!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm reviewing the ticket content, which mentions \u201cOracle and PAS project setup,\u201d along with phrases about assignments and forms, indicating a project-related context. This suggests it could fit into categories like \u201cInternal Project,\u201d \u201cAccess,\u201d \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d or \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d I need to decide which category best matches. Since the ticket relates specifically to setting up a project, it seems logical to classify it as an \u201cInternal Project.\u201d I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object accordingly.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
