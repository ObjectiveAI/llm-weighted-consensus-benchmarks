It seems like it mostly aligns with HR Support due to the focus on personnel records and absence management. However, there might also be a connection to Administrative rights or Access. I need to evaluate that further.**Determining HR category**\n\nThis IT ticket appears to be about timesheet processes, reporting, and updating records due to maternity leave and other absences. It seems focused on HR-related support, such as managing time reporting and leave. There's no direct mention of hardware, software access, or administrative rights.
