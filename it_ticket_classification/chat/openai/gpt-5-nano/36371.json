It's about an Oracle authentication issue, specifically access problems from outside the network mentioning a potential password reset. This clearly fits the \"Access\" category.\n\nThe user's request is straightforward: categorize this ticket. I need to respond with a properly formatted JSON object, which should look like `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. No extra comments or details are needed; just the JSON output.**Preparing the JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m ready to respond. I need to double-check that \"Access\" is indeed one of the category choices, which it is. \n\nNow, I\u2019ll prepare the final output: a JSON object that states the category as \"Access.\" There's no need to add any extra comments or details\u2014just the clean and straightforward response. Let's deliver that JSON!"
