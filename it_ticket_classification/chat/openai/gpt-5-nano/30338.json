While it might fit \"Access\" if it pertained to access rights, the primary context suggests it's related to hardware assets. So, I think the most fitting category would be \"Hardware.\"**Formatting the response**\n\nI'm considering whether to categorize the IT ticket under \"Administrative rights,\" but it doesn't seem to fit here. They explicitly asked for a categorization. The user might expect just a single category label, so I should respond simply. The system's schema defines how to format this response as a JSON object. I'll output it as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I need to avoid any extra commentary to keep it concise, focusing solely on the user's request."
