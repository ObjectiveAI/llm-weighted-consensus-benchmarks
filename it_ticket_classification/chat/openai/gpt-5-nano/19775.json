The mention of \"senior developer\" adds some context, but it's not crystal clear. This could relate to \"Access\" if it's about user credentials, or \"Internal Project\" if it's about an ongoing task. It also touches on \"Administrative rights\" due to the assignment request. The message is quite muddled!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm trying to figure out the best category for this IT ticket. The options are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Since the ticket mentions updating a status and assigning someone, it leans toward \"Internal Project.\" However, it could also involve \"Administrative Rights\" if assigning means granting access. Given it relates to an ongoing issue from March, I'll go with \"Internal Project\" for the category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
