They mention \"new project code oracle fusion,\" which suggests it's related to Oracle Fusion, a cloud ERP. There's also a reference to creating something according to an attached form and implementing automation. Given this context, it likely belongs in the \"Internal Project\" category. It doesn't fit other categories like hardware or HR support, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and format the response in JSON as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like I need to categorize this IT ticket without adding any extra commentary. The instructions are clear: I should provide the output in category format. I'll focus on just delivering the JSON object that represents the category. There's no need for additional explanations here, so I'll go ahead and format it simply as needed. Let's produce the response in the required JSON format without any fluff."
