From the categories we have, it seems like it might relate to Access or Administrative rights since it's about permissions rather than hardware or HR. I'll go ahead and categorize it accordingly!**Deciding Ticket Category**\n\nI see there's an \"Administrative rights\" category, which fits user access privileges well. With the user's issue about an error in submitting their expense report, it could be \"Miscellaneous,\" but there's also a \"Purchase\" category that could relate since the expense report might tie into purchasing. However, since the categories don\u2019t specifically include \"Finance\" or \"Expense,\" I'll lean towards \"Administrative rights.\" It relates to access rights and workflow restrictions based on their description.**Crafting JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object for the category based on the user's ticket. They mentioned an error related to submitting an expense report, which could fit in \"Administrative rights\" due to workflow permissions. However, I\u2019m also considering \"Access,\" since it deals with access control for the expense workflow. The phrase about \"pending rights\" hints at needing approvals, not just login issues. Let\u2019s go with \"Administrative rights\" and format it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
