The message mentions \"link to maps leaver form,\" and it seems they're requesting something related to a departure form. I\u2019m interpreting \"leaver form\" as possibly connected to employees leaving a project or organization. Given the context, I think the most fitting category could be \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" since it pertains to internal processes. Let's confirm this.**Interpreting IT ticket request**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out the user's message: \"link to maps leaver form tuesday july.\" It looks like they're requesting a link, most likely related to a \"leaver form,\" which seems HR-related for employees leaving the company. Since this is an IT ticket, there could be a request to place the form on maps, possibly involving Google Maps or an internal tool. The mention of \"ext\" at the end might be short for \"extension.\" I need to categorize this appropriately!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories available: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. The mention of \"leaver form\" suggests this is related to HR processes for employees leaving, so \"HR Support\" feels like the right fit. However, since the user also references a link and \"maps,\" it could hint at \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" too. Still, the strong implication of HR makes me lean towards \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll categorize it accordingly and format my response in JSON. Let's go with:\n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}}.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI need to provide the category in a specific JSON format as per the instructions. The only allowed output is the JSON object itself, so I\u2019ll keep it straightforward. Since \"HR Support\" is the correct category, I will output it exactly as:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nNo extra text or anything unnecessary, just the required JSON object. Got it!"
