It looks like they need help with a \"new starter\" and related forms for an induction process. The options are HR Support, Access, and a few others. Given keywords like \"induction\" and \"attached return form,\" it seems like this could fall under HR Support. I'm leaning towards that, as it aligns with onboarding and new employee assistance!**Clarifying Ticket Categories**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories to determine the best fit for this IT ticket. There's \"HR Support,\" which is relevant since it pertains to onboarding a new starter. Other options include \"Access\" for system permissions and \"Administrative rights\" for admin requests. The content suggests they need help completing a starter form for induction, indicating it might be an internal process. So, I believe the best categories to consider would be either \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\"**Clarifying Ticket Categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket. The focus is on a \"starter form induction,\" which hints at HR onboarding. While \"HR Support\" seems fitting, the context is more IT-related, making me wonder if I should ask for clarification. The term \"new starter pas\" could refer to a \"building pass\" for security access. If it's about issuing an access pass, then \"Access\" might actually be the best choice here. I need to be sure!**Categorizing Ticket as Access**\n\nThe user is looking to complete a \"starter form\" for issuing an access pass, indicating that this ticket falls into the Access category. Since it involves a new starter and the need for a badge, \"Access\" is indeed the most suitable choice. Now I\u2019ll craft the response in the required JSON-like format. The instruction clearly indicates that I should output this as a JSON object, so I'll keep it minimal and provide the response as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
