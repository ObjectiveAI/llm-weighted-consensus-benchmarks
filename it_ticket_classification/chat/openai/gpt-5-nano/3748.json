Overall, I'll focus on categorizing the ticket based on access roles for the compensation reviewer.**Formatting access request**\n\nThe user wants to add a Colombia profile, likely involving adding a user to the compensation reviewer group, which means categorizing it as \"Access.\" The proper response format is a JSON object with the category value. So, I\u2019ll prepare it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I just need to keep it simple and direct with no extra information, ensuring that the field name is exact. I'll confirm I'm using valid JSON to meet the requirements."
