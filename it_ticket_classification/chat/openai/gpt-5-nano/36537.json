They mention wanting to \"raise below tickets\" and refer to cables and something related to \"mobile.\" The term \"provide cable\" hints at hardware issues. The phrase \"walk locked\" could be a miscommunication\u2014maybe they meant \"work locked\"? Since the context suggests hardware with the double mention of \"provide cable,\" I'll lean toward classifying it under Hardware. Let's clarify this!**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nGiven the confusion, I think the best category for this request is Hardware since it mentions cables and a mobile device. It could also fit under Access if there's a password issue, but \u201clocked\u201d might mean a locked account. There\u2019s no need for categories like HR Support or Internal Project. Since it\u2019s about the tasks, I prefer to categorize this as Hardware. I\u2019ll format the final output as a JSON object with the chosen category. Let\u2019s do this!**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m ready to respond with the category \"Hardware\" since it fits well with the mention of mobile devices and cables. I need to ensure I use proper JSON formatting as required by the schema. The output should be a JSON object with the \"category\" field. So, I\u2019ll structure it as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Since the prompt specifies that I need to categorize the IT ticket accordingly, this should be the right response. Let\u2019s go ahead and finalize that!"
