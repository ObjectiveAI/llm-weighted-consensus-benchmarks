It looks like they\u2019re mentioning \"extension cord\" several times along with \"order,\" \"connect,\" and \"coordinator.\" This seems related to hardware procurement. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this ticket as \"Purchase\" since it's about ordering extension cords. While it involves hardware, the mention of \"order\" indicates it's more about making a purchase than just a hardware request, so \"Purchase\" feels like the right fit.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing whether to categorize an IT ticket related to extension cords. The term \"connect\" suggests a setup, but with the limited content, the best categories are \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" The user mentions needing to \"order\" extension cords, which leans more towards \"Purchase.\" Even though \"extension cord\" is hardware, the focus on procurement leads me to choose \"Purchase\" as the more relevant category. I plan to format this as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Formatting the category response**\n\nThe user has instructed me to categorize an IT ticket. I will respond with the appropriate category based on the previous analysis, which is \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll make sure to format this correctly as a JSON object, ensuring the string is one of the enumerated categories. So, I\u2019ll present it as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. This way, I'm aligning with the user's request while also keeping the response neat and organized. Let's provide that!"
