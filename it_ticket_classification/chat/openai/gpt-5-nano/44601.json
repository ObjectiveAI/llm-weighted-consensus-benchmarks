Considering the issues described seem software-related rather than hardware problems, I should classify it under \u201cAccess\u201d or possibly \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d It\u2019s important to select the most appropriate category to ensure the user gets the right support for their pressing issues!**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm trying to categorize this IT ticket about errors regarding block processing, document uploads, and contract submissions. It could fit under \"Access\" if it's about usage rights, or \"Miscellaneous\" since the issues aren't very specific. \"Internal Project\" might also apply if the errors relate to a project workflow. Overall, the focus seems to be on software issues rather than hardware ones, so I\u2019ll prioritize selecting a category that best addresses their concerns effectively.**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to classify this IT ticket, and while the typical category might be \"Software/Applications,\" it isn't listed. \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the closest fit. There's also \"Access\" for permissions, but that's not explicitly mentioned here. Considering the content of the ticket about processing records and contract submission errors, it might be more fitting to categorize it as \"Internal Project\" since it relates to internal workflows. I\u2019ll output a JSON response to reflect my classification decision.**Classifying the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned ongoing issues and requested an investigation into attached errors, suggesting this relates to an internal project. \"Internal Project\" seems like the best category for this ticket since it's specific to project-related issues. The format requires me to respond with JSON for clarity and structure. I\u2019ll ensure to output just the necessary JSON response for the user's request without any extra text. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll provide:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
