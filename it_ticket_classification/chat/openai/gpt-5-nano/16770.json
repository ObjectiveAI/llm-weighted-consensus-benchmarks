Since it primarily concerns access, I think \"Access\" is the most suitable category. However, if it's more about permissions regarding these cards, \"Administrative rights\" could also apply.**Selecting category for IT ticket**\n\nI believe the appropriate category for the IT ticket is \"Access.\" The user specified they want a response in JSON format, so I need to create an object with a field called \"category\" and set its value to \"Access.\" I'll keep it straightforward by delivering exactly: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. We don't need to address the content further, just stick to the category selection. Although I could add a note explaining the reason, it's not necessary, so I'll keep it minimal."
