The content seems a bit garbled, mentioning terms like \"project\", \"lead\", and \"pm.\" It sounds like it could be related to an \"Internal Project,\" but the mention of \"change\" may suggest it\u2019s about \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" Overall, it appears unclear, so I\u2019m leaning toward \"Internal Project\" but acknowledging the ambiguity. I'll output it as JSON with the appropriate category.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the categories available for this IT ticket, like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and more. The ticket content suggests it\u2019s about a project, which could lead me to categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" However, if it\u2019s unclear, it might fit into \"Miscellaneous.\" The phrases like \"project for Friday\" and \"please change\" hint at scheduling or altering something, possibly linked to \"Administrative rights.\" Ultimately, I'll go with \"Internal Project\" since it reflects the focus on a project and timeline best.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
