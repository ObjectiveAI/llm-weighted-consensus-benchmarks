They seem to be requesting the addition of an annual leave event in Oracle. This could fall under \"HR Support\" since it's about leave, or \"Administrative rights\" if they're needing permission to add it themselves. Given the phrasing, it seems like they might not have the rights to do so, making \"HR Support\" the likely fitting category.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user mentions wanting to add an event themselves, indicating they need help with the Oracle system, specifically related to HR. The phrase \"annual leave event\" clearly ties to HR support, so the best category for this ticket is \"HR Support.\" While there are other potential categories like \"Access,\" this request focuses more on HR system functionality rather than general access issues. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
