This leads me to think it's about access rights. I\u2019m considering whether to classify it under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since both categories fit, I wonder which one is the most precise for this issue.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user's text discusses \"permission on path for exchange servers while attempting export file\" and mentions an \"access path denied\" error, pointing to permission issues. I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Access\" since it directly deals with access permissions. It could also fit under \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Access\" seems more straightforward here. I think it's best to respond concisely with the appropriate JSON object. My response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
