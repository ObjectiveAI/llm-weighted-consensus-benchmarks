The ticket mentions changing credentials for new interns, focusing on AD credentials, display name, and username. Since those elements are primarily about access rights, the most fitting category could be either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\". I'll probably lean towards \"Access\" since the primary concern seems to be related to user access. It's important to select the right category to address the issue effectively!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe content of the ticket focuses on changing credentials for new interns, specifically involving Active Directory credentials, display names, and usernames. Given this context, it appears to be related to access management for interns. I think the most fitting category is \"Access.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could fit if it pertained to granting admin access, it's not explicitly stated. So, I'll go with \"Access\" and deliver it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Delivering Format**\n\nI need to make sure my response is in a format that can be parsed by code. The instructions suggest using a structure that includes a category object. Since we've determined the appropriate category is \"Access,\" I\u2019ll prepare my output accordingly. The format will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's important to follow this precisely, so I\u2019ll just deliver that now without any additional text. Here we go!"
