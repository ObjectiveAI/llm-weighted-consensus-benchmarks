The text includes terms like \"administrator,\" \"action needed,\" and \"approval flow,\" which makes it a bit tricky. It could relate to user access, but that\u2019s unclear. I\u2019m thinking it should be in \"Purchase\" since there's a requisition number involved, indicating procurement. Yet, it might also connect to \"Internal Project\" if it's about an internal process change. Still, \"requisition\" leans toward \"Purchase.\"**Categorizing requisition requests**\n\nThe user asked for a \"number requisition,\" which suggests they want a requisition number. This clearly relates to purchasing, so I\u2019m thinking the right category is \"Purchase.\" I need to format my response as a JSON object with the required \"category\" string. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I want to keep things concise and straightforward. Alright, let\u2019s finalize this!"
