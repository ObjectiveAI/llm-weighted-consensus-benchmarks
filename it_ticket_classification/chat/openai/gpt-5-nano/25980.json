The user asked me to categorize the ticket, and I see several mentions of \"leave,\" \"leaders rejected,\" and \"mailbox receive messages.\" This suggests the issue revolves around leave request approvals. It seems like categorizing it as HR Support is the best choice because it focuses on employee annual leave requests and potential rejections by leaders.**Deciding on the IT ticket category**\n\nThe phrase \"leaders rejected\" hints at approval issues related to leave requests, so the user might want to change who approves these requests. It could also relate to \"Access\" if there are access issues or \"Mailbox messages\" regarding forwarded emails. Since the primary concern seems to be about leave approvals, categorizing this as \"HR Support\" fits best. The required format is a JSON-like output, so I'll go with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
