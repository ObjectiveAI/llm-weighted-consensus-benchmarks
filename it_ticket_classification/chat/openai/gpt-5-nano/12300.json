It could fit under \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or possibly \"Access\" since it deals with filtering views. Honestly, the mention of configuration tasks makes me lean toward \"Internal Project.\"**Evaluating IT Ticket Category**\n\nThis task feels like it falls under operational infrastructure, possibly an \"Internal Project\" since it involves configuring a filter. However, if they need permission to view changes, \"Administrative Rights\" might fit, but there's no mention of permissions specifically. Since it's about filtering out cancelled changes, it could also be classified as \"Miscellaneous.\" The question about deleting cancelled changes might suggest data retention, leading me to consider \"Storage,\" though that doesn\u2019t really match. I need to choose the best fit from the options provided.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nIt seems like \"Internal Project\" makes sense here since the task is related to an infrastructure engineer working internally. \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option too, but the ticket's focus on configuring a filter to manage changes aligns more closely with an internal project rather than a random issue. I should categorize it as \"Internal Project,\" and I\u2019ll craft the final answer as a JSON object. It will look like this: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
