It seems they're asking about grade changes data for importing into Oracle, mentioning phrases like \"grade changes imported\" and \"process grade proposal changes effective in next couple days.\" However, the message is messy and unclear. I see we have categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" etc. I'll need to fit this ticket into one of those categories appropriately.**Analyzing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe content appears to focus on importing data into Oracle PM related to grade changes and procedural questions, which leads me to think it's about either \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" But, since it mentions \"grade changes,\" it likely involves HR data. The part about \"registered under number\" suggests a company with multiple subsidiaries, wanting clarity on the data import process for HR purposes. Therefore, I'll categorize this ticket under \"HR Support,\" as that's a fitting option from the categories available.**Categorizing HR Data Import Ticket**\n\nThis ticket is clearly about an HR data import into Oracle PM, related to grade changes. I should categorize it as \"HR Support,\" since that's the focus. While it could also fit under \"Internal Project\" if it were linked to a specific project, it's primarily HR-related. The user requested to categorize this IT ticket, so I need to output a JSON object following the required format. I\u2019ll go ahead and format it as: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
