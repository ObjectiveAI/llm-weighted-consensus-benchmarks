The text is a bit jumbled, but it appears to involve requests for monitor legs or stands. The mention of \"friday\" could indicate scheduling. So, it looks like it fits best in the \"Hardware\" category since it's centered on monitor support. I'll go with that classification based on the content about providing and adjusting monitor legs.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI think I should categorize this ticket as \"Hardware.\" While I considered \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" those don't seem to apply. Maybe \"Purchase\" fits if they\u2019re requesting monitor legs, but it's not explicitly a purchase request. It really sounds like an internal ask to supply or adjust monitor stands. So, \"Hardware\" feels like the best choice. Now, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object matching the expected schema. Here's how it looks:\n\n{\"category\":{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}}{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
