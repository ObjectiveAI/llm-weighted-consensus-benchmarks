They talk about connecting a laptop to a monitor using an adapter. Thus, \"Hardware\" is likely the fitting category. I'll create a concise JSON object for this categorization.**Delivering IT ticket category**\n\nThe user just needs the category, which is indicated in the prompt: \"Categorize this IT Ticket.\" I\u2019ll provide the JSON format as requested. The category object will be structured simply: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It\u2019s important that I don\u2019t include any extra text\u2014just the JSON itself as specified. I\u2019m confirming that everything is valid and sticking to the allowed categories. Now it\u2019s time to deliver this concise response!"
