They mention key phrases like \"new purchase po\" and \"purchase po,\" which suggest a procurement request. I'll check against predefined categories and decide the best fit. Given their details about \"inch pro two thunderbolt ports\" and \"log installation,\" it seems like a purchasing request. So, I think the most appropriate category for this ticket is \"Purchase.\"**Categorizing IT ticket further**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize this IT ticket as \u201cHardware\u201d since the mention of \"inch pro\" could refer to something like a MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt ports. The phrases \"new purchase\" and \"log installation\" suggest that they want to install new hardware. However, they also highlight a purchase order. It seems reasonable to categorize it as \"Purchase\" since the primary action revolves around that. I'll express the category in a JSON-like format for clarity.**Formatting category response**\n\nThe system requires a JSON object with a \"category\" field based on the instructions. The valid categories include options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and more. Since this ticket is about a \"new purchase,\" it aligns best with \"Purchase.\" My output will be a JSON object like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nI also want to make sure the final answer is in plain text alongside the JSON. Even though \"Hardware\" could be fitting, I think \"Purchase\" is the most appropriate choice here. Let's go with that."
