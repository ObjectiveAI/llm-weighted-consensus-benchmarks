It seems like they are requesting access to a shared folder, possibly linked to collaborators across different entities in Bogot\u00e1. The mention of \"accessible future colleagues\" gives a clue about the access rights needed. Based on the context, I think the best category for this ticket would be \"Access.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user requests a shared folder, mentioning that it needs to be accessible for future colleagues. Based on the context, I think this ticket relates to access rights rather than administrative permissions since it emphasizes access for colleagues. The references to subsidiaries and entities seem secondary. So, I'll categorize this as \"Access\" and respond with the required JSON format. Here\u2019s the output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}"
