Since it refers to a \"new project,\" I think \"Internal Project\" fits best as a category. Alternatives could be \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but that\u2019s less explicit. The user is asking me to categorize this in a help desk system, so I'll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. A brief explanation might be helpful, too!**Finalizing Category Response**\n\nThe instructions clearly say I need to provide just the category in the required format. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object stating the category as \"Internal Project,\" making sure to match the exact capitalization. Even though there's mention of \"Administrative rights,\" it doesn't seem like a direct request for access, just related to the code pipeline. Therefore, \"Internal Project\" makes the most sense. I'll craft the final answer now. So, it's: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
