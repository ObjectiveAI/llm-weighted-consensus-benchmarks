The message includes a starter form and mentions an intern joining in November, along with a late notice and confirmation of arrival today. It seems related to HR or onboarding. The best category might be \"HR Support,\" but there's also \"Administrative rights,\" which connects to access rights. However, since there's no explicit mention of IT access, \"HR Support\" seems more fitting.**Categorizing IT ticket options**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT ticket. The content suggests it could fall under \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" since it's about onboarding a new starter who might need access setup. The phrase \u201cplease find attached starter form\u201d indicates it's an onboarding form. However, it doesn't specifically mention access provisioning, which makes \"HR Support\" seem like the best fit. The user wants this ticket classified correctly for routing to the right team, emphasizing HR and onboarding tasks.**Deciding on category for ticket**\n\nI\u2019m pondering which category suits this IT ticket best. It's about a new starter becoming an intern, mentioning an attached starter form and joining in November. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if access rights were explicitly stated, they aren't. \"Internal Project\" doesn\u2019t fit, and \"Miscellaneous\" is too vague. So, I think \"HR Support\" is the best choice since it clearly relates to onboarding the new starter. I\u2019ll return that as JSON with {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Crafting the output format**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the allowed types for this task. The system message indicates I need to output a JSON object with a \"category\" field that matches one of the specified strings. Based on the ticket, I think \"HR Support\" is the best option since it directly relates to onboarding the new starter. Even though I considered \"Access\" for possible provisioning needs, the text doesn't mention that. So, I\u2019ll proceed with the JSON response: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
