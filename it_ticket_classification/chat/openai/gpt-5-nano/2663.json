They keep mentioning \"roles\" and asking for roles to be added. It seems related to user access or permissions, which likely fits under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Both categories are relevant, but I need to determine which one is the most appropriate. Given the context, it seems like \"Access\" might be the better choice for this ticket.**Deciding on the category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the category list that includes \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I wonder which is more specific, but since it's about granting roles, it could go either way. The user\u2019s message is a bit unclear, mentioning \"please provide roles added,\" which suggests they might want roles added for a user. I think \"Administrative rights\" makes the most sense, so I\u2019ll select that category. I need to respond in JSON format, setting the category to \"Administrative rights.\"**Preparing the JSON response**\n\nI need to output a JSON object for the category, either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since the user's request is about adding roles, I think \"Administrative rights\" fits best because it relates to permission privileges. I'll ensure it's formatted correctly as a JSON object. So, I\u2019ll respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nNow I\u2019m ready to proceed with sending that response!"
