However, the categories don\u2019t directly include software or licensing. \"Purchase\" might fit since it relates to buying a license, while \"Access\" could refer to using the software or installation rights. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Purchase\" as the most likely category since that seems to align best.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that if I need to stick strictly to the given options, \"Purchase\" seems to be the best fit for the IT ticket. However, \"Access\" might relate to getting access to a license server. The ticket seems ambiguous since it could relate to either obtaining a license or accessing it. Given that it focuses on \"license,\" I lean towards categorizing it as \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll format the answer as a JSON object with the category specified.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
