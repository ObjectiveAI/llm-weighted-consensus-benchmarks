The key terms here are \"access\" and \"wireless connect.\" Based on the categories provided \u2014 Access, Hardware, HR Support, and others \u2014 it seems that \"Access\" would be the most appropriate category for this ticket. I also consider \"Hardware\" due to the mention of wired ports, but \"Access\" fits best overall.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nIt looks like the best category for this IT ticket is \u201cAccess\u201d since it\u2019s mainly about access to wireless resources and meeting rooms. The mention of \u201cwired ports compatible setup\u201d hints at hardware, but it's really about compatibility as part of access. I need to provide the output in JSON format, specifically: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I want to ensure that I've kept the capitalization correct, as indicated in the provided enum. That seems to wrap this up nicely!**Finalizing category response**\n\nI need to produce the output as: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. It\u2019s important to ensure this is the only content since the instructions specify a minimal response focused on the category. I want to keep it straightforward without any extra details. So, I\u2019ll provide this clean, concise response as requested. It feels good to stick to the guidelines and deliver exactly what\u2019s needed!"
