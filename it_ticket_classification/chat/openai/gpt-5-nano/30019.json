The ticket mentions potential attachments and the word \"code,\" which makes me think about either an internal project or access to something related to Oracle. Since it seems focused on a new project code, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best fit, but I also wonder if \"Access\" might apply if the request is about obtaining access to Oracle.**Determining the right category**\n\nI have a list of categories to choose from for this IT ticket: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The ticket focuses on a \"new project code\" for Oracle, and it involves code creation. Since it doesn\u2019t relate to hardware or storage, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit. Although it is somewhat garbled, the key phrases lead me to lean towards \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category for this ticket.**Preparing the response format**\n\nI need to respond to the user with the category value in a specific JSON-like format. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. The system message outlines that the response needs to be a JSON object with a \"category\" property of type string, containing an enumerated value. So, I\u2019ll ensure to keep my answer concise and avoid any extra explanation, just delivering the category as requested. Let's get right to it!"
