They mentioned an \"oracle visibility issue\" and requested investigation related to \"random colleagues under menu,\" which suggests a problem with access or permissions. The categories to choose from include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" so I'll decide between those two based on the context. Since it seems to mainly relate to visibility and permissions, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access.\"**Selecting IT category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket's content, which mentions an \"oracle visibility issue\" and \"random colleagues under menu.\" The grammar isn\u2019t great, but it points to access concerns. Although \u201cInternal Project\u201d or \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d could be options, I think \u201cAccess\u201d fits best since it's about visibility and permissions. I'll produce a JSON object as required: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Even though \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d might seem relevant, I think \u201cAccess\u201d is the right call for this case.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
