The user mentioned terms like \"license,\" \"allocation,\" and \"purchase form,\" all related to software license procurement for a leaver. It could fall under \"Purchase,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" Given the references to licenses and allocation, the most fitting categories might be Purchase or Access. I'll analyze which fits best.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing this IT ticket under \"Purchase.\" It mentions key aspects like purchase forms, item types, suppliers, and amounts, which all relate to software licensing. The request includes logging allocation for a leaver, which could hint at access rights, potentially placing it under \"Access.\" However, since it predominantly deals with purchasing and allocating licenses, I think \u201cPurchase\u201d is the best fit overall.
