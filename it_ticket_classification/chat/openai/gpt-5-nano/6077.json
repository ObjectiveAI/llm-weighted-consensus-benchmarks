The categories I have are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The content mentions updates about surveys and mandatory information, which seems project-related. It could fit as \"Internal Project,\" but \"Miscellaneous\" might also apply. There's also mention of accuracy and campaign details, making it a bit tricky. I'll need to ensure I choose wisely!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe text discusses updating survey contacts, mapping data, and ensuring accuracy, which seems relevant to an internal survey campaign. I think the \"Internal Project\" category is the best fit. I could consider \"Administrative rights\" if it involved permissions, but there's no mention of that. I'll prepare to output a JSON object with the category formatted as {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. However, it might be a good idea to ask for clarification, just in case!**Outputting category justification**\n\nI'm thinking about whether to provide a short justification for the categorization. The instructions only say to categorize, but it feels right to confirm the chosen category. I need to ensure I output the category in JSON format correctly. I'll go with {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}, and I'll double-check the spelling matches what\u2019s in the category list. Everything looks good so far! Let's get that output ready."
