They mention needing access and express a sense of urgency about being stuck at work. The categories available include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Given the content, categorizing it as \"Access\" seems to fit best.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe user appears to be requesting \"access to PM resource within reports,\" relating to permissions. This could fit under either \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" Given that their request centers on accessing resources within the reports, categorizing it as \"Access\" seems more appropriate. If it were specifically about permissions for administration, then \"Administrative Rights\" would apply. I'll structure the output as a JSON-like object with the key \"category\" and the value \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
