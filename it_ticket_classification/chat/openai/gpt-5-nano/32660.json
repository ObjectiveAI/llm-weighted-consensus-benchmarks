The options are: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The message suggests a request for uploading an Excel file of leads, which could fall under \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It could also relate to \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" if permission is needed to upload the data.**Clarifying IT ticket categorization**\n\nI need to figure out the best category for this IT ticket. The request is about uploading leads, which isn't explicitly hardware or storage. It could fit into \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project,\" especially since uploading may relate to a project. \"Administrative rights\" suggests it involves permissions. Although the user didn't mention any permission issues, I think \u201cAccess\u201d might work because it pertains to the privileges necessary for uploading. Still, \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the safest choice for a generic request.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
