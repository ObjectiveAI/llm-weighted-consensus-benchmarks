It seems like it's all about OneDrive file access issues, especially regarding client and production folders. \n\nSince the main focus is on accessing files, I think it's best categorized as \"Access,\" even though \"Administrative rights\" might fit if it were specifically about access rights. However, given the context, \"Access\" is the most appropriate choice. I\u2019ll return this in JSON format with a category field.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to make sure to follow the provided category schema, so I\u2019ll create a JSON object that includes the category \"Access.\" Since it\u2019s listed as one of the enum values, I can directly output it like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nThe prompt requires just the category without additional notes or text, so I\u2019ll keep it simple. My final output will be strictly in JSON format, ensuring clarity and correctness. Done!"
