It mentions \"select minds issues,\" possibly referring to a referral tool, and talks about employees having trouble adding referrals. I need to decide which category from the list makes the most sense, like \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" since it\u2019s challenging to understand the details. The request lacks clarity, so I\u2019ll choose cautiously to ensure proper classification.**Analyzing IT ticket classification**\n\nThe user seems to be facing problems with a \"referral tool,\" specifically with adding referrals and selecting locations. It might involve issues with an application named \"Select Minds.\" Given the categories available, it seems likely this ticket relates to \"Access\" due to potential permission issues. However, since there might also be software aspects involved, it could also fit under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" The classification needs careful consideration based on the details provided.**Evaluating IT ticket category**\n\nIt sounds like the user might be dealing with a referral tool that supports multiple locations. The categories listed provide options like \"Internal Project,\" but since this is about a referral tool rather than a project management tool, that doesn't fit well. \"Access\" might be appropriate if the user can't add referrals due to permission issues. If I'm uncertain, I could lean towards \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Access\" appears to be the best fit here.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user has indicated issues with adding a referral and mentions multiple locations, which could suggest a UI problem. Since they didn't specify login or permissions, it's all a bit vague. I'm considering classifying this as \"Miscellaneous,\" since it's a safe catch-all for unclear tickets. However, if it's an issue with location selection, \"Access\" could also be relevant. Ultimately, for simplicity, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the way to go. So I'll return this as a JSON-like format:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}**Delivering the IT ticket category**\n\nThe user wants a category for the IT ticket, and based on the options given, I'll provide a JSON object with \"Miscellaneous\" as the category. This seems appropriate because the ticket describes vague issues. I could also ask follow-up questions for clarification, but since they specifically asked for categorization, it's probably best to keep the response simple. So, I'll deliver the response like this:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
