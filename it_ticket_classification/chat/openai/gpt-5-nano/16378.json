Given the content, it probably falls under the \"Hardware\" category.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket to figure out the best category. It mentions \"HP phone\" and \"phone on floor,\" which leans toward the \"Hardware\" category. Alternatively, it might touch on \"Administrative rights\" regarding phone system access, though that seems less likely. The mention of \"Mob Zone\" could hint at a project, but it feels unclear. Given the context, the safest bet appears to be labeling this as \"Communication/Phone hardware,\" which fits perfectly in the \"Hardware\" category.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
