The user mentioned files too big, which points toward the \"Storage\" category since it concerns file size limitations. While \"Access\" might be relevant if it involved upload rights, there's no mention of that. So, I'll go with \"Storage\" as the most appropriate category since it's all about the file size issue.**Formulating ticket response**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the user's request and respond in JSON format. The task requires me to use a specific \u201ccategory\u201d field with predefined options. Given the issue is about file size limitations, I\u2019ll choose \"Storage\" as the category. I\u2019ll ensure proper capitalization and present the result cleanly. So, my output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}\n\nThat keeps it straightforward without adding any extra text."
