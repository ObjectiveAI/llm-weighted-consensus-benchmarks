Given all this, I think the most fitting category would be \"Access,\" as the user can't access the new PAS.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating how to categorize the IT ticket. Though \"Software\" isn't an option, I consider \"Administrative rights\" if the user needs that access to install or run something, but it\u2019s unclear. Looking through the categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights, I think \"Access\" fits best. The user mentions issues with loading the application, which indicates a software access issue. I'll go with \"Access\" for the category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
