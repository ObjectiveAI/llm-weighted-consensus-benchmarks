I wonder if it also touches on issues like jail configurations for those machines? It's crucial to understand the specifics of this task to categorize it properly. I want to ensure I\u2019m pinpointing the right area since it can impact how this project is approached.**Extracting task details**\n\nThe tags include a jumble of tasks related to creating a git repository, adding a slave with specific size and OS resources, and pushing and tagging in git. It mentions stopping scheduling related to running ports and addresses details like user numbers and executors matching logical hosts. There's also a mention of creating user mediums for testing and a bastion setup, along with automatic shutdown processes for machines. It's quite complex, so I need to organize this better for clearer action items.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThis task involves setting up a build slave in a CI/CD environment, likely related to a development infrastructure project. Given the mention of configuring CI/CD tools, repositories, and a bastion host, it certainly seems to fit the \"Internal Project\" category. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply for user creation, I believe \"Internal Project\" is the best choice here since it's fundamentally about development setup. So, I\u2019ll finalize the output as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Validating the JSON output**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to add a brief note or just stick to the category response. The instruction is clear: I need to output only the category object. After checking the schema again, it confirms that the category must be a string from a defined list. So, it has to be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Since that aligns perfectly, I\u2019ll proceed with this format \u2014 simple and valid! It\u2019s great to double-check, just to be sure!"
