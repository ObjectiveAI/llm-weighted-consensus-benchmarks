I\u2019m considering whether it falls under \"HR Support\" or \"Access,\" given the terminology used, especially since it relates to line manager assignments and submission processes. I\u2019ll determine the most appropriate category that fits this ticket's content.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking the IT ticket could fit under \"Access\" since it involves line manager assignments and approvals in Oracle, particularly around submission access. It might also fall under \"HR Support,\" given that line manager assignments are tied to HR processes. The user asked for a categorization, so I need to give a clear JSON-like object identifying the category. Given the context, it seems most appropriate to label it as an \"Access\" issue regarding permissions in Oracle.**Categorizing for guidance**\n\nThe user is asking for advice on how to proceed with something that has already been submitted, relating to IT support for applications with line manager assignments. I need to determine if \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" is the better category. While it touches on HR processes, it primarily concerns access issues and permissions. Given this focus, I'll categorize the ticket as \"Access,\" since it connects to approvals in Oracle. I'll present it as a JSON-like object with the category set to \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
