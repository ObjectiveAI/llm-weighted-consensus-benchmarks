There's also a \"Purchase\" category for procurement. I\u2019m torn between categorizing it purely as Hardware or also including Purchase since it involves ordering. Given that the primary concern is the monitor, I'll classify it primarily as Hardware, while acknowledging the procurement aspect.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket according to the request which indicates a need for an additional monitor. The phrase \"please order\" clearly suggests procurement, making \"Purchase\" a strong candidate for the category. While \"Internal Project\" and \"Administrative rights\" don\u2019t apply here, the user's phrasing points towards a specific request that likely aligns best with \"Purchase.\" I'll prepare to output a JSON object with the selected category field.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
