The repeated mention of wanting to share suggests it's about access control. The phrase \"accept decline information confidential\" could point to permissions, making \"Access\" the most relevant category. While \"Administrative rights\" might also fit since sharing documents may require such permissions, I think \"Access\" is the best choice for clearly addressing their needs related to permissions and sharing.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI see that the main focus is on sharing documentation, which suggests it's related to access management. The mention of \"confidential\" points to data privacy, so I need to categorize this IT ticket correctly. I understand the format needs to be JSON, specifically as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. While \"Administrative rights\" could be a possibility, the user didn't ask for such permissions\u2014just to share. So, I\u2019ll stick with \"Access\" as the appropriate category: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
