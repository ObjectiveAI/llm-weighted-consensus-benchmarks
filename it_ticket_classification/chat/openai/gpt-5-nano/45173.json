Given that \"HR Support\" is one of the categories, it seems the most fitting here. It deals specifically with accessibility to the annual leave system and issues around absence records. So, I'll classify this ticket under \"HR Support.\"**Categorizing IT Tickets Again**\n\nI see that both \"Access\" and \"HR Support\" are present in the categories, but since this ticket is specifically about HR system access related to leave, I think \"HR Support\" is the better fit. The user asked for a categorization, so I\u2019ll format my response in JSON. The structure is clear, and I\u2019ll ensure to include \"HR Support\" exactly as it appears in the category options. So, I\u2019ll respond with:  \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
