The user is requesting help with creating a shared folder named \"days\" that contains several subfolders like \"analysis,\" \"architecture,\" and others. This implies that the ticket has aspects of both file storage and access rights. Given the specifics, I think it fits within the \"Storage\" category best, but it could also relate to \"Access\" due to the shared folder nature. I'll use the approved JSON format for the category selection.**Categorizing Shared Folder Request**\n\nThe user wants to create a shared folder with subfolders, which leans towards the \"Storage\" category since it involves file structure. However, it could also relate to \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are needed. The ticket is primarily about creating a shared folder, so I'm leaning heavily towards categorizing it as \"Storage.\" The request doesn't specify permissions, just the need for the folder structure. Based on the guidelines, I'll respond with JSON as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
