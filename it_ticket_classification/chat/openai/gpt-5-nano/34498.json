They mention a \"password reset snow template,\" which suggests it relates to ServiceNow (SNOW). The request is about checking the password reset template and the completed manual categories. It seems clear that the ticket is focused on the password reset process and template. I should match this to the most appropriate category from the list provided, considering it's specifically about access.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the right category for this IT ticket about a password reset template. The options seem to be \"Access\" or maybe \"Administrative rights.\" However, since the focus is on password resets, it clearly falls under \"Access.\" The mention of ServiceNow confirms it's about user access rather than admin rights, so \"Access\" fits best. I'll output this as a JSON object reflecting the category. It should follow the required format neatly.**Finalizing category response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object according to the system's schema for the ticket category. Given the ticket refers to \"password reset snow template,\" I believe \"Access\" is the most appropriate and precise category. While \"Miscellaneous\" is a possibility, it's too vague. So, I\u2019ll format my response correctly without any extra explanations, just sticking to what's required. I\u2019ll provide the JSON as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's move ahead with that!"
