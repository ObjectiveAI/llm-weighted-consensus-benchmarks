Given that the ticket deals with application alerts and updates, it doesn't fit hardware or access. It feels like it could be \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" since it relates to an ongoing software issue. I\u2019ll lean toward categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nIt seems this ticket doesn't fit into \"Purchase.\" It might relate to \"Administrative rights\" if they were specifically asking for rights. They mention an issue persists and request a number related to it. Given it's about \"alerts summary\" and a general description of embedded style alerts, it could fall under \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" and deliver it in the correct JSON format.\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
