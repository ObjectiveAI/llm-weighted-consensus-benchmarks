The text refers to a \"starter form\" and seems to connect to onboarding, along with a mention of an administration officer and some specific dates. It looks like it might involve assurance about a different person\u2019s details. Based on the category options provided\u2014such as HR Support and Administrative rights\u2014I should lean towards \"HR Support\" for categorization.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI'm looking at a ticket that revolves around a \"starter form\" and onboarding paperwork, including working location and references to a colleague. It seems like a request for HR assistance regarding onboarding. The categories include \"HR Support,\" which feels fitting, and \"Administrative rights\" might also apply, but the focus is more on onboarding than access. I think I'll go with \"HR Support\" for this ticket since it's primarily about that communication.**Finalizing the Category Response**\n\nI need to double-check the category list for this IT ticket, which includes options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and a few others. The text mentions filling out a starter form and working location, which suggests it relates to onboarding and requires HR support. So, HR Support seems to be the best fit. In the required output format, I\u2019ll use a JSON object. \n\nI'll simply respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
