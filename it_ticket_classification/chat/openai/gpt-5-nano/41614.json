Given the context, it looks like this ticket is mostly about access control, which makes it likely to fall under \"Access\" or possibly \"Hardware,\" if it's a hardware issue.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user reports issues with multiple doors on the third floor, like a balcony door that isn\u2019t opening and an access reader that\u2019s functional. They mentioned having colleagues stuck, which highlights the urgency. I need to categorize this ticket, and since it's mainly about access control, the \"Access\" category seems like the best fit. There's also a hardware aspect involved, but \"Access\" is more relevant. I'll respond using the required JSON format to specify this category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
