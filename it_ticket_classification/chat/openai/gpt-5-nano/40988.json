The user seems to be talking about Oracle entries and difficulties with entering data related to leave. \n\nGiven the context, I\u2019m thinking it fits best under \"HR Support\" because of the mention of annual leave and leave management. It could also connect to \"Access,\" but it feels more HR-related overall. So, I\u2019ll classify it as \"HR Support.\"**Interpreting IT ticket**\n\nThe categories I have are limited, but \"HR Support\" seems to fit the user\u2019s situation. The user mentioned problems with Oracle entries related to \"lieu leave,\" which indicates HR, especially since they discussed \"annual leave\" and \"hours.\" It sounds like they need help categorizing the ticket rather than fixing the issue. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like object categorizing it as \"HR Support.\" The format will be: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
