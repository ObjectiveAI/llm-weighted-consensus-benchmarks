The ticket includes phrases like \"problems entering cards\" and \"cannot submit,\" which indicate issues relevant to HR and system access. It seems that the best categories to consider are \"Access,\" since it may relate to login issues for submitting time cards, or \"HR Support,\" as it directly ties to human resources functions. I'll go with \"Access\" as it matches the issue best.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI see the ticket is about time entry in the HR system, where the user can't submit their time cards. While it could relate to \"Administrative rights,\" I don't think that's the main issue. The mention of \"entering time cards\" suggests this is more relevant to either \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" Since it revolves around submitting time cards and potential access issues, \"Access\" seems like the best fit. I'll categorize it as \"Access\" and respond with a JSON object."
