This could relate to hardware, maybe for carrying equipment like a laptop? However, requests for a \"bag\" aren\u2019t standard. I'll map it to a category, likely \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase,\" but I need to determine what kind of bag they mean.**Clarifying IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ve got to categorize the IT ticket and the potential categories include \"Hardware\" for devices, \"Purchase\" for items, \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and \"HR Support.\" The phrase \"friday pm\" might suggest a schedule for picking up a bag. Since the message is a bit unclear, I should definitely ask clarifying questions. My best guess for the category is either \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase,\" but I'll invite the user to confirm what they meant.**Responding to IT ticket category**\n\nThe user may expect a JSON response with a category property. I need to return one of the allowed categories in that format. Given the ambiguity, I should select the best guess and note that it's unclear. If nothing clearly matches, I can choose \"Miscellaneous.\" However, since the phrase \"would need a bag friday pm\" suggests a procurement action, \"Purchase\" might be the right choice if they\u2019re requesting to buy a bag. So, I'll lean toward \"Purchase\" as the most appropriate option.**Formatting category response**\n\nI see that the request \"would need a bag friday pm\" suggests it\u2019s about procuring a bag, with \"friday pm\" indicating a due date. So, it makes sense to categorize this as \"Purchase.\" I'll format my response in the required JSON object format: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. The system expects strictly this format with no extra text or formatting, so I'll stick to that and give the user just what they need."
