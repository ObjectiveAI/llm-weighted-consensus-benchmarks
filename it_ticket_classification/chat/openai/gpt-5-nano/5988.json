The text seems to relate to onboarding and HR processes. It could fit into \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" Given that it clearly mentions onboarding, I think \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category. It highlights the need for new personnel training and related documentation.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI'm looking to categorize a ticket related to onboarding based on the user's request to fill out a starter form. The mention of \"starting November questions\" hints that this does pertain to HR. Since \"Administrative rights\" is more about system access rather than personnel, I think \"HR Support\" is the right fit. Following the required format, I'll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. No extra commentary needed!**Deciding on the category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether this ticket could be about \"Administrative rights,\" especially if the starter form is related to granting access. However, it seems more like a request for onboarding rather than rights management. So, I\u2019ll conclude that \"HR Support\" is indeed the right classification for this ticket. Now, I just need to provide the answer with that category designation. Let's go ahead and confirm it!"
