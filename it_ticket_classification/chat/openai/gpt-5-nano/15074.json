Although it could be classified under \"Access\" if it's about adjusting quotas, the main focus is definitely on mailbox size, which relates more to the \"Storage\" category. So, I'm concluding that this ticket should be categorized as \"Storage.\" That seems to fit best!**Outputting JSON structure**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket and return it in a specific JSON format. I need to maintain the structure outlined, which requires a \"category\" field with a string type. Since \"Storage\" fits the context perfectly, my response must be clear and concise. I\u2019ll make sure to keep everything in the required format without adding unnecessary text. So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. That aligns with the user's request!**Providing JSON response**\n\nI need to provide just the JSON object with the correct syntax and no trailing commas. The content clearly indicates that it falls under the \"Storage\" category due to the mention of a \"mailbox size too small.\" While \"Miscellaneous\" might seem plausible, \"Storage\" is definitely the better fit here. So, my response will be straightforward: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. That should meet the requirements without any added fluff!"
