Phrases like \"accesses accounts kept\" point towards the Access category, but it could also fit Administrative rights since it addresses adjusting dates for an intern's access. I need to decide between these two categories based on the content.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this ticket as \"Access\" since it deals with maintaining access accounts and adjusting dates. The ticket mentions \"intern extension\" and requests for updates, which suggests it\u2019s about updating access rights for an intern. While \"Internal Project\" could be an option, \"Access\" seems more fitting. The user asked to categorize the ticket, so I'll keep it concise and respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's go ahead with that!"
