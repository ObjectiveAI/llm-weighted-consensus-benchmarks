The terms \u201cbulk leaver form\u201d and \u201chardware allocation\u201d are key here. It seems to involve an HR-like process, specifically related to offboarding interns and managing hardware resources. Since it discusses hardware allocation, I'll categorize this ticket under \"Hardware.\" It's important to get this right for the best processing!**Deciding on the category**\n\nI\u2019m weighing the best category for this IT ticket. It mentions \"hardware allocation,\" which makes me lean towards \"Hardware,\" but it also discusses \"leaver forms,\" which points more towards \"HR Support.\" Both categories are valid in this context. The ticket primarily revolves around offboarding interns and requires filling out a form, which signifies HR involvement.\n\nGiven that the process seems more HR-related, I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support\" to align with the offboarding aspect while still acknowledging the hardware allocation.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the available categories for this ticket, which involves a bulk leaver form and hardware allocation. While \u201cHardware\u201d is tempting due to the explicit mention of hardware allocation, the focus seems more on the HR process regarding interns. The request is primarily for assistance with filling out the bulk leaver form. \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" don't fit since there\u2019s no discussion of access needs. \n\nGiven the context, I\u2019ll categorize it as \u201cHR Support,\u201d but my output should follow a structured format for parsing.**Formatting the output**\n\nI need to provide a JSON object for the requested ticket categorization. While \"Hardware\" seems like a straightforward choice due to the hardware allocation aspect, I also considered \"HR Support\" since it involves a leaver form and interns. The user specified that this is for routing in the IT context. \n\nHowever, I believe using \"Hardware\" is more direct here. So, my final output will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.\n\nI'll keep it simple and straightforward, following the instruction to categorize the IT ticket."
