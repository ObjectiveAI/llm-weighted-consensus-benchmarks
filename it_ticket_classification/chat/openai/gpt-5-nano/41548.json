I should definitely go with that one!**Categorizing access rights issues**\n\nThe text includes phrases like \"change sent Wednesday,\" \"manager change,\" and \"incorrectly assigned,\" suggesting a problem with access rights related to a manager role. I\u2019m considering whether \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" fits better, but since \"Access\" is broader and relates specifically to rights changes, it seems more appropriate here. The reference to \"HR manager change\" indicates it's HR-related, but access is the key focus.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll finalize the category as \"Access\" and present it in the required JSON format. Here goes: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
