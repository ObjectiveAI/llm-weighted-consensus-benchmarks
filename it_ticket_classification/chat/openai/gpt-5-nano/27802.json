The content mentions deprovisioning accounts for those who left after their internship, implying a request for access changes. The ticket could fit into categories like \"Access,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" Since it involves account deactivation upon leaving, HR Support might be most appropriate, but it could also be an Access issue depending on specifics.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIn IT ticket taxonomy, the \"Access\" category is usually for user provisioning and deprovisioning, which fits here since the ticket mentions interns and a \"bulk leaver form.\" While \"HR Support\" could also apply, the emphasis on mass deprovisioning leans me towards categorizing it as \"Access.\" I should present this in a JSON format since that's what's required. The final output will be concise: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Keeping it straightforward is essential!**Preparing Final Output**\n\nThe ticket is clearly about \"leaver\" forms and \"closing accounts,\" which means deactivating accounts for those leaving. Since it mentions a bulk leaver form for interns, it aligns well with the \"Access\" category. So, I'll prepare the final output in JSON format. I just need to ensure everything is concise and clear since that's what's required. Let's finalize it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'm all set to go!"
