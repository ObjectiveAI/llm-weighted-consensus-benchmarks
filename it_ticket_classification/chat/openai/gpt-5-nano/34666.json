They\u2019ve checked the archive too which further indicates it's a storage issue affecting their ability to send mail. So, I'm leaning toward categorizing this ticket as \"Storage\" since the problem lies in the full mailbox. \"Access\" could be relevant but seems secondary.**Deciding on Category Format**\n\nI'm considering the \"Sent mailbox\" issue, which is likely related to being unable to send mail because of the full shared mailbox storage. Given the context, categorizing this issue as \"Storage\" seems appropriate, since it's about mailbox capacity.\n\nI could also consider \"Administrative rights,\" but there\u2019s no mention of permissions. To respond correctly, I should format my output as a JSON object with the category string. Following the required schema makes the most sense for parsing. So I'll go with something like: {\"category\": \"Storage\"}.**Formatting Response**\n\nI need to provide the category for the IT ticket in the correct format. Based on the issue discussed, the category is clearly \"Storage.\" \n\nWhile just returning the category is sufficient, it may be helpful to include a brief justification. However, since the instruction is to respond with the category specifically, I'll make sure to stick to that requirement. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll go ahead and format my response as: {\"category\": \"Storage\"}. That should fulfill the request perfectly!"
