It likely relates to HR or access provisioning for this new user, possibly indicating onboarding. The categories I have to choose from include HR Support, Access, Administrative Rights, and Internal Project. Since this is IT-related and not about hardware, Access seems most fitting for granting user accounts and system access.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI can't just assume the category without proper analysis. The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. For a \"new starter,\" it usually involves onboarding and access setup. I think \"Access\" is the best fit since it's about granting system access for the new user. The mention of an attached form indicates an onboarding process. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and prepare a JSON response with that property.**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nThe required format is clear: I need to output a JSON object for the category. The schema specifies that the response should follow a certain structure. Since the instruction emphasizes categorizing the IT ticket, I will respond specifically with the category identified, \"Access.\" The system doesn\u2019t require me to include the entire schema, just the relevant JSON snippet. So, I\u2019ll generate the response as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to keep it concise and accurate!"
