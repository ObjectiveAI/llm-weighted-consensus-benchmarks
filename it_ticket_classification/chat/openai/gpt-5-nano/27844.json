The content mentions issues with Visual Studio Professional licenses, including assignments and subscriptions. It seems related to \"Access,\" as it involves software license accessibility. \"Purchase\" might also fit, since it relates to license buying. However, the emphasis is on assignment problems and reassignments.

This issue clearly falls under the \"Access\" category since it pertains to software licensing. Now, I need to craft a final answer in the required JSON format.
