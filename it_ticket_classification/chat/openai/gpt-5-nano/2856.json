This ticket seems to be about onboarding a new starter, possibly linked to HR. It could fit well into the \"HR Support\" category, but might also relate to \"Access\" if it's about granting access for that new staff member.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nThe content implies an HR process, specifically with \"new starter,\" so I will categorize the ticket as \"HR Support.\" I need to output a JSON object with that category. The required format is clear: it should be {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} based on the schema given. The instruction to \"Categorize this IT Ticket\" indicates I should provide this specific JSON object. So, that's what I'm going to return: just the category in the correct format.**Finalizing response format**\n\nI think it might help to provide a short justification for the category, but the guideline emphasizes minimal content. So, I\u2019ll just stick with the required structured format. The schema clearly indicates that I need to return a JSON object showing \"category\":\"HR Support.\" Therefore, my response will contain only that specific output without any additional text. I will ensure there\u2019s no extraneous content and keep it straightforward."
