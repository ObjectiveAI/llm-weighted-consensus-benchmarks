They might be thinking about setting up an email group for a social event on Wednesdays. It could also be an internal project to manage these social discussions, especially since they mention an increase in employees necessitating effective communication. It appears there\u2019s a need for administrative rights or access to manage a mailing list for all employees.**Analyzing internal project needs**\n\nIt looks like this could be categorized as an \"Internal Project\" aimed at managing social topics and announcements. Alternatively, it might fall under \"Miscellaneous\" if it's less clear. I see that they need a mass email distribution for social announcements, possibly scheduled for Wednesday afternoons. The focus appears to be on supporting increased employee numbers, enhancing announcements and discussions, and tracking topics more easily. Overall, it\u2019s about creating a mailing list or channel for these purposes.**Categorizing project needs**\n\nIt seems this request might fit under \"Access\" since they could need permission to create a mailing list or distribution group, though they didn\u2019t mention that explicitly. If \"Administrative rights\" is an option, it could relate to creating guidelines for a distribution list in Exchange/Office 365. However, their focus appears to be on building a process for social announcements and discussions. Overall, it feels more like an \"Internal Project\" for setting up a communication channel or newsletter. It may also be \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll prepare a JSON-like category for the IT ticket.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
