The category options include \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"HR Support.\" Considering the repeated mentions of authorization and access for members, it seems like the best fit is the \"Access\" category. However, if it\u2019s specifically about permissions related to members, \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant. But since \"booking issues\" is a key point, I'll prioritize \"Access.\"**Outputting category selection**\n\nI think the best category for this IT ticket is \"Access\" because it involves issues related to bookings, events, and trainings. To follow the instructions, I need to provide a JSON object that specifies the category as \"Access\" in the required format. I'll format it correctly without adding any extra text. So, the response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That should meet the requirements perfectly!"
