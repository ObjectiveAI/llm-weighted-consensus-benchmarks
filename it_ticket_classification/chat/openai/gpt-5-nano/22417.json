The terms \"leave approver\" suggest it relates to someone in HR managing leave requests. The categories that fit include \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"HR Support.\" Since changing an approver involves permission adjustments, \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" seems most appropriate. I\u2019ll classify it accordingly, noting it\u2019s an IT ticket related to workflow, not HR directly.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI see that the user\u2019s request involves changes to a leave approver, which means it\u2019s more about permission alterations. I\u2019m considering categorizing this ticket under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given that it's about modifying who can approve leaves, \"Administrative rights\" seems the most fitting because it relates directly to permissions. Although the mention of \u201cFriday pm\u201d suggests there might be a timing element, the primary action is the change itself. So, I\u2019ll classify it as \"Administrative rights.\""
