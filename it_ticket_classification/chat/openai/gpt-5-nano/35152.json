The user\u2019s input is a text about issues with missing time cards and managing direct reports. It sounds like it relates to HR processes concerning weekly submission deadlines for time cards. Considering this, I think the most fitting category would be \u201cHR Support\u201d to address these payroll-related concerns effectively.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe text mentions maternity leave and absence, and it's mostly about missing time cards and reporting processes for line managers. This definitely seems more HR-related than anything else, so I think the \u201cHR Support\u201d category fits best. While there are other options like \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d and \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d they don\u2019t quite align. I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format, ensuring it matches the schema. So the response will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
