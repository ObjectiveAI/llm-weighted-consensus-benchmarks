The task instructs me to output a JSON object with this categorization. So, I'll format my response as `{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}` to meet the requirements outlined in the prompt.**Providing JSON category format**\n\nI need to respond according to the instruction provided at the top, which indicates I should format my response as a JSON object with the category specified. The category I\u2019ve decided on is \"Miscellaneous.\" Even though there might be a requirement for plain text, the schema guides me to use the JSON format. So, I\u2019ll provide the response as `{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}` while keeping it simple, since the user only asked for the categorization."
