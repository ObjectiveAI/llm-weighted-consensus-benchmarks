It mentions updating push screen savers for certain locations and changing versions, which makes me think it relates to technology rather than HR or administrative issues. \n\nThe possible categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and more, but it seems to fit best under \"Miscellaneous\" related to software changes. I\u2019ll produce a JSON object with the selected category.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the right category for this ticket, which involves pushing screen savers to various locations. It seems like it relates to IT policy, specifically an internal project for deploying updates. The mention of \"order promote event\" isn't clear but doesn\u2019t fit other categories like Administrative rights or HR Support. Since it aligns best with implementing an internal IT project, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and prepare a JSON object with that classification.**Formatting the response**\n\nI\u2019m double-checking the required format for the response, which is a JSON object that specifies the category. It looks like I need to provide just the category value within the proper JSON schema. The instruction clearly says to categorize the IT ticket, and the schema indicates that it should have a key \"category\" with a string value from the specified options. So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} and ensure the syntax is correct."
