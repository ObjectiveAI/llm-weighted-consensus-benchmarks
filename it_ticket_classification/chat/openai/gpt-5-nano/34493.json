The best fit seems to be \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d since it\u2019s primarily a notification issue. I briefly thought about \u201cInternal Project,\u201d but it\u2019s definitely more of an issue with the system itself, so \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d it is!**Creating JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category for the IT ticket. The provided instruction indicates that I should determine the category based on the ticket's content. Since \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the best fit, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object. \n\nIt should look like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} \n\nI\u2019ll keep it clean, provide just the JSON response, and not include any extra text or explanation."
