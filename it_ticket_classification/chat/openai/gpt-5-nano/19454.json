It seems like it could fit in the \"Access\" category, since it's primarily about accessing files. However, it might also qualify as \"Internal Project\" due to the mention of slides and deck updates. Choices are limited!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis ticket definitely doesn't fall under hardware, HR, storage, purchase, or administrative rights. It could be classified as \"Internal Project\" since it involves project files and collaboration. However, there's a pressing issue related to downloading the file which suggests that \"Access\" might be the better fit. The user mentioned urgency in saving and accessing the file. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and prepare to respond with a JSON object specifying that category."
