The ticket mentions terms like \"ad joiners engineers\" and \"access,\" probably indicating \"Active Directory joiners.\" The categories I'm considering are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" especially if it pertains to those needing admin rights for AD. However, given the references to feedback and optimization processes, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the most appropriate category.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe text seems to politely request information about AD joiners and optimizing processes for them. It indicates a potential focus on onboarding. I need to decide between \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but I think it's best categorized as \"Access,\" since it's about user access to network resources related to Active Directory. The response will be a JSON object with the category field, which I\u2019ll set to \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
