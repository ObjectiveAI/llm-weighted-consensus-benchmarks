They provided a schema with options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. The content mentions aspects like \"contracts,\" \"draft stage,\" and requests to \"delete contracts.\" It seems related to contract management in a CRM system. I\u2019m considering \"Administrative rights\" for permission requests, but it might also fit \"Internal Project\" or even \"Miscellaneous.\"**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe phrase \"please delete contracts\" suggests an action that likely requires admin rights. The ticket discusses the contract lifecycle, mentioning \"draft stage\u201d and \u201cleave stage.\" It could fit \"Internal Project\" if it pertains to project management, and \"Purchase\" if it's tied to procurement. While \"Access\" doesn\u2019t quite fit, \"Administrative rights\" makes sense as deletion requires permission. They didn\u2019t explicitly request access but seem focused on cleaning up contracts, pointing to \"Administrative rights\" as the best category for this ticket.**Selecting the right category**\n\nThe ticket categories aren\u2019t perfect; while \"Internal Project\" is for IT tasks, this seems more about CRM data. \"Miscellaneous\" could be a safe catch-all, but I want to select the best match. The user hasn\u2019t mentioned anything about access, just a request to delete items, which indicates they need admin rights. So, \"Administrative rights\" feels like the right choice. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}, noting that it pertains to contract cleanup in CRM."
