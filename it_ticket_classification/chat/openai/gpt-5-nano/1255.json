The phrasing is a bit messy, but \"change active contracts\" appears several times. Given the available categories\u2014Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights\u2014I'm considering options. It seems like this might relate to Administrative rights or possibly Internal Projects or Access. The reference to a \"programme portfolio officer\" isn't particularly helpful for categorization.**Identifying ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m pondering the best category for \u201cchange of for active contracts.\u201d It could fit \"Administrative rights\" since it involves contract changes, but maybe \"Access\" works too if it\u2019s about accessing those contracts. There's a chance it relates to an \"Internal Project\" if it pertains to changes in contract assignments within a program. The text mentions \"programme portfolio officer,\u201d which doesn't help clarify. It\u2019s a bit tricky to categorize, considering typical IT ticket categories like Miscellaneous or Storage as well.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m contemplating the phrase \"assigned old,\" which might mean \"assigned to old.\" This could indicate \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I think \"Administrative rights\" is the best choice since it suggests a change in administration or ownership. Alternatively, it could be \"Internal Project\" if it's related to a programme portfolio officer. The content is quite minimal, so I should respond with the chosen category and a brief justification. I\u2019ll follow the required JSON format for clarity.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
