The user refers to submitting something, so this might fit into categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Purchase,\" or even \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it seems to involve an approval workflow, it could also relate to \"Access\" if that's about needing permission to submit or get approvals. However, there's no mention of hardware, storage, or HR support.**Sorting proposal requests**\n\nI see that the user is asking to submit proposals and mentioning approvals, which suggests this might lean towards \"Administrative rights\" due to the focus on workflow and user accounts. However, the mention of \"two proposals\" and \"grade proposal\" could make it relevant to \"Internal Project.\" The categories include options like \"Access,\" which relates to rights, and other categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Purchase\" don\u2019t seem to fit. So, I need to choose one that makes the most sense based on their request.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m noticing there's no clear request for access in the user\u2019s message. Instead, the mention of \"approver\" suggests a workflow for approvals, especially with \"next approver today,\" indicating it\u2019s about managing a process. \"Internal Project\" appears to be the best fit since it encompasses tasks tied to submitting proposals and approvals. \"Purchase\" could work if the proposals relate to buying something, but it isn\u2019t explicit. So, I\u2019ll choose \"Internal Project\" and format my response in a JSON structure like: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
