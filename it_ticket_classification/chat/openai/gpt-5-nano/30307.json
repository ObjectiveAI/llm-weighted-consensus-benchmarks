The user seems to be reaching out about a new starter form that needs completion, likely for access provisioning. There\u2019s some ambiguity with the term \"friday starter form.\" Since the ticket pertains to an onboarding process and doesn\u2019t involve hardware or storage, the most suitable category appears to be \"HR Support,\" as it aligns with the onboarding context and access needs.**Choosing the right category for IT tickets**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the provided details. The phrase \"new starter\" indicates a new employee, possibly located in New Jersey. The ticket mentions needing help with a \"friday starter form,\" which likely relates to onboarding. It doesn't seem to be about administrative rights for IT systems since it's more focused on the onboarding process. So, I believe the best category is \"HR Support,\" although \"Access\" could fit, but there\u2019s no specific mention of access needs.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm deciding how to categorize an IT ticket, which should be either \"HR Support\" for onboarding or \"Access\" for user account provisioning. Since the user didn't mention login details, \"HR Support\" feels like the safer choice because it's more relevant to the onboarding process. The allowed categories include \"HR Support,\" so I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON-like object, specifically: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"} to align with the response format provided.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
