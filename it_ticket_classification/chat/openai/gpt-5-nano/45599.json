It seems to relate to an undeliverable email issue. \"Development com mailbox\" could refer to an email like \"development@example.com,\" and they're asking for a \"mailbox increase,\" which likely means a quota increase. The message suggests that the recipient's mailbox is full or there's a policy rejection issue. I need to clarify the bouncing status, possibly 5.2.2 or 5.1.1.**Mapping IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this ticket into one of the defined system categories, such as Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative Rights. The issue seems to be related to email delivery failure due to a full mailbox or perhaps an address not found. \"Storage\" appears to be the most fitting category since it directly relates to mailbox quota. \"Administrative rights\" is another option if it involves adjusting that quota. Overall, categorizing it under Storage makes the most sense.**Preparing IT ticket response**\n\nThe instruction is to categorize this IT ticket using JSON format. The correct response should look like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I initially considered \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d because it could relate to increasing the mailbox quota, which requires admin access. However, since the message mentions \"mailbox full\" and \"increase needed,\" \"Storage\" seems to be the most appropriate choice. I'll just provide the concise JSON response without additional notes, as that's what the user asked for.  \n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
