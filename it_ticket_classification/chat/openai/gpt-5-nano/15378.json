It includes phrases about notifications, configurations, and assignments.\n\nI\u2019m considering placing this into one of the following categories: \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Internal Project,\" but it's a bit unclear which fits best.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket content seems focused on configuring notifications and mentions aspects like assignment, recipient details, and signature removal. It hints that it might need access rights, but I don't see explicit issues related to login or access denial. \n\nI'm considering whether it fits into \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" The details point towards \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" but without direct denial or login problems, \"Miscellaneous\" may fit better if it's too vague to categorize clearly.**Classifying the ticket**\n\nThe ticket references \"assigned,\" \"recipient,\" and \"signature removal,\" which could tie to \"Administrative rights\" if admin settings need changing, although it's not explicit. In these classification tasks, I'll need to choose the closest category. \n\n\"Signature removal\" sounds like it could be related to email configurations, rather than permissions. It might also be an \"Internal Project\" if it relates to project tasks. Given the context, it could best fit \"Miscellaneous,\" so I\u2019ll prepare a JSON response reflecting that choice.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
