The ticket is about migrating old site files and the need for file transfers, confidentiality, and deadlines. It mentions terms like \"upload files,\" \"editing rights,\" and \"closing down site,\u201d which could apply to Access or Administrative rights, but Storage seems relevant too for file migration. Internal Project could fit as well since it's a project.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket content is about migrating a site and moving files, with a deadline mentioned. It doesn't fit categories like Hardware, HR, or Purchase, so I'm narrowing it down to Administrative rights, Access, or Storage. The ticket focuses on migration activities like uploading files, editing rights, and closing down the old site. Administrative rights seem most appropriate due to permissions and ownership changes. Still, Storage could apply as well. A good choice would be to categorize it under Administrative rights.**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket highlights aspects like \"permissions,\" \"uploading,\" and \"editing rights,\" which suggest that \"Access\" could fit. However, \"Administrative rights\" seems more precise since the ticket is about managing rights. It specifically requests changes in editing and upload rights, plus archiving and closing down the site. Given that, I\u2019d choose \"Administrative rights\" as the best category. I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. No extra details are needed."
