So I'll need to figure out the best fit for the category based on context.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out how to categorize this IT ticket. The user seems to be asking to raise an incident related to a \"clear negative clearing\" feature, possibly indicating an issue that involves administrative rights or access. The mention of \"planning analyst\" could hint at the user's role.\n\nThe best categories might be \"Access\" for permissions, \"Administrative rights\" for admin concerns with that feature, or \"Miscellaneous\" if it\u2019s not clear. It doesn't fit \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" or other categories. I\u2019m weighing between \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous.\"**Categorizing IT ticket type**\n\nThe ticket indicates a request to \"please raise incident,\" which is common in IT. The mention of \"Administrative rights\" could suggest they need admin permissions for the \"clear negative clearing\" feature, although it\u2019s not explicitly stated.\n\nThis likely points to an issue with that feature in the system used by planning analysts. If it\u2019s an IT support incident about a bug, \"Miscellaneous\" could be a generic fit. However, \"Access\" could also apply if permissions are the problem, and \"Internal Project\" is a possible choice if it relates to the specific project.**Categorizing role and ticket**\n\nThe mention of \"planning analyst\" might indicate the user's role, but I wonder if the text could be a corrupted translation. The Romanian phrase suggests they might think the user is a planning analyst, which is a bit unclear.\n\nI need to provide a categorized output, likely in a JSON format, using one of the allowed categories. Based on the content, I'd lean towards \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll make sure to choose the most fitting one for the incident.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
