The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the context, it looks like this ticket should fall under the \"Purchase\" category since it's about a new purchase order and related receipts.**Categorizing the Purchase Request**\n\nI read the user's text, which is about a new purchase order for an Apple Pro Retina and mentions keyboards and mandatory receipts. It sounds a bit jumbled, but it's clear that it relates to purchases. Given the available categories\u2014Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights\u2014I think this ticket should be categorized as \"Purchase.\" I'll respond with the categorization in JSON format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Formatting the Response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object, following the specified format for the category. The schema states that I should output something like {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Since the user's text clearly indicates that this request is about purchase orders and receipts, I\u2019ll confirm that the category is indeed \"Purchase.\" So, I'll return the response as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} without any extra comments\u2014just a clean answer!"
