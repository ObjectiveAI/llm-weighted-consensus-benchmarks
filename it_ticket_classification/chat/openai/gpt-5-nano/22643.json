Overall, this definitely needs a proper category!**Determining Category for IT Ticket**\n\nI think this ticket might fall under \"Internal Project\" since it deals with an internal audit task and reporting. However, it's also possible it fits \"Administrative rights,\" especially if it relates to accessing Oracle. The distinction here is important; \"Access\" is a separate category focused on permissions. The content suggests generating a report in Oracle about time and location over several months. Overall, it looks like \"Internal Project\" or \"Access\" could be the best fits!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nSince this is related to an internal audit task, \"Internal Project\" seems like the right category. The prompt specifically asks me to categorize this IT ticket. I need to respond in a JSON format, so I\u2019ll create a JSON object with the category key. I should confirm the output looks as expected without adding extra commentary. The final output will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
