It mentions issues with Oracle not working and problems submitting, approving, or viewing information for about a week. Since the user is struggling with access, it seems like an access issue may be the most relevant category. So, I\u2019ll classify this ticket under \"Access,\" given the context surrounding permissions and login challenges related to the Oracle system.**Categorizing IT ticket correctly**\n\nI'm determining the best category for this IT ticket, which deals with being unable to submit, approve, or view information in Oracle. \"Access\" seems most fitting, as it suggests a permissions issue. I\u2019m also considering \"Administrative rights,\" but since the issue primarily revolves around access, I'll stick with \"Access.\" The JSON response will only include the required format without extra content. So, I\u2019ll respond with {\"category\":\"Access\"} to meet the system\u2019s requirements.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
