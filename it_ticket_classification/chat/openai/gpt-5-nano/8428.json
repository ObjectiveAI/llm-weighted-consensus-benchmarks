Ultimately, it seems to request adding a member, so \"Administrative rights\" might be the more precise choice here.**Structuring category response**\n\nThe user mentioned \"add member client,\" which likely means adding a client to the service delivery managers list, a clear administrative task tied to access control. Therefore, I think this falls into the \"Administrative rights\" category. I'll format my response in the specified JSON-like structure, which is required based on the prompt's schema. So, I\u2019ll respond simply with: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I want to make sure to keep it concise and direct without any extra commentary."
