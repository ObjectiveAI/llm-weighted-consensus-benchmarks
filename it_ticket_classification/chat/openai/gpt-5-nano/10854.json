It mentions a new starter starting on Wednesday afternoon, which likely involves creating a user account for this new employee, given the reference to \"credentials.\" There\u2019s some unclear language around \"assistants starter discipline,\" but the focus on creating credentials per the attached form indicates this is IT-related onboarding. So, I think the best fit for this ticket is the \"Access\" category due to the need for user account creation.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm determining the appropriate category for an IT ticket focused on creating credentials for a new starter. It could fit into \"Access\" since it relates to user accounts and permissions. While it references a \"new tower\" that might suggest \"Hardware,\" the primary focus is on credential creation. So, \u201cAccess\u201d is definitely the best option here. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object indicating the category as \u201cAccess\u201d according to the required schema: {\"category\": \"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
