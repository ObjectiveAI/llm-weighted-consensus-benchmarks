The text includes phrases like \u201caccess to Confluence,\u201d \u201ctablet,\u201d and \u201cperformance testing.\u201d It strongly focuses on access, as they mention needing permissions for the Confluence site. While \u201ctablet\u201d hints at a hardware aspect, the main issue seems to be about access. I think the best fit for this ticket would be the Access category since that\u2019s the central concern.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m debating between categorizing this ticket as Access, Internal Project, or Administrative rights based on the user's notes. They mention things like \u201cConfluence site\u201d and \u201cperformance testing,\u201d which complicates things a bit. However, the primary concern seems to be access to the Confluence site, especially since they\u2019re asking about permissions. Access is commonly used for these situations in IT service desks. So I\u2019ll settle on Access and format my response as {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
