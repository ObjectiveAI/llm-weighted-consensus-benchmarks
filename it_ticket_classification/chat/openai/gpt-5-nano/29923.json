It looks like most of the issues revolve around asset compliance and errors related to partitions. Given the context, it seems this ticket fits best in a category related to \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" as it doesn\u2019t strictly align with the others.**Categorizing Ticket**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT ticket. The phrases indicating \"partition available large enough\" suggest a storage-related issue, while terms like \"non-compliant assets\" and \"errors\" support this. Although \"Administrative rights\" might pertain to permissions, it's not really relevant here. Based on the language about asset compliance and partitions, the most fitting category seems to be \"Storage.\" I'll respond in the required JSON format without any extra text. Here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
