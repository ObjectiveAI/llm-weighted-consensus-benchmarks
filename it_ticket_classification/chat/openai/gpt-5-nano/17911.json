I see mentions of enabling features, mobile applications, authentication, and permissions. It's a bit unclear, but it could fit into \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" or even \"Miscellaneous.\" Given that it's centered on mobile app development, I'll lean toward \"Internal Project.\" \n\nI'll format my response as a JSON object indicating the category as \"Internal Project.\" This should align with the system's requirements!**Finalizing category output**\n\nI need to output the category as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I considered if another category might fit better, like \"Access,\" since there are mentions of authentication and permission. However, this ticket focuses more on developing a mobile app and enabling features, making it fit well within \"Internal Project.\" There are also references to RESTful order and quizzes, but the main theme is still about enabling features. So, \"Internal Project\" it is!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nI need to make sure my output follows the instruction that says it may need to be parsed by code, so I won't add any extra text. The format must be a JSON object with quotes around both the key and value. Since the category I\u2019ve chosen is \"Internal Project,\" it aligns perfectly with the requirements provided. Now, I'll present it exactly as needed!"
