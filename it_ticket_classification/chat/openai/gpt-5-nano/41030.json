Ultimately, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the best choice. I'll respond with the JSON format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} and stick to that without additional explanation.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI see that the tool suggests my output needs to be parsable by code, so I'll ensure to stick to a JSON object format. This makes sense because a structured response is usually easier to process programmatically. It's clear I need to focus on delivering a well-formed JSON string in my answer. Let's make sure everything aligns with that requirement. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and respond accordingly!"
