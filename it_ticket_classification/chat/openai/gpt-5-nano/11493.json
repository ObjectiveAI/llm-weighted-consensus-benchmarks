It mentions filling out a starter form, suggesting it\u2019s related to onboarding or HR processes. The most likely categories are \"HR Support\" or \"Access,\" since it\u2019s about the new starter and the form. However, \"HR Support\" fits well because it includes HR-related requests, while \"Administrative rights\" is more about permissions. So, I think \"HR Support\" is the best choice here.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nThe text doesn't mention access requests but asks to fill out an \"enclosed starter form.\" It seems to relate to onboarding tasks for a new starter. The phrase \"new starter center Tuesday July starter form\" possibly indicates scheduling for that center. Given that the \"HR Support\" category covers onboarding tasks, that appears to be the best fit. Since clarity matters, I\u2019ll classify it as \"HR Support\" and format my response in the required JSON object.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
