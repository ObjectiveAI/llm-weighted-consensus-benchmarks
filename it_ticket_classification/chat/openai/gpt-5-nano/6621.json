It seems they're asking for help to grant rights, mentioning \"approval flow\" as well. Given the context and keywords, the ticket likely fits into the \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" categories. The instructions are to provide a JSON-like category, so I'll need to format it correctly with the chosen category as the \"category\" field.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think the ticket is related to the Oracle approval flow and access rights levels. Among the categories, \"Access\" fits, but I notice \"Administrative rights\" is specifically mentioned too. The phrase \"level he rights\" seems to indicate a request for elevated privileges. Since the ticket primarily talks about granting admin rights through an approval process, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Administrative rights\" since it\u2019s the more specific option.**Formatting response correctly**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object following the required format, specifically {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}. The instruction is clear about providing the category in this structure. Since the user asked to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" it seems they only want the category without extra text. The system expects this precise JSON format, so I\u2019ll ensure it's presented correctly as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nNo additional text needed, I\u2019ll keep it simple!"
