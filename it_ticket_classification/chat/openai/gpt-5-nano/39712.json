The text mentions that codes appear without tasks, which complicates things slightly. It makes sense to categorize this under \"Internal Project\" since it's primarily about project codes used for those projects.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering whether to categorize the issue under \"Access\" because it involves the ability to submit reports and codes seem missing. Still, there's no explicit login or permission issue beyond that. \"Internal Project\" feels like the best fit among the options given. \"Miscellaneous\" could work too, but I think sticking with \"Internal Project\" is best. I should format the response as a JSON object based on the user's request: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
