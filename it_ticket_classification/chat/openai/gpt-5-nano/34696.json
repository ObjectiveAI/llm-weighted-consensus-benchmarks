The text mentions approval for holiday requests and includes terms related to annual leave and absence records. This suggests it's about HR-related leave requests and fits best under the \"HR Support\" category. To proceed, I'll prepare a JSON response with the appropriate category field set to \"HR Support.\" That should clearly represent the content's focus.**Formulating the JSON response**\n\nI need to create a JSON object that includes a \"category\" string based on the instructions. The prompt specifies that I should categorize the IT ticket. The allowed categories include \"HR Support.\" So, my response must be in the format: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}` with an exact match on the string, including the capital \"S.\" Since the task mainly requires the category, I\u2019ll keep my response straightforward and just provide the JSON without additional explanation."
