The message mentions filling out a document with proper information, which seems related to onboarding interns. I think it could fall under \"HR Support\" since it involves new interns. However, it might also relate to IT issues like access or administrative rights. I\u2019ll analyze the context carefully to choose the best fitting category.**Selecting ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"bulk form interns,\" suggesting it's about internal onboarding forms for new interns. The part about filling out a document with proper information supports this. There's a scheduling note for \"Wednesday November PM,\" which doesn't really help with categorization. I\u2019m considering options like \"HR Support\" for onboarding, or \"Administrative rights\" for access provisioning. However, since it focuses on filling a form, \"HR Support\" seems to fit best. It might also be \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" if too vague, but HR Support is my top choice.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to output a JSON object for the IT ticket categorization, specifying the category. The allowed values include options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others, but I'm going with \"HR Support\" since it fits best. I must ensure the format is correct, as the tool expects a specific structure: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} in plain text. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and respond with just that JSON object, without any additional commentary."
