However, it could be seen as \"Miscellaneous\" as well. Since it\u2019s predominantly hardware-related, I\u2019d go with \"Hardware\" and format my response as a JSON object with the category field.**Outputting JSON for categorization**\n\nI see that I need to create a JSON object with a \"category\" field based on the user's request. The category options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given that the content is about connecting a display, \"Hardware\" seems like the most suitable choice. I'm confident in this decision, so I'll just respond with the straightforward JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. No extra text!"
