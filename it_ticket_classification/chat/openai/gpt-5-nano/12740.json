The references to \"high importance\" and \"planning officer ext\" suggest a high-priority request. Given that mailbox storage typically falls under \"Storage,\" that seems to be the right category. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object to match the requirements. It should look something like this:  \n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Storage\"}}**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nThe category is likely \"Storage,\" and I need to ensure the format is correct as it requires a JSON object. The category should be in proper case, so it has to be \"Storage\" with a capital S. I\u2019ll keep the response focused solely on the category since that\u2019s what the user requested. They mentioned categorizing the IT ticket while providing those details. \n\nSo my final output will be:  \n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}**Confirming category as Storage**\n\nIt's clear that \"Mailbox increase\" indicates a need for more storage, so I'm confident that \"Storage\" is the correct category. Now, I just need to respond accordingly. Keeping it straightforward makes sense since the user's request is focused on categorization. So, I\u2019ll make sure my response reflects that. Let's go ahead and finalize this!"
