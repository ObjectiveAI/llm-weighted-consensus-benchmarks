The user's ticket text has some broken grammar, but it seems focused primarily on remote access issues and mentions connection errors. Given that the priority is high and the key point is about accessing remotely, I believe the best category is \"Access.\" There might also be a hardware issue, but the main concern is remote access.**Responding with JSON Format**\n\nI need to respond using JSON according to the specified \"category\" schema. The schema indicates that the output should be a JSON object with a \"category\" field. Given the need to categorize the ticket, I\u2019m thinking the correct output is simply: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. \n\nI should avoid any extra explanations in my response. The final output is clearly just that JSON structure, so I\u2019ll make sure to keep it precise. Let's confirm that that\u2019s the right approach!"
