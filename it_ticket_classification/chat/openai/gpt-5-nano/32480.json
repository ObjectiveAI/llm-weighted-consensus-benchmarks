Looking at the ticket content, it discusses invoices, device acquisition, and procurement, which leans towards \"Purchase.\" It doesn\u2019t relate to HR, access, or storage. I'll categorize it as \"Purchase\" in the JSON format required, potentially just the category string if that's what they expect.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI see that the instruction under \"category\" requires a JSON object with a category value. In past tasks, I've provided outputs like {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. The ticket content mentions terms like \"invoice,\" \"requisition,\" and \"device acquisition,\" suggesting that it's about procurement, so \"Purchase\" is indeed the right choice. I need to stick to just the final JSON without any extra commentary. Thus, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
