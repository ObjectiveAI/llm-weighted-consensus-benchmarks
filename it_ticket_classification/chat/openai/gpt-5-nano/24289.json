I'll output it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Categorizing the request**\n\nIt looks like this is a project management request related to internal tasks, so \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit. I do consider \"Access\" since \"allocate following task details\" might relate to access rights, but there's no clear mention of that. \n\nAll other categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Miscellaneous\" don't apply here. Since the user asked for a categorization, I\u2019ll stick with \"Internal Project\" and respond with the JSON format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Keeping it clear and straightforward!"
