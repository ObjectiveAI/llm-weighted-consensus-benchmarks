I must first parse the user message, which says, \"Categorize this IT Ticket: [long text].\" Once I read through the details, I can classify it properly into one of those categories. It's crucial to ensure that the categorization fits the specific issue at hand!**Analyzing messy text**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a rather chaotic text that mentions changing the site owner on Wednesday, approving a file, and coordinating with various individuals. There are mentions of employee monitoring, approvals from high importance, and tasks assigned to different roles. It seems overwhelming and lacks clarity. I need to untangle this mess to identify key points, requests, and responsibilities effectively. How can I make this more organized for everyone involved?**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIt looks like the text is about changing a site owner and permissions related to that. The terms mentioned include approval processes, owner files, and employee monitoring, which hint at multiple categories like Access, Administrative Rights, and possibly HR Support. The user is asking for categorization, not a resolution. Since the content revolves around site ownership and associated permissions, it seems best to classify this IT ticket as \"Administrative Rights,\" which falls under Access.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket discusses changing a site owner, enabling ownership, approved files, and updates, which seems mainly focused on Access and Administrative Rights. The phrase \"change site owner\" suggests modifying ownership, likely in a system like SharePoint, indicating the necessity for Administrative Rights. While \u201cInternal Project\u201d could be relevant, it doesn't fit here as well. So, I\u2019ll prepare the output in JSON format as required, making sure to use the exact casing:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
