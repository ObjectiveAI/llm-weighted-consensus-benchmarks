However, the ticket text is pretty messy! It discusses various issues with job tool display and referral processes. It's challenging to pinpoint a specific category given the confusion, but I\u2019ll focus on identifying keywords that could help classify it effectively. Let\u2019s see what I can do!**Identifying Category for IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket appears related to HR and recruitment issues, particularly around referrals and endorsements, so it seems to fit the \"HR Support\" category. There\u2019s also a mention of \"Administrative rights,\" but this seems more focused on HR tools and recruitment processes\u2014not hardware or storage. Given the context, I think \"HR Support\" is definitely the best fit. Now, I need to respond with this category as a JSON object. Let's go with: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
