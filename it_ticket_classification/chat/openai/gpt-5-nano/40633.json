Considering the categories available, I could see it fitting into \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d due to the focus on permissions and approvals. It could also relate to \"Internal Project\" if it concerns an internal setup. However, \"Administrative rights\" seems like the best fit given the context around notifications and the testing functionality issue.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI see that the terms \"approvers\" and \"notifications not active\" point towards issues with user notifications and the approval workflow. The user wants to categorize the IT ticket, which could fit under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The specifics seem to lean more towards \"Administrative rights\" due to the configuration of notifications and approvals tied to the Oracle Fusion instance. There\u2019s still some ambiguity, but it doesn't seem to be about login issues, so I\u2019ll go with \"Administrative rights\" as the best option.**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nIt seems that the category \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit for this ticket since issues with approvals and notifications are often linked to user rights and admin configuration. While I considered \"Access,\" the phrase \"approval sent requisition document approvers\" suggests an approval workflow that's more about notifications and not user access. Since there's no specific category for \"Workflow\" or \"Notifications,\" \"Administrative rights\" makes the most sense. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
