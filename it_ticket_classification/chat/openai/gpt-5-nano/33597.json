I think the best fit for this would likely be the \"Purchase\" category, possibly also considering \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I'll output that in JSON format.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nThe content really emphasizes \"purchase,\" \"installed,\" \"log installation,\" and \"administrator,\" indicating it's about a procurement process. So, I think \"Purchase\" is definitely the right category. I need to ensure the output is in the exact JSON format required: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. There's a need for precision because the system expects this category structure, and sometimes they just want the category field alone. I\u2019ll go ahead and deliver it concisely as requested."
