The issue revolves around selecting task details in a project list, which suggests a software problem. It\u2019s unlikely to be hardware-related, so my potential categories are \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project.\" Since it seems more like a general software issue that doesn't fit neatly into other categories, \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's description indicates an issue with \"selecting task details,\" which sounds like a user interface problem related to the Oracle reporting tool. Since there's no explicit \"Software\" category, my options narrow down to \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access.\" \"Access\" could work if they're unable to reach certain features. However, given the context and lack of clarity, \"Miscellaneous\" appears to be the most fitting choice for a generic software issue. It\u2019s a good category for this type of IT ticket.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
