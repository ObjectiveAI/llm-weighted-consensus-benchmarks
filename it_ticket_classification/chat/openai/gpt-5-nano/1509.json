The ticket mentions leave management and an analyst discussing logged leave with a timecard screenshot. \n\nAmong the provided categories, HR Support seems the most relevant, even though \"HR\" isn\u2019t explicitly listed. Administrative rights and Internal Project don't fit as well. Given the context of managing leave, I'll categorize this ticket as HR Support. It aligns best with the functions discussed.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to output a JSON object with the category set to \"HR Support.\" The instructions specify the required format, so it should be straightforward with just the JSON object itself and no extra text. \n\nIt seems clear from the context that this ticket is about leave management rather than Administrative rights or Access. They mentioned adding leave for December and looking into a timecard and absence, which all point to HR functions. So I'll go ahead and output: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
