The user's message mentions \"new starter access card\", which suggests a need for an access card for a new employee. They also mention changing someone's permanent status, which could involve HR or IT. \n\nI need to consider the available categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Based on the content, it looks like this should fit under Access.**Categorizing access request**\n\nThe user's message mentions \"new starter access card enabling tower,\" which indicates a need for provisioning an access card. This likely falls under the \"Access\" category because it specifically handles access.\n\nHowever, they also mention changing the person's permanent status, which suggests HR involvement. There's an \"HR Support\" category available, but since the primary focus is the access card, I think \"Access\" is the better fit. The mentions of a \"BR specialist\" and \"R&D developer\" could indicate that the request involves different departments. I'll confirm this assessment!{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Access\"}}**Clarifying JSON output**\n\nI see there's some confusion about the required JSON format for categorizing the IT ticket. The task instructions say to categorize it, and there\u2019s a specified schema. It looks like I should provide a JSON object with the category included as a field.\n\nShould I go with the full schema format, or simply output the category? Based on previous tasks, I think the safer move is to just return: {\"category\":\"Access\"} since that focuses on the essential value. But I want to be careful, as it might need the full wrapper too!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
