Another thought is to consider \"Miscellaneous\" since that\u2019s often used for unclear ticket issues. Given there's no clear category like hardware or storage, \"Miscellaneous\" seems appropriate. I\u2019m also wondering if \"Storage\" fits, but that wouldn't apply here. Other options like \"Internal Project\" or \"HR Support\" don\u2019t seem relevant either. So, \"Miscellaneous\" really looks best.**Outputting ticket category**\n\nThe tool requires a specific category structure. Since the prompt asks me to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" I should provide a concise JSON response like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I need to make sure the formatting is correct and that it follows the expected structure. It seems that \"Miscellaneous\" is an acceptable category here. The instructions suggest that extra commentary isn\u2019t needed, so I\u2019ll just deliver the JSON directly as the final answer without any additional text."
