The ticket clearly indicates a network problem, specifically with cables. I\u2019m considering options like Hardware for network hardware issues or Miscellaneous, but the focus on the lack of a wired connection points more towards Hardware since it relates to cables and switches. It seems like the best fit is indeed Hardware, so I'll go with that.**Formatting response as JSON**\n\nI need to format my response as a JSON-like object. The prompt specifies a schema that requires a \"category\" property with predefined string values like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and more. After analyzing the user's issue about a wired connection, it seems the best fit is \"Hardware\" due to mentions of physical cables in a meeting room. I'll provide the output strictly as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any extra text, ensuring it remains valid JSON. Let's proceed with that!"
