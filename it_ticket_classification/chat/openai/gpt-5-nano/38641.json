However, since the time card app relates to HR and payroll, \"HR Support\" might be even more appropriate. Given the specifics of the user's issue, I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"HR Support\" to best address their concern.**Deciding on category**\n\nAlright, I need to categorize the issue regarding the error in the time card Oracle app. The error arises after completing the time card, with difficulties in accessing or deleting cards. It feels like it fits under \"Access\" since it relates to access issues, but since it's an HR app, \"HR Support\" might be the best fit. The user didn\u2019t mention administrative rights. I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support\" since it directly connects to their problem.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
