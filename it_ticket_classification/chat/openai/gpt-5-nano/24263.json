The ticket text is a bit jumbled but has phrases like \"new purchase,\" \"purchase order,\" \"purchased backpack,\" and \"log installation.\" It seems related to a purchase order and installation request. Since the user is asking me to categorize it, I should output a JSON object with the appropriate category string based on these details.**Parsing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket text: \"new purchase po Friday December pm purchase po dear purchased backpack please log installation.\" It has phrases like \"new purchase,\" \"purchase order,\" and mentions a \"purchased backpack.\" I think they want to log the installation, perhaps in our ticket system. Given the categories available, since there is a clear purchase involved, it seems best to classify it under \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to follow the specified format for the response: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[...]. I see that \"category\" encompasses various options like Hardware, Purchase, and others. Given the ticket mentions a \"purchased backpack,\" it seems best to classify it under \"Purchase.\" A backpack isn\u2019t hardware but more of an accessory. So, I\u2019ll keep it simple and just output the required JSON: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. No extra explanation needed!"
