The user sent a long message that's messy but seems to focus on access issues with opening documents via any browser. They mention access being for \"employees only\" and \"clients have access\" too. Given the details about browser compatibility and difficulties, it definitely falls under the \"Access\" category. I'll confirm that this category exists in the list.I'm focusing on creating a clear JSON response. The task is to output a category string as a JSON object, specifically for the \"Access\" category based on the IT ticket. I just need to keep it simple and concise, avoiding any unnecessary details. So, the final output will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThis direct response fits the prompt perfectly without any extra text. Alright, I\u2019ll ensure it\u2019s clean and to the point!"
