Given the options available in the schema\u2014I conclude that the best fit for this category is \"Storage.\"**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI need to provide a JSON output for the IT ticket categorization. The prompt asks for a structure that includes a \"category\" field. According to the valid channel details, the category must come from a specific list. In this case, I'll use \"Storage\" as the category since that's the most relevant based on the ticket contents. I\u2019ll stick to the required format without adding extra commentary, resulting in:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
