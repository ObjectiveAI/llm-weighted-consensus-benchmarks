They mention \"file restore,\" \"backups,\" \"root drive,\" and \"Azure design.\" This seems to be about restoring a file, which is definitely related to storage. \n\nThe options for categories are \"Storage,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Storage\" feels like the best fit since it focuses on file restoration and backups. So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object indicating the category as \"Storage.\"**Generating JSON output**\n\nI see that the prompt gives a category schema I need to follow. It shows valid categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. Since I\u2019ve determined that the ticket should be categorized as \"Storage,\" I need to format the output correctly. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll prepare the response as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Storage\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to keep the output clean\u2014no extra comments, just the JSON in the final channel. Let's get that done!"
