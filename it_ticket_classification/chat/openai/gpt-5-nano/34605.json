The user mentions being unable to connect via cable since morning and has issues accessing the floor. This likely indicates a network connectivity problem related to hardware, like the network cable, or an access issue. The \"Access\" category might apply here, since it could refer to both network access and physical access to the floor. I\u2019ll narrow it down effectively!**Clarifying IT Ticket Access**\n\nThe user mentions, \"cannot access the floor,\" which might imply they need a security badge for building access. However, the repeated phrase \"connect via cable\" suggests an Ethernet connectivity problem. I could categorize this as \"Hardware\" since it's likely a cable issue. Yet, it might also fit \"Access\" if it relates to network resources or physical entry to the floor. The phrasing is a bit unclear, but I\u2019m aiming to categorize it accurately!**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nIt seems like the main issue here is likely a network connectivity problem. I'm debating whether to categorize it as \"Hardware\" or \"Access.\" In many ticket systems, \"Access\" generally refers to system login rather than network connectivity. Since the user mentions \"connect via cable,\" which relates to hardware, it makes sense to categorize it as \"Hardware.\" This covers network elements like cables and switches. I'll provide a concise answer in the requested JSON-like format to ensure clarity!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
