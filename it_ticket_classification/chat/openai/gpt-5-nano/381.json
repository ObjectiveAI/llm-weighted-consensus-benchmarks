According to the schema, I can choose from categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" etc. Since the text includes multiple mentions of backups, restoring files, and validation, it seems to best fit under \"Storage.\" While I considered \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" the focus remains on backups. So, the \"Storage\" category definitely seems most appropriate here!**Defining IT Ticket Category**\n\nIt seems that the best way to classify the IT ticket is under \"Storage,\" especially since it focuses on backup and restore activities. While \"Internal Project\" could fit if it\u2019s specific to a restore exercise, the typical classification would lean toward \"Storage.\" The required output is a JSON-like structure. So, my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I need to make sure not to include any extra text\u2014just the JSON object as instructed!"
