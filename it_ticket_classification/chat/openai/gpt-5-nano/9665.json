The ticket discusses changes to the automatic approval request notification and mentions details like the summary and requester name. It seems related to IT processes concerning approval workflows. From the allowed categories\u2014Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights\u2014I'm contemplating which fits best. \"Access\" seems most appropriate since it's focused on approvals.**Classifying IT categories**\n\nI\u2019m working on categorizing an IT ticket for triage. The ticket talks about changes to the automatic approval request notification and actions by the approver. This suggests it involves workflow automation. While \"Administrative rights\" might seem fitting since it relates to approval authority, \"Access\" is likely more appropriate as it concerns user requests and approvals. The mention of including the requester's name hints at a system change. I think \"Access\" is the best choice, and I\u2019ll respond accordingly in the proper JSON format.**Formulating JSON response**\n\nI see that I need to provide a JSON object for the ticket's category. The schema indicates that the \"category\" field is a string enum of allowed categories, so my initial thought is to respond with {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m reconsidering if \"Administrative rights\" might fit better since it pertains to changes in automatic approvals. But, the focus seems more about notification content than on rights. The ticket specifically mentions including details in notifications related to approvals, confirming that \"Access\" is indeed the best fit. I\u2019ll go ahead with that in my response.**Crafting the JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m focused on keeping things simple and clear, so I\u2019ll only include the necessary category JSON without any extra content. I\u2019ve settled on the response being:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThat should meet the requirements perfectly. Now, I\u2019m ready to present it!"
