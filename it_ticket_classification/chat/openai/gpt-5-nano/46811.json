It mentions checking settings related to \"default more than restriction.\" This suggests it could relate to access rights or configurations, which might fall under \"Administrative Rights\" or \"Access.\" It might even tie into an \"Internal Project.\" The user\u2019s intent seems to be about confirming settings in place, so I'll carefully choose the best fitting category from the list provided.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the message about checking settings with the phrase \"default more than restriction.\" It hints at checking policies, which may not directly indicate administrative rights. It could also relate to an internal project. The confusing part is the unrelated text at the end, which doesn\u2019t help clarify. I think the best fitting category for this ticket is \"Access,\" since it most closely relates to user permissions and settings.**Outputting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the ticket. The phrase \"check if default more than restriction\" points toward permissions, which leans me towards \"Access.\" I recognize that \"Internal Project\" could fit if it\u2019s related to a project, but I think \"Access\" is more appropriate here. The prompt specifies that I should return the category in a specific JSON format. So, I\u2019ll output the response as {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any additional comments."
