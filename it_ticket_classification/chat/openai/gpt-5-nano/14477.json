It mentions a \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" \"contractor,\" and \"attached completed form.\" This likely falls under HR onboarding or Access provisioning for a new starter. The main categories I can choose from are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It seems to fit best under either \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\" Let's classify it!**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI have content that includes terms like \"new starter,\" \"contractor,\" \"form,\" and \"attached,\" which suggests it's related to onboarding. I think \"HR Support\" fits since it involves forms, but \"Access\" seems more appropriate for provisioning accounts. Given the user's request to categorize this IT ticket, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" as it relates to onboarding and access provisioning. The required output will be in JSON format, featuring just the category. Let's stick with \"Access\"!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
