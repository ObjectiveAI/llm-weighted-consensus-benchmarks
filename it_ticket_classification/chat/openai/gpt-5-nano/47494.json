The user is currently out but has intermittent access and wants something urgent addressed. They mention \"engineer\" and \"automatic,\" which is a bit unclear. Since this involves approval workflows, it likely falls under the \"HR Support\" category. However, \"Access\" seems to fit best too since it relates to changing the approver path. I\u2019ll consider providing a JSON object formatted like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to follow their instructions closely. They probably want just the category in JSON format, specifically something like {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's good to confirm that \"Access\" is in the expected enum values. Although I wonder if \"Administrative rights\" might actually fit better since it deals with approvals and routing. \u201cAccess\u201d could relate more to system permissions, while \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d focuses on the ability to approve leave requests.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user mentioned an employee who can submit requests but has issues with routing to the correct approver. They have intermittent access and want to fix this routing problem. \"Administrative rights\" might fit since it involves changing approver paths, but there's also \"HR Support\" to consider. However, since this is an IT ticket and HR isn\u2019t an IT function, \"Access\" seems to be the safest choice. So, I\u2019ll go with the output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
