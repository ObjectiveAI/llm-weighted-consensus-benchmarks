So, I should output a JSON object with the appropriate category. Given the context, \"Access\" seems to fit best, as it's likely about account access issues. I'll structure my response as a JSON object with \"Access\" as the category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user mentions \"lost pass\" several times, which likely means they lost a password and need to block an account while also asking for assistance with getting a new one. This points to an issue related to access. The categories I can choose from include \"Access,\" which seems most fitting, along with \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Given the context, I will settle on \"Access\" for the category. So, my output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
