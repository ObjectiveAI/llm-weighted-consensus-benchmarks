It seems to fit primarily within the \"Internal Project\" category since it involves process improvement relevant to IT infrastructure management. Other categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous\" don't align as well. Given the user's request, I'll prepare a JSON object categorizing this IT ticket as \"Internal Project.\"**Determining JSON Category Structure**\n\nI\u2019m thinking through the listed categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Since the content involves creating templates and processes in IT, \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems like the best fit. \n\nI'll prepare a JSON object response with the specified structure, including a category field. Even though there's some confusion about format, I'll ensure to follow the required JSON-like snippet to meet the user's request accurately.**Finalizing JSON Response**\n\nFor multi-turn tasks, I need to provide a JSON response with the category as \"Internal Project.\" The expected format is slightly more complex, requiring a schema with \"type\":\"object\" and properties detailing \"category\" as a string. However, for this task, I\u2019ll output simply:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure this strictly adheres to the requirements since \"Internal Project\" is valid within the enumeration. The key is to keep it concise and clear with no extra text."
