The mention of \u201ccannot log after resetting\u201d suggests it's primarily related to access. While it could also imply administrative rights if an admin handled the reset, I think \u201cAccess\u201d is the best fit here. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the category. Let's get that structured correctly!**Confirming category response**\n\nI see that the \"category\" tool requires a JSON object with a \"category\" field. So my response will simply be: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I think about including a short justification, but since the prompt only asks for categorization, I\u2019ll stick with just the JSON output. The user mentioned a login issue after a password reset, which confirms it's an access issue. So, that reinforces my choice! Alright, I\u2019ll return that!"
