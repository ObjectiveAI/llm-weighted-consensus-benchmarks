The message mentions internal audit leavers and active ad accounts, focusing on disabling accounts immediately. \n\nSince this relates to access control and managing user accounts, the most suitable category here would be \"Access.\" \n\nI\u2019ll structure the response in a JSON-like format with the appropriate category field.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm looking at the appropriate category for this IT ticket. It seems \"Access\" is the best fit because disabling accounts relates to access management, rather than dealing with administrative rights, which involves granting or revoking admin privileges. While \"Administrative rights\" might come to mind, that's not what's being requested here.\n\nOther categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"HR Support\" aren't relevant either. So, I'll go with \"Access\" and prepare a JSON output with the category field indicating that.**Formatting the response**\n\nI've decided on the category \"Access\" for this IT ticket, which relates to disabling accounts. Now I need to ensure the output is formatted exactly as specified\u2014a JSON object with just the category field and no extra text. \n\nSince the ticket mentions sensitive information about employees, I won't include any additional details to maintain privacy. I'll wrap this up with the clean format: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and prepare to deliver it."
