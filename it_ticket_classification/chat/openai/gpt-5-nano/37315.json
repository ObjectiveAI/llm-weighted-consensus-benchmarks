The user is mentioning problems downloading builds and a slow connection, indicating a network issue. Looking at the available categories, I see there's no specific one for \"Network\" or \"Connectivity.\" The closest options seem to be \"Miscellaneous,\" which covers general IT problems, or \"Access,\" but that's more about permissions. As the user is experiencing a connectivity issue, \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit here.**Categorizing IT ticket in JSON**\n\nWhen prioritizing IT tickets, network issues generally fit in a \"Network/Connectivity\" category, but that isn\u2019t listed here. It looks like \"Miscellaneous\" is the best choice for this ticket. While \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" don\u2019t apply, \"Hardware\" could be considered if it's a network hardware problem, but the whole floor being slow points to a broader connectivity issue. So, I'll respond with the category in the required JSON format: {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
