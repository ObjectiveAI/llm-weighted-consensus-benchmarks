The user\u2019s message is a bit jumbled, but it seems focused on a new purchase order for a Thunderbolt gigabit adapter from Apple. I think I should classify this as \"Purchase\" since it directly relates to procurement. However, it could also fit under \"Hardware\" or even \"Administrative rights\" due to the context.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nFor this IT ticket about a purchase order, allocation, and receipts, the most appropriate category is \"Purchase.\" It could potentially fit under \"Internal Project,\" but \"Purchase\" is more likely. The user wants a response in a specific JSON format, so I need to provide it as a category object. The output will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to stick strictly to the allowed categories and keep it concise, without any extra explanations."
