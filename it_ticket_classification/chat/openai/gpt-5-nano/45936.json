The issues mentioned include user admin problems, errors during report processing, and trouble with the data source connection. This looks like a standard IT support scenario. Given terms like \"cannot create connection data source\" and \"report server,\" I\u2019m leaning toward the \"Access\" category. However, the reference to user admin issues isn't entirely clear. I should decide carefully!**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m determining how to categorize an IT ticket. The mention of \"cannot create connection data source\" suggests it might relate to access issues or possibly require \"Administrative rights\" for permissions. \n\nWhile \"Access\" fits the login and permissions aspect, \"Administrative rights\" could also work if the ticket focuses on those issues. The text hints that it\u2019s a user admin issue, which leans toward permissions. To finalize, I'll propose \"Access\" for the JSON output, noting the server and remote error context as well.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this ticket, focusing on the main issue: \"error occurred during report processing\" related to the data source connection failure. This likely indicates a problem with credentials. \n\nGiven that \"Access\" fits for login and data source access, I think it's the best category here. The final output should be a JSON object: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I\u2019ll keep it concise, and if more detail is needed later, I can ask clarifying questions. Let's go with this!"
