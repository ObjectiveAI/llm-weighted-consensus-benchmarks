The text mentions \"new starter access card enabling center\" and requests help with a starter form. \n\nIt looks like the user is asking for assistance with enabling access for a new starter by filling out that form. Given the focus on access rights, I think this ticket likely belongs in the \"Access\" category.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nI think this ticket should be categorized as \"Access\" since it's about provisioning access for a new starter. The user is asking for help with filling out a starter form, which aligns with that category.\n\nThe instruction mentions outputting a JSON object with a category field, so I\u2019ll format it like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI need to stick to the instructions and ensure there\u2019s no extra commentary\u2014just the category as specified!**Deciding on ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether this ticket should be categorized as \"HR Support\" due to mentions of \"new starter\" and \"starter form.\" Those sound like HR tasks. However, since it's an IT ticket requesting help to \"fill out starter form,\" I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access.\" \n\nThe user is asking about enabling access for a new starter, which aligns with IT support. So, I believe \"Access\" is the more appropriate choice. I\u2019ll finalize my output as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
