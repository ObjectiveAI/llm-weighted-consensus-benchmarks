It seems that the main concern is the storage fullness on the server\u2019s database, which might fit best under \"Storage\" or possibly \"Hardware\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It's definitely related to storage capacity!**Categorizing an IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m dealing with a server issue where the ticket states that the hardware database is full. It could fit well under the \u201cStorage\u201d category since it\u2019s primarily about disk space. The ticket also mentions recovery, which makes \u201cHardware\u201d a potential option too, but since the core issue is storage fullness, I think \u201cStorage\u201d is definitely the best fit. For the response, I should provide just the JSON object with the category value. Here we go: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
