This definitely fits into the \"Access\" category. The content revolves around file visibility and reducing redundancy. So, I\u2019ll output JSON reflecting that with the correct category. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Ensuring precise output**\n\nI need to make sure there's no extra text in my response. The system expects a strict JSON format, specifically one that includes a category property. So, I\u2019ll focus solely on crafting that final answer to meet the requirements. Let\u2019s keep it simple and straightforward, ensuring that I provide just the necessary JSON for clarity and accuracy. So, I'll prepare that final response now."
