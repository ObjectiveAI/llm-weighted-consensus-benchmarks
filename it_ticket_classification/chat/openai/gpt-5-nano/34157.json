They provided a long, messy text, and I'm trying to map it to the right category among options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. The ticket covers remote desktop servers, licenses, increasing connections, and disk space. It seems to revolve around licensing and capacity, so it could fit under \"Purchase\" for licenses or \"Access\" for remote desktop access. But it also relates to hardware capacity, making this a bit tricky!**Categorizing the request**\n\nThere's a mention of several terms related to adding disk space, licenses, and server roles. It looks like this is a procurement request for more licenses and storage. While it could fit into \"Internal Project\" for server changes, the simplest and most fitting category is \"Purchase\" since it's primarily about buying more licenses and storage. I'll output this as a JSON object with the category set to \"Purchase,\" following the specified schema. \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
