The phrases suggest it could fall under \"Access\" if it's a permissions issue, or \"Storage\" if it's a capacity concern. I\u2019ll evaluate the content carefully to choose the best category.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether this IT ticket is related to the Belgrade office. The categories include HR Support, but that doesn\u2019t fit because it\u2019s an IT issue. It could relate to an internal project since it mentions SOWs. However, the best fit appears to be \"Access\" because the employees can\u2019t upload documents due to permissions. \"Storage\" could be relevant if their upload fails due to the storage path. Ultimately, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" since they're seeking to resolve permission issues. I'll respond with the category in a JSON object.**Preparing response format**\n\nI need to create a JSON object with a \"category\" field for the IT ticket. The instruction clearly states to categorize it, so I'll respond with the appropriate category from the provided options. In this case, I\u2019ve determined that \"Access\" is the correct category. \n\nThe response will just be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s important to stick to the required format and not add any extra commentary. I\u2019ll finalize and send that response!"
