Meanwhile, \"intern mobile\" might suggest it's related to an internal project. I should finalize my choice, but I'm leaning towards the \"Access\" category for this ticket.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing this IT ticket as \"Access.\" The phrase \"open connection\" suggests it's about granting access or establishing a network connection. While it could also relate to an \"Internal Project\" due to the mention of an intern, the content seems more aligned with access requests. The message hints that the intern is reaching out about their mobile connectivity, which reinforces my choice. Overall, I'll go with \"Access\" for this ticket category.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to respond with a JSON object. The format is clear: it should include a \"category\" field with an enum of possible categories. Since I decided on \"Access\" as the category, my response will just be that in the correct format. I'll keep it concise and deliver the JSON object accordingly. Here it goes: {\"category\":\"Access\"}"
