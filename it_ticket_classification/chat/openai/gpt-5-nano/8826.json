The user might mean adding functionality to a calendar UI. I need to choose from the given categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since there's no \"Software\" category, I'll lean toward \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" That seems like the best fit!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a request related to calendar features. It could fall under \"Internal Project\" if it's part of broader project work or \"Miscellaneous\" if it's a bit unclear. The user's phrasing suggests they want to display conference rooms on the right side of the calendar app, which might connect to UI configurations in systems like Outlook or Google Calendar. Given the ambiguity, the safest category choice could be \"Miscellaneous\" rather than forcing it into \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Choosing the category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the user's request about adding rooms to the calendar. While \"Access\" seems relevant if it's about calendar access, the phrasing is a bit awkward. They likely want to \"add rooms to the calendar on the right.\" This action suggests resource integration rather than access rights. Since \"Internal Project\" could also fit, I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" as a neutral choice. I need to respond with a JSON object as specified, so here goes:  \n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}**Selecting the best category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about which category fits best for the user's request. \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they need permission to modify calendars, but that's not clear from their phrasing. \"Access\" might also work, but given the vague nature of the request, I'm settling on \"Miscellaneous\" as a safe choice. I should just respond with the JSON object and avoid any extra commentary this time. Here it is:  \n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
