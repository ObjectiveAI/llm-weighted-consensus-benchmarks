The mention of leavers indicates it might relate to access removal or account deprovisioning, so I'm considering the \"Access\" category. However, it could also fit into \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or even \"Miscellaneous.\" Given the context of updating procedures for departing employees, Access seems to be the most appropriate choice.**Categorizing ticket options**\n\nI\u2019m considering the category for this ticket. \"Access\" seems the strongest choice since it involves deprovisioning access for leavers. However, it could also go under \"Administrative rights\" if it specifically deals with those privileges. The phrases like \"update procedures\" and \"automatic templates\" suggest it relates to process improvement for offboarding, possibly hinting at \"Internal Project.\" But that category is meant for internal IT projects, so, overall, \"Access\" feels like the best fit given the context.**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m deciding to pick \"Access\" as the category for the IT ticket. The prompt instructs us to output this in a specific JSON format. According to the schema provided, I need to create an object with a \"category\" key that has one of the predefined values. So, I\u2019ll deliver: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to keep it straightforward without extra commentary. Let's get this delivered!"
