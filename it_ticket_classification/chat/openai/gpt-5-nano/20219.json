I\u2019m leaning towards the \"Hardware\" category since they're asking for devices. However, it could also fit under \"Purchase\" if they meant to request buying them. But since it says \"needs monitors\" rather than \"needs to purchase,\" \"Hardware\" feels more accurate. The typical categories for IT tickets include hardware, purchase, internal project, and more.**Classifying IT Tickets**\n\nThe user's request includes \"monitor february two monitors,\" which seems to indicate they're discussing months and equipment. The phrase \"hello colleague needs monitors\" points towards needing two monitors. For the IT ticket classification, this request likely falls under \"Hardware\" since it's about physical equipment. However, it could also be categorized as \"Purchase\" if they need to authorize buying monitors. Given the context, I'll classify it as \"Hardware\" and provide a JSON object with the category.**Finalizing IT Ticket Output**\n\nThe user's request requires me to categorize the IT ticket simply. I'll output it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nSince they didn't ask for an explanation, keeping it minimal is key. I need to ensure I'm using the valid categories, and \"Hardware\" fits perfectly here. So, I'll stick with that and present the output clearly as required. Sounds good!"
