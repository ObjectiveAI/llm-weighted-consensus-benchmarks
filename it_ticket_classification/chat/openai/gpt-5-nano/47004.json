The ticket mentions \"screen resolution\" and \"monitor solved,\" which clearly indicates a hardware issue. \n\nSo, it makes the most sense to categorize it as \"Hardware.\" The user specifically asked me to categorize, and the format required is a JSON-like object. I\u2019ll prepare to output the response as: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. This matches the guidelines provided.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI\u2019m examining the required format for the output based on the provided schema, which shows that I need to create an object with a \"category\" property. \n\nTo be precise, the output should reflect the category as a string among the specified options. After considering everything, I\u2019ll confirm that the response should be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. While the schema suggests an object, I believe this reflects what\u2019s required, so I\u2019ll stick with that format. Just to be safe, keeping it straightforward is the best approach here!**Delivering final response**\n\nI\u2019m finalizing my response with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It's short and to the point, which is important. \n\nConsidering the specific mention of \"screen resolution\" and \"monitor solved,\" I'm confident that categorizing it as a hardware issue is correct. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and deliver this final output without overthinking it further. It makes sense and meets the user\u2019s request perfectly!"
