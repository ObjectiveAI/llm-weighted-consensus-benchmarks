Let\u2019s ensure I select the most relevant category based on these details!**Classifying Ticket Content**\n\nThe ticket includes phrases like \"external range,\" \"default gateway,\" and \"mask,\" which suggest it\u2019s related to network configuration. I\u2019m considering placing it under \"Internal Project\" since that often covers ongoing tasks, but \"Miscellaneous\" could also fit as a catch-all. \n\nIt appears the user is requesting resources for a range configuration, including details on host names and proxies. The abundance of network-specific terms makes it essential to categorize this accurately based on the content!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket points to network infrastructure details with terms like \"IP range,\" \"subnet mask,\" and \"gateway.\" It could lean towards \"Administrative rights\" if modification permissions are needed, but there\u2019s no clear request for that.\n\nThe mention of \"external range\" and potentially referencing licenses or certificates might complicate things. With phrases like \"added resources range configuration,\" it suggests a network project, making \"Internal Project\" the best fit. While \"Miscellaneous\" is an option, it seems more focused on specific network configuration tasks.**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket lacks an explicit \"Project\" tag, but \"Internal Project\" seems fitting since it involves configuration tasks rather than user support. \"Access\" could apply if it\u2019s about securing rights to a range, though that's not clearly defined.\n\nHardware, HR Support, Storage, and Purchase are off the table. \"Miscellaneous\" could work if I'm uncertain, but \"Internal Project\" seems best given the focus on network range configuration. I\u2019ll proceed to create a JSON object that includes the chosen category based on this analysis!**Formatting the Response**\n\nI've settled on the required format as a JSON object, specifically: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. \n\nI need to ensure everything is quoted properly and there's no additional text. The user might think \"Administrative rights\" fits since the ticket discusses \"added resources\" and related terms. However, the lack of a clear permissions request makes it lean towards resources instead. \n\nWhile \"Miscellaneous\" could be safer, I should stick with \"Internal Project\" as it aligns best with the ticket's focus. So, I'll respond only with this JSON format!"
