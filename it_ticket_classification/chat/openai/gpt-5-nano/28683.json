The \"starter form\" could refer to an extension or something external, considering \"ext\" could mean either of those. So, in terms of the given categories, I'm looking to map this ticket to \"HR Support\" or \"Access,\" since it relates to onboarding.**Categorizing onboarding requests**\n\nThe message seems to indicate onboarding for a new employee, and \"starter form\" with \"ext\" might relate to an extension of access or email. The mention of \"pm\" is probably not referring to a project manager in this context. The user likely wants to categorize this for triage related to access provisioning. I see that \"Access\" fits best, as the new starter will need accounts and system access. \"HR Support\" is also an option, but \"Access\" seems more appropriate here.**Deciding ticket categories**\n\nGiven the content, I think \"Access\" is the best choice since it relates to provisioning accounts for a new starter. The mention of \"starter form ext\" could imply an extension, but it\u2019s unclear if \"Administrative rights\" is needed. Since that isn\u2019t specified, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" The output needs to follow a specific JSON-like structure. I\u2019ll produce this as `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I\u2019ll keep \"Administrative rights\" in mind for future reference, but it doesn\u2019t seem necessary right now.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
