But the ticket content seems generic, mentioning an inability to submit and an \"attached error message.\" This could indicate an \"Access\" issue, possibly due to permissions, but there\u2019s no explicit mention. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" because the inability to submit might stem from not having access to the submission system. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and prepare a JSON-like response for submission.**Formatting response**\n\nI\u2019m putting together the response and think it should just include the category in JSON format like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The guidelines indicate that we just need that value and don\u2019t have to provide a justification. It makes sense to keep it simple and direct. So, I\u2019ll output the final answer as {\"category\":\"Access\"} and ensure it\u2019s formatted correctly. No extra information is needed, just the category will do!"
