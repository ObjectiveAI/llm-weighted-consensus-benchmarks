The provided category options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nIt seems like they're asking for an access card for a new starter and contractor, along with some code changes related to storage. The term \"storage\" appears often, which could indicate it's a specific system name. I'm leaning towards categorizing this ticket as Access.**Parsing Ticket Requests**\n\nThe ticket appears to request an access provision (an access card) and a code change related to storage. This could likely fall under the \"Access\" category, but \"Administrative rights\" could also apply since they mentioned reassigning the card while keeping the same access.\n\nBreaking it down, the \"new starter access card\" clearly indicates Access, and \"contractor\" supports it as well. The mention of \"code change\" might imply Administrative rights. Given the context about storage, it could refer to a specific system, suggesting it's another factor in the decision.{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
