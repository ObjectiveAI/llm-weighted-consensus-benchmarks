There\u2019s a category for \u201cAccess\u201d that seems appropriate since they\u2019re asking for approval to complete tasks. However, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d also fits if it involves granting admin privileges. I need to choose between those two categories.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m examining the phrase \"access to pm,\" which likely refers to \"access to Project Management.\" The user is asking for help with approvals, suggesting they need permission for something. The available categories include \"Administrative rights,\" which relates to granting admin rights. Given that they want access for their daily tasks, the safest choice is \"Access,\" focusing on access permissions. Since they mention approvals, I\u2019ll stick with \"Access.\" I'll output this in the required JSON format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
