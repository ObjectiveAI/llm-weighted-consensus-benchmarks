The ticket seems to involve updating a table format, which could indeed pertain to an internal project since it's about formatting data. The message hints at legal liability tied to subsidiaries, but it\u2019s unclear. I think I should categorize it under \"Internal Project,\" as it relates to the internal data table, although \"Administrative rights\" might apply if it concerns user permissions.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI see there aren't any explicit access issues here. The \"update table format inputs\" seems more like a task related to an internal project rather than something miscellaneous, which is too broad. So, I need to respond with a JSON object in the specified format. The system specifies that I should output something like {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It looks like this is the right category based on the context. So, I'll confirm that and provide just the JSON as instructed: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
