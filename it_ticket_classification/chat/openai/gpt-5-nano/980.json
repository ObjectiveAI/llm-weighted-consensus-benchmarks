Given the content, it seems like the user wants to enable an admin account, suggesting it falls under either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019m trying to figure out which category fits best.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket content involves enabling an admin account and ensuring someone has the same level of privileges as other members. This definitely suggests the necessity for \"Administrative rights\" since many IT ticket systems have a specific category for that. \n\nAlthough \"template lead\" might indicate the user\u2019s role, the priority here is the admin account aspect. I'll categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" and format it according to JSON standards: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. It\u2019s important to ensure capitalization and spacing are exact as shown in the schema."
