There\u2019s quite a list of categories to consider: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. It seems important to ensure we place each ticket in the correct category for efficient handling. I should be sure to review the tickets carefully to make the best categorizations. Let's get this organized!**Analyzing connection issues**\n\nThe user provided a text filled with technical details indicating problems connecting to a server. It mentions errors related to server certificate verification, specifically a self-signed certificate. The logs suggest issues with establishing the connection and various error routines. It seems like they're experiencing repeated attempts to connect, followed by fatal errors and restarts. I should focus on identifying the key issues, which seem to revolve around certificate verification and connection stability. Let's see how to address this!**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking the best category for this issue is \"Access\" since it involves connectivity and certificate problems related to authentication. The user mentioned issues that directly link to access, which aligns well with the category options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. I also want to ensure the response is in the correct JSON format. So, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let\u2019s get this structured properly!"
