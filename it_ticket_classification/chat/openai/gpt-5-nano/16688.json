It seems to relate to network infrastructure, which likely falls under \"Hardware\" since patch panels are typically hardware components. \"Access\" could also be relevant, but it\u2019s unclear if they need permissions. I wonder if it could be considered an \"Internal Project\" since it involves wiring, but there's no specific internal project tag mentioned.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI need to classify an IT ticket into the right category. Given that it focuses on cabling, patch panels, and switches, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Hardware.\" It could fit as \"Internal Project\" since there\u2019s ongoing work, but the ticket seems more like a task involving IT operations. Since the user specifically asked for categorization, I\u2019ll output a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I feel like this aligns best with the details provided.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
