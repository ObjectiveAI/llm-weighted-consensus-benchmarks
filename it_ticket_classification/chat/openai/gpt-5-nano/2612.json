They mention \"pipeline code,\" \"add opportunity,\" and \"create pipeline code,\" suggesting this might relate to a CRM or sales pipeline. However, our category list does not include anything specific for CRM or Sales. The closest options might be \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The user's phrase, \"program me portfolio officer,\" adds some confusion. I'll need to think carefully about the best fit.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on categorizing the ticket regarding creating pipeline code. It seems related to \"Internal Project,\" as it\u2019s software development work. The text doesn't indicate hardware, HR support, or access, although access to pipeline code could be relevant. \"Administrative rights\" might be applicable if rights for creation are needed, but that isn't explicitly mentioned.\n\nI think \"Internal Project\" fits best, but \"Miscellaneous\" could work too if I'm unsure. I\u2019ll output the category in a JSON format as instructed, specifically: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
