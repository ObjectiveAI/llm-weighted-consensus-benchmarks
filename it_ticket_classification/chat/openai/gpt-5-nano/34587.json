The standard categories are limited here, so \"Hardware\" seems the most appropriate choice since they've tried resetting the phone and reconnecting it. Other categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"HR Support\" don't apply. So, \"Hardware\" looks like the best fit!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI think \"Hardware\" is the best fit for categorizing this IT ticket, based on the user's mention of a \"milky way phone\" that keeps showing \"service unavailable.\" However, I wonder if \"Access\" could apply since it relates to network service issues. They\u2019ve also mentioned trying to reconnect a cable, which suggests it could be a desk phone issue. Given the various hints, I'm leaning towards classifying it strictly as \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll output the category in a proper JSON format!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
