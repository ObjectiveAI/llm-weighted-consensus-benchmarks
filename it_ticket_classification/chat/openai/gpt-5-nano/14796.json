It seems related to onboarding, so I\u2019m thinking of categorizing it as either \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" While the ticket focuses on form filling, it also involves IT tasks like account creation and access provisioning. Given all this, it could fit into \"Access,\" \"HR Support,\" or even \"Internal Project.\" I need to decide the best category.**Determining the right category**\n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing the ticket as \"Access,\" since it's focused on providing access for a new starter. While \"HR Support\" fits because it involves onboarding, this is primarily an IT ticket. The mention of \"fill starter form\" suggests it's for access or employee details. In IT, onboarding tasks involve account provisioning and hardware setup, so \"Access\" makes the most sense given the context. I need to respond concisely using the category field as instructed.**Formatting the output**\n\nI need to ensure I respond in the specified format by delivering a JSON object with the \"category\" field set to one of the allowed values. Given the context, I\u2019m deciding on \"Access.\" The schema requires me to structure it as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. While I might want to include a brief justification, the instructions don't explicitly ask for one; they only require categorization. So, I\u2019m going to go ahead and deliver that JSON object now."
