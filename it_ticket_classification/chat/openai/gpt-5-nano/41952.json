I'll have to output a JSON-like object with the specific category. Since the issue clearly revolves around a drive not appearing, \"Storage\" seems like the most fitting category. It's explicitly mentioned in the taxonomy, so I'll respond with a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Clarifying JSON format**\n\nI need to follow the given format closely for categorizing the IT ticket. The instruction mentions to categorize and provides a schema. I understand that the schema outlines the structure and allowed values for the response. So, I should output a valid JSON object without the schema wrapper. The correct output for the category should look like: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. That's the value matching the schema, focusing on the actual data rather than the schema itself.**Outputting the category**\n\nThe instruction indicates that my output might need to be parsed by code, which means I should stick to a straightforward format. I\u2019ll output the minimal JSON object with the category set to \"Storage.\" It seems best to keep it simple, without adding any extra notes since the instruction specifies formatting in JSON only. So, the output will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. That seems clear and aligned with what\u2019s needed. Let\u2019s deliver that!"
