The ticket mentions a high importance request regarding enabling a Tuesday starter form. It sounds like it involves access for a new starter across multiple entities and subsidiaries, each possibly being a separate entity. Given the context, the most fitting category options are \"Access\" since it deals with access cards and new starter processes. Let\u2019s make sure to choose that option!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThis ticket seems focused on provisioning an access card for a new starter, so it fits into the \"Access\" category. It might also relate to \"HR Support\" since it involves onboarding, but \"Access\" is specified as a category in the options provided. I need to format my response as a JSON-like object. I'll produce the final output simply as {\"category\":\"Access\"} to match the required format. Let's make sure it adheres to their expectations!**Providing category object**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to provide a category object. Given the ticket relates to the new starter access card, it fits solidly into the \"Access\" category. I\u2019ll make sure to respond with just the necessary JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, without any extra text or confusion. The ticket's language is a bit jumbled, but there\u2019s no need to overanalyze it; I\u2019ll focus on the key point!"
