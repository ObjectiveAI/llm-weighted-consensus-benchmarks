The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nThe text mentions things like \"people manager notification,\" \"direct reports,\" and \"weekly submission,\" so it relates to HR. Since it involves aspects of notifying managers about leave and updating records, I think \"HR Support\" is the best choice. I'll prepare a JSON object that specifies this category.**Outputting JSON Category**\n\nI see the prompt requires me to create a JSON-like object with a \"category\" property from the specified options. The correct choice here is \"HR Support,\" and I need to ensure that the casing is just right to match what's allowed. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll make sure the output is exactly as specified, without any extra text. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll produce this valid JSON in the final channel."
