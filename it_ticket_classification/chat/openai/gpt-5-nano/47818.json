There\u2019s also a mention of a server error, which might fit under Access or possibly Miscellaneous. \n\nGiven the categories available, I think HR Support is the primary classification for job referral issues, and I\u2019ll note the server error under Access. I'll be preparing a JSON output for that.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI need to determine the best category for a ticket regarding a job referral platform, considering options like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the user is mentioning \"server error\" and \"web link available,\" there could be an IT access issue. However, the primary focus is on job referrals and related topics, which fits \"HR Support\" best. I\u2019ll prepare the response in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This category is indeed allowed.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to produce a JSON-like response that specifies the \"category\" property. The instructions clearly state to keep it structured with just the necessary elements. So, I\u2019ll prepare the output as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} without any additional text. It\u2019s straightforward, and I\u2019m making sure to adhere to the format properly! Let\u2019s just get it right!"
