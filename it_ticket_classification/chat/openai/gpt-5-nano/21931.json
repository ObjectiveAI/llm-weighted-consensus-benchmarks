The ticket mentions \"service now change view request,\" \"change view,\" and \"seeing profile,\" which could relate to either access or administrative rights. There are also references to a \"senior infrastructure engineer\" and \"mobile change,\" which may pertain to infrastructure changes. It looks like the best fits could be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" since it seems to involve requests for viewing or changing access rights.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the user's request to categorize an IT ticket, specifically related to \"service now change view request.\" The repeated phrases like \"change view\" and \"profile change view\" suggest it might involve access issues. There\u2019s no mention of hardware, storage, or HR, so those categories are out. While it could potentially be linked to an internal project, it seems to align best with \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it\u2019s about requesting permissions or elevated privileges.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe phrases \"change view\" and \"change view please\" suggest that the user may be requesting permission changes to view a profile, indicating access rights. I need to consider whether to categorize this as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" If it's a general access or permission request about changing a view in ServiceNow, it fits best under \"Access.\" However, if it were specifically asking for admin rights, that would fall under \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\"**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to follow the structure for the category JSON object based on the provided instructions. This means I should create a JSON object with a \"category\" field that matches one of the enumerated options. Since I'm categorizing the IT ticket as \"Access,\" I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s important that I adhere to the format exactly since the instructions specify to respond with the JSON only. So, I\u2019ll keep it simple and straightforward."
