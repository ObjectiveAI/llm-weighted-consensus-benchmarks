I\u2019m thinking this could fall under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" since it\u2019s about adding a user to a group.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI\u2019ve been considering the categories for this IT ticket, and while \"Internal Project\" isn\u2019t relevant, \"Administrative rights\" could apply if we're granting permissions. However, I\u2019ll stick with \"Access\" as the best fit. The prompt asks for a JSON object, so I\u2019ll provide it in the required format, ensuring it matches properly. I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"} as the response, focusing solely on delivering this JSON object. This keeps it straightforward and clear!"
