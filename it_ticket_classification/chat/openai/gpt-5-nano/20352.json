It fits best under the \"Hardware\" category, but it could also be seen as a \"Purchase\" if they're asking to buy RAM. However, the typical classification would lean toward \"Hardware\" since it's more about the upgrade. So I'm settling on categorizing it as Hardware.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to decide on the right category for the IT ticket and confirm that \"Hardware\" is the closest fit for the request to \"increase ram increase.\" I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object since that's the required format. The category must be precise, so I\u2019ll make sure the capitalization is correct. I\u2019m going to output it simply: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}` without any extra text, just as instructed. That should keep it concise and to the point!"
