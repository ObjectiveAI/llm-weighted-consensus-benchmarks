The phrase \u201clast recovery points created\u201d indicates it\u2019s about backups. There\u2019s an issue described as \u201ctemporarily unable to respond,\u201d which might relate to either \u201cStorage\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d Since it\u2019s an alert from the backup system, I\u2019d categorize it under \u201cStorage,\u201d given it focuses on recovery points and protection. However, the statement about the data source type is a bit unclear.**Finalizing category classification**\n\nThe phrase \"last recovery points created\" definitely relates to backup and restore processes, so I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Storage.\" The prompt indicates that I need to respond with a JSON object that includes a \"category\" field. \n\nI\u2019ll format it as: {\"category\": \"Storage\"} since that\u2019s a recognized value. That seems valid, and while I could consider \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" sticking with \"Storage\" feels right. I\u2019ll make sure to deliver it cleanly as a JSON object as required."
