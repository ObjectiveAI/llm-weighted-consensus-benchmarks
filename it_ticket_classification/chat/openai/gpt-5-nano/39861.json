The ticket mentions servers being down, which affects two teams and requires an urgent fix due to accessibility issues with the database and web server. Looking at the taxonomy, I think the best matches could be either \"Hardware\" due to the server outage or possibly \"Access\" since they can't currently reach the database or web server. However, it's not about user access rights; it's about a service outage.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nThis issue is clearly an outage. I think \"Hardware\" fits if the servers are down due to a hardware failure. The absence of an \"Infrastructure\" category makes it tricky. \"Internal Project\" isn't relevant, and \"Miscellaneous\" feels too vague. While it could also be categorized under \"Access\" because they can't reach the databases and web server, this isn't a permission issue; it's a service outage. I'll choose \"Hardware\", creating a JSON-like object with {\"category\": \"Hardware\"} to respond.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
