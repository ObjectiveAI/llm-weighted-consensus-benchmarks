It sounds like they\u2019re seeking help or direction for their problem. I\u2019ll need to decide how to best categorize this ticket based on their description.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe issue revolves around reports visibility and access to previous months' reports. It seems to focus on who can view these reports rather than hardware, storage, purchases, or internal projects. I'm considering whether to categorize this as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The request for help loading reports implies that the user needs assistance with permissions. Since it\u2019s mainly about who can see the reports, I lean towards the \"Access\" category for this ticket.**Identifying the ticket issue**\n\nThe ticket refers to a problem where the user can only see a subset of reports for the current month, hindering visibility for previous months. This points to an issue with access rather than storage or internal projects. I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"Access.\" I may need to format my response as a JSON object to match the category schema provided, with the category set to either \"Access\" or possibly \"Administrative rights,\" depending on whether it's a permissions issue.**Finalizing ticket response**\n\nThe user emphasizes the \"visibility\" of reports, indicating a permission issue rather than administrative rights. Based on the details, categorizing this ticket as \"Access\" seems best. I should provide a clear, concise response in the specified JSON format since the task focuses solely on categorization. I\u2019ll format it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThis ensures it's a valid JSON string without any extra content, meeting the request directly and efficiently!"
