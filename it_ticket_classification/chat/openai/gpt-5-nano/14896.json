It seems \"Access\" is more appropriate.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe text mentions terms like \"sonar access,\" \"rights,\" and \"assigned privileges,\" indicating multiple system accesses. It seems appropriate to categorize this ticket under \"Access\" since it primarily discusses access rights. However, I also see that it could fit \"Administrative rights\" if it involved admin-level privileges. Ultimately, since it focuses on rights and not necessarily admin rights, I\u2019ll go with \"Access.\" \n\nI\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
