This ticket doesn't seem related to hardware, storage, purchases, or admin rights, but it might involve adding a drop-down field that requires administrative privileges.\n\nIt looks like it's about \"leave options,\" likely wanting a drop-down list for vacation or leave types, possibly for an allocation specific to a certain date. So, it\u2019s probably an IT task to implement this drop-down selection in the internal system.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nAlright, this seems to be related to \"HR Support\" since it involves leave options within HR. The ticket is actually classified under IT, but I think labeling it as \"HR Support\" is the best fit. The user isn't requesting administrative rights, so we can skip that.\n\nI\u2019ll output a JSON object reflecting this category. Based on the required format, it should be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I'll just stick to this simplified response!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
