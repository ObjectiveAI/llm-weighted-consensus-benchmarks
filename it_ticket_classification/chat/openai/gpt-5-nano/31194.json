The text is a bit jumbled, mentioning a \"new starter\" and an \"administration officer,\" which suggests it's about new employee onboarding.\n\nFrom the provided categories like \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights,\" I think \"HR Support\" is the best fit here. So, I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Sounds good!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like the ticket is from an \"administration officer\" regarding a \"new starter\" and onboarding. They mention \"completed form\" and \"joining,\" which could indicate they're requesting access provisioning. \n\nConsidering the options, I think the appropriate categories could be \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" The mention of \"Bogota PM\" suggests it relates to a project. However, since onboarding usually falls under \"HR Support,\" I\u2019ll categorize it as such. That makes the most sense here!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nIn IT ticket categorizations, onboarding often includes tasks like \"Access,\" which involves creating user accounts and granting system access, and \"Administrative rights\" if admin permissions are needed. The phrase \"completed form joining\" indicates they filled out an onboarding form.\n\nConsidering the provided categories, I think \"Access\" fits best since it connects to \"new starter\" and onboarding forms. While \"HR Support\" is relevant, it\u2019s more about HR processes rather than IT. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" That seems appropriate!**Analyzing IT ticket text**\n\nI\u2019m breaking down the ticket text: \"new starter bogota pm re complete hi please find completed thank complete hi please help completed form joining thank administration officer.\"\n\nIt seems like an Administration Officer might be requesting assistance with completing an onboarding form for a new starter in Bogota PM. Since this typically involves setting up account access, \"Access\" appears to be the most suitable category. If they had mentioned admin rights, I might consider \"Administrative rights,\" but they didn\u2019t, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" I'll present it in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with the JSON format. The system requires output as a category object, structured as follows:\n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}\n\nSo, I\u2019m going to create an output with the key \"category\" set to \"Access,\" which fits the criteria. I\u2019ll return:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nSince the user asked for the categorization, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and just provide the category. That works perfectly!"
