The user mentioned an \"Oracle\" error related to submission issues. Since there's no \"Software\" category, \"Miscellaneous\" might fit better for the general issue. It could also relate to \"Access\" if it's a permission issue, or \"Administrative rights\" if related to submission authority. Overall, I'll pick between these three based on the context.**Categorizing IT issues**\n\nIt seems like the ticket is about a transaction submission problem, probably a software issue rather than hardware. Since there\u2019s no \"Software\" category, I should go with \"Miscellaneous\" as a general option. However, if the problem might be due to access restrictions, \"Access\" could be relevant too. The user\u2019s message doesn\u2019t mention login or permissions specifically, which nudges me toward \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll provide the category in the required JSON format.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
