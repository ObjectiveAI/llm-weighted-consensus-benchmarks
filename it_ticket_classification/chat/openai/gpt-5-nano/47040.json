The ticket mentions \"leaver tickets,\" access changes, and something about completing a leaver form, which points towards HR-related topics. Since it's about disabling access and end dates, it seems best categorized under Access. This makes sense because leaver tickets typically relate to access termination, so I'll go ahead and categorize it as Access.**Categorizing Ticket for Access**\n\nI'm noticing some terms like \"planning officer\" and \"administration officer,\" which hints at an internal project. However, the ticket's content focuses on \"leaver tickets not generated,\" \"set leaver data,\" and \"disable her,\" indicating it's all about terminating access for a leaver. So, I think the appropriate category is indeed \"Access.\" I need to output the category in JSON format without extra explanations. So, it\u2019ll look like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
