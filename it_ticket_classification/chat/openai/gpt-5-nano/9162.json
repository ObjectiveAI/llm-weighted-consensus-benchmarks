The ticket's content is about cycling event planning, which doesn\u2019t relate to IT hardware. It seems more aligned with administrative or project management tasks. Since it involves budgeting, contracts, and logistics, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. So, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and prepare the required JSON object."
