The main issue seems to be about being \"unable to view rejection reasons.\" Key terms like \"timecards,\" \"screens,\" and \"access\" suggest this might be related to an HR or IT access problem. Based on this, I think it could fit well under \"HR\" or \"Access\" tickets since it's about permissions or visibility of rejection information.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm working on categorizing the IT ticket based on the content provided. The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. Given that the user cannot view rejection reasons, it seems to be an access issue, suggesting the \"Access\" category fits well. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also work since it directly relates to viewing permissions. I need to choose one, so I could format it as {\"category\":\"Access\"}, though \"Administrative rights\" might be more precise for this situation.**Choosing the category**\n\nI'm tasked with selecting a category for the IT ticket based on the content. Since the issue involves being unable to view rejection reasons, it might indicate a permissions issue, making \"Access\" the best choice. I also considered \"HR Support\" because it's about HR-related matters, but since it's an IT ticket, \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" seems more fitting. Given the mention of \"timecards,\" I feel confident categorizing this under \"Access.\" Now, I need to format my response correctly as a JSON object, focusing on providing the category value.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
