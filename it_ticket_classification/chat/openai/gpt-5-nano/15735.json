The user's message is quite confusing, but it seems to be asking for the number of usable computer towers at different locations. Given that it's all about counting usable towers, it clearly falls into the \"Hardware\" category. I should prepare a response formatted like JSON to reflect this category accurately.**Providing category JSON**\n\nThe prompt outlines a category schema that requires outputting a JSON object with the category labeled as \"Hardware.\" Since the user specifically asked to categorize the IT ticket, I'll focus solely on that. The requirement is to provide a plain text JSON format, so I'll ensure the quotation marks are correct. The final output needs to be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI can also mention there shouldn't be any extra text, just this JSON representation. Let's proceed with that!"
