The ticket is messy but seems to concern maternity leave, action reports, and related HR processes. It's clear that this involves HR Support, especially with leave status and weekly reports. It doesn't relate to access, hardware, or purchases, so my conclusion is to categorize it as HR Support and format it as a JSON object.**Formatting the response**\n\nThey only require the category field? The prompt makes it clear that a \"Valid channels\" category object type is needed. I need to make sure my response is just the category: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.\n\nIt's important that the capitalization matches the allowed enumerations exactly as \"HR Support.\" So, I\u2019ll craft the final answer as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll keep it simple, without any extra text."
