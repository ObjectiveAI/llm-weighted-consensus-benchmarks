The ticket mentions issues with a client's pipeline showing the wrong data. \n\nIt seems to relate to a problem with pipeline data due to the client, so I'll likely categorize it under \"Miscellaneous\" or perhaps \"Access.\" I'll make sure to clarify as needed!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm working on categorizing an IT ticket, and it could fit into several categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Storage.\" Since it discusses a pipeline showing incorrect data and requests adjustments, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit due to its focus on internal processes. There's also an approval mentioned from a director. \n\nI\u2019ll format my response as JSON with the category as \"Internal Project\": {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.
