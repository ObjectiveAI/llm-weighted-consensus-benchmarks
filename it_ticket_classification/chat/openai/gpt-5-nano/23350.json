The text seems jumbled but focuses on survey invites, feedback impact, and submission reminders. It mentions important terms like \u201csurvey invites,\u201d \u201csession expires,\u201d and \u201cassessment.\u201d Given the context, it feels like it should fall under \"Miscellaneous,\" as it doesn\u2019t fit neatly into any specific category.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT ticket. It might fit under \"Access,\" but it doesn't seem to be about access credentials. It feels more like \"Miscellaneous\" since the focus is on survey invites and feedback processes. It might be \"Internal Project\" if it relates to a survey system project, but it primarily discusses amending survey scheduling and closure for feedback. \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t apply here either, as it\u2019s not about permissions. Given all this, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the best fit.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to provide a JSON output with the category classification. The text mentions \"survey invites,\" \"feedback,\" and notifications, suggesting it might relate to a survey tool. This could align with \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s about improving that system. However, since there isn\u2019t a clear action request, it might also fit under \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll decide which category best matches before finalizing my output.**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding how to categorize this ticket, and since there\u2019s ambiguity, I could go with \"Miscellaneous\" just to be safe. However, \"Internal Project\" feels more specific, especially if the ticket is about improving survey invites scheduling. The user hasn\u2019t specified a software or system, so I lean toward \"Internal Project\" as it aligns with tasks for the internal survey project. The text suggests modifications to the survey process, confirming that it\u2019s likely an internal workflow change. So, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit.**Finalizing JSON Output**\n\nIt looks like \"Internal Project\" is the right choice for this ticket category. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object, making sure it looks like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. While I could provide a brief justification, the instructions only ask for the category, so I\u2019ll stick to just the JSON output. Here it goes:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}  \n\nOkay, I\u2019m all set!"
