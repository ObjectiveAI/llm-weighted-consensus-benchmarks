Since it aligns more with HR issues, I\u2019ll categorize it under \"HR Support\" and prepare to return that as JSON.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to create a JSON object with a \"category\" key based on the instructions provided. The user\u2019s request was clear: they want to categorize an IT ticket, specifically under \"HR Support.\" So, I\u2019ll respond with the required format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} without any extra content.
