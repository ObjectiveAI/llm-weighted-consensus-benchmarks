It seems to be an access issue, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\". I want to make sure I stick to the given list of categories, which does include \"Access\". Thus, I'll return the following JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll keep it straightforward since that's what the instruction requires!**Adhering to category requirements**\n\nI need to stick strictly to the required category enum for the IT ticket. \"Access\" is indeed a valid category, so I'll format my response accordingly. I\u2019ll return it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's essential to make sure it\u2019s valid JSON with the correct quotes and structure. No extra text is needed here; just the concise category response is perfect for clarity!"
