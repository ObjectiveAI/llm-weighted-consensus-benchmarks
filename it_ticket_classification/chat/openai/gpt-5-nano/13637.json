Given the context, I think \"Hardware\" makes the most sense, since they're asking for a cable. However, it could also fit under \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Still, \u201cHardware\u201d seems like the best choice here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like the user is asking for cables, which clearly fall under the \"Hardware\" category. They mentioned \"chord needed Wednesday,\" which I believe is supposed to be \"cord needed Wednesday\" for IT equipment. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware\" since cables like power or HDMI are what they need. The response should be formatted as a JSON object. I'll output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to match the schema. Let's make sure it\u2019s properly formatted with quotes too!"
