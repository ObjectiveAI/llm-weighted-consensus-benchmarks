The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket text sounds quite garbled, but it mentions \"log installation,\" an \"order number,\" \"PC,\" and \"engineer,\" which leads me to think it's likely a request regarding hardware installation. If it's about PC installation, Hardware seems like the right category. If it's about permissions, then Administrative rights might apply, but Access could fit for login issues too.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe language in the IT ticket seems to indicate an installation by an administrator, mentioning \"order number,\" \"PC type,\" and \"engineer.\" It may suggest it's related to an installation request, which is hardware-related. My conclusion is that it fits best under the Hardware category. I\u2019m going to respond with just the required JSON format, which should look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} since that's what the prompt expects, without any extra text."
