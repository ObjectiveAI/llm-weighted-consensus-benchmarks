The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The content primarily discusses backups, root cause analysis, and performance issues, so I think \"Storage\" is the best fit due to the focus on backup storage. While \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" are mentioned, the core issue remains centered around backups and storage.**Outputting category JSON**\n\nIt looks like \"Storage\" is indeed the most fitting category. I need to format my response as a JSON object with the category field set to \"Storage.\" The user's prompt simply asks to categorize the IT ticket, so I'll keep it straightforward. The required format is just the category itself. Therefore, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} and make sure there are no extra explanations. Just the clean JSON object is needed!"
