It includes details about requesting hardware like desktops, laptops, and monitors for the Cambridge edition. Since it focuses on equipment procurement, the most fitting category would be \"Hardware.\" However, the emphasis on the approval issue complicates things a bit.**Categorizing Messy IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket appears quite messy, with multiple phrases and details to consider. The available categories include Access, Administrative Rights, Internal Project, Miscellaneous, Purchase, Storage, HR Support, and Hardware. Since the ticket mentions equipment requirements, it seems like it could fit under \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" However, there are access requests too, which complicates things. Given the ticket's focus on hardware and approval processes, I think \"Hardware\" may be the best fit, despite the mixed aspects.**Clarifying Ticket Categories**\n\nI'm looking at the category \"Administrative Rights,\" which seems unusual for this ticket. Typically, \"Access\" pertains to system or account access, while \"Administrative Rights\" is for elevated privileges. The text mentions \"editorial accounts\" and \"remote access,\" pointing to access-related issues. However, the main focus appears to be on approval routing, especially since the ticket discusses procurement of equipment. So, to follow instructions, I should respond with a JSON object. The best categories are either \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware,\" but \"Purchase\" fits best.**Categorizing Equipment Request**\n\nThe content of this ticket includes an approval request for various equipment needed for Cambridge, such as desktops, laptops, monitors, keyboards, and more. This clearly indicates a hardware equipment request related to staff setup. The mention of \"approval request\" and \"view approval request link\" aligns with a typical purchase workflow. While it could fit under \"Hardware,\" the best category for this ticket is \"Purchase,\" as it specifically involves item approval and procurement. So, I'm deciding on \"Purchase\" as the final choice.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
