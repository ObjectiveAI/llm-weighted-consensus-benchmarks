However, I could also consider \"Access\" if the issue pertains to accessing MS Word. I'll format my response as a JSON object with the selected category clearly identified.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nThe user is asking me to raise a ticket, and based on their notes, \"Miscellaneous\" is the most fitting category since there's no mention of hardware or administrative rights. I need to format my response as a JSON snippet according to the provided schema. The correct output will be `{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}` without including any extra text or notes. I want to keep it clear and concise for efficiency."
