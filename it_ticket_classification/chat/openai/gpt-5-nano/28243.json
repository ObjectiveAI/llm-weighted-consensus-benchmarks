The ticket mentions project management software features like boards, sprints, and configuration requests. It might fit best under \"Internal Project,\" but there's also a possibility for \"Administrative rights\" considering the mentions of a board owner and deleting boards. \"Access\" is another option due to permissions issues. It's a bit tricky!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket is related to internal project management, making \"Internal Project\" the most suitable category. However, it might also fall under \"Administrative rights\" if the user is asking for permissions to configure or delete boards. The ticket mentions various aspects like a new project, configuring, deleting boards, and more. So I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll respond with just the JSON object for clarity: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. No extra text is necessary!"
