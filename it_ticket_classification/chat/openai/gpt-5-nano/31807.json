The user seems to be asking for the creation of subfolders in a storage location. Their phrasing about \"access to storage\" is explicit but tricky to parse. I think I'll choose \"Storage\" as the primary category since that directly relates to their request about photos. The JSON output should simply confirm that choice without extra text. So it will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}**Formatting category response**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the instruction to provide an answer in category format. The valid output is supposed to be a JSON object, specifically with a \"category\" key that matches one of the permitted strings. In this case, I\u2019ll select \"Storage\" as it fits the context. \n\nSo, the final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no additional content and just keep it concise and clear."
