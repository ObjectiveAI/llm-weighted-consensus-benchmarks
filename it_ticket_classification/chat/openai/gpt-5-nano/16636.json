Given the context, I think \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply, the frequent mention of purchase terms leads me firmly toward \"Purchase.\" I'll format the output as a JSON object.**Delivering the category object**\n\nThe instructions clearly state that I should respond with a category object. So, I\u2019ll output it as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I want to make sure I'm quoting \"Purchase\" exactly to match the allowed values. It's important to avoid any extra commentary and just deliver the JSON. The prompt specifies to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" so I\u2019ll keep it straight to the point and provide the necessary answer."
