They also mention needing a tool to work starting next week, but it's not entirely clear. \n\nSo, I'll classify this ticket under \"Hardware\" in JSON format, as it's the most fitting category based on the context provided.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe main issue is that the meeting room system isn't working, which clearly falls under the \"Hardware\" category. While there are mentions of \"debugging\" and \"tests setup,\" they seem to relate more to this hardware problem. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\"\n\nI need to make sure the JSON format is correct, so I\u2019ll output it as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Now, let\u2019s deliver that information!"
