I should classify it as \"Administrative rights\" since it relates to tasks and managing requests regarding colleagues. \n\nI need to ensure I capture the main focus of this chaotic message well in the category selection.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe text appears to relate to internal project communication regarding a code task, including details about a table and dates. While \"Administrative rights\" could seem relevant, it\u2019s not explicitly about access permissions. Phrases like \"submitted,\" \"date code task,\" and \"agile manager\" suggest it\u2019s tied more to project management. \n\nGiven that there's a specific \"Internal Project\" category, I think that fits best based on the context of handling an internal project task. I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\"**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to craft a response in JSON format that matches the required schema for this IT ticket categorization. The instructions indicate I should include a property for the category, with options like \"Internal Project.\" \n\nEven though it feels like sometimes just the category string is expected, I should proceed with the full JSON object, as it aligns with past tasks. The ticket's context clearly relates to task management, so I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" I'll ensure the proper formatting for the final response too."
