The ticket includes some mixed-up text but clearly states that the search isn\u2019t working for them. However, it seems to work on a different machine with the same options. This suggests the problem may be machine-specific. I\u2019ll make sure to highlight both the working and non-working aspects for clarity.**Categorizing Oracle Fusion issue**\n\nThere's a problem with the Oracle Fusion project search not returning results in some scenarios. It might relate to access or search function issues. The available categories include \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the ticket describes an application issue with Oracle Fusion and indicates the search works on some machines, it\u2019s likely related to access permissions. Given the context, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project,\" which seems appropriate for internal system issues.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering the \"Internal Project\" category for this ticket since it relates to the Oracle Fusion project search used internally. \"Access\" could also be appropriate because some results may not show due to permission issues. However, since the user specifically asked for categorization, it seems best to settle on \"Internal Project.\" I'll output a JSON object with the selected category, which should look like: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Including a brief justification could be helpful, but the instructions suggest I focus mainly on the categorized JSON.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
