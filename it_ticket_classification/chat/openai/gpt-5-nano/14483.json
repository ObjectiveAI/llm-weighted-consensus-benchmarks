It mentions an old device return, which makes me think it could fit into categories like Hardware, Purchase, or even Administrative rights. Since this ticket involves the return of an old device and a new phone, it seems to mostly revolve around Hardware. I need to categorize it accordingly based on these clues!**Selecting IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the user\u2019s message, which includes phrases like \"old device,\" \"device installed,\" and \"swap required,\" suggesting a focus on hardware like a Samsung Galaxy phone. While terms like \"logs,\" \"receipts,\" and \"order number\" are present, they don\u2019t shift the main focus from Hardware. Although \"Internal Project\" and \"Purchases\" might come to mind, the essence of this ticket revolves around hardware swaps and returns, leading me to categorize it as Hardware."
