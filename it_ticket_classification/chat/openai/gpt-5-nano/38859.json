The ticket text is pretty garbled, but it seems to relate to someone trying to submit a \u201cleaver\u201d form but facing issues. It could fall under Access for submission problems, Administrative rights, or even Internal Project, considering the context of the form. There\u2019s definitely confusion to untangle here!**Classifying IT ticket categories**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket based on provided options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The content relates to \"leaver\" forms, planning processes, and mailbox issues. It sounds like someone is trying to submit a leaver form but can't, which could involve HR procedures or Access issues, possibly related to Administrative rights. The user's request for help suggests this is indeed an IT ticket about submitting the leaver form.**Identifying IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a technical issue related to a user who can\u2019t submit a \"leaver\" form, which touches on Access since it involves system permissions. I\u2019m considering categorizing it either under Access or HR Support. The ticket seems to lean toward HR Support because it\u2019s about the leaver form submission, but there are significant access implications as well. Since both categories fit to some degree, I need to choose the most appropriate one.**Choosing the category for the ticket**\n\nI\u2019m leaning toward categorizing this ticket as \"Access\" because it's about the inability to submit a form, likely linked to permissions. While \"Administrative rights\" might also apply, it's a separate category, and typically, access issues pertain more to system entry. The mention of \"environment\" might indicate problems related to upcoming restrictions. Overall, given the chaotic nature of the ticket and the repeated references, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" as the best fit.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
