It mentions phrases like \"new project request,\" \"please create,\" and \"registered under number.\" This signals it could be related to an \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, I'm also considering \"Access\" because of the mention of subsidiaries as separate entities. It's tricky since the information seems inconsistent, so I\u2019ll need to analyze it closely to determine the best fit.**Mapping IT ticket categories**\n\nI'm looking at the categories for mapping the IT ticket. The options include types like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and Administrative rights, among others. Since the text references a \"new project request,\" the best choice seems to be \"Internal Project.\" This aligns well with content about subsidiaries too. I need to provide a JSON object with the category set to \"Internal Project,\" following the schema provided, like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Keeping it concise is key!**Responding with JSON format**\n\nI need to output a JSON object containing the category without any extra explanation. Since the instruction specifies that the response format should be strictly a category object, I\u2019ll make sure to keep it clean and straightforward. It's essential to stick to the format, so I\u2019ll provide only the JSON object. Here we go!"
