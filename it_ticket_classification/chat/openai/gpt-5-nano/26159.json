The user described various map issues and training sessions, mentioning access rights and administrative tasks. The ticket seems to fit best under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" due to mentions of providing rights and scheduling training. It sounds like it's related to configuration tasks for a mapping tool, indicating access control involvement.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing system categories like \"Administrative rights,\" which is for granting permissions; \"Access\" for access-related issues; \"Internal Project\" for specific internal tasks; and \"Miscellaneous\" for anything else. The ticket discusses cartography in an HR management system and includes terms related to portfolio officers. It emphasizes requests for rights and scheduling training, indicating administrative needs. Given the context, \"Administrative rights\" best fits because it pertains to rights assignment. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Administrative rights.\"**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that follows the system's category schema. The instruction specifies the format should be:  \n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}\n\nSo, I\u2019ll ensure my output strictly includes just the category within that format. I want to produce:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}  \n\nThat matches exactly and adheres to the required structure. I\u2019ll keep it concise."
