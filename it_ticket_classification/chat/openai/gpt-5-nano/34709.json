The ticket mentions an Oracle issue related to entry approvals, specifically annual leave that\u2019s awaiting approval. It seems clear that this falls under HR-related concerns since it deals with leave approvals and checking statuses. I\u2019ll aim to classify it as \"HR Support\" because of its focus on leave management within the Oracle system. Let's see how I can confirm this categorization.**Categorizing as HR Support**\n\nThe ticket needs to be categorized, and based on its content, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit. It deals with entry approvals for annual leave within the Oracle system, so that aligns well with HR processes. While \"Access\" might be considered due to mentions of blocked entries, there's no indication of login issues. \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback, but I'd stick with \"HR Support\" as the most relevant option. So, I'll respond with the JSON category format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
