The content mentions \"epic link,\" \"story bugs,\" and \"reports,\" which points towards project management within software development. I'm noticing that it doesn't fit into categories like Hardware, HR Support, or Access. It might make sense to classify it as \"Internal Project,\" since it's centered on managing internal project tasks. \"Miscellaneous\" is another option, but \"Internal Project\" seems more fitting.**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nI think \"Internal Project\" is the most appropriate category for this ticket because it's centered around the epic link in an internal project management context. While \"Administrative rights\" may seem relevant, it's more about permissions and doesn't fully capture the essence of the ticket. So, my task now is to format my final response as a JSON object with the category set to \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll provide only the necessary JSON without any extra explanation."
