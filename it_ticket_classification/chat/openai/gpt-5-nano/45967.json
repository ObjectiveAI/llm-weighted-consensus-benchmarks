The ticket text mentions that a laptop has been crashing and has been slow for weeks, indicating a likely hardware issue. From the predefined list, I should assign it to the \"Hardware\" category. \n\nNext, I\u2019ll format the classification in a JSON object with the selected category. So, it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That will help keep things organized!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket content, which strongly indicates a laptop crash and slow performance, suggesting a hardware issue. The mention of \"laptop crashed\" points toward a hardware failure. It seems \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate category based on the options given, despite considering \"Storage\" too, in case it's related to the hard drive. The final decision is to use \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll prepare the response as a valid JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} and ensure it has no extra spaces."
