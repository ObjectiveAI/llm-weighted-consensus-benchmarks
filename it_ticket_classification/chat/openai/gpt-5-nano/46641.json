The user describes challenges logging into a program and mentions needing it for work over the weekend. Given the details, it seems like this falls under \"Access\" because it relates to login credentials and connection problems. It doesn\u2019t quite fit \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" so \"Access\" is my best guess for categorization. Let\u2019s output it in JSON format!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned they need the application to work over the weekend but encountered an error when logging in. They said they received a \"connection successful\" message but still faced issues connecting. This suggests that the problem relates to accessing the application. \n\nGiven the available categories, \"Access\" seems the most appropriate. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the property \"category\" set to \"Access\" to meet the specified requirements.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with just the category for the IT ticket, which I\u2019ve determined to be \"Access.\" The schema specifies that the output should only include the category property without any additional justification or text. So, I\u2019ll format my response properly as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure everything is correct so the JSON meets the expected formatting guidelines."
