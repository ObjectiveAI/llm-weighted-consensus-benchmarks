The categories include \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Access.\" Based on the hints, I'll classify this under \"HR Support\" for a new starter. So, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nI'm processing a request to categorize an IT ticket. The likely options seem to be \"Access,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Administrative rights,\" as it's about a new starter needing system access or IT provisioning. Given that the ticket hints at onboarding in Belgrade and mentions attachments, I think \"HR Support\" makes sense for onboarding. But typically, for IT tickets, \"Access\" fits better for system access requests. So, I should opt for \"Access\" as the most appropriate category here.**Finalizing Category Choice**\n\nI'm deciding to categorize the ticket as \"Access,\" since it deals with enabling a new user. While \"Administrative rights\" could be more specific, there's no explicit mention of rights being requested. The term \"new starter\" suggests it's about onboarding and providing account access. So, I\u2019ll stick with \"Access\" and provide the output in the required JSON format. I\u2019ll return: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra commentary to keep it clear and concise. Let\u2019s go with that!"
