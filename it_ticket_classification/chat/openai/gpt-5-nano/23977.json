The ticket mentions terms like \"split into two partitions\" and \"separate hard drive,\" indicating it's related to hardware and storage. The most fitting categories would be \"Storage\" or \"Hardware,\" but since it's specifically about logical disk partitions, I think the best choice is \"Storage.\" It doesn't seem to involve internal projects or administrative rights directly.**Formatting response as JSON**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object for categorizing an IT ticket. The required format specifies using a \"category\" field and the accepted values such as \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and others. Although I wonder if I should include an explanation, the instructions clearly state to categorize the ticket. It\u2019s best to stick to the requirement: I\u2019ll output just the JSON object with the category. So, I\u2019ll provide: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. That's the right approach!**Identifying category from ticket**\n\nThe ticket states, \"split into two partitions,\" which clearly implies it's about partitioning a hard drive. Although it mentions \"Wednesday December pm,\" that's not essential for categorization. Given that this task is related to storage, I\u2019ll assign it to the \"Storage\" category. Now, it's time to format my response correctly in JSON, and I\u2019m ready to provide that: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. Sounds like a solid plan!"
