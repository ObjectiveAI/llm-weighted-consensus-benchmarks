The mentions of \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"attached form\" suggest this is related to onboarding. It could fit under \"HR Support\" since it involves a new employee's paperwork. However, it might also touch on \"Access\" if it pertains to permissions or access rights. But given the context, \"HR Support\" sounds like the most appropriate category for this ticket.**Formulating JSON output**\n\nI\u2019m considering if the ticket might be categorized under \"Access,\" but it seems more focused on the onboarding process with the attached form. The reference to \"zone\" is unclear, but it leans more towards an HR context. So, I\u2019m deciding on \"HR Support\" as the category. Now, I need to format this into a JSON-like structure. I\u2019ll ensure proper syntax with the right keys and values, so it clearly reflects the category \"HR Support.\" Let's get to crafting that JSON!**Preparing JSON example**\n\nI realize I need to provide an example in addition to the proper JSON structure with the category. While the usual approach is to just give the category JSON, it looks like the required format specifies a schema-like structure. So I\u2019ll make sure to output the type and properties correctly but also include \"HR Support\" as the value. Let\u2019s ensure I include everything needed in the right format, so it aligns with the instructions!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
