The user's message seems to request a \"new pass\" or maybe \"new access,\" mentioning \"rights\" and \"pm.\" It looks like they need urgent assistance for changes related to a forecast. So, I'm thinking the best categories to use here are \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" as it seems they want rights or access related to a user.**Categorizing IT ticket request**\n\nThe request mentions \"please give pm rights\" and is marked urgent, with \"error\" included at the end. This suggests it's an IT ticket about access permissions. I see options like \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" as potential categories. Since the ticket discusses granting access, I'll go with \"Access\" to keep it safe. However, if it's about privileged access, \"Administrative rights\" could also be valid. I need to respond with a JSON object containing the chosen category. \n\n{\"category\": \"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
