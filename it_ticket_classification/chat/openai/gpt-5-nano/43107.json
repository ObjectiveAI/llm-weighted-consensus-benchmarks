They also mentioned keyboard and mouse issues and traveling with a wireless mouse. It seems that the main category could be \"Hardware,\" but considering the request for ordering, \"Purchase\" also makes sense.**Selecting IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking to categorize a ticket about ordering a laptop and some hardware issues. The user has problems with their keyboard and mouse, and they want a solution for a wireless mouse while traveling. The categories to choose from include Hardware, Purchase, Internal Project, and others. Since the ticket primarily discusses hardware issues, I think \"Hardware\" is a suitable choice. However, \"Purchase\" could also fit due to the request for ordering a laptop. So, it\u2019s a bit tricky!**Categorizing IT ticket request**\n\nThe ticket primarily asks about the process for ordering a laptop and mentions ongoing issues with the keyboard and mouse. I need to pick the best category from options like Hardware and Purchase. Since it\u2019s mostly about hardware problems, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware,\" as they seek solutions related to their laptop peripherals, including a wireless mouse for travel. Now, I\u2019ll format this in a concise JSON structure, focusing on the \"Hardware\" category specifically.**Outputting category JSON**\n\nI\u2019m working on a JSON object that includes a category string from the provided enumerated values. The instructions clearly require me to output in a specific format. So, I understand I need to return something like `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`.\n\nHowever, the expected structure must fit a schema, including fields like \"type\" and \"properties.\" I need to ensure the output conforms to that schema but also fills in the actual selected category. It seems important to combine both aspects properly!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
