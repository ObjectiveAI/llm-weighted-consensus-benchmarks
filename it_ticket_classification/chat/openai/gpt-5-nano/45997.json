I\u2019ll parse and analyze the details to make the most appropriate categorization for the user.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the options for categorizing the ticket: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the focus on attendance and payroll processes, \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category. I'll return this as a JSON object with the required format, specifically: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I need to ensure there's no additional text, just the category in the exact format requested.
