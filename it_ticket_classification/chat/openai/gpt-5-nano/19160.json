It mentions \"internal tool,\" \"Active Directory server information,\" \"integration,\" and \"certificate needed.\" I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" since Active Directory connects to authentication. However, it could also be \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or even \"Miscellaneous.\" I should carefully choose the category that best fits the content of the ticket from the list available for triaging.**Evaluating ticket categories**\n\nThe user seems to be looking to integrate an internal tool with Active Directory and is asking for server information and possibly a required certificate. The options for categorizing this ticket include \"Administrative rights,\" which relates to access tasks, or \"Internal Project,\" since it involves integrating a tool. \"Access\" could work because it ties into authentication, but it doesn't seem to be about login issues. Given the focus on integration, \"Internal Project\" might indeed be the most fitting category.**Formatting ticket response**\n\nThe text suggests the user is working on an internal tool and wants to integrate it, which fits the \"Internal Project\" category. I need to respond using a specific JSON format. The output requires a JSON object with a category field set to a string from the allowed categories. So, my response should simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI just need to ensure there\u2019s no extra text; I'm sticking to that format as instructed. Let\u2019s finalize it!"
