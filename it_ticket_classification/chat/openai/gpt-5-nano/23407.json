They're asking for help with permissions or changes regarding these employees. I'm considering what \"cc\" might mean; it could refer to a variety of things. Overall, the best fit seems to be the \"Access\" category, since it relates to permissions and employee investigation.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket, particularly focusing on the phrase about \"performed change permissions,\" which hints at either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since the user explicitly mentions changing permissions, that leans more towards \"Administrative rights\" because it deals with granting or altering admin privileges. While there are other factors like \"oracle friday pm\" and \"two employees,\" I think the central task here is about permissions. So, I'll confidently categorize this as \"Administrative rights.\"**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI'm considering the user's inquiry about investigating access for two employees, but since \"change permissions\" is explicitly mentioned, I believe \"Administrative rights\" is the right category. I need to format this in JSON per the required schema, which specifies that the category should be a string from a given list. So, I\u2019ll provide just the JSON object with the category value set to \"Administrative rights.\" Let's keep it clean and simple. Here goes:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
