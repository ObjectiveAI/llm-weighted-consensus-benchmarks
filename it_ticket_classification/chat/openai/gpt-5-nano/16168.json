It seems to relate to updates, possibly about changes to employment type. \u201cHourly\u201d is mentioned several times, making me think it\u2019s an HR issue. There\u2019s a slight chance it could relate to \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d if it involves access rights. Overall, it seems like the ticket is focused on updates regarding employment type changes.**Interpreting employment changes**\n\nThe phrase \"starting type employment hourly\" sounds like it might indicate a change from salaried to hourly employment. It seems there\u2019s a request for updates related to this change, along with a note about \"thank lead.\" I really need to categorize this ticket properly. Given that it's focusing on employment type, it relates to HR support rather than IT. While \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could apply if it involved access, it doesn\u2019t seem to fit here.**Categorizing employment updates**\n\nThe text mentions \"updates to be made\" and \"starting type employment hourly,\" which suggests that it\u2019s about updating an employment type in a system. I\u2019m wondering if \"paternal se va\" refers to a boss leaving, but that's a bit unclear. It seems more like an HR admin task, rather than IT-related. Since it\u2019s an IT ticket, I\u2019ll categorize this under HR Support. So, my output should be a JSON-like category object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
