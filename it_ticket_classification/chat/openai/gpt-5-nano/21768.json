Let's clarify which category fits best based on the context I find!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a ticket that seems related to Microsoft Surface PCs on a domain. It mentions needing a step-by-step guide and assistance with Surface devices. The phrases suggest issues with domain membership and supported versions. There are references to hardware, remote access, and printers, making me think it fits best under \"Access.\" However, that category typically relates more to login issues or permissions, so I need to choose the most accurate classification.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mainly discusses Surface devices and mentions \"step by step guide\" and \"purchase requisition platform.\" Since the focus is on hardware (specifically Surface PCs), the \"Hardware\" category feels most appropriate. I want to provide a JSON-like object, so the format will be a single object with the category as \"Hardware.\" Although there is also mention of the \"purchase requisition platform,\" I think it\u2019s best to categorize it primarily under hardware. Let's prepare the final response:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
