It mentions deadlines, site owners, and decommissioned sites, which makes me think it fits into \"Internal Project\" since it's about managing a migration project. However, if it touches on access issues, \"Administrative rights\" might also apply. There's a note about archiving files, so \"Storage\" could be relevant. But ultimately, \"Internal Project\" seems the most fitting category overall.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nYes, I\u2019ve decided to categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll respond in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It feels like the right choice based on the content. Since the user asked to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" it seems clear that they just want the category output. I guess asking for clarification isn\u2019t necessary right now. So, I'll go ahead and produce that JSON response!"
