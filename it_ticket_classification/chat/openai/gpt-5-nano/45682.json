Asking for clarification, like \"Which floor?\" could be helpful, but since the user's instruction was clear, I\u2019ll go with my original choice. \n\nThe expected output needs to follow the JSON-like structure with the \"category\" key. I\u2019ll respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}**Finalizing response format**\n\nWhile I could ask clarifying questions to be more helpful, the user specifically requested that I categorize the issue, which means I should keep it straightforward. Following the instruction to maintain minimal formatting, I need to ensure that the output is a plain text JSON string. So, I\u2019ll be sure to respond clearly and correctly with the chosen category. Let\u2019s go ahead and finalize that response!"
