It seems to fit best under the \"Hardware\" category since it involves decommissioning a router. However, it might fit as \"Internal Project\" if part of a bigger change initiative.**Deciding on category**\n\nI need to select the most fitting category for this IT ticket. \"Hardware\" seems right since it's about decommissioning a router, which relates to network hardware. Although \"Access\" could relate to monitoring poll status, it doesn't fit access rights. I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" \n\nNow, I must respond in JSON format as instructed:  \n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"} \n\nI\u2019ll keep this concise without extra explanations, just delivering the necessary information."
