So, I'll classify it as \"Access\" and make sure to format the output in the specified JSON schema.**Formatting response correctly**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object indicating the category for the IT ticket. The correct format is simply to state: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. However, I notice there's a specific JSON schema that must be followed, which includes a structure for the category field. According to this schema, the expected output should properly align with the provided instructions. \n\nIn this case, I\u2019ll stick to the simple response format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, eliminating any extra text.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best option for categorizing this IT ticket. It clearly mentions \"access card for the new cleaning,\" leading me to conclude that \"Access\" is indeed the right choice. \"Internal Project\" and \"Administrative rights\" don\u2019t fit here. While \"Membership/keycard\" could be relevant, it isn't in the provided list. So the response will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra punctuation and just present the JSON as required."
