The relevant categories might be \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" However, since it revolves around annual leave, I think the best fit would be \"HR Support.\" It doesn\u2019t seem to be a technical IT issue, but there might be confusion with the mention of \"Fusion.\"**Determining the IT ticket category**\n\nIt seems the user is asking about categorizing an IT ticket, possibly related to \"Fusion,\" which could be an application. The content refers to \"two days annual leave\" and updating leave details, suggesting it fits into \"HR Support.\" If it's not about software or an \"Internal Project,\" \"HR Support\" is definitely the right choice. I need to format my response as a JSON-like object with the category property to clearly indicate \"HR Support.\"{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
