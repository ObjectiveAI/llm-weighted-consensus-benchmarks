It seems to describe issues with using documents, like being able to enter a folder and open files, but facing troubles with disabled links and unsupported workbooks. This resembles an IT issue related to access or permissions. Given the context, it seems fitting to categorize it under \"Access\" as it highlights problems accessing certain features and external links.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize the ticket as \"Administrative rights\" due to disabled features, but it seems more likely to fit under \"Access.\" The user mentions not being able to use links or external workbooks and having certain features disabled. Since it relates to permissions and accessing documents, \"Access\" appears to be the best choice. I\u2019ll finalize by returning a JSON object with the category as \u201cAccess,\u201d which aligns with the issues described.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nThe prompt is asking me to categorize the IT ticket and shows a schema with a category field. The expected response is a JSON object, specifically like `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. The schema indicates it's a string, and I should match the format exactly. I\u2019ll ensure to use \"Access\" with a capital A to stay aligned with the enumeration. The final output should be concise, providing just that JSON response without extra explanations."
