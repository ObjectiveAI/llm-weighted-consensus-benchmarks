The user's message highlights issues with pages not loading and mentions certificates. It seems like a web access issue, so I\u2019m leaning towards the \"Access\" category. However, there\u2019s a chance it might fit under \"Administrative rights\" due to the certificate mention. Overall, \"Access\" seems like the most appropriate choice for this ticket.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nIt's clear that the issue isn't related to hardware, HR, storage, or purchases, nor does it fall under internal projects or specific admin rights. It might fit in \"Miscellaneous\" if it's unclear. However, the \"Access\" category seems most suitable because of the user\u2019s comments about web pages not loading and potential certificate issues. Even though a \"senior manager\" is mentioned, that doesn't change the category choice. I need to prepare a JSON response with the selected category as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
