The phrases in the message suggest it's related to changing an approver, likely due to someone being on holiday. This sounds like it could fall under either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" categories. It's about adjusting permissions or authority within the Oracle system, so I\u2019ll decide between these two categories for classification.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket is about replacing an approver, which could relate to the approvals workflow, possibly involving access control. I need to choose between \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" categories. \n\n\"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" don\u2019t fit well here. Changing the approver is related to permissions, suggesting \"Access,\" but it\u2019s also modifying admin workflows, hinting at \"Administrative rights.\" The term \"approver\" is associated with access control, but it doesn't relate to gaining system privileges, which complicates the classification.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe request is to replace an approver due to a holiday, which is an administrative action. I need to determine the best category for this.\n\n\"Miscellaneous\" doesn't seem right, while \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Internal Project\" are irrelevant. \"Administrative rights\" feels specific, but \"Access\" might be the more suitable option. Since this involves changing the approval chain in Oracle, the focus is really on modifying workflow rather than granting admin privileges. So I\u2019ll categorize this under \"Access,\" which fits best with the nature of the request. I'll respond with the required JSON format.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket and expects a JSON format for the response. According to the provided schema, I need to output a JSON object with a category field.\n\nSince I\u2019ve determined the category to be \"Access,\" I'll format it correctly: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll make sure to follow the schema precisely and avoid any extra text. While I considered \"Administrative rights\" since it's about replacing an approver, \"Access\" is still the best fit based on the request.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
