The user\u2019s message seems a bit garbled but hints at a missing project code and mentions trying to search for usual codes like \u201cbench.\u201d They\u2019re asking for suggestions, which is confusing because it seems related to access permission or an internal project. It\u2019s likely an \u201cInternal Project\u201d issue since it centers on the project code. However, it could also fall under \u201cAccess\u201d if it pertains to user permissions. I'm trying to consider all angles!**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user\u2019s message suggests they are onboarding a new \"joiner\" and looking for help with a \"file bench.\" This indicates it's likely related to project management and missing project codes. I think \u201cInternal Project\u201d is the best category since it connects to project codes and files. Although \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could apply if it involves access issues, it's primarily an internal project concern. So, I'll format the response as a JSON object with the category specified. It should be straightforward!**Formatting IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe system prompt clearly states, \"Please categorize this IT Ticket.\" That means I should output the category in the specified format without any extra details. Since it fits best, I'll categorize it as \u201cInternal Project.\u201d I need to ensure I have the capitalization exactly right, so it reads: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll stick to that format and proceed! It\u2019s straightforward, and I'm confident this is what the user needs."
