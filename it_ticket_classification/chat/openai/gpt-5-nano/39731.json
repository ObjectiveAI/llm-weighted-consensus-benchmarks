It mentions problems generating the report and screens going black or empty after pressing continue. This sounds like it could relate to software, so I should map it to the \"Miscellaneous\" category since it doesn\u2019t fit neatly into the other defined categories like Hardware or Access. Let's ensure it gets the right attention!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, but the category list doesn't include \"Software.\" The issue seems related to a reporting tool within a system like PAS, and the user mentions \"discipline lead.\" It could fit as \"Internal Project\" if it pertains to a specific project, or more generally as \"Miscellaneous.\" Since there are symptoms like a black screen, it feels like a software issue rather than an access permission problem. I'll lean toward \"Miscellaneous\" for a generic IT issue.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user didn't give much context, but I think the best fit for this IT ticket is either \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" Since it's about a PAS report, it might be related to an internal project, especially with the mention of \"discipline lead,\" suggesting a project manager role. I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" \n\nSo, I should output this as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll stick to the required format and keep it simple since the user didn't ask for an explanation.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
