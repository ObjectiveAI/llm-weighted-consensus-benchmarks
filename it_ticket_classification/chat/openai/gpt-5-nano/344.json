I remember that the system requires a JSON object with a category field, so I should classify this under \"HR Support\" based on what seems to be the user's intent and the context provided.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the potential categories for the IT ticket. It seems the user's request relates to HR changes, specifically \"line management change,\" which would fit under \"HR Support.\" There's also a possibility of it being about access if it involves reporting lines, but it doesn't explicitly mention that.\n\nGiven everything, \"HR Support\" seems like the most appropriate category for this request. I'll prepare my response as a JSON object with that category. \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
