The mention of \"new starter\" suggests this is an onboarding task. It seems best to categorize it under \"HR Support\" since that's specifically available. The user seems to be indicating that a new employee will start on Tuesday PM, so I\u2019ll aim to categorize this IT ticket correctly. My goal is to output a JSON object with the suitable category.**Deciding on category format**\n\nThe instruction specifies that I need to provide a category object with a \"category\" key. The content is clearly about onboarding and filling out a starter form, which suggests it falls under HR or possibly IT. Since we're discussing a new employee, I\u2019ll choose \"HR Support\" as the appropriate category. The message mentions a new starter joining Tuesday PM and requests to fill out a form, emphasizing its HR context. I'll prepare the JSON format accordingly.**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to ensure that my response is a \"category\" object with the string enumerated correctly. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} with the exact phrasing. I need to avoid any extra text and stick to just the JSON object format. Following the instructions precisely is key here, so I'll make sure to provide the response as expected without adding anything unnecessary. Let\u2019s go ahead and do that!"
