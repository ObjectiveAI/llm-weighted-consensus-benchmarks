The ticket mentions a monitor that's been loaned out until Tuesday PM, so it seems related to handling hardware.\n\nAlthough \"Storage\" comes to mind, that typically refers to data rather than equipment. Since it\u2019s about a physical monitor, I believe the best category fit is \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll make sure to format it in JSON.**Creating JSON output**\n\nThe user needs a JSON object with a \"category\" field, and the expected output is {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. I need to ensure the capitalization is correct since \"Hardware\" has a capital H. \n\nThough the instructions mention that bullet lists are acceptable, I must stick to providing it in the required JSON format. I briefly considered if it could be \"Administrative rights\" or \"Storage,\" but since it's definitely about a physical monitor, I'll go with {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. Now, I'll deliver that."
