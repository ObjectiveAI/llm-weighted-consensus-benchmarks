The sentence seems to include a request for rights related to hiring and requisitions, which suggests it's about access rights. So, this could fit either the \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" categories. Since they mention wanting \"the same rights\" as someone else, it feels more aligned with \"Access.\" Let's go with that for categorization.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nIt looks like I have to categorize the IT ticket with mentions of both \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The content leans towards requesting rights for approving requisitions, which hints at \"Administrative rights.\" The request involves granting similar access as another user who handles hiring, so it doesn't quite fall under \"HR Support\" since it's about permissions rather than direct support. I think the correct category is \"Administrative rights\" as it fits this context best.**Formatting IT Ticket Response**\n\nI need to provide the categorization for the IT ticket in a JSON format expected by the system. The category should match one of the specified enums, and in this case, it's clear that \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit based on the content of the ticket. Since the user requested a categorization, I\u2019ll make sure to keep the response minimal and focus on outputting only the required JSON object. Let's return:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
