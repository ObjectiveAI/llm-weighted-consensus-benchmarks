The categories provided include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" both of which seem relevant since the user discusses permissions. I think the ticket is mostly about access issues, so I\u2019ll choose \"Access\" as the category. However, it might also fit under \"Administrative rights.\" It's tricky since they're closely related.**Categorizing access permissions**\n\nThe user needs help because a member can approve anything, which means there could be an issue with elevated privileges or misconfiguration. I think this fits under \"Access,\" since it relates to permissions. I\u2019m also considering if it might be \"Administrative rights\" instead, but since we\u2019re focusing on access permissions, \"Access\" seems more appropriate. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like object that clearly defines the category as \"Access.\" It's important to keep it concise and straightforward.**Determining appropriate category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize this ticket as \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" The situation seems related to admin privileges since it involves someone approving anything. However, given that \"Access\" is specifically mentioned as a category, I think it's safer to classify it under \"Access,\" focusing on access control and permissions. So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object that clearly specifies {\"category\":\"Access\"} and stick to that without adding any extra text."
