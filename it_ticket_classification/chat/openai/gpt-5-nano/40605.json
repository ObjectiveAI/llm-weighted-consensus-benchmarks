The user mentioned issues with annual leave hours in the Oracle system, so it seems to fit either \"HR Support\" or maybe \"Administrative rights\" because it's about an HR function. Since the category list explicitly includes \"HR Support,\" that feels like the right choice. There\u2019s also a mention of assigning leave, which could hint at \"Access,\" but it\u2019s less clear here. I think \"HR Support\" is the way to go!**Structuring the response**\n\nI\u2019m considering that the category for this ticket might lean towards \"Administrative rights\" if they need permissions to adjust leave. However, given the clear mention of \"annual leave\" and \"Oracle,\" the best fit seems to be \"HR Support.\" The ticket doesn't seem to fall under \"Internal Project.\" I need to respond with a JSON object that matches the required format, ensuring it reflects the category correctly. So, I\u2019ll structure the output as follows: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I want to make sure I follow the schema provided!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
