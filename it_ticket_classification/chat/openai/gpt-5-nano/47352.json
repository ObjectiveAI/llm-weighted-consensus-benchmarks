The main points suggest that they're \u201cunable to upload any contract,\u201d which seems to highlight an access problem. \n\nLooking at the category options, \u201cAccess\u201d seems to be the best fit since it relates to permissions. It could also be considered \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d but the specific nature of the access issue makes \u201cAccess\u201d more appropriate. There's no mention of hardware, HR support, or storage.**Determining category response**\n\nI'm thinking it might fit under an internal project category, but it feels more like a generic IT issue. I believe the best fit is \"Access.\" Now I need to respond in the JSON format that's required.\n\nThe format looks like this: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. The instructions suggest I should focus on just the category, avoiding heavy formatting. They mention that the output needs to be parsed by code, so keeping it simple is key. I\u2019ll provide the category in the proper JSON structure to align with their requirements.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
