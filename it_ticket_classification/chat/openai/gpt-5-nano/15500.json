The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the references to maternity leave and the need for a leaver form, it seems to fit best under \"HR Support\" and possibly \"Access\" since it involves access card details. I'll proceed with that classification!**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing an IT ticket concerning access to an access card and maternity leave forms. The categories available are \"HR Support\" and \"Access.\" While \"Access\" seems technical and pertains to physical card provisioning, \"HR Support\" is more aligned with handling HR forms. The mention of the \"maternity leave leaver form\" suggests this is primarily about HR processes rather than technical access. Therefore, categorizing it as \"HR Support\" seems most fitting, as the user requested help with the ticket classification.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding how to categorize the IT ticket that mentions an \"access card\" and a \"leaver form.\" While \"Access\" might seem logical due to the access card, the request is specifically about filling out an HR-related form. None of the other categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Hardware,\" or \"Miscellaneous\" apply here. Given the emphasis on HR processes, \"HR Support\" is the most suitable category. So, I\u2019ll go with that! Now, I need to format my output as a JSON category string.**Formatting output correctly**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that includes the \"category\" field, specifically using \"HR Support.\" To ensure I\u2019m following the instructions properly, I\u2019ll format my answer as: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nNo extra text is needed here. I\u2019m all set to provide that response!"
