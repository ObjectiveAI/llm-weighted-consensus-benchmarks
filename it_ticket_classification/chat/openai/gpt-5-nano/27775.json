They mention wanting a monitor similar to what they already have, which makes it seem hardware-related. There's a possibility it could fall under \"Purchase\" since it involves acquiring equipment. However, I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit because the request directly focuses on a hardware item. So, I'll go with \"Hardware\" as the category for this ticket.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm working on categorizing an IT ticket, which typically involves distinguishing between categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" or \"Internal Project.\" The user talks about wanting a monitor similar to their existing one, suggesting a hardware request. If they\u2019re specifically asking for a second monitor, it may also fall under \"Purchase\" since it is about acquiring equipment. So, I\u2019ll need to decide whether to label it as \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase\" properly.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user is requesting a monitor, which clearly indicates a hardware request. This suggests that the ticket should fall under the \"Hardware\" category. While there's a possibility of it being categorized as \"Purchase,\" since it involves obtaining equipment, \"Hardware\" fits best given their mention of a second monitor. Now, I need to ensure I provide the response in the correct JSON format. I\u2019ll go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
