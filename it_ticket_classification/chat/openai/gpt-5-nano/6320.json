I\u2019m wondering if the best category would be \"Access\" for permissions or \"Administrative rights\" for more specific privileges. Given the focus on adding members, it feels like \"Access\" could be the most suitable choice.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI believe this ticket should be categorized as \"Access,\" especially since it deals with access rights for shared team members and default view settings. Although \"Internal Project\" could fit if it relates to a specific feature, sticking with \"Access\" seems best. I'll respond with a JSON object structured according to the provided schema: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This adheres to the required format, ensuring it's clear and meets the guidelines.**Delivering the categorization**\n\nI\u2019m wondering if I should add a short justification for the category. The instructions specify that I need to categorize this IT ticket, and it might suggest just the category itself. However, the guidelines are clear that I need to output a JSON object. So, my final response will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any additional justification. Let's deliver this response as required!"
