It sounds like they're asking for help with the installation process, possibly relating to a virus issue or licensing assignment. I\u2019ll map this ticket to the most appropriate category from the list, likely under \"Purchase\" or \"Miscellaneous\" since it mainly discusses licensing and installation concerns.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm looking at the user's message, which includes terms like \"license,\" \"assigned,\" \"buy parallels license,\" and \"handle installation.\" It\u2019s a bit unclear, but it seems to relate most closely to a \"Purchase\" category since it's about buying a license. There could also be elements related to \"Administrative rights\" if there's a need for installation without those rights. Given the categories are somewhat limited, I think \"Purchase\" is the best fit here for this situation.**Parsing IT ticket concerns**\n\nI'm breaking down the user's message about software, which includes phrases like \"package license assigned\" and \"buy parallels license.\" It seems they're requesting to purchase a Parallels license and have someone manage the installation, mentioning virus issues as well. I think the best category for this is \"Purchase,\" since it primarily revolves around acquiring a license. There\u2019s also a chance it could be \"Administrative rights\" if they want help with installation, but \"Purchase\" feels most fitting here.**Formatting response in JSON**\n\nThe instruction requires me to categorize the IT ticket using a specific JSON format. I need to provide a response that looks like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. The user has simply asked for a category, and since this ticket is about licensing, \"Purchase\" fits best. While I wonder if I should add a justification, the instructions indicate that only the category is necessary. So, I\u2019ll stick to the JSON response without additional commentary."
