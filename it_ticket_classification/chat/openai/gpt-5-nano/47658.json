The allowed categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Administrative Rights, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Miscellaneous. The ticket seems to relate to access and password issues, mentioning terms like \"not working,\" \"changed password,\" and \"old password.\" Given the content, I'd classify it under \"Access,\" since it primarily concerns login issues.**Classifying User Message**\n\nThe user's message is a bit unclear, but it seems to refer to access issues, particularly with \"password.\" They mentioned trying to change their password and that the old one isn't working, which leads me to think a reset might be needed. I'm leaning towards categorizing this as \"Access,\" though \"Administrative Rights\" could also apply. Following the instructions, I need to output a JSON object specifying the category. I'll format it as required, simply returning the category without additional explanations.**Outputting Category for IT Ticket**\n\nThe task indicates that I should return a JSON object to categorize the IT ticket, specifically as \"Access.\" It\u2019s possible that \"Administrative Rights\" might fit since it relates to passwords, but the primary focus seems to be on access issues. Therefore, I'll proceed with \"Access.\" I need to ensure that the output is strictly in JSON format, without any additional text. So, here\u2019s the clean output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
