The request is a bit noisy, but those are the main points. It seems to be an internal system where tickets go into categories like Hardware, HR Support, or Miscellaneous, among others. Given the context, I'll have to select the best category from those options to assist the user effectively.**Classifying the document request**\n\nThe user is asking for document links related to tasks that employees need to perform, which makes it a bit tricky to categorize. It could go under \"Access\" if it\u2019s about accessing documents or \"Miscellaneous\" if the request isn\u2019t specific. There\u2019s also a hint of \"HR Support\" due to the mention of work terms submissions. However, since it\u2019s a broad request, I think classifying it as \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the best choice for their general documentation needs.**Choosing a category for document links**\n\nThe user is requesting document links, but the category isn\u2019t entirely clear. It's not strictly \"Administrative rights\" since that involves permissions for admin actions. \"HR Support\" doesn't fit since it\u2019s not about HR issues. The reference to \"manage cards view\" probably relates to a tool like Trello or Jira, hinting at project management documentation. However, due to the ambiguity, I think the best category to choose is \"Miscellaneous\" since it covers the general request for documentation without specifying other areas.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
