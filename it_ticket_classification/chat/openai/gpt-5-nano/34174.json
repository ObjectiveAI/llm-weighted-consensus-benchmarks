The categories I have are: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" From the content, it looks like the user is struggling to access necessary files and is asking for help. So, I'll classify this ticket under \"Access\" since it's primarily about file access.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI'm contemplating whether to categorize this ticket as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The text indicates permission concerns, and mentions folders being accessible and asking for checks. It could fit both categories, but since the request seems focused on access to files, \"Access\" feels more appropriate. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply, it\u2019s more specific. Since I need a JSON-like response format, I should prepare a category object with the key \"category\" set to \"Access.\""
