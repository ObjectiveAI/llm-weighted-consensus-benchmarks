There are mentions of locations, \"CA\" and \"VA,\" times like \"Friday PM,\" and \"analyst ext hub.\" Overall, the focus appears to be on managing access cards related to leavers, confirming \"Access\" is likely the best fit for this ticket.**Parsing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing the string about revoking access cards related to a leaver. It mentions \"tower,\" which might refer to a building or something else, but since the focus is on access cards for an ex-employee, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" I considered \"HR Support,\" but the context points to a security task. Since the request is clearly to categorize the IT ticket, aligning it with \"Access\" makes the most sense. I should respond in an appropriate format.**Responding with JSON**\n\nThe prompt includes a category schema, and I see that I need to provide a JSON object. Based on the ticket analysis, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" The instruction is clear about categorizing the IT ticket, so I'll format the response correctly as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI\u2019ll keep it simple and stick to just providing the object without any extra text."
