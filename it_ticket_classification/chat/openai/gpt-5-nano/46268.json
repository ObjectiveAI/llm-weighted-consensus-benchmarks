While access might fit because it deals with network connectivity, the emphasis on the physical wire leads me to lean towards \"Hardware.\" I also need to consider if it could fit into \"Miscellaneous\" if nothing else aligns perfectly.**Choosing the right category**\n\nFor IT tickets, \"Access\" covers things like login credentials or VPN, but this issue relates to a physical wired network problem. I think \"Hardware\" is clearly the most fitting category here. So, I need to format my response as a JSON object with the \"category\" field. \n\nIt should look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Also, I want to ensure I don\u2019t include any extra text or formatting. So, in the end, I\u2019ll just provide that JSON object."
