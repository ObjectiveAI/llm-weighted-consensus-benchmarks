The system specifies I should respond with a JSON format containing a category field.\n\nFrom the given options like Hardware, HR Support, and Access, it seems this ticket likely fits under \"Hardware\" or \"Access.\" Let's clarify that in the response.**Deciding Category for IT Ticket**\n\nI think a system outage might fall under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Hardware.\" If it's about a service or application being down, \"Miscellaneous\" is often used, especially since there's no specific \"Network\" or \"Software\" category. \"Hardware\" would apply if a physical device is having issues, while \"Storage\" relates to storage issues. However, without more details, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a safe choice. \n\nI need to return a JSON object with the category \"Miscellaneous,\" formatted correctly as {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}.**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is the appropriate category here since it\u2019s part of the allowed enum. So, I'll go ahead and finalize this choice. There's no need for any additional context or elaborate discussion \u2014 just sticking to the essentials! \n\nI\u2019ll ensure that my response is simply formatted as a JSON object with the category value returning \"Miscellaneous.\" This should meet the requirements perfectly, ensuring clarity and correctness."
