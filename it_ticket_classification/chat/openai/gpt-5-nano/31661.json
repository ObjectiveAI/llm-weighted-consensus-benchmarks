Based on what I see, it's clearly a procurement process, not related to HR or other categories. Therefore, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object stating: { \"category\": \"Purchase\" }.**Outputting JSON Format**\n\nI need to ensure that I'm outputting the information properly formatted as a JSON object since the prompt specifies that it could be parsed. I\u2019ll keep it simple and to the point, giving no extra commentary. So, the output will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. This way, I\u2019m following the instructions precisely!"
