Therefore, I will structure the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. This seems like the appropriate category based on the information given.**Determining the Category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the best category for the IT ticket. The options include \"Storage\" and \"Hardware,\" but the ticket mentions a \"drive upgrade,\" which suggests it relates to storage. While \"Hardware\" could also fit, \"Storage\" is explicitly one of the options provided. Since \"drive upgrade\" clearly points towards storage needs, I feel confident in choosing \"Storage\" as the category. I\u2019ll format the response simply as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. This keeps it clear and concise, just as instructed!"
