They mention issues like \"new employees not active,\" \"log ticket,\" and \"interns graduated started working.\" It sounds like it relates to access permissions, workspace assignments, and user accounts. Given the context, it seems the best categories to choose from are \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll definitely lean toward the \"Access\" category since that fits the main issue.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket is about logging access for new employees and interns who still have permissions issues. Phrases like \"new employees not active\" suggest account activation or deactivation. The reference to \"cannot be assigned workspace\" points to workspace provisioning. It seems that \"Access\" is the best category since it covers permissions, while \"Administrative rights\" focuses on admin privileges. Given that, I should respond with a JSON object indicating the category as \"Access.\" Let's ensure that I only output the JSON.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nThe instruction clearly states that I need to output a single JSON object containing the category. The required format specifies it should include the category with an enumerated list. I know the selected category is \"Access.\" Even though it's tempting to add some reasoning, the instruction indicates that I should just provide the JSON without any additional comments. So, I\u2019ll make sure to output only the necessary JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's stick to that!"
