The text mentions needing to add user privileges and access. From the categories provided\u2014like Access and Administrative rights\u2014this seems to fit best under \"Administrative rights\" since the user is asking for admin access and added privileges. The mention of \"sonar\" suggests it's related to an application too.**Categorizing admin access request**\n\nThe user wants to grant admin access to Sonar for project discipline management, including requests to add a \"sonar simple user\" and \"sonar discipline.\" The focus here is on access rights to a system. The choice is between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" but since it specifically involves granting admin access and privileges, \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit. I'll respond with the required categorization in a JSON object format.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe instruction clearly states to categorize the IT ticket. I see that I need to provide a JSON object with a \"category\" property. The valid categories include options like \"Administrative rights,\" which is the one I'll go with in this case. So my response will simply be: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I won't include any extra text, just the JSON object as instructed. Let's get that ready!"
