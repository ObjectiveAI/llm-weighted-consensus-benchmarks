It seems \"Sonar discipline\" might refer to a team or system. The request includes adding users, which indicates they need access rights. Considering the details, this ticket seems to fit into the \"Access\" category since they are asking for access to the Sonar system. I'll format that into a JSON-like structure.**Determining the category**\n\nThe ticket seems to request access to the Sonar system and also mentions adding users, which might indicate they\u2019re looking for administrative rights. However, since the focus is on access management, I believe \"Access\" is the more suitable category rather than \"Administrative Rights.\" The user specifically refers to gaining access on Tuesday and adding \"people's users,\" which reinforces that they\u2019re requesting access. Given all this, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" for the JSON output.**Categorizing the request**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether \"Administrative Rights\" is the right choice since adding users might seem to require admin credentials. However, it sounds more like they're requesting to add users to the Sonar system, which relates more to access control. Thus, the \"Access\" category seems more appropriate. I\u2019ll output a JSON object with the category field for this ticket, following the schema provided. It\u2019s clear I want to settle on \"Access\" as the category for the ticket response.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
