They mentioned a \"new purchase\" and specifically referred to a \"cooling pad\" installation, which makes me think it fits under the purchase category. Now, I\u2019ll check the list of categories provided to confirm. The options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the user is asking about a purchase and installation, I'm feeling confident about the Purchase category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to parse the ticket which mentions a \"new purchase\" and involves a \"cooling pad\" that requires installation. It seems to focus on a purchase order, possibly indicating project management too. The request includes an emphasis on logging the installation and handling receipts. Given all this, \"Purchase\" seems like the right category for this ticket. I'll create a JSON-like category object to respond, simply saying: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and to the point.**Responding with category**\n\nI've got the instruction to categorize the IT ticket, and it looks like an appropriate representation is necessary. The allowed value for the category based on the analysis is \"Purchase.\" So, I should prepare my output as a JSON-like format with the category. That means I'll simply represent it as: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. Alright, responding with just that straightforward category!"
