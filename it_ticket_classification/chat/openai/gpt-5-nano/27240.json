It could also relate to \"Internal Project,\" but \"Hardware\" fits more closely since it's about the installation of new equipment.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking the best category for this IT ticket might be \"Hardware\" because it focuses on memory and installation. However, it also references \"purchase order\" and \"purchase,\" which could suggest the \"Purchase\" category. The key actions in the message point to logging an installation of a purchased memory module. If I need to pick one category, \"Hardware\" feels most fitting since it directly relates to the memory's physical installation, but it could also tie into \"Purchase.\"**Outputting category as JSON**\n\nI need to create a JSON-like object for the category based on the ticket content. Given that the most appropriate choice seems to be \"Hardware,\" I will respond like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.\n\nI considered options like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but they aren't relevant for this case. Although \"Purchase\" could work due to the mention of a purchase order, the primary action is to log the installation of memory. In IT terms, memory is classified as hardware, so \"Hardware\" is indeed the best choice. I'll finalize with that format."
