The message is quite garbled, but it mentions frustrations related to the review process and rendering issues. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Internal Project,\" since it seems to relate to a UI rendering problem. However, this issue isn't exactly covered by the existing categories; they feel a bit broad for this specific case.**Clarifying the Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket refers to an issue with the \"review before submit\" step in a workflow, where it's described as \"unreadable,\" hinting at a UI/UX rendering problem. The categories don\u2019t fit well, as it doesn't relate to hardware, storage, purchase, or internal projects. It's also not an access or HR issue. Given the poorly formed content, I think it\u2019s best to categorize this as \"Miscellaneous,\" since it indicates a rendering problem. I'll respond with the appropriate JSON category object.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
