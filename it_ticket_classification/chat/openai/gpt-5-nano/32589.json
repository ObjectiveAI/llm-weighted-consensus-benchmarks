The user\u2019s message is a bit noisy: it mentions \"new project code oracle\" which seems to refer to something specific, perhaps related to software. There's also a focus on scheduling leave with \"officer leave till ext zone.\" It\u2019s tricky since the message lacks clarity. I\u2019ll go through the options, but I\u2019m leaning towards \"Internal Project\" given the context. Let's form the appropriate JSON with the chosen category.**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket. It could be \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The ticket mentions \"code,\" implying it relates to project or coding specifics. There's \"oracle,\" which suggests a database context, and the phrase indicates a potential request for access to that environment. Given the focus on a new project, I'll lean toward \"Internal Project,\" but \"Access\" might work if it pertains to admin rights. It\u2019s quite unclear, so \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is also a possibility.**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nThe text mentions \"leave till ext zone,\" which might refer to an \"extension zone,\" but it's not very clear. I believe \"Internal Project\" is the right category since it relates to a new project code and Oracle. So, I'll go with that. Now, I need to respond in the required JSON format, simply returning: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nI'll make sure to keep it concise and avoid extraneous commentary!"
