It mentions \"belgrade conference room Nile work\" multiple times, suggesting it's about a conference room issue. I'm thinking \"Nile\" could refer to a project or the name of the room. The request to \"fix\" indicates hardware-related problems, perhaps with AV equipment. So, it\u2019s likely fitting into the \"Hardware\" category rather than anything else. I'll generate a JSON output with this classification!**Categorizing IT Ticket Again**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this IT ticket as \"Hardware\" since it\u2019s about equipment in a conference room. I considered \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t fit. \u201cInternal Project\u201d? No, that doesn\u2019t apply either. It seems more about fixing the equipment, so \"Miscellaneous\" wouldn\u2019t be quite right. The task is clear: I need to output a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Just the category, without any extra schema stuff. I\u2019ll make sure to follow that format!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
