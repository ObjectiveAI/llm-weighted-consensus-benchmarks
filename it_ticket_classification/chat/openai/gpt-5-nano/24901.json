It seems to involve adding someone to a \"social\" context, potentially related to a calendar event or communication group. The phrase \"Wednesday December PM social\" makes me think it could indicate scheduling a social event. Since \"social\" could refer to social media or events in the IT ticket taxonomy, I think I should categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" based on the available options.**Categorizing User Request**\n\nThe user\u2019s message suggests they want to add someone to a social event scheduled for a Wednesday in December in the PM. This could involve \"Access\" to a calendar, or \"Administrative rights\" for adding to a distribution list. Considering the context, if they need permissions for groups or calendars, I\u2019d categorize it as \"Access.\" If it feels too unclear, I might consider \"Miscellaneous,\" but I want to choose the most appropriate category based on the details.**Categorizing IT Ticket Request**\n\nThe user\u2019s request includes \"add to social Wednesday December PM social\", which indicates they likely want to add someone to a social context, like a calendar event. Given the ambiguity, it seems to be an access request, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" I'm planning to respond with a JSON object format that complies with the specified structure. I\u2019ll return: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without adding extra commentary. Let's keep it straightforward!"
