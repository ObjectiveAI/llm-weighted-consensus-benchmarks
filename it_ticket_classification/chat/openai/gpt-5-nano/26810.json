The user's ticket includes requests about fixing dates, adding someone, and mentioning a client name and work location, pointing toward categories like HR Support or Access. Given these details, I should probably lean toward categorizing this ticket as HR Support, considering the emphasis on new starters and related administrative tasks.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"new starter\" and \"urgent contractor,\" which suggests an onboarding process. It also refers to needing forms, client names, work locations, and deadlines. This leans heavily toward being an HR-related issue, so \"HR Support\" seems like the right category. While \"Access\" might be considered if it were about system access, the focus is more on forms and onboarding rather than granting access. Thus, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and format it correctly as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
