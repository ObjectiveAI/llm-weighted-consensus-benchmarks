The mention of \"belgrade pm\" could signify a location or project code, while \"joiner whom expect July 1st\" indicates a specific date. Given that the focus is on access provisioning for a new starter, \"Access\" seems like the most appropriate category to go with, even though \"Administrative rights\" could be an option.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nConsidering the ticket, it could fit under \"HR Support\" if it relates to onboarding, but since it seems to be focused on IT\u2014particularly in setting up accounts\u2014I think \"Access\" is the way to go. The ticket mentions terms like \"new starter\" and \"joiner,\" which strengthen that connection. I\u2019ll format my output as a JSON-like object with the required key. I'll just keep it simple:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
