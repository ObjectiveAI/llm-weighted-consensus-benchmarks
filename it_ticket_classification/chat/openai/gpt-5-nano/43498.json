The specifics mention that the wired connection isn't working, while the wireless is fine, which suggests a hardware or access-related problem. I\u2019m weighing between categorizing it as \u201cHardware,\u201d \u201cAccess,\u201d or potentially \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d since the plugs were functioning normally before. The goal is to produce a JSON object reflecting the correct category from the allowed list.**Determining Category for IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m leaning toward categorizing this IT ticket as \"Hardware\" since the issue involves a physical network port that\u2019s not functioning. While \"Access\" could apply if it were strictly related to network access, the problem is specifically with the wired connection. The provided description confirms that the user can connect only via wireless. So, given all that, the best fit seems to be \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll create the JSON object as instructed to reflect this choice.**Generating JSON Output**\n\nI need to create a JSON object for the IT ticket, specifically a \"category\" string selected from allowed options. The final format should look something like: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. While \"Access\" could also fit since it deals with network access, the description suggests that the issue really is about a non-functioning port, which leans more toward \"Hardware.\" I'll stick with that choice. Just to clarify, the primary requirement is the JSON object, but a brief note might help\u2014although that's not necessary.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
