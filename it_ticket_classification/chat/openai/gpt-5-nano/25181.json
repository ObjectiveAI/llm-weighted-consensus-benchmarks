The text mentions a purchase and installation of a wireless mouse adapter. I'll consider predefined categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" and others. Since the context points towards a purchase, I think it fits best under the \"Purchase\" category. According to the prompt, I have to structure this as a JSON object, so I\u2019ll set it up as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Parsing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm looking at the ticket that mentions a new purchase order from December, specifically about a wireless mouse adapter. It also mentions logging or tracking the installation of this adapter. Since the focus is on purchasing hardware and its installation, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it under \"Hardware.\" However, it could also fit in the \"Purchase\" category since it's specifically about a purchase order. This ticket definitely revolves around new hardware and installation tasks.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe ticket focuses on a \"new purchase PO\" and mentions logging installation, which brings up two main aspects: Purchase and Installation. I need to decide between categorizing it as \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" Given that it emphasizes a new purchase order, \"Purchase\" seems like the best fit. Although there's a mention of installation, it ties back to the purchased hardware. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Purchase\" and output the category as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
