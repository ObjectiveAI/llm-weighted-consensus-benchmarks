They mentioned using a mobile app, which indicates it likely relates to software access. It could fit under \"Access\" since it's about permissions for Oracle Fusion Expenses. However, if admin privileges are necessary, \"Administrative rights\" might also work. I think \"Access\" is the best fit here because the focus is specifically on activation and permissions.**Finalizing category response**\n\nThe user mentioned \"mobile app,\" suggesting the ticket is about accessing or activating an app. This clearly falls under the \"Access\" category. So, I should create a JSON object with that category. The required format is straightforward: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nI need to make sure I follow the specified schema properly. If there's any nuance, like if admin privileges are needed, it might also relate to \"Administrative rights.\" However, based on the request, \"Access\" fits best. I'll keep it simple and accurate with the output.**Choosing the right category**\n\nThe mention of \"expenses\" suggests it's about the Expense module in Oracle Fusion. The user is likely looking to enable access to this module, particularly through a mobile app. This indicates that the request is about permissions and application activation, which aligns well with the \"Access\" category. Although \"Internal Project\" could be an option if it were a specific project, it\u2019s clearer that this is primarily about accessing the Expenses module. So, I'll go with \"Access.\""
