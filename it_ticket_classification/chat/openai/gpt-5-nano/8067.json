The ticket mentions a maternity leaver and things like access card and maternity form. I\u2019ll determine which category fits best from the given options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" etc. The ticket appears to be about processing an access card for someone on maternity leave. Given the context, I think it should be categorized under \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\"**Classifying IT ticket category**\n\nI'm working on categorizing the IT ticket. Since it's about an access card and mentions a maternity leaver, \"Access\" seems to fit best, as it aligns with the IT focus on access rights and cards. While \"HR Support\" is also an option, it's clear that the ticket is primarily about access. So, I'll classify it as \u201cAccess\u201d and prepare the final output in JSON format to meet the required specifications.**Preparing the JSON output**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that categorizes the IT ticket. The right category is \"Access,\" so I\u2019m going to format it as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I could consider adding a justification for this choice, but the instructions specify to primarily provide just the JSON output. It\u2019s clear that this classification is based on access rights and the context of an access card. So, I'll keep it concise and finalize my output as {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
