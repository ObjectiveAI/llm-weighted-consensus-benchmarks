It mentions RAM for new members and talks about splitting two tickets. This does hint at a request for hardware, specifically RAM, maybe as a purchase or upgrade. Since it relates to a hardware upgrade or a purchase of RAM, I'll lean towards either \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase\" as the appropriate category for this ticket.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"RAM for new members\" indicates a hardware issue, likely a RAM upgrade. There\u2019s also a mention of scheduling, but it seems less relevant. The request for RAM confirms it as a hardware request, placing it in the \"Hardware\" category. There's an additional note about splitting tickets for members, which seems secondary. I\u2019ll make sure to respond with a JSON object that includes the category as just {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any extra text, following the instruction closely.**Determining JSON output**\n\nI\u2019m confirming that it\u2019s fine to output just the JSON, focusing on the \"category\" field as the only property. I also want to consider whether there might be confusion in the user's message about \"RAM for new members.\" It could imply a request to allocate RAM for new members' accounts. Nevertheless, the request still aligns with a hardware issue. So, my final output will be a JSON object indicating the category as \"Hardware.\""
