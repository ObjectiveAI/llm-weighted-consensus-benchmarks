The ticket mentions trouble uploading a resume and trying different browsers, clearing the cache, and using incognito mode. This could fall under several categories: \"Access\" for permissions issues, \"Storage\" for file upload problems, or \"Miscellaneous\" if it's harder to classify. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Storage\" as they seem most relevant to the upload issue. Let's settle on the best option!**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the appropriate category for this ticket. The available categories don\u2019t include \"Software\" or \"Web,\" and while \"Access\" usually pertains to login issues, this situation involves uploading a file. \"Storage\" seems relevant if it\u2019s a file system concern. The user mentioned trying different browsers, but they didn\u2019t specify any login issues. Since there\u2019s some uncertainty, I might lean toward \"Miscellaneous\" but could also consider \"Internal Project\" based on the context. Let's figure this out!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user tried different browsers like IE and Chrome, cleared their cache, and used incognito mode, which suggests a cross-browser issue. I need to categorize this ticket, and my options include \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Storage.\" While \"Access\" pertains to permissions, the user didn\u2019t mention login problems. \"Storage\" applies if it's a backend issue related to files, but it might be for an internal HR portal, too. Since categories are limited, I think \"Miscellaneous\" fits best, so I'll create a JSON-like object to reflect that.**Deciding on Access Category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning toward categorizing the ticket as \"Access\" because the user mentioned they \"cannot upload,\" which suggests an inability to access the upload feature. Even though it\u2019s not about login issues, it still points to a permissions problem. The \"Access\" category fits well as it covers the inability to perform actions. Since the user specifically asked me to categorize the IT ticket, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nThat should match the system's requirements perfectly!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
