It mentions a \"new starter tower\" which suggests hardware, and talks about \"create his credentials,\" hinting at access or administrative rights. The rest of the text refers to a \"candidate\" who has accepted a job offer and mentions a \"tester.\" This seems to relate to setting up credentials for a new employee, possibly indicating it's mostly about onboarding and hardware for new starters.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI need to classify an IT ticket where the user informs that a candidate has accepted a job offer. The request to \"create his credentials\" indicates this pertains to access provisioning, so I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" While \"Administrative rights\" is an option, it refers to elevated permissions, and here we're simply creating user accounts. There's also a mention of \"new starter tower,\" suggesting hardware, but the main action revolves around credentials. Thus, \"Access\" is the most fitting category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
