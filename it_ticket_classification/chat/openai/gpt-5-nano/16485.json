I should lean towards classifying it under \"Hardware,\" but there could also be a request for purchase. Parsing the text doesn't clarify much beyond that jumble.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nIt seems the user is indicating a hardware item was delivered: \"extension cord received,\" possibly hinting at some issues with it. The fitting category here is \"Hardware.\" I need to follow the required format and respond with a JSON object specifying the category. Since the system specifies that it wants only the category, I\u2019ll format my response as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI should stick to the instruction to provide just this response without any extra text. Double-checking, though; \"Purchase\" is a possibility since it's about an extension cord. But given the context, \"Hardware\" seems more appropriate.**Deciding on the Right Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the categories, and while \"Purchase\" might suggest ordering or requesting something, this ticket is really about receiving an item. So, \"Hardware\" is clearly the best fit here. I need to ensure my response is straightforward. I should deliver just the necessary JSON format without any extra formatting or text. This will keep it clean and meet the requirements perfectly! Let's go ahead with that."
