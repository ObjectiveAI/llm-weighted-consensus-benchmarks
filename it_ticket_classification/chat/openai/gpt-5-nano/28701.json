While \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t seem fitting, \u201cInternal Project\u201d might work since it relates to maintenance within infrastructure. However, if I'm unsure, \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is a safe fallback. The user wants a JSON-like response, so I'll present the chosen category clearly to meet their needs.**Determining JSON category**\n\nI've decided that \"Internal Project\" suits best, as it suggests a project related to maintenance work on systems. The user requested a response in a simple JSON format that includes just the category field. It shouldn\u2019t have extra text, so I\u2019ll go ahead and prepare this JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Even though I considered adding a brief justification, the instructions emphasize sticking to the specified format. So, I'll keep it clean with just this output."
