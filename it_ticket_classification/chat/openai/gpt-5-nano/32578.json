Overall, \"Purchase\" looks like the best fit for this situation.**Responding with JSON**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object for the category, which I've determined to be \"Purchase.\" The required format is straightforward: a category object with a \"category\" field. So, the output will be: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. I must ensure that nothing extraneous is included, following the instruction to provide only the categorization. I\u2019ll stick to this format and respond solely with the category object."
