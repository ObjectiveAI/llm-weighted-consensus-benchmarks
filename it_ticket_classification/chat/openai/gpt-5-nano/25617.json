I\u2019m thinking it might fall under the \u201cAccess\u201d category because the new employee needs access to systems, but it could also relate to \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d if they\u2019re requesting those. The garbled content does suggest some issues, but I've decided that \u201cAccess\u201d fits best since it\u2019s focused on onboarding and system access for the new hire.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the ticket details for categorization. While \"HR Support\" might be for new starter paperwork, this ticket clearly relates to IT with terms like \"new starter,\" and \"attached.\" There\u2019s mention of an \"error,\" but it doesn\u2019t point to HR issues. The focus seems to fit better under \"Access,\" especially since it deals with system access. So, I\u2019ll prepare the necessary JSON response with the category: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Keeping it concise!"
