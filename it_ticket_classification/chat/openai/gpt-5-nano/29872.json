The user's request mentions multiple things, like a quote for floor expansions and equipment procurement for the Bucharest TH floor. Since it\u2019s clearly about acquiring equipment, the most suitable category seems to be \"Purchase.\" Although it could relate to an \"Internal Project,\" the primary focus is on purchasing equipment. The response should definitely be in JSON format as specified in the instructions for the category object.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI see the system prompt shows that I need to output a JSON object with a specific category format. The user wants me to categorize the IT ticket, and the allowed categories are clearly listed. My best approach seems to be responding simply with {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}, which fits the requirements. It looks like I should ensure that \"Purchase\" matches the enumerated options. Since the instruction is focused on categorization, I think I'll keep explanations minimal.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
