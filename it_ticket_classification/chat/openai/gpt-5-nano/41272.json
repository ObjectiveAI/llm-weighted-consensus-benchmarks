The ticket discusses a leave correction for an annual leave request for next Monday, mentioning that the person has work obligations on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. It looks like they contacted compliance for help with correcting this entry. Given that this is primarily about correcting an HR leave request, it seems appropriate to categorize it under \"HR Support.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis ticket is clearly related to HR, focusing on a leave correction. The mention of \"compliance\" certainly points towards needing HR Support. Other categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" don't fit here. Although \"Miscellaneous\" might work, HR Support is definitely the best choice since it's about changing a leave request in the system. So, I need to present the answer as a JSON object like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"} \n\nThat should be clear and to the point!"
