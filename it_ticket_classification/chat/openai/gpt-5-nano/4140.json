Given the repeated focus on HR tasks related to interns and forms, it seems to fit best under \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Administrative rights\" due to references to access.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user provided information about logging tickets after receiving completed forms, indicating it relates to the onboarding process for graduates. They referenced internal project management, and while \"Administrative rights\" could apply if there was a clear request for access, it\u2019s not explicit. It seems more suitable to categorize it under \"HR Support\" since it focuses on onboarding interns and scheduling forms. It doesn't fit into hardware, storage, or purchases, making HR Support the best fit.**Producing JSON Output**\n\nI need to produce the output as a JSON object for the category \"HR Support.\" I see that the enumerations indeed include \"HR Support\" with the correct spacing, so my output should look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Since the instructions specify that it should be a clean JSON object without any extra text, I need to stick with just this format. Alright, I\u2019ll confirm my output is ready and respond now!"
