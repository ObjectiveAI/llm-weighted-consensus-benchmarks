It doesn't clearly indicate hardware or access requests, which makes me think it might fit under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" Overall, I'll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" since it\u2019s a general IT issue.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering if this IT ticket fits into \"Internal Project\" since it might relate to a project. The text mentions locations and roles but isn't clear. When I think of typical IT support categories like Hardware, Software, or Access, I'm realizing the options are limited here. The phrase \u201cissue faced today\u201d is too generic, so I'll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous.\" It could have been \"Access,\" but it doesn't explicitly request system access. I\u2019ll prepare the response in JSON format.**Formatting the response**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket. I need to respond with the correct format, which is a JSON-like object indicating the category. Since I've determined it fits under \"Miscellaneous,\" I\u2019ll format my response as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. \n\nI\u2019ll stick to the instructions and only provide the required information. There\u2019s no need for any additional explanation unless the user specifically asks for it, so I\u2019ll deliver just the category object!"
