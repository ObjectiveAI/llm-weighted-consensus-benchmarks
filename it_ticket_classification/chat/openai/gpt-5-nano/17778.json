It looks like they're asking about \"Mind Map Manager Professional,\" likely requesting software installation. The mention of \"professional\" hints at specific software like \"MindManager\" or \"MindMeister.\" The request could be for installing \"Mind Manager Professional\" or something similar. I'll treat it as a software installation request and categorize it accordingly.**Choosing the category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to decide which category fits the request best, and it could be \"Purchase,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since there\u2019s no specific \"Software\" category, \"Purchase\" might apply for software licensing. However, the text about installing \"Mind Map Manager Pro\" suggests it's an installation request, which falls under \"Administrative rights\" since admin access is needed. \"Access\" is more about system permissions, so it seems like \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit here.**Formatting output for category**\n\nI think the best category for the ticket is \"Administrative rights\" since the installation of software usually requires admin privileges. Even though the ticket says \"install mind map professional,\" it's not explicitly stating rights, but installation typically does need them. So, I need to output a JSON object that includes the chosen category in the expected schema: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[...]}}}. I\u2019ll ensure it matches the required format for the response.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
