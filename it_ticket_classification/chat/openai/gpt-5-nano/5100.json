It mentions Oracle Fusion, project code, and opportunity code forecasts. I\u2019m considering a few categories here: \"Access\" could fit due to the setup code and access to Oracle Fusion. \"Internal Project\" seems appropriate too, as it focuses on a new project code and client opportunities. There's also a hint at \"Purchase\" with the mention of bids. However, given the context, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like the user\u2019s request is for a new project code related to Oracle Fusion. I think \"Internal Project\" is the best category for this since it\u2019s clearly about a new project setup. While it could also be related to \"Access\" due to potential permissions, that seems less fitting. So I\u2019ll prepare to respond with a JSON object in the required format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I need to make sure it\u2019s exactly that with no extra text included."
