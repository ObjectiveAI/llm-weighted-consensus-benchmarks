The user is asking for help with filling out a maternity leave form, which definitely falls under HR. There's also a mention of \"access card,\" which could indicate something related to access control. I think the proper category here would be \"HR Support,\" given the context of the request. I'll prepare a JSON output with that category.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the ticket by selecting the best label. Since it concerns maternity leave forms, \"HR Support\" seems like the primary category. However, there's mention of an \"access card,\" which could relate it to IT. If the issue involves issuing this access card for someone on maternity leave, it might be an access control task. So, I could see both \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" as relevant, but the request centers on HR processes. It's a bit tricky!**Labeling the ticket**\n\nTypically, \"maternity leave\" falls under HR, so I see \"HR Support\" as the best category here, especially since the user's requesting help with maternity leave forms. The \"Access\" category could be relevant if it involved managing access, like deactivating it or issuing an access card. But since the ticket specifically asks for assistance with a form, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. No extra commentary needed unless requested!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
