The ticket mentions \"change approval flow\" and \"Thursday,\" but it seems a bit garbled. It could be about modifying a workflow, which likely falls under \"Internal Project.\" \"Administrative rights\" might apply if they want to change permissions, but it feels more like internal workflow configuration. So, I'll go with \"Internal Project,\" but \"Miscellaneous\" is a backup option if it's unclear.**Deciding on category response**\n\nI think \"Internal Project\" is the right choice since the request is about a workflow change. While \"Access\" could fit if they're needing permissions, it feels more like an internal adjustment. I want to respond concisely with the format they specified. So, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON-like object for the category: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. It's important to keep it valid JSON and stick strictly to the required format. I'll make sure there's no extra commentary and just provide the object."
