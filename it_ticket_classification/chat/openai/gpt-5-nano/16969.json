The user's message focuses on transferring ownership of the phone after relocation. It might fall under \"Hardware,\" but it also seems more about asset relocation, which could fit \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or even \"Miscellaneous.\" The existing categories are somewhat limited in scope here, so it's a bit tricky. I'll have to choose carefully!**Categorizing IT Ticket for Device Transfer**\n\nThe user is requesting a transfer of a mobile phone due to maternity leave, so it looks like we need to manage an asset by assigning it to a different colleague. It seems like this fits best under \"Hardware,\" given that it\u2019s a physical device. While it could also touch on \"Administrative rights,\" since it's about ownership transfer, I think \"Hardware\" is the better choice. I'll respond with a JSON category format for clarity!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
