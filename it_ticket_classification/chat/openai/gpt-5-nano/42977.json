It\u2019s important to establish clear categories so that issues can be resolved efficiently and by the right team. I wonder if there are existing guidelines or criteria for categorization. Maybe I'll look into past tickets to see how they were categorized to maintain consistency. My goal is to make this process smooth and effective for whoever is handling the ticket next.**Analyzing special leave request**\n\nI see that the user provided a long text related to a special leave request approval issue. It seems to be about incorrect approvals and guidance on how to manage these requests, like accepting or declining them. There's also an emphasis on the need for timely approval to avoid complications, especially when it comes to annual leave. I\u2019ll need to ensure I address this properly so that the user can follow the correct procedures.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at procedural instructions related to categorizing an IT ticket. The categories available include \"Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.\" The ticket content focuses on special leave request approvals, which makes it seem HR-related. While there's no explicit \"HR\" category, \"HR Support\" fits best given the context of leave requests. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and categorize this ticket under \"HR Support\" as it aligns well with the content.**Returning JSON category**\n\nThe ticket discusses topics like \"special leave request,\" \"annual leave,\" \"approval,\" and \"reject reason,\" all indicating an HR process. Since the user specifically asked to categorize this, I need to provide a precise JSON response. The required format includes a category key with a string enumeration, and I\u2019ve confirmed that \"HR Support\" is a valid option in the enum. So, I\u2019ll respond with: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"} \n\nI\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text and stick to the requested format."
