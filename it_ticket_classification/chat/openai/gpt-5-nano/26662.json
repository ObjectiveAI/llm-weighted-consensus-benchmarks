The phrases \"delete comments from Tuesday November PM\" and \"please delete comments\" indicate it's likely an incident or request related to document management. The mention of \"key holders,\" \"attached spreadsheet,\" \"order,\" and \"next audits\" suggests it might involve access control or administrative rights. However, editing the spreadsheet could also fit under administrative tasks. It's a bit tricky, but I think it leans towards administrative rights.**Analyzing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out the best category for this ticket about deleting comments from a spreadsheet. The user mentions \"key holders\" and \"cards,\" which hints it relates to access control. The request for deleting comments from a specific time suggests it\u2019s about modifying a document. I\u2019m thinking it could fit under \"Administrative rights\" because it\u2019s an editing task, but it also touches on \"Access,\" given the references to cards and permissions. It's a bit of a balancing act!**Categorizing IT ticket structure**\n\nThe user is asking to categorize the ticket, and it seems I need to provide a JSON-like structure for that. The prompt says, \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" followed by some text. I should format my response with a \"category\" field, using allowed values like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" etc. \n\nBased on the content, especially the mentions of comments, key holders, and audits, I think \"Access\" fits best since it involves access control. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also apply if we focus on editing the spreadsheet. I'll finalize on \"Access.\"**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm focusing on the right category for this ticket. The \"Administrative rights\" category usually relates to changing user permissions, but this request is more about deleting comments. The \"Miscellaneous\" category is another option, but it doesn't feel quite right. Among the choices, \"Access\" seems to fit best due to the references to key holders and audits. \n\nI'll format my response as a JSON object with the category specified as \"Access.\" So, my final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
