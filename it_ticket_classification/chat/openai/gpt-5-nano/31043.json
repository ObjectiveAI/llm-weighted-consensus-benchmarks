The user mentioned \"windows dual boot\" and \"dual boot installation,\" which likely refers to a technical setup involving policies and requirements. Given the context, it seems appropriate to classify it under \"Administrative rights\" since installing a dual boot usually requires those permissions. So, I\u2019ll respond with the appropriate JSON output.**Categorizing IT installation**\n\nI have a list of categories to consider: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Looking at the user's mention of \"dual boot installation,\" it\u2019s likely related to \"Administrative rights\" because that usually requires admin access. There\u2019s a hint of compliance in \"special requirements by policies,\" which also points toward needing admin privileges. So, I think the best fit is clearly \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d for this IT ticket.**Deciding on category output**\n\nI\u2019m considering which category fits best, leaning toward \"Administrative rights\" since dual boot installations typically require admin access. If it\u2019s part of a larger project, \"Internal Project\" could apply, but given the ambiguity, \"Administrative rights\" is the safer choice. I\u2019ll prepare the JSON output, which should look like this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. It seems the system requires this specific format, so I'll ensure it's formatted correctly before providing it."
