They've provided a message that isn\u2019t very clear but mentions \u201cincidents configured daily alerts\u201d and \u201cworking days Friday.\u201d It seems related to alert configurations, likely suggesting there\u2019s an issue with incident alerts that don\u2019t work on weekends. I\u2019m considering a few categories\u2014like \u201cInternal Project,\u201d \u201cAdministrative Rights,\u201d \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d or \u201cAccess.\u201d I\u2019ll focus on what fits best based on their concerns about alert configuration.**Categorizing Alert Issue**\n\nThe user\u2019s message mentions \"working days Friday,\" which suggests that alerts might only function on Fridays. It\u2019s not entirely clear what they mean by needing further information, but I need to categorize this ticket. The categories to choose from are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative Rights. \"Access\" might fit if it's related to alerts, but \"Administrative Rights\" could apply if they require permissions to configure alerts. I'll need to think through which fits best!**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user\u2019s message about \"incidents configured daily alerts\" could mean they want help with setting up daily alerts for incidents. The part about \"working days Friday\" might refer to the scheduling of these alerts. While it seems a bit ambiguous, my first instinct is to categorize it as \"Miscellaneous,\" which is often used for unclear issues in ticketing.\n\nHowever, \"Internal Project\" might be more fitting if they\u2019re referring to configuring alerts for an internal task, especially since the mention of \"senior engineer\" hints at a corporate setting. I'll keep it vague yet practical for the response format. Let's go with a JSON object, ensuring it\u2019s exactly as required. \n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}**Categorizing Alerts Setup**\n\nThe phrase \"incidents configured daily alerts\" suggests that the user is asking for help with setting up monitoring or alert configurations. However, since none of the categories specifically mention \"Alerts\" or \"Monitoring,\" the best fit would be \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll go ahead and prepare the response in the required format. I'll return it as a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Now, I\u2019m ready to provide that response!"
