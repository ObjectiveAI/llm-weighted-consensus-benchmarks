The prompt gives categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. The ticket describes issues with a phone that keeps logging out and getting disconnected, along with mentions of cables and moving desks. It seems related to hardware because it's about physical devices and connectivity. While \"Access\" could apply if logging out concerns access, the focus seems more on hardware issues.**Categorizing IT ticket issue**\n\nThe core issue is that the phone logs out and disconnects, likely related to cables after changing phones and moving desks. It points to a hardware issue with the desk phone or VoIP device. So, I think the appropriate category is \"Hardware.\" I know I should return a JSON object according to the category schema. The final output will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"} \n\nI\u2019ll make sure the formatting meets the system's exact requirements.**Deciding on category for ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether the category could be \"Access\" since it involves being logged out. But the user\u2019s issue is mainly about the device disconnecting, and it seems tied to physical hardware connections like cables. They mention changing phones, moving desks, and dealing with waiting on discovery. The focus on cables and connectivity makes it clear that this is primarily a hardware issue. Since there's no specific \"Networking\" category, \"Hardware\" feels like the best fit here.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
