The text includes phrases like \"monitor request\" and \"provide monitor,\" which suggests it relates to hardware. While \"Purchase\" is a separate category specifically for procurement, the core request seems to focus on hardware needs. It's also possible it ties to an \"Internal Project,\" but it feels more straightforward as a hardware request. Given this, I think I'll classify it as \"Hardware.\"**Classifying hardware request**\n\nI'm working on categorizing a ticket that requests a monitor. If it\u2019s about providing a monitor, that fits under hardware. The wording suggests it could be a purchase, but it\u2019s primarily focused on requesting a monitor. Since \u201chello please provide monitor\u201d implies supplying one, I think it\u2019s best to categorize this as \"Hardware\" since it's related to hardware provisioning. The distinction between \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase\" is important, but this request feels straightforwardly about supplying a monitor.**Deciding on the category**\n\nThe phrase \"monitor request\" suggests a request for a monitor, which could mean it falls under either \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" Since the user is asking to \"provide a monitor,\" it seems more appropriate to classify this as a request to procure equipment, making it a \"Purchase.\" I want to ensure I output it correctly as a JSON object, so I'll format it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text, just the JSON as specified."
