The message mentions a \"new starter,\" an \"intern,\" and \"workstation,\" which suggests it relates to onboarding and setting up hardware. It could potentially fall under either \"Hardware\" or \"Access.\" However, since it focuses on setting up a workstation, I think the best fit is \"Hardware.\" The unclear parts, like \"added location\" and \"find attached,\" are interesting but don't change the overall category.**Finalizing JSON Output**\n\nI\u2019m considering the IT ticket classification again. While there\u2019s a chance it could relate to \"Access\" or even \"Administrative rights,\" it seems safest to categorize it as \"Hardware\" since it focuses on the workstation setup. I need to stick to the required JSON format that includes \"category\" within the object. The output should be streamlined, so I\u2019ll keep it concise: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nThis way, I ensure it's structured correctly without any extra text!**Confirming IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to ensure that I\u2019m considering whether the ticket might imply \"HR Support\" due to the mention of a \"new starter.\" However, since we\u2019re focusing mainly on IT ticket categorization, it\u2019s clear that the relevant category is \"Hardware.\" It's important to stick to the context of IT issues rather than drifting into HR topics. So, I feel confident that the best classification remains \"Hardware.\" That solidifies my final answer!"
