The options to choose from include \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" and \"Internal Project.\" Since this ticket isn't specifically about hardware, HR, or purchases, it seems most appropriate to go with \"Miscellaneous.\" Even though \"Access\" was considered, the focus on the certificate error points clearly toward \"Miscellaneous.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering which category fits best for this IT ticket. It seems to fall under \"Miscellaneous\" given the user's mention of a certificate error. I ruled out \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Hardware,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I thought about \"Access,\" but since the issue is about a certificate error rather than access control, that doesn't apply. Even \"Internal Project\" doesn\u2019t work here. So, the final decision is to categorize it as \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format now: \n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
