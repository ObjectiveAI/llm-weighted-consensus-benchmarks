It might be asking for important dates related to their weekend schedule. I'll lean towards categorizing it under \"HR Support.\"**Deciding on IT ticket categories**\n\nThe categories for the IT ticket include \"HR Support\" for onboarding tasks, \"Internal Project\" for internal projects, \"Administrative rights\" for admin requests, and \"Access\" related to system access. The ticket states \"new starter hello please fill date weekend,\" which seems to imply onboarding and perhaps filling out a date. It's a bit unclear, but I feel \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category, while \"Access\" might not fully apply here. I should prioritize clarity!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I should go straight to that without overthinking. The ticket mentions \"new starter,\" which definitely indicates HR onboarding. While there's a possibility of it being related to system access due to the new starter, the phrase \"please fill date weekend\" suggests it may be about scheduling. Since \"new starter\" strongly leans towards HR onboarding, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" The output will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
