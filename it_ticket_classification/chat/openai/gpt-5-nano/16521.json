The user's block of text looks like a messy mix about a planned outage, with mentions of on-site assessments and forms. It could fit the \"Internal Project\" category, given the context, but it's not definitively about access rights. I'm considering \"Access\" since there are hints about system access during the outage, even if it's not explicitly stated. The overall tone seems to indicate urgent coordination.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out which category fits best among the options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights. \"Internal Project\" seems to be the right choice since the content is about planned outage coordination, which requires forms and teamwork. \"Administrative rights\" isn\u2019t applicable here, and \"Miscellaneous\" is too vague. The content mentions high importance and confidentiality related to the outage, so I'll categorize this IT Ticket as \"Internal Project.\"{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
