The text describes an issue with change requests in a management system where cloned changes still show as active, even if they\u2019ve been set to draft. It looks like a bug in the system\u2019s handling of cloned changes, which means this situation relates to software behavior. So, I'll categorize it under \"Miscellaneous\" since it doesn't fit neatly into the other categories.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to determine the right category for this IT ticket. It doesn't align with hardware, HR, access, storage, purchase, or internal projects. It could potentially fall under \"Administrative rights\" since it discusses changes in ownership but focuses on an application bug in the change management system. There\u2019s also the possibility of it fitting into \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d Considering it\u2019s about status updates after cloning rather than a feature request, I think \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d might be the best choice.**Finalizing category**\n\nIt looks like I've decided to categorize the IT ticket as \"Miscellaneous.\" This seems like the best fit given its nature as an application bug rather than fitting into more specific categories. Now, I just need to prepare to deliver this category assignment. It's straightforward, but I want to make sure everything is clear before I send it off. Let's get it done!"
