The ticket mentions several aspects like leave date, location, access rights, and mailbox. So, I need to decide which category from the provided list fits best. It sounds like the main category is likely \"Access,\" since it deals with deprovisioning rights and access for the departing employee. I\u2019ll output this as a JSON object with the appropriate category.**Deciding category for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket related to a leaver form and leave date. While it could fit under HR Support due to terms like \"leaver form,\" it\u2019s really about IT aspects. It makes sense to classify it under \"Access\" because it's about deactivating accounts and managing access rights. Since only one category is allowed, I'll choose \"Access\" as the best fit and will produce a JSON object without any extra text. Here's the final output: {\"category\": \"Access\"}."
