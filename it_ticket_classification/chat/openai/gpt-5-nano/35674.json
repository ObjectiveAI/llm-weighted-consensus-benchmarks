They mentioned that they can't submit it and have tried restarting Internet Explorer and using Chrome. This seems like it could be an access or permissions issue related to the timesheet application. It might also fall under HR support since it involves submitting a timesheet. Depending on specific details, it could even be categorized as miscellaneous if none of these fit perfectly.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI need to assign a category to an IT ticket about timesheet submission, which relates to HR support. Given that the user asked for help and mentioned difficulty submitting their timesheet, it fits under \"HR Support.\" They also tried different browsers, suggesting a potential app issue, but it\u2019s still primarily an HR matter. Now, I must ensure the JSON response matches the format by using exact capitalization. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}**Responding with JSON**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I should respond with just a JSON object for the category. Since the user is unable to submit their timesheet, it seems most fitting to categorize it as \"HR Support.\" Although there could be an argument for \"Access\" due to potential login issues, the user provided details about trying different browsers, which suggests it's primarily an HR issue. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and deliver:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
