They seem to be asking for changes related to approvals after commits. So, I\u2019m trying to interpret their intent: is this primarily about access, administrative rights, or possibly an internal project? The best category seems to be \"Access\" based on the request\u2019s focus.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user is asking to grant rights for merging without required default reviewers and to set those reviewers. This involves configuring repository policies and admin rights. I see there's a specific category for \"Administrative rights,\" which fits well here. While \"Access\" could work because it's about permissions, \"Administrative rights\" feels more precise considering the context. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" and respond with the JSON format: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. Only the category should be included, no extra text.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
