It mentions a \u201cleavers report,\u201d which makes me think it relates to employee turnover. Choosing the right category is important! The \"HR Support\" category seems to fit best since it concerns HR data. There's also \"Miscellaneous\" in case it's not entirely clear. I\u2019ll lean towards \"HR Support\" because it deals with HR reports directly.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's message about a \"missing report\" and \"leavers report\" indicates a discrepancy between reports. They are requesting an explanation and correction, which makes me lean towards categorizing this as \"HR Support\" since it involves HR data. It doesn't seem to fit under access, internal projects, or administrative rights. Therefore, I'll conclude to categorize it as \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll output the category in the expected JSON-like format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
