I\u2019ll choose the category that makes the most sense based on the context.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe ticket talks about an error related to submitting a sheet and mentions testing and leads, which makes me think it could relate to an \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It clearly isn\u2019t about hardware or access rights. Since it's tied to testing within a project, \"Internal Project\" might be the best fit. The \"Miscellaneous\" category is too vague for specific issues. I\u2019ll finalize my categorization with a JSON object indicating \"Internal Project\" as the chosen category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
