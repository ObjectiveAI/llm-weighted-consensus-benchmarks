They mention changing settings teams have regarding project resources and notifying about an outage. The potential categories could be \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Change management,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" From the provided categories, \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Internal Project\" seem to fit best since the content revolves around accessing project resources and changes in settings. Let's narrow it down to those options!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe messages mention \"resources,\" \"teams' access to project resources,\" \"change settings,\" and \"notify teams.\" It looks like I need to inform teams about these changes and any outages. I think \"Access\" is a suitable category since it's about permissions to resources. \"Administrative rights\" might work if it's specifically about changing those rights. However, since it's mainly about access and changes to settings, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" in a JSON object. Let's go with that!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
