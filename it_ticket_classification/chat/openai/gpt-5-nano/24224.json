The original message is quite messy and includes terms like \"removal,\" \"service now,\" \"December PM removal,\" \"removed groups,\" \"active directory,\" and \"virus.\" It seems it could pertain to removing users or groups in ServiceNow. Given all this, it likely falls under the \"Access\" category because it's addressing permissions related to removed groups and Active Directory.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIn the IT ticket taxonomy, I recognize there\u2019s an \"Access\" category, especially since the request involves removal of access and groups. I must classify it as \"Access.\" The available categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" among others. It could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" due to potential admin removal, but it\u2019s not explicitly stated. Given the context, including terms like \"service now,\" \"removed groups,\" and \"active directory,\" I think \"Access\" is the safest choice to categorize this ticket. I'll return the category in the required JSON format.**Responding with Category**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object for the IT ticket categorization. The required format specifies that I include the \"category\" key. Since the user asked me to categorize the ticket, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Even though I could add a justification, it seems unnecessary for this instruction, so I\u2019ll stick to the essentials. My final output will be clean and concise, just like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
