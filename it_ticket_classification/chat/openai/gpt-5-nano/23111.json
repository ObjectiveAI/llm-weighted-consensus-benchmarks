The text mentions \"new interns,\" \"school of testing,\" and \"administration officer.\" It feels like it falls under HR Support or Administrative rights because of keywords like \"bulk starter form\" and \"administration officer.\" However, since \"HR Support\" is specifically for human resources requests and aligns closely with the mention of interns and forms, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"HR Support.\"**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket. The text mentions things like \"new interns,\" \"bulk starter form,\" and addresses an \"administration officer,\" suggesting it's about onboarding interns. The categories \"Administrative\" and \"HR Support\" come to mind, but \"Administrative rights\" wouldn't apply here since it\u2019s about forms and support for interns. I think the best fit is \"HR Support\" since it focuses on the onboarding process. I'll organize that into a JSON-like format.**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to respond using the specified \"category\" format in my output. The requirements indicate that I should provide a JSON-like object showing \"category\" as one of the enumerated values. Given the context of the IT ticket, I'll specify it as \"HR Support.\" \n\nSo my final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI should stick strictly to this format without adding extra text, as that's what's required in the instructions. I'll deliver it as per the schema."
