It seems clear that they\u2019re asking about how the camera will be used, so I think it fits best under the \"Hardware\" category.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIt looks like this ticket falls under the \"Hardware\" category. The user mentions \"camera for android course,\" suggesting it's about equipment needed for training. The options I have are Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others, but this request is really about clarifying the camera\u2019s purpose rather than making a purchase.
