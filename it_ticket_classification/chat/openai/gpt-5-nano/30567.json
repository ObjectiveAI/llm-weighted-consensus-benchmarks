However, since it talks about granting access, it could also be relevant to \"Administrative rights.\" But without additional details, I'll go with \u201cAccess\u201d as a more general choice. I also need to format this as JSON with a category field.**Outputting IT ticket category**\n\nI see that I need to categorize the IT ticket based on the user's instructions. The ticket mentions \"board board,\" which likely means \"board access,\" so it falls under the \"Access\" category. The instructions tell me to provide that in a JSON format. There's no ambiguity, and I feel confident that \"Access\" is the right choice. So, I\u2019ll format my response precisely as: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and return that."
