It mentions issues about \"oracle leaver missing notifications\" and \"please check remove other leavers.\" This could fit into the \"Access\" category since it deals with user deactivation and notifications in Oracle, particularly for employee departures. Terms like \"missing notifications\" and \"reports\" support this idea. While \"Administrative rights\" might be another option, \"Access\" seems to be the most appropriate category.**Determining JSON response**\n\nThe issue at hand is about removing access for leavers while also addressing missing notifications. It seems clear that this relates more to OS or system access, making \"Access\" the most fitting category. I need to respond with a JSON object that follows the required format, which specifies a \"category\" with a value of \"Access.\" I must ensure there's no extra text, just this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nLet's deliver that cleanly!"
