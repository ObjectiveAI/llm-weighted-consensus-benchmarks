Since this is an IT ticket, it could relate to \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" due to the mention of assigning someone. \"Lead\" could indicate a team lead context.**Selecting IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket might fit into \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" based on its unclear content. Since it pertains to accessing permissions, categorizing it as \"Access\" seems reasonable if they're looking to assign access. Given the phrase \"permanent basis,\" it could be referencing employment status, which doesn\u2019t fit IT. We also have \"Internal Project\" if it involves assigning someone internally. If all else fails, I could fallback to \"Miscellaneous,\" but I want to choose the best option. I'll respond with a JSON object like {\"category\":\"Access\"} and note that the content is unclear.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
