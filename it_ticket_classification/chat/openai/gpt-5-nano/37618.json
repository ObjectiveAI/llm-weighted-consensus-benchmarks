It's a bit garbled, but I'm piecing it together!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI've recognized that \"Software\" isn't a valid category for this IT ticket. Given the context, \"Administrative rights\" could fit if it's about approvals and access. I see keywords like \"approval\" and \"menu,\" which suggest it\u2019s linked to an \"Access\" request, possibly about an approval workflow. There's mention of an attachment too, which reinforces that idea. Based on what I gather, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access\" and prepare the JSON output accordingly!**Producing category JSON**\n\nI need to produce the JSON for the category, which should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The wrapper \"category\" is indeed the key I need based on the provided schema, and it should be valid JSON. While I could ask the user for clarification since the ticket they provided was a bit messy, the main task is to categorize it. I\u2019ll stick with stating \"likely Access due to approval\" and respond concisely with the correct JSON format."
