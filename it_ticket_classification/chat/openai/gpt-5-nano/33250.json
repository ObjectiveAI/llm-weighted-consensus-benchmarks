The available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket text indicates that it's a purchase request, mentioning device approvals and delivery details regarding a Galaxy device. So, it seems clear to categorize this under \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll format the output as JSON with the appropriate category field.**Returning JSON category**\n\nThe prompt provides a category schema that details how to format my response as a JSON object. I need to ensure that I return the category as a string from the provided enumerated options. Since the content clearly indicates a purchase request with keywords like \"purchase,\" \"approved,\" and \"deliver device,\" I will categorize it as \"Purchase.\" So my final output will be exactly: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I'll make sure to use the exact case required!"
