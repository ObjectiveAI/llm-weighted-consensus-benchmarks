The content seems related to an \"annual service recovery test,\" along with various elements like service name, restore location, and documentation templates. It feels like it might fit under \"Internal Project,\" but \"Miscellaneous\" could also work. It's not really about hardware or access, so I'll lean toward \"Internal Project.\"**Categorizing the project**\n\nThis ticket seems project-related, with various templates and documents involved in service recovery testing, so it likely falls under \u201cInternal Project.\u201d While it could relate to \u201cStorage\u201d concerning restore locations, it really focuses more on planning and documentation. \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t fit since it\u2019s not about access rights. So I\u2019ll categorize it as \u201cInternal Project\u201d and format the response as a JSON object: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI\u2019ll stick to just that JSON format, as that\u2019s what the user expects."
