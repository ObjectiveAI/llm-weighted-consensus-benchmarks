I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object, ensuring it clearly shows the category as \"Purchase.\" The final output should just include the required JSON structure, without any additional text.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the provided instruction. The application's requirement is to return a JSON object that includes just the category as a string. My focus will be on ensuring that I follow this instruction precisely and avoid any unnecessary details in the response. I'll keep it simple and direct, producing the required JSON format as specified. This way, I fulfill the task without adding any extra text."
