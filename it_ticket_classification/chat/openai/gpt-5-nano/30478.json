I need to choose from categories like \"HR Support\" and \"Access.\" The mention of an \"approver\" and \"interim approve leave requests\" leans towards HR processes rather than strictly IT. So, I\u2019ll likely classify it under \"HR Support,\" since it seems more relevant to leave approvals and HR functions than technical issues.**Categorizing an HR ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing a ticket that discusses the annual leave approver, focusing on requests for Tuesday PM. Since it\u2019s related to approving leave, \"HR Support\" seems like the right category in our IT ticket taxonomy. While \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if it involved granting approval rights, it doesn\u2019t quite fit here. I\u2019ll output the category in the required JSON format as a string: \"category\": \"HR Support,\" focusing solely on the categorization.**Outputting the category in JSON**\n\nThe instructions indicate that I need to provide a JSON object with a field labeled \"category\" and set its value to \"HR Support.\" The format suggests I should follow a specific schema, which makes it clear that the answer needs to be a proper JSON object. So, I should produce: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. It's important to ensure that I don't include any extra explanations\u2014just focus on delivering the correct format straight away!"
