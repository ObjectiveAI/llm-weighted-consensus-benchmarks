I think \"Internal Project\" fits based on these details.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nIt seems like this IT ticket should be categorized as \"Internal Project\" since it involves project codes and PM role assignments. It could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" if it's more about setting up forms, but given the focus on new project codes and management roles, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best choice. I think I need to respond with a JSON object that specifies this category, formatted correctly for usage in code.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
