The text is quite garbled, but it mentions topics like \"notification,\" \"public address,\" and \"planned works infrastructure.\" It seems to discuss changes to a public address and possibly a request related to these changes. I'm considering which category fits best\u2014like Hardware, HR Support, or Miscellaneous\u2014since it relates to infrastructure changes and public address. I'm pondering how best to classify it!**Determining ticket categories**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize the IT ticket. It seems tied to \"planned works infrastructure\" and \"public address,\" leading me to think it might fit under \"Internal Project.\" However, it could also relate to \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are needed to change the address. The mention of \"public address\" could suggest it\u2019s about access, but \"Infrastructure\" isn\u2019t a category I can use. Out of all the options, \"Internal Project\" looks like the best fit, though I'm hesitating with \"Administrative rights\" as a possibility too.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI think this ticket likely relates to DNS or IP address range for external access, so it shouldn't fall under hardware or storage categories. \"Internal Project\" seems the best fit, but I could also consider \"Miscellaneous\" if there\u2019s any uncertainty. However, since it's focused on planned works infrastructure, I'll stick with \"Internal Project.\" I need to format my response as a JSON object with just the output, so I'll go with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Perfect!"
