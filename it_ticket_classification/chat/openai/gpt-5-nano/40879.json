Since there\u2019s no \"Performance\" category, I think classifying it as \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the best option.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Hardware.\" It seems to reflect a general IT performance issue, and \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the best catch-all option. I could think about \"Administrative rights\" if it seemed like a permissions issue, but that doesn\u2019t apply here. \n\nSince the task requests a JSON format with the category, I\u2019ll craft the response as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} and avoid any extraneous text."
