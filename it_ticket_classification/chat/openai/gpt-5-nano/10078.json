It appears to be high priority and involves a compliance officer. There are mentions of roles like a senior Android developer and completing forms. For the IT ticket, categorizing it under \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" makes sense since it involves provisioning accounts and administrative permissions related to onboarding. Overall, it's about assisting with access during this process.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI think this IT ticket should be categorized as \"HR Support\" because it focuses on onboarding forms and involves a compliance officer. The user seems to want help with categorization rather than answering a ticket. The request mentions things like joining, development, and location in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. Since it lacks specifics about systems and is more about HR onboarding, \"HR Support\" seems like the right choice. I'll format the output as JSON: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
