Since it involves internal project management tasks, like assigning a project manager, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the most fitting category. The prompt suggests I need to respond with a JSON object that contains this category. Following the instructions, I\u2019ll format my response as {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"} to align with the schema provided. Keeping it straightforward!**Finalizing category response**\n\nThe instruction asks me to categorize the IT ticket, and I need to keep it straightforward. I'll provide the category in the specified JSON format, which is {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It's important to ensure that it\u2019s in proper JSON format without any additional commentary. Keeping it minimal is key. So, I\u2019ll proceed with that response!"
