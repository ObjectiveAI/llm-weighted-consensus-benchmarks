It talks about various topics like change management, application discipline, and naming conventions. It seems to be about renaming to avoid confusion and improving communication among owners. Given these points, I'd probably categorize this as \"Internal Project\" since it involves getting things organized and coordinated without reinventing the wheel. Let's make sure the ticket gets classified properly!**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe IT ticket seems to be about change management and application discipline, with references to renaming and coordinating between owners. The right category options are limited, but \"Internal Project\" stands out since it covers internal processes and improvements. I won't choose \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" as they don\u2019t fit here. So, it looks like I should respond with a JSON-like format stating the category as \"Internal Project.\" Just need to double-check before finalizing!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
