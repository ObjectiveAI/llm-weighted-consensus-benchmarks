Based on the content, it seems to focus on hardware like wireless controllers, access points, and antennas, as well as licensing bundles. I'm considering the schema provided and will likely categorize it as either \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" Given the emphasis on hardware components, \"Hardware\" feels like the better fit here!**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI think this request should be categorized as a \"Purchase.\" The user's inquiry about pricing for infrastructure components, like wireless controllers and antennas, clearly indicates they are looking to make a purchase. So I'll craft a JSON response that matches the schema provided. I need to ensure my response is concise and in the required format, so I'll just output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. That keeps it simple and allows for clear communication!"
