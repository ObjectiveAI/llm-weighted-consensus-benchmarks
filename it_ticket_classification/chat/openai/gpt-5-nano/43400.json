This looks like a helpdesk classification task, and I have specific categories to choose from: \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" \"HR Support,\" etc. Since they're having trouble accessing Oracle, it seems like an application access issue. I'll classify this under \"Access\" because there's no mention of permissions, just the access problem.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI have my category determined: \"Access.\" Now, I need to create the JSON output correctly. The instructions indicate that I should respond in a specific format, providing a category object. The structure asks for an object with a \"category\" field. So, I will output: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra commentary. Although there are mentions of relocation and next steps, the main issue remains the inability to access Oracle, confirming that \"Access\" is the right category. Now, I'll just finalize this!"
