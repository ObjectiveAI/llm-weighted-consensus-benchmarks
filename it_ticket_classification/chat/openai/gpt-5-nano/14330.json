Given this context, \"Access\" seems the most fitting category, considering the focus on repository access.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe phrase \u201crepository hi write repository users think permissions\u201d could imply they\u2019re asking about write permissions. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this under \"Access\" since it focuses on access to the repository. However, if they need admin privileges to write, I could consider \"Administrative rights.\"\n\nThe mention of \"access to repository Thursday PM\" might suggest they want limited access then. Given these clues, \"Access\" seems to cover the request best, as it generally addresses access issues without implying admin privileges."
