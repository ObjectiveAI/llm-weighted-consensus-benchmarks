The allowed categories include \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase,\" and it looks like this request falls under \"Hardware\" since it specifically asks for a monitor, which is a piece of hardware. It also mentions ordering the monitor, leading me to consider the \"Purchase\" category. Ultimately, I think \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category for this ticket.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the content of the IT ticket that requests an additional monitor. The mention of \"additional monitor required\" clearly indicates it\u2019s a hardware request. While there\u2019s an action to order, which could suggest \"Purchase,\" many IT systems categorize it under \"Hardware\" for equipment requests. Since the user wants a single category, I believe \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate fit for this ticket since it directly pertains to the monitor requested.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
