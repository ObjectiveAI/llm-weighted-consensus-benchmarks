The categories to choose from include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Since the ticket doesn't clearly fit into any specific category like \"Email/Software,\" I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit. It doesn't concern access permissions, so I'll go with that to ensure it's categorized correctly.**Deciding on category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on the user's mention of Outlook issues. I've ruled out categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase,\" leaving \"Miscellaneous\" as the best choice. There's no specific \"Software\" category, so it fits best here. The instructions tell me to respond only with a JSON object containing the category. I\u2019ll prepare the output as: {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"} without any extra commentary. Keeping it clean and simple!**Finalizing category choice**\n\nSometimes I wonder if \"Access\" might be more appropriate because the user mentioned the \"search option\" not working in Outlook. However, I still feel that it doesn't really fit that category. It's definitely more about a general Outlook issue rather than a specific access problem. So, I think sticking with \"Miscellaneous\" is the right call. I\u2019m ready to finalize my response now!"
