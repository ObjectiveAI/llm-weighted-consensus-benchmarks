The user talks about increasing the mailbox size in Outlook to manage large files from clients and teams. The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since this issue relates to the mailbox size being inadequate, it seems to fit best under Storage. That's where I'll categorize it to ensure it gets the right kind of attention for escalation.**Parsing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m breaking down the user\u2019s input about the \"outlook mailbox size\" and the need to increase it to manage large files from clients and various teams. It seems like they want to avoid permanently deleting emails due to space issues, so it definitely fits under the Storage category. \n\nI need to respond in the correct format, outputting the JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} without any extra content, since the user simply asked to categorize the IT ticket.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
