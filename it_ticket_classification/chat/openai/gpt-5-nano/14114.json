The output will be in JSON format, like this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.**Parsing IT request**\n\nLet's break down the request: \"request tuesday pm hello please rights head.\" The ticket appears to be a request, and \"tuesday pm\" likely indicates scheduling. Now, \"hello please rights head\" seems like it\u2019s asking for access or permissions, possibly related to a specific person or role (\"head\"). \n\nGiven the mention of \"rights,\" it makes sense to categorize this as \"Administrative rights\" for privileges, but if I'm unsure, I might lean towards \"Access\" as a more general option. The phrasing is a bit ambiguous, though!**Delivering category object**\n\nI need to deliver a simple JSON object with a category field. Given the ticket's focus on rights and access related to Tuesday PM, \"Access\" seems appropriate. I'll format the response as instructed and create the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This will ensure I provide just the necessary information without any extra text. It\u2019s important to keep the format valid and straightforward. So, I'll submit that JSON object as my final response."
