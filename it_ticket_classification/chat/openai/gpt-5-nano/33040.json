The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It seems like the ticket revolves around training codes, suggesting it falls under \u201cAccess.\u201d I\u2019ll format my response in JSON to indicate the appropriate category succinctly. My response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Evaluating training codes category**\n\nThis ticket seems focused on codes related to trainings and activating them. It might be about access to those training sessions, which leads me to believe the \"Access\" category is the right choice since it deals directly with permissions for these codes. \"Administrative rights\" wouldn't fit since it's not about system permissions. I've ruled out other categories like Purchase and Internal Project. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as Access and respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
