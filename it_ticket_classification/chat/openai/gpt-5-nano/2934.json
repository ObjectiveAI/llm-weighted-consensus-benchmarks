I see two possible categories: \"Hardware\" because it's about a hardware accessory, or \"Purchase\" since they might be requesting to buy it. It seems to fit under \"Hardware,\" which relates to peripherals, but it would also make sense under \"Purchase\" if they want to procure one. I'll consider these options when finalizing the category.**Classifying IT ticket requests**\n\nThe text about the \"request for laptop stand cooler\" indicates it's likely a request for a hardware item. I see it fits best under \"Hardware,\" as it involves a cooling stand, a type of peripheral. There's also \"Purchase,\" but since there\u2019s no mention of procurement specifics, I\u2019ll stick to \"Hardware.\" I need to respond in a structured JSON-like format, so I\u2019ll provide a category field with \"Hardware\" and include a brief justification for clarity.**Formatting the IT ticket category**\n\nThe system indicates I need to provide a JSON object for the category. The instruction is clear: I should output just the category based on the ticket request. I\u2019ll format it correctly as a JSON object, specifically ensuring the field is labeled \"category.\" Thus, I\u2019ll deliver it as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I want to keep it succinct, so there's no extra text or explanation beyond that."
