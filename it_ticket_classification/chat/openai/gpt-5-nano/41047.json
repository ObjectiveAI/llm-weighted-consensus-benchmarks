The details mention a \"critical alert,\" \"tape failed,\" and \"administrator console,\" suggesting that it relates to hardware issues. Therefore, I want to classify it appropriately within the schema provided. It seems the best fit for this ticket involves selecting the \"Hardware\" category. Once I've confirmed that, I'll format the response as a JSON object that fits the specified schema.**Deciding category for ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket regarding the tape failure. Initially, I thought \"Storage\" since it directly relates to the tape medium. However, it could also be labeled as \"Hardware\" if it's a hardware issue with the tape drive. Given that the description specifically mentions \"tape failed,\" it leans more toward \"Storage.\" I'll format my final response as a JSON object that clearly states the category as \"Storage.\""
