The ticket mentions \"assisting with her connection\" and \"blocker settings,\" indicating it's definitely related to access. So, I think the \"Access\" category is the best fit. I\u2019ll format my output as a JSON-like object, ensuring it clearly reflects the category choice as required. Let's get this structured properly!**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to create a JSON object for the category field, and it should be set to \"Access\" based on the user's ticket about connection issues. The text mentions changing blocker settings, which suggests it\u2019s fundamentally an access issue. Although I briefly consider if \"Miscellaneous\" might work, the emphasis on access makes \"Access\" the most appropriate choice. So, I\u2019ll keep it simple and just return {\"category\":\"Access\"} as instructed. Let's deliver that!"
