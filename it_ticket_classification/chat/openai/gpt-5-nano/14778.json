The ticket seems to be about adding technical evaluators for evaluations and mentions adding user accounts or access, along with removing others. It looks like it fits best under \"Access\" since it deals with user access provisioning. While \"Administrative rights\" could work, it's more about permissions, and this ticket is focused on adding evaluators. So I'll go with \"Access.\"**Finalizing category for IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket is definitely about system provisioning, so I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" I need to format the output as a JSON object with a specific schema. The instruction clearly states to provide just the category without any extra commentary. So, I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I think this captures everything clearly. Let\u2019s make sure it\u2019s straightforward and meets the requirements! I'll finalize it now as just the JSON object."
