Another option could be \"Internal Project\" if it's for a specific task or \"Administrative rights\" if it's a permissions issue. Based on the user's wording about the Explorer browser, it looks like they might want to view rights related to access issues. I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" and format the response in JSON. Here's how that looks: {\"category\": \"Access\"}.**Formatting the category response**\n\nThe instructions specify that I need to provide a \"category\" block. Usually, the output is formatted like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure it aligns with the schema required, where it\u2019s an object containing the \"category\" field, with \"Access\" being one of the valid options. The user didn\u2019t ask for any extra detail, so I\u2019ll just give them the straightforward JSON response without any extra text. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
