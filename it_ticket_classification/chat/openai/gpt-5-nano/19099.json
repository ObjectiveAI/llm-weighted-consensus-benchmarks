The user\u2019s message reads, \"add member to Wednesday March PM add member hi add please help thanks mob.\" It looks like they're requesting to add someone, which likely falls under either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The mention of \"add member\" usually suggests they're adding someone to a meeting or project, so \"Internal Project\" could also be a potential fit. I'll consider these categories to classify the ticket accurately!**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm working with limited categories for this IT ticket. \"Access\" seems fitting for granting access to a resource, like a calendar or group, although the user didn\u2019t specify what they're referring to. The request involves adding a member to something on Wednesday, which might be a meeting or distribution list. \"Administrative rights\" could be considered, but since there are no specifics about rights, I'll default to \"Access.\" I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format as {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
