Based on these details, it looks like the best category to assign would be \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll ensure I map it accurately to help the user streamline their request.**Crafting JSON response**\n\nI can categorize the ticket as \"Purchase\" since it revolves around purchase orders, requisitions, and suppliers. The repeated mentions of \"document purchase order requisition implemented\" alongside terms like \"assignee\" and \"task number\" reinforce this. I need to format my answer correctly following the specified JSON structure. So, I\u2019ll ensure the output is strictly as instructed, without extra text, producing: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. That should meet the requirements!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
