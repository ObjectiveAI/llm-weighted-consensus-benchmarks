It looks like they're asking for a password reset and checking access to a board view. The terms like \"reset password,\" \"administrator,\" and \"external directory\" point to issues surrounding access. I should classify this under the \u201cAccess\u201d category, as it primarily involves granting access and resetting a password related to their request. The user holds a position as a senior tester, so this could be important too.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe category for this ticket should be \"Access\" since it relates to a password reset request. While \"Administrative rights\" might seem relevant, the primary focus is on access rather than elevated privileges. The user\u2019s message indicates a need to reset their password and contact their administrator for further details. Therefore, the clear choice is to categorize it under \"Access.\" I\u2019ll craft the answer in the required format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
