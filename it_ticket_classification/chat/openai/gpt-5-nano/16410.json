It looks like it's a request regarding a purchase order and a device swap. The text mentions \"purchase order,\" \"swap,\" \"old device cleaning,\" \"accessories,\" and \"cover glass.\" Given these details, I believe this ticket fits best under the \"Hardware\" category, as it relates to devices and purchasing specifically. It's important to make sure this is sorted correctly for efficient handling!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"allocation purchase order,\" \"swap required,\" \"complement device,\" and \"hand cover glass,\" suggesting a hardware-related request. It also emphasizes \"purchase order\" multiple times, which might lead me to categorize it under \"Purchase,\" but it primarily focuses on swapping devices and accessories. While \"Purchase\" applies to allocation requests, \"Hardware\" seems more fitting since it deals directly with devices and accessories involved in the swap. It\u2019s a little confusing, but I\u2019ll sort it accordingly!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe main action in the ticket is about swapping an old device for a new one, along with installation and accessories like the cover glass. Even though \"purchase order\" is mentioned, the focus is clearly on the hardware swap, which is essential for categorization. IT tickets are typically categorized based on the type of issue. Therefore, I believe the best category is \"Hardware.\" I'll present the final answer in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
