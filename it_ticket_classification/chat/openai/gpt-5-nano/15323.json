The wording feels a bit scrambled but focuses on wanting to access the weekly agenda and schedule training. My best guess is to select the \u201cAccess\u201d category since that's the main concern. There\u2019s also a chance it could fit under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but \u201cAccess\u201d seems the most appropriate choice for this situation.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nIn IT ticket taxonomy, the \"Access\" category relates to permissions, logins, and similar requests. This particular ticket seems to ask for access to a schedule or agenda, which might relate to morning (AM) and afternoon (PM) training sessions. The user also mentions accepting or declining training invites, which further supports this. While \"Administrative rights\" focus more on specific permissions, the broader term \"Access\" is more fitting here. I need to format this as a JSON-like object for the category selection.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
