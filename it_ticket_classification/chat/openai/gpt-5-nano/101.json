It\u2019s mentioning logging allocation after receiving the items and a requirement for mandatory receipts. Since the request is clearly related to purchasing new hardware, I think it fits best under the \"Purchase\" category. However, it also touches on \u201cHardware.\u201d So I'll focus on \"Purchase\" as the primary category, since only one category is needed.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI see that the \"Purchase\" category clearly applies, particularly since the ticket mentions \"new purchase\" and \"receipts.\" It seems focused on purchase orders and allocation. While \"Hardware\" could also apply, the best choice here is \"Purchase,\" especially since only one category is allowed. Since the user requested categorization, I\u2019m going to format my response as a JSON object that reflects this choice. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe user's message indicates they want to purchase keyboards and wired headphones, along with logistics regarding receipts and purchase orders. It\u2019s clear that the main focus is on purchasing hardware items. Therefore, the most suitable category is definitely \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll make sure to format my response strictly according to the system requirements without any extra text. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll reply with: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
