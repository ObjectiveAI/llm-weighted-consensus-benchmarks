Given these details, the most appropriate category seems to be \"Access,\" though \"Administrative rights\" could work too. Since \"Administrative rights\" is a subset of access, I think I'll go with \"Access\" as the more general category.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions issues related to \"key being added roles developer,\" \"permission view,\" and \"access\" regarding a project. It seems like this is largely about access to a board, so I need to decide between categorizing it as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since the instructions say to categorize it, I think I'll go with \"Access.\" \n\nI just need to respond with a simple JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra commentary."
