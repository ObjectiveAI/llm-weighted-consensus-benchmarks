The user sent a messy ticket about a mouse problem, which seems to indicate a hardware issue. It sounds like they need a replacement mouse. So, I'll categorize it as Hardware, not Internal Project since it\u2019s specific to the mouse. Finally, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like object containing the category as per the format required.**Outputting category format**\n\nI need to output the category for the IT ticket as a JSON object. The simplest response would be {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, which captures the essence of the ticket about a mouse issue. However, there\u2019s a required format that suggests a JSON schema: it has to include an object type and properties. Since the safe approach is to return the straightforward JSON object, I'll go with {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} for clarity and compliance with the instructions.**Providing JSON output**\n\nThe required schema indicates I need to use a nested object, but I typically need to output a simple category value. However, it seems the format requires a top-level object wrapper. The field itself will be \"category\" with the value of \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll output {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to meet those needs without any extra text. From the user\u2019s message about the mouse problem, it confirms a hardware issue. So, I'll finalize my response as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
