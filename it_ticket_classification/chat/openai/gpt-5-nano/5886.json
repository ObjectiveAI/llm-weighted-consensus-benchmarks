We could also consider \"Internal Project\" if it ties to a project. Another note is some mention of logging, but overall, sticking with \"Hardware\" seems the simplest and most appropriate choice.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe mention of \"meeting room\" suggests we're dealing with a conference room device. To respond properly, I need to categorize the IT ticket using a JSON format as required. The instruction specifies that I should output a JSON object containing the category. Following the schema, I should confirm that it will just include {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It's important to keep the response simple and compliant with the schema, focusing solely on the category without extra content. So I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
