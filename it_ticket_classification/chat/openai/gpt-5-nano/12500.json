The categories available include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and others. Since the message seems related to onboarding and leave, \"HR Support\" fits best, as there's no specific category for \"HR Onboarding.\" I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support\" because it captures the essence of the user's request for help with this situation.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m weighing the best category for the IT ticket about a new starter and annual leave. It could suggest \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d but specifics on access aren't mentioned. I think \u201cHR Support\u201d is the best category since it relates to onboarding and HR processes. The user\u2019s focus on the new starter and annual leave points to HR. I\u2019ll categorize this ticket accordingly and respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
