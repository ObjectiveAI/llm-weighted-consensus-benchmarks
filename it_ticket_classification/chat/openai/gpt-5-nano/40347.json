Since it concerns HR processes, I'll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" The required format is a JSON object, and I need to ensure that it follows the specified schema, which includes the type as an object with a category property.\n\nI\u2019ll respond with the exact JSON required: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.
