The allowed categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and a few others. Since the content mentions secure wipe, which qualifies as data sanitization, it might relate to \"Hardware.\" However, \"unit for sale\" could indicate decommissioning, which might also lean toward \"Hardware.\" I'll make sure to create the JSON accurately based on these insights!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"secure wipe and verify functionality of unit for sale,\" which definitely points to hardware asset management and data sanitization. I'm thinking the category \"Storage\" could fit since it relates to wiping, but I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" since the task involves the actual unit and a secure wipe. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" don\u2019t apply here. Given everything, I\u2019m concluding to categorize it as \"Hardware\" and will respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Outputting Category for IT Ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket and provided allowed categories. I need to decide whether to output just the category name or follow the JSON structure from the schema they included. Ultimately, it looks best to stick with the JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. While the schema indicates the category as a property, it seems simple to just provide that response directly, which should work well for parsing. I\u2019ll focus on keeping it concise with just the JSON object in the answer!"
