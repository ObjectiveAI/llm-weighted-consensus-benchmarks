The ticket text is quite garbled, making it tricky to determine the appropriate category. It seems to relate to working days and possibly holiday discrepancies, but it\u2019s not clear. I\u2019ll need to sift through it carefully to ensure I place it in the right category. Let's break it down!**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nIn the ticket, there are references to \u201cworking days,\u201d \u201cpublic holiday,\u201d and \u201camend number working days,\u201d indicating it\u2019s likely related to HR operations or administrative tasks about public holidays. This makes me lean towards \"HR Support\" since it involves policies and amendments to the calendar. The required response format is a JSON object with the category, which I'll define as \"HR Support.\" So I'll make sure my output reflects that correctly!**Preparing JSON output**\n\nThe system specifies that I must output a JSON object following a certain schema. Therefore, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} as it matches the schema's requirements. It\u2019s important to adhere closely to this structure, so I won't add any extra commentary. I need to ensure this is concise and clear. I've confirmed the content relates to working days and public holidays, making \"HR Support\" the correct category. So here\u2019s the final output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
