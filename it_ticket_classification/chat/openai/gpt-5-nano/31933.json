The ticket mostly seems focused on provisioning access for new agents to handle calls. I\u2019ll lean toward \"Access\" since it fits their request for adding agents better.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user's ticket mentions \"path new agents to be added\" and references a \"telephony path,\" which suggests they need telephony access set up for these agents. I think it's best categorized as \"Access\" since it's focused on provisioning access for new agents. I need to craft a response in the required format, specifically a JSON object detailing this. So, I\u2019ll prepare it as: {\"category\": \"Access\"} to align with the system's schema.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
