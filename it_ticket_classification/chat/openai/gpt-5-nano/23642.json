The ticket discusses cable management, audio/video cables, room bookings, and liaising with suppliers. It seems to focus on planning and organizing, making \"Internal Project\" the most appropriate category because it reflects the project nature of organizing cabling and handling AV needs. While \"Hardware\" could apply due to the equipment aspect, the focus is primarily on project planning and procurement. \"Administrative rights\" doesn't fit, and \"Purchase\" may apply, but the emphasis is on project management.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
