Given the categories in the system, \"Access\" seems relevant for disabling accounts, while \"HR Support\" is also a possibility due to the maternity leave mention. However, since the main action revolves around IT processes like deactivating accounts, \"Access\" feels like the most appropriate category for this ticket.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket and provide a JSON output with a category field. The options include things like \"Administrative rights,\" but since the ticket is mostly about disabling accounts and managing access, \"Access\" seems like the best fit. I\u2019ll go with that. The final response will be in JSON format: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. No need for further explanations unless the user asks for clarification; I\u2019ll just keep it straightforward."
