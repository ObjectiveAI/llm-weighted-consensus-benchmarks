Since there's no specific \"Software\" category, \"Miscellaneous\" seems the most fitting. The user mentioned \"administrator,\" which makes me wonder if it's related to \"Administrative rights,\" but that's not clear. Given the ambiguity, I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\nI'll prepare a minimal JSON object, just as instructed, to represent this categorization. The output will be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
