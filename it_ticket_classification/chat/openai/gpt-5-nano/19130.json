The categories available are quite specific: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Based on the content, it leans towards \"Access.\" The output must be in JSON format according to the schema provided, so it\u2019ll look something like this: `{\"category\": \"Access\"}`. I'll make sure my output conforms to the given requirements.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket I received highlights a need for access to shared folders, so it seems the main category is \"Access.\" However, it might also involve \"Administrative rights\" if the user requires special permissions to access these folders. Still, the primary focus appears to be on gaining access. To respond properly, I\u2019ll prepare the JSON output in the requested format: `{\"category\": \"Access\"}`. It\u2019s important to follow the user\u2019s instruction clearly here!**Providing the category**\n\nI need to focus on just providing the category value without including the schema in my response. The instruction is clear, asking simply for the \"category.\" So, I\u2019ll stick to the requested format. I\u2019ll prepare the final output as `{\"category\": \"Access\"}` with no additional text. It's straightforward, and I want to make sure I'm following the user's instructions precisely!"
