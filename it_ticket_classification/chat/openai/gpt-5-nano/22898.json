The user's request seems to be about helping with a migration, specifically transferring employee pictures and forms. Given these details, it could fit as an \"Internal Project\" due to its migration nature, \"Storage\" for the pictures and forms, or \"Access\" if it involves transferring data access. Administrative rights could also be relevant if they need permissions to proceed.**Categorizing IT tasks**\n\nI'm looking at available categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket mentions needing help with migration and transferring employee pictures and forms, which seems like an IT task. It could fit under \"Internal Project\" because it's about an internal migration. \"Storage\" might also work due to the data involved. However, \"Internal Project\" seems the most appropriate since it directly relates to managing an internal migration project. We need to assign that category!**Finalizing category response**\n\nI've been considering the available categories. \"HR Support\" doesn't seem relevant, and \"Access\" would apply only if they explicitly needed access rights. \"Administrative rights\" might fit if they required admin privileges, but that's not clearly stated. I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit for this ticket. I need to craft the output as a JSON-like category response since that's the required format. So I\u2019ll respond with just the category object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
