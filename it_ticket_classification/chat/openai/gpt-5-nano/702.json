They mentioned a \"new starter\" and \"attached mobile hardware,\" indicating they need assistance with completing a form. This could relate to onboarding, so I'm considering whether to categorize this under \"HR Support\" or \"Hardware.\" An onboarding form feels like it fits best under \"HR Support,\" while the mention of mobile hardware suggests it might also relate to provisioning.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT ticket. The user mentions \"new starter,\" indicating a new employee who needs assistance with a form and has \"attached mobile hardware.\" This suggests it's related to hardware provisioning, but there\u2019s also a hint of access due to the new starter aspect. Though categories like \"Onboarding\" aren't options, the explicit mention of \"mobile hardware\" leans me towards classifying it under \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate category.**Producing JSON output**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket to categorize it correctly. The context indicates a \"new starter,\" and hardware provisioning seems to be the main action here. The request for assistance likely relates to the \"HR Support\" category, but that doesn\u2019t fit perfectly. Since \"Administrative rights\" isn't suitable either, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" \n\nNow, I need to format my response as a JSON object since that's what the system requires. My output will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
