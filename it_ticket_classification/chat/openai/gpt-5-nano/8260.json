It mentions a new service with an external network connection using a dark leased line, highlighting networking, providers, contracts, and more. Looking at the available categories\u2014like \"Internal Project,\" \"Purchase,\" or \"Access\"\u2014I think \u201cInternal Project\u201d fits best since it relates to infrastructure. But I should also consider \u201cPurchase\u201d if it involves acquiring the leased line. It\u2019s a bit tricky!**Finalizing the category selection**\n\nAlright, the key focus is on categorizing a ticket related to a \"new service now external network connection\" and \"dark leased line.\" This clearly points to an infrastructure project, so I\u2019m going with \"Internal Project.\" \n\nTo follow the format, I need to provide a JSON-like response with the category field. While I can add a brief justification, it seems the instructions prioritize a clean output. So, I\u2019ll keep it minimal and output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
