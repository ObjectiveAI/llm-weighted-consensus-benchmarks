It feels a bit straightforward, but it's crucial to pick the right label so the request goes to the appropriate team. Each category has its nuances, and I want to make sure I'm not overlooking something essential. Let's figure this out!**Analyzing ticket text**\n\nI need to read through this ticket text, which seems a bit jumbled and possibly spammy. It's all about \"feedback impact,\" surveys, and access to the service portal. The message is quite mixed, mentioning issues with completing surveys and clarifications regarding feedback requests. It's important to decipher this clutter to understand the user's needs. I'll have to approach the content carefully to ensure I capture the essential points without getting lost in the chaos!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user is looking for a category for the ticket. The text indicates issues like \"no access to the service portal\" and mentions things like \"survey session expires.\" It seems clear that the primary category is \"Access,\" as it's mainly about accessing the service portal. While there are mentions of ticket closing and feedback, the focus remains on access. So, I'll create a JSON object with the category set to \"Access.\" Let's keep it straightforward!**Finalizing category output**\n\nI expect to provide a simple JSON response: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This is in line with the schema requirements, focusing solely on the category. I want to avoid any additional commentary or heavy formatting since the instructions indicate to keep it straightforward. A single line with the category will do perfectly. So, the direct response will be just that JSON object. Keeping it clean and simple is key here!"
