It sounds like a hardware or input device issue, so I think it should fall under \"Hardware.\" However, it could also fit in \"Miscellaneous\" if it's a broader issue. I want to make sure I choose the most accurate category for effective resolution! Crossing out options like \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" makes sense.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe issue mentioned seems to involve a laptop with cursor movement problems caused by the pointing stick and keyboard. It indicates a hardware input device problem, so I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" The user specifically asked me to categorize the IT ticket, so I need to output a JSON-like object that fits the schema provided. \n\nFollowing that format, I'll respond with just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any additional text, since that might be the clearest response for parsing.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI'm confirming that the issue definitely indicates a hardware input device problem, with the cursor sliding because of the touchpad, pointing stick, or keyboard. Although I briefly considered categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous,\" it clearly falls under \"Hardware.\" Even if a software driver update could potentially resolve the issue, the root cause points to a hardware problem. I\u2019ll stick with my initial decision and respond accordingly."
