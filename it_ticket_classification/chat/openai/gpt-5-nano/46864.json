Given the mentions of submissions and access rights, I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category for this ticket. It feels like a request for permission to submit something urgently today.**Double-checking IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering the \"Administrative rights\" category for this IT ticket since it might involve granting admin rights. However, there\u2019s no clear mention of admin privileges\u2014just references to \"access needed screens\" and other terms related to workflows. It leans more towards needing temporary access to update something. I think \"Access\" remains the best category. I'll output a JSON object in the correct format with the category: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's proceed with that!**Understanding the Ticket Content**\n\nThe ticket text is quite jumbled, but it seems to focus on a process involving submission forms for a \"last date,\" \"start date,\" and \"end date.\" It's likely related to a workflow in a system called \"fusion,\" discussing how to manage or sign cards. There's urgency in the request, indicating someone is encountering errors with submissions and needs access today. I need to ensure I capture the essence accurately for categorization or processing!**Categorizing Access Request**\n\nIt seems the ticket concerns user access to screens, possibly mentioning \"re-logging only.\" The phrase \"how can we make be able submit his today\" indicates they're looking for a submission process, marked by urgency about fixing an issue related to submission days. Given this focus, I think \"Access\" is the right category. I\u2019ll provide a JSON response in the required format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Keeping it concise and ensuring proper quoting is essential!"
