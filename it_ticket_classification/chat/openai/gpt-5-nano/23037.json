I realize they might expect a structured response, specifically in JSON format. The system requires output as an object, so I\u2019ll format it correctly. I'll focus solely on providing the JSON output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This meets the requirement without any additional notes since the instruction specifies that only the category is necessary.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI see the user asked to categorize an IT ticket, and while it contains elements of both IT and HR, \"HR Support\" seems to be the best category here. Phrases about maternity leave and contracts support this classification. There\u2019s some nuance with mentions of time sheets, like \u201ctime sheets wednesday pm sheets,\u201d but they align more with HR. So, I\u2019ll provide the output as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Let\u2019s deliver this clearly!"
