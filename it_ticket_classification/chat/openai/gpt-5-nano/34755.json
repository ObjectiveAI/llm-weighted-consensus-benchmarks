It mentions several issues like \"time card error\" and requests to \"delete surplus\" and \"reset card.\" I\u2019m considering the categories. It could fit under \"Access\" if it relates to resetting access or a password, or perhaps \"Administrative rights\" if it requires admin privileges. \"HR Support\" could also be a fit due to the time card aspect, especially revolving around time tracking. Let's dive into this!**Clarifying IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe category list includes \"HR Support,\" which is very relevant for issues related to time cards and payroll. There's no \"IT Support\" category, but I\u2019m considering whether this ticket fits under \"Access\" since the user wants to reset a card. The message is a bit jumbled but talks about \"time card error\" and deleting surplus entries. It seems like they're trying to reset a time card or possibly something else. I need to clarify what \"card\" refers to\u2014time card or potentially a credit card?{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
