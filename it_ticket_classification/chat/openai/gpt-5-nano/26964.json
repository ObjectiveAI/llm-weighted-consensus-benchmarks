It mentions an \"oracle request\" related to a past employee and various details about report submission processes, but it\u2019s all mixed up. I should choose the best category for this ticket. I can select from options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. Given the content, it sounds like HR Support might be the best fit.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe ticket is about \"oracle requests for a past employee,\" and it includes mentions of \"reports,\" \"weekly basis,\" and \"submitting\" processes. I\u2019m considering whether it fits under \"Access\" since it could involve requests for access to Oracle, or \"HR Support\" due to the reference to an employee who has left. There\u2019s also a chance it could relate to \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project.\" Given the context, I think \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" are the most accurate categories.**Determining ticket categorization**\n\nThe content refers to a \"past employee\" and involves requests for \"reports\" that need to be submitted weekly. This sounds like they might want to cascade processes for forwarding those reports for a past employee. The mention of \"oracle requests\" suggests possible access issues, and the user wants me to categorize this IT ticket. Among the options, \"Access\" seems like the best fit since it deals with Oracle requests, but \"Administrative rights\" could also apply if it's about granting access.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe text mentions \"oracle requests for a past employee,\" which might involve the Oracle system for HR purposes. It suggests retrieving data or reports related to that employee. I notice phrases about submitting reports weekly, which leans toward an access request since it ties back to accessing the Oracle system. While \"HR Support\" is a possible category, I'm leaning towards \"Access\" because it fits better with the focus on system access. I'll present it as {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
