It seems to be about approvals and balances. I think the right category here is \"HR Support,\" focusing on leave requests. I\u2019ll respond with the category in JSON format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Returning JSON Format**\n\nI need to return a JSON object structured like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I should keep it simple and avoid any extra text or punctuation. The instructions are clear about responding only with the category in a JSON format. So my final response will just be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I think I've got this right, and I\u2019ll deliver it without any additional clutter!"
