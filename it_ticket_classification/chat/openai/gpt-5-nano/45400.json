The prompt indicates a schema that requires a category field, so I\u2019ll ensure my output includes the appropriate category string according to the ticket classification. Let\u2019s get this formatted correctly!**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe ticket describes an issue with the main door opening without a card, which relates directly to access control. Based on its content, I think the most appropriate category for this ticket would be \"Access.\" It seems clear that this query is regarding a door access system malfunction. I'll ensure to classify it correctly, aligning with the information provided to maintain quality in addressing the user's concern! Let's get this sorted!**Finalizing the categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering that this ticket could also fall under \"Hardware\" since it mentions door hardware. However, the main issue is clearly about access control, especially with the mention of the access system and door lighting. So, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object in the correct format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. If there were more categories involved, I\u2019d mention them, but in this case, the focus is on getting the current categorization right. Let's get it done!"
