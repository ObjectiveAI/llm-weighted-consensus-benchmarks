The description sounds like a sound issue related to the microphone since they can hear others, but not themselves. Given the category options, \"Hardware\" seems the most fitting since it deals with the physical components of the PC. Now, I\u2019ll output a JSON object with the selected category. It should look like this: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}.**Determining the issue category**\n\nThe user's description indicates that the microphone is not transmitting their voice, as they can hear others but not vice versa. It seems the new PC is emitting sound from the speakers, but the microphone might be the issue. While it could be software-related, the primary concern appears to be hardware since it involves audio equipment. So, the \"Hardware\" category seems the most appropriate for this ticket. I'll categorize it as such.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user's ticket involves both hardware setup and connectivity, making it a bit tricky. Typically, I\u2019d consider categories like \"Hardware\" or \"Software,\" but I don't see \"Software\" here. The relevant categories seem limited: \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Administrative rights\" don't fit. So, I'll go with \"Hardware\" since the issue pertains to the microphone not transmitting sound. I'll format my response as a JSON object, ensuring it meets the category schema. Here\u2019s how it looks: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}."
