The request seems to involve Oracle Fusion PM and asks for a code per an attached form. Among the available categories, \"Internal Project\" seems the most fitting since the user is asking for a project code. \"Access\" might apply if it were just about gaining access, but the focus is on creating a code for an internal project.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nThe ticket describes a request for a new project code related to Oracle Fusion PM, specifically mentioning an engagement code called \"stronger together.\" They need this code created based on an attached form. Considering this, the most appropriate category appears to be \"Internal Project.\" I need to respond in JSON format, specifying the category as instructed, ensuring I follow the schema correctly by including quotes and adhering to the structure provided. \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI need to double-check the instructions, which specify that I must provide a JSON object without any special formatting. It's important to use the exact string \"Internal Project\" for the category. So, I'll confirm my output with just the JSON object itself. I want to make sure I'm following this correctly, without any added text or formatting, and I'll return the output as specified. \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
