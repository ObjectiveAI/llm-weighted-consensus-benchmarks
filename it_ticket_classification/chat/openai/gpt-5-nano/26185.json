There\u2019s a French phrase \"la va manger\" which might mean \"we are going to eat,\" and \"ext\" could refer to an extension. It looks like the ticket relates to HR onboarding, so I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as either \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access\" based on internal terminology.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking \"HR Support\" is likely the best fit for categorizing the IT ticket since it references a \"new starter\" and a \"starter form.\" However, \"Administrative rights\" could apply too if accounts are needed. The phrase \"starter form ext\" leaves me a bit puzzled, but usually those tasks involve access and onboarding. So, I need to produce a JSON object with the appropriate category based on the provided schema. Given all this, I\u2019ll likely choose \"HR Support.\"**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the IT ticket category options, noting that \"HR Support\" is a clear choice, but \"Access\" might fit depending on the context. The mention of \"starter form\" hints at something related to onboarding, potentially related to setting up accounts, which makes \"Access\" sound appropriate. The phrase \"ext\" could refer to an extension for a phone line, and \"pm\" indicates timing. Since it centers on providing access for a new starter, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Access.\"**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI'm thinking that while \"HR Support\" deals with HR processes, tickets about new starters typically fall under \"Access\" since they often involve creating accounts. So, for this IT ticket, the best category would likely be \"Access.\" I should output a JSON object with the category value exactly as enumerated: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It seems best to keep my response succinct and focus solely on the JSON format without adding extra text. So, I'll proceed with that."
