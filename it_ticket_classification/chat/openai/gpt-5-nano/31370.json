There's a mention of moving a July effort, which suggests a possible scheduling request\u2014maybe it relates to adjusting a project schedule, fitting into the \"Internal Project\" category. The ticket mentions \"stingray effort\" and moving man-hours in a project schedule, so that fits under project management. The other categories like storage, purchase, and administrative rights don't apply here.**Classifying IT request**\n\nThe text doesn't seem to be about access or hardware; it's more focused on closing costs and moving a July effort. This looks like it could fit into the \"Internal Project\" category. Since the instruction asks for a categorized response, I should format it as a JSON-like object with the category specified. I'll go with {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} to match the exact string needed. It's essential to be precise here, so that seems like the best choice!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
