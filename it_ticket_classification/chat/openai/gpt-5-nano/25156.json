I wonder if it could also fit into \"Purchase,\" but that typically relates to ordering rather than replacing. Nevertheless, for this context, \"Hardware\" is definitely the right call.**Preparing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe user's request is clear: they want to categorize an IT ticket that involves replacing a monitor and keyboard charger. This indicates a hardware issue, so I think \"Hardware\" is the safest classification. I need to ensure I format my output correctly as a JSON object. According to the instructions, I should write it as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any extra commentary or spaces. I'll go ahead and deliver that now."
