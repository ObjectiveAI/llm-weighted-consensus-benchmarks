The ticket's content is a bit unclear, but it seems to relate to a cable, likely falling under \"Hardware.\" It could also fit \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Hardware\" feels like the best choice since it's about a physical cable. Administrative rights and Access don\u2019t seem relevant here. I'll classify it as \"Hardware.\"**Finalizing category output**\n\nI\u2019m going to categorize the ticket as \"Hardware\" since it relates to a physical cable. The required format is a JSON-like object, specifically: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I have to make sure there's no extra text and that the category property is exactly \"Hardware.\" While \"Miscellaneous\" is a possibility, the repetition of \"cable\" makes \"Hardware\" the clear choice. So I\u2019ll output just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} and not include any justifications."
