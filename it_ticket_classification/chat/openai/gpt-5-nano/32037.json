They provided a message that seems to contain typos, asking to \"block Friday PM suspicious mails.\" It sounds like they're concerned about receiving suspicious emails often.\n\nI\u2019ll try to interpret it clearly. The ticket likely falls under \"Miscellaneous\" since it doesn't fit neatly into other categories like Hardware or Access. It\u2019s unclear and a bit confusing, but I'll choose the best option.**Interpreting IT Ticket for Categorization**\n\nIt looks like the user wants to block suspicious emails, particularly on Friday PM. They're receiving frequent suspicious emails that might contain malicious links or attachments, and the term \"consultant\" is confusing. \n\nI need to categorize this ticket using the limited categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit, but \"Access\" could work if there's an access issue. I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" for now.**Categorizing IT Ticket Request**\n\nThe user wants to block suspicious emails, specifically those arriving Friday afternoons, highlighting potential phishing threats. Their request centers on security concerns regarding attachments and links.\n\nGiven my options, \"Miscellaneous\" seems the best fit because other categories like \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" don\u2019t apply here. I should aim to format my output as a JSON object with \"category\" set to \"Miscellaneous,\" following the required schema. It's straightforward enough!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
