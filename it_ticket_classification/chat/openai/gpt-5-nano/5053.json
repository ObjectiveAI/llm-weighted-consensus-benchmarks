The provided categories include options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Given that the content is HR-related and mentions the leaver process, it seems appropriate to choose \"HR Support.\" Although there's a mention of access, the focus is more on the HR process itself. So, HR Support is the best fit.**Choosing category for IT ticket**\n\nI think the category for this ticket should be \"HR Support\" since it's focused on an HR process related to leavers. Although \"Administrative rights\" might apply if adjustments are needed, the content suggests it's mainly about offboarding. The text indicates there's been an announcement regarding employees leaving, a resignation being withdrawn, and a request to abort the leaver process. So, I\u2019ll classify it as HR Support. I need to respond with the category in JSON format.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
