It\u2019s a bit broken, but it seems like they\u2019re mentioning \"unable to send sheet for July\" and asking for options to review or submit something moving forward.\n\nConsidering the categories available, it could fit under \"Access\" if they\u2019re having issues accessing something. I need to make sure to interpret their request correctly and assign the right category!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe user said they are \"unable to send a sheet for July,\" which might indicate they have access issues. This points to either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" though they haven\u2019t explicitly requested admin rights. I also see a reference to \"Oracle,\" which could relate to a system.\n\nThey also ask about options to review or submit for the July sheet, making \"Access\" seem like the best fit since it\u2019s primarily about permissions and being unable to perform an action.**Categorizing IT Ticket for JSON Output**\n\nOkay, the user needs me to categorize an IT ticket and provide the output as a JSON object. They specifically want a \"category\" key with a string value from the allowed options. The user mentions being \"unable to send a sheet for July,\" suggesting it might relate to permissions, pointing to \"Access\" as a potential category. \n\nWhile \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" could also fit, \"Access\" seems most appropriate since this ticket revolves around the inability to perform an action due to permission issues. I\u2019ll prepare the final output as {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
