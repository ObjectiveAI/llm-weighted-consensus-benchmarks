In IT helpdesk categorization, we can use categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, or Administrative Rights. Since the message mentions \"submit leaver form\" and \"handled by him,\" it's likely related to access or administrative rights. I\u2019ll focus on selecting the most appropriate category for this ticket.**Deciding the IT ticket category**\n\nA \"leaver form\" is generally related to an employee leaving and involves IT disabling access or collecting equipment. In terms of categories, I see options like HR Support, Access, and Administrative Rights. Since it's tied to offboarding, \"HR Support\" feels like the best fit. The user\u2019s ticket emphasizes filling out this form, which indicates it's connected to Human Resources. Given that, I think \"HR Support\" is the most suitable category for this ticket.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nIf the task is about deactivating accounts, it might fit under \"Access.\" However, since the message frequently refers to \"HR\" and \"leaver,\" it leans more towards HR. The phrases like \"thanks\" and \"handled by him\" don\u2019t really provide clarity about IT actions. Since the primary action is to \u201cfill submit leaver form,\u201d I'll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" I'll create a concise JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} to match the required format."
