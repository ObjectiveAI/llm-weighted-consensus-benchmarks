It seems to be about a profile path change related to working locations and assistance from a leader. The keywords like \"profile path change,\" \"working location,\" and \"assist\" stand out. I'm trying to decide where it fits among categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, and others. Given the context, it might fall under HR Support or Access.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI think this ticket is related to profile path changes, likely about user-related paths, possibly in Active Directory. It\u2019s unclear if it fits best under Access, Administrative Rights, or maybe even Storage. The mention of updating profile paths for a working location tomorrow suggests it\u2019s about access permissions. While admin rights aren\u2019t explicitly stated, I lean towards categorizing it as Access since that seems most relevant. Based on everything, responding with a JSON category object is the next step!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
