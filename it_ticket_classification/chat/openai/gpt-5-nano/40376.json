It mentions issues with a machine, specifically an Azure server problem, needing a new machine added, and crashes with the current DB server. The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It seems this fits best under \"Internal Project\" since it involves the design lead and internal assignments. Let's finalize that!**Categorizing IT ticket request**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the categories available: Hardware, Storage, Access, Administrative rights, Purchase, Miscellaneous, HR Support, and Internal Project. The request involves adding an Azure machine and addressing current DB server crashes, suggesting that it isn't just about hardware but relates to a specific project. I believe the best fit is \"Internal Project\" since it pertains to operational IT issues overseen by the design lead. Although \u201cHardware\u201d could be a consideration, it seems more about cloud infrastructure provisioning and project needs.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing the ticket as \"Internal Project.\" Initially, I considered \"Administrative rights\" due to the request for direct assignment, but I think it fits better under \"Internal Project\" since it deals with machine access and Azure. While \"Access\" is another possibility regarding Azure, it doesn't capture the full scope. I\u2019ll output a JSON object formatted correctly for this category as follows: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let\u2019s keep it straightforward!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
