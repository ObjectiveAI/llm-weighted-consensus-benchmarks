It mentions issues like Outlook calendar, organizer rights, and sharing permissions, which suggests it focuses on access control. So, I think the best categories would be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since they involve rights and visibility in calendars. I'll need to be careful to make sure I choose the one that covers all the aspects mentioned clearly.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user is asking for rights related to being an organizer, transferring rights, and setting visible reminders for members. This suggests a focus on access control, particularly for sharing calendars. I\u2019m inclined toward \"Access\" as the best category since this specifically relates to permissions for organizing and sharing calendars. While \"Administrative rights\" could also fit, it generally refers to broader IT admin privileges. I'll make sure to provide a concise justification for the categorization in JSON format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
