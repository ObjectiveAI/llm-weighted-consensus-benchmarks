The content mentions ownership and package deployment, leading me to think \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit. However, \"Access\" also relates to ownership rights, and it may belong to \"Internal Project\" if it involves an internal machine.**Selecting ticket categories**\n\nIt looks like I need to choose the best category for an IT ticket. The options are \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or possibly \"Internal Project.\" The phrase \"change owner\" suggests it's about access rights, while \"Administrative rights\" refers specifically to admin privileges or ownership transfers. There's also a mention of \"update package installed,\" which could connect to a software update. However, the main focus is on ownership change, leading me to choose \"Administrative rights.\" I'll respond with a concise JSON format stating the category."
