I need to classify it into one of the categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, or others. I'm guessing it could be about a \"new hire\" needing help with AD, which I think refers to Active Directory. But then again, \"please ad\" might mean \"add.\" It's tricky!**Classifying the ticket request**\n\nThe user mentioned, \"new hi please help creating please ad thanks floor blvd district.\" I think this might actually refer to a \"new hire\" needing help with \"AD,\" which usually stands for Active Directory. It seems like a request for creating a user account, which would fall under the \"Access\" category for user provisioning. If it requires permissions, it could relate to \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Access\" feels like the more appropriate choice for this ticket.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to return a JSON object to categorize the IT ticket. The user requested a specific format: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}. Based on the analysis, I'll set the category to \"Access.\" So, the output will be just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll stick to the format without adding extra text."
