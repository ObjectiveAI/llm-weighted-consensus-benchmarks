The content specifically relates to an employee departure in New Jersey in October, mentioning the need for access rights to be terminated and leaver documents to be sent. It seems this fits best under the HR Support category due to the context of an employee termination and related actions.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis IT ticket involves an immediate termination, a request to shut off access, and to send a leaver document. It seems focused on access deprovisioning, which leads me to categorize it as \"Access.\" Although \"Administrative rights\" or \"HR Support\" could also fit, \"Access\" is the most relevant since it deals with disabling access and leaver procedures. I'll respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. No extra commentary needed!**Confirming JSON response format**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to respond with a JSON object that includes a single field named \"category.\" I\u2019ll make sure to follow this requirement and confirm that the formatting matches what\u2019s expected. That means I\u2019ll only include this field without any additional information. I\u2019m focused on ensuring I get this right!"
