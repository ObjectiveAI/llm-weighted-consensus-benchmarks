The user provided a brief request regarding \"additional RAM,\" which clearly falls into the \"Hardware\" category since RAM is a hardware component. There\u2019s a mention of a potential procurement aspect with \"order run locally,\" which might suggest \"Purchase,\" but the primary request is about the hardware upgrade. So, I'll classify it under \"Hardware\" and prepare a JSON object with the relevant category field.**Formatting the JSON output**\n\nI need to output a JSON object with a \u201ccategory\u201d property based on the IT ticket details. The system specifies that I should use an allowed category. While I consider classifying it under \"Purchase\" due to \"order run locally,\" the main request clearly focuses on \"request for additional RAM,\" which is a hardware upgrade. Given these considerations, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" Now I just have to ensure that I provide the correct JSON format for the response.**Preparing the JSON output**\n\nI need to create a JSON object with just the \"category\" field and nothing extra. The proper format for the output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It\u2019s important to keep it concise and to the point, following those guidelines. Now, I\u2019m ready to deliver this formatted response without any additional text. So, let's go ahead with that!"
