The system instructions indicate that I should return a JSON format like {\"category\":\"Access\"} or another appropriate option. My next step is to analyze the ticket text to determine the correct category.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions several key phrases related to user accounts, like \"reactivated the ad accounts,\" \"disabled accounts,\" and \"permissions.\" Given the context, it likely falls under the \"Access\" category since it deals with user account access controls. While \"Administrative rights\" could also fit because of the permissions aspect, the focus on investigating account reactivation points strongly towards \"Access.\" I need to respond with a JSON object indicating the chosen category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
