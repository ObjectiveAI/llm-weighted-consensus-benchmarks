The content revolves around Active Directory synchronization and the leaver process. Given that it involves access management, the \"Access\" category seems most relevant. There are mentions of approvals and rights, which might also connect to \u201cAdministrative Rights.\u201d I\u2019ll need to focus on accurately classifying based on these details.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions terms like \"cross leaver process\" and \"leaver form,\" which relate to internal IT project workflows for Active Directory sync and the leaver process. I\u2019m weighing between categorizing it as \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" \"Internal Project\" fits well since it involves implementing processes and scripts. While \"Access\" relates to Active Directory's impact on management, the focus seems more on the project itself. So, I'll go with \"Internal Project\" as the most suitable category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
