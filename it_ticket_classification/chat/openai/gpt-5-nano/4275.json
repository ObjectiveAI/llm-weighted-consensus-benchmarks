The user mentions needing \"additional equipment\" like a screen and mouse. There's a sense of a request for purchasing hardware. I'm weighing the options between classifying it as \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" Since it talks about ordering equipment, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Purchase,\" but it definitely connects to hardware as well. It\u2019s a bit tricky to pick the best fit!**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe content clearly indicates a request for equipment, particularly a mouse and screen, which points to hardware. However, the mention of \"order\" suggests a purchasing aspect. In many IT ticket systems, there are categories like \"Hardware\" for devices and \"Purchase\" for procurement. Given the specific request, I think \"Purchase\" fits best while also recognizing that it relates to hardware. Now, I need to output the JSON object with the selected category.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
