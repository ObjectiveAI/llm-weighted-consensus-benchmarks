The system message made it clear that the top-level key should be \"category,\" and its value needs to be one of the enumerated strings. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll format it correctly as {\"category\": \"Access\"} instead of nesting the value. \n\nThat seems right, and if the user wants additional details later, I can always ask for clarification. For now, let's just deliver that concise response."
