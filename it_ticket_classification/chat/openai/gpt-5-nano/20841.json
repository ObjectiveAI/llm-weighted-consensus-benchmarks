There's also \"Administrative rights,\" which could apply if it's about changes in admin access. The user's mention of \"accept decline\" hints at a meeting but feels ambiguous. Overall, I'm settling on classifying it as \"Access.\"**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the phrase \"Administrative rights\" possibly referring to the admin access needed for planning. There\u2019s also the \"Internal Project\" category, but this doesn\u2019t seem relevant here. Since the user\u2019s request clearly states \"wants to access planning,\" I think it fits into the \"Access\" category. I know I need to output this in JSON format: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. While there\u2019s a bit of ambiguity with \"planning,\" I believe \"Access\" is the safest choice for this classification.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
