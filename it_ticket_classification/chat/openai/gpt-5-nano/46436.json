It's clear it's not hardware or HR support specifically, but it might tie into those areas. \"Administrative rights\" could come into play if the user lacks permission, but I\u2019m also considering \"Access\" for the submission button issue. Since it's complicated, \"Miscellaneous\" might fit best if it doesn't neatly fall into one of the categories.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nThe text discusses issues like the submit button not appearing and timecard submission errors. It could fit \"Internal Project,\" but the categories are quite generic. I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" for ambiguous cases\u2014especially application-related issues\u2014but \"Access\" might work if it\u2019s a permissions problem. The core issue appears to be a bug in the timecard system, leaning towards \"Administrative Rights\" or \"IT Support.\" Ultimately, I think I'll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" with a brief explanation.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
