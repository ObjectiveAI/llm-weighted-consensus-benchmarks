It mentions a new purchase, a purchase order, and aspects like logging allocation after receiving the item and mandatory receipts. Based on these details, it seems to be about purchasing and asset allocation. The \"Purchase\" category stands out as the best fit. \"Internal Project\" and \"Administrative rights\" don't quite match. Interestingly, there's no category for asset or inventory management.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at how to categorize an IT ticket, and it seems like there are a few possible options: \"Storage,\" \"Hardware,\" or \"Purchase.\" Given that the ticket mentions a new hardware purchase and talks about allocating items, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Purchase.\" The mention of mandatory receipts clearly ties into the buying process. So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object where the category is set to \"Purchase,\" adhering to the specified format.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
