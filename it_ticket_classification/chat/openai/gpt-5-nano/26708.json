It mentions a \"new starter\" in Bucharest and involves terms like \"date,\" \"administration,\" and \"access.\" I can infer that this might relate to onboarding. The most fitting categories could be \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I'll need to decide which category best fits this unclear information. It's a bit tricky, but I think I can sort it out!**Categorizing IT ticket details**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and a few others like \"Internal Project\" and \"Purchase.\" The user's mention of \"new starter\" points to onboarding, which likely requires access rights to systems. The ticket text might suggest it's about provisioning access in \"Access\" or even \"Administrative rights\" if admin permissions are needed. With references to Bucharest and potential multilingual phrases, the phrasing is a bit complex, but I'll do my best to categorize it!**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI think the best fit for this IT ticket is \"Access,\" since it's about a new starter needing access to systems. The mention of \"administration officer\" suggests a role, but it doesn't specifically state anything about admin rights. If the ticket were focused on granting admin rights, \"Administrative rights\" could be more relevant. But since it revolves around onboarding and access, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and provide a JSON formatted response as required!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
