The user provided a block of text about generating a leaver form and issues regarding leavers versus active ad accounts. I need to figure out the best category to place this ticket in based on the given options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It seems to relate to HR Support since it discusses leaver procedures and forms.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at an IT ticket about leaver forms and Active Directory accounts. It involves offboarding and generating the leaver form, which relates to access and permissions. I think the most fitting category is \"Access,\" since it focuses on account permissions. It could also touch on HR support due to the leaver process. Given the instructions to respond with a specific JSON object, I'll make sure to output just that without any extra text. Here's what I\u2019ll present:  \n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
