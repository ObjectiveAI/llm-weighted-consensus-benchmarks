These elements indicate it relates to IT offboarding. The most fitting category seems to be \"Access,\" as it covers changes in user access, AD rights, and mailbox deprovisioning. \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, but \"Access\" is broader and more appropriate for this context.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nWhen classifying this IT ticket, I see it relates to offboarding and could fit in either \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\" The category list includes both options, but the content aligns more with a \"leaver form,\" emphasizing HR aspects. However, the technical tasks of disabling accounts and removing permissions lean toward \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since the user asked to categorize it into one single category, I believe \"Access\" is the most fitting choice given its focus on AD rights, mailbox, and roaming profiles.**Formatting response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON-like category object based on the given instructions. The output must include a \"category\" property with one of the specified values, like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Access.\" It's important to stick to the exact format and ensure I only present the category object. \n\nBased on earlier analysis, this ticket fits best in the \"Access\" category. So my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
