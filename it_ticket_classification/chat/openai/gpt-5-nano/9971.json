It\u2019s messy, but I need to pick a category from options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. The phrase \"review leaver accounts\" could suggest it fits under \"Access,\" but I want to ensure I categorize it correctly. Let\u2019s think this through!**Categorizing IT Ticket Details**\n\nI'm analyzing an IT ticket that includes several unclear requests. It mentions user access accounts for leavers and tasks like \"assign asap\" and \"extend rest fleet.\" While some phrases could point to resources or software licenses, overall, it seems focused on access management. I believe the best fit is the \"Access\" category, although \"Administrative rights\" might also work. Since the user wants a specific format, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}` without extra text."
