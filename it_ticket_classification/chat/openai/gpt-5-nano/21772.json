The key phrases seem to focus on \"duplicate feedback\" and potential issues regarding \"knowledge instances.\" I\u2019m considering whether it fits into \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It looks like this could be a bug report surrounding the feedback, but it\u2019s a bit unclear. I\u2019ll need to decide carefully on the most appropriate category for better clarity.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe user's message includes phrases like \"within minutes please advise\" and talks about \"duplicate feedback.\" I\u2019m narrowing down the categories: it's certainly not hardware, HR, or access. \"Miscellaneous\" seems fitting as a general IT ticket. However, it could also relate to an \"Internal Project\" if it involves specific knowledge instances and rules. Given the overall context, I'll leanish towards \"Miscellaneous,\" since it generally covers a variety of IT issues. But I\u2019ll also keep \"Internal Project\" in mind!**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI suspect there\u2019s a bug causing duplicate feedback notifications, but I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Miscellaneous\" since there isn't a specific category for software bugs. \"Administrative rights\" might be relevant if access rights are involved, but it\u2019s not obvious. Sometimes \"Internal Project\" fits for developer tasks, though here, \"Miscellaneous\" seems best. I need to respond with a JSON object in the required format, so it will be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. A brief justification could enhance the response!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
