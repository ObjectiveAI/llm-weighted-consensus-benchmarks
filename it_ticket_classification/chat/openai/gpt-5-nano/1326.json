The ticket appears related to issues with the timecard system, but the provided categories don\u2019t explicitly include options like \"Software\" or \"Application Support.\" I think the best fit is \"Miscellaneous,\" or possibly \"Access\" if it touches on user permissions. It's a bit tricky since the categories aren't perfect matches!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize this IT ticket under \"Administrative rights,\" as it involves issues with deleting timecards. However, the core concern seems to be errors in the timecard submission process and workflow. Since there isn't an \"IT Support\" category, \"Miscellaneous\" appears to be the best fit. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format required, keeping it clean and straightforward: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
