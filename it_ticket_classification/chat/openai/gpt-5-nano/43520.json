The message mentions \"OS environment,\" \"upload resume,\" and specifically asks for help with an application issue regarding the Safari browser. It seems like it wouldn't fit \"Hardware\" or \"Access\" since there's no request for access rights or administrative help. It could be classified as \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" based on the details provided. I should decide on one of those categories.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket categories, which include options like \"HR Support\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" The issue seems to involve an \"upload resume\" error, possibly linked to an applicant referral system, making it potentially HR-related. However, there's no specific category for \"HR,\" just \"HR Support.\" Since the user is asking for a categorization, I\u2019ll need to provide the response in the required format, like {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} or possibly {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Let's go with \"HR Support.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI have an IT ticket regarding a technical issue with uploading a resume in Safari. It's discussing an error that seems to link to an internal recruitment portal. While I could categorize it as \"Miscellaneous,\" since it\u2019s a general IT problem, \"Access\" isn\u2019t quite right since it\u2019s a browser issue. \"HR Support\" relates better to job referrals. So, I'll likely go with \"HR Support\" since it aligns more closely with what's happening here.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
