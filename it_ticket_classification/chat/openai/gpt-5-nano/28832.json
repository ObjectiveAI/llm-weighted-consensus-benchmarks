They mention something being \"wrongly assigned,\" which seems linked to permissions or administrative rights. The phrases \"for approval\" and \"wrongly assigned\" lead me to think it fits under \"Access\" since it relates to the assignment of approval rights. Alternatively, it could also fit under \"Administrative rights,\" which is about access privileges for admin functions. I'll go with \"Access.\"**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI realize that \"Oracle\" might refer to the ERP system, which doesn\u2019t fit into hardware, HR, storage, or purchasing. It could relate to an internal project if it's a project assignment. The mention of \"discipline lead\" could imply HR or a managerial context. The user's message indicates a support ticket concerning a wrong assignment for approval in Oracle. Ultimately, \"Access\" seems to be the most fitting category since it's about permissions for approval, but \"Administrative rights\" could also work. I'll finalize it in JSON format with the category field included.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
