Based on the content referring to requisition approvals, it seems like it fits best under \"Purchase,\" given keywords related to approvals and requisitions. Though \"Administrative rights\" could apply, the focus on requisition makes \"Purchase\" the more suitable category.**Creating JSON Response**\n\nI'm getting ready to craft the JSON response, which will simply be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.\n\nIt's important to ensure that the JSON string is valid and follows the schema, with \"Purchase\" correctly capitalized. Since the instructions specify to respond with just the category JSON object, I'll focus on delivering that without any extra text. Let's make sure to get this right and keep it simple!"
