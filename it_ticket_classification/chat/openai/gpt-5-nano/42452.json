There are limited options, but \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project\" seem relevant. It sounds like an internal project issue with Oracle report generation errors that affect weekly/monthly approvals. Categorizing IT tickets correctly is vital to route them to the right team. So, \"Internal Project\" might work since it's linked to internal software issues, though \"Admin rights\" could apply to permissions for generating reports.**Delivering JSON for IT ticket**\n\nI think we need to return a JSON object with a category key based on the user's ticket. The provided category options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the ticket mentions Oracle report errors for weekly/monthly card approvals, it seems more related to reporting issues rather than hardware. \n\nAccess may apply if the user can't generate the report. If I\u2019m unsure, I might default to \"Miscellaneous\" for safety.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering the \"Internal Project\" category since the ticket is about generating reports for project approvals, which relates to internal project management software. It seems fitting to categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" \n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that reflects this decision: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Even though the prompt could suggest a plain text response, the schema specifies a JSON object, so I'll stick with that and keep it concise without additional explanation."
