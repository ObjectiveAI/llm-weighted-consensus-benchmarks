However, it could also be \"Administrative rights\" if it involves needing admin access to fix the approval flow. Considering that context, \"Purchase\" seems like the best fit.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI think the best category for this IT ticket is either \"Purchase\" or \"Administrative rights,\" depending on the situation. The phrase \"approval flow requisition\" hints at an issue with the approval workflow for requisitions, suggesting a potential system or process problem. While \"Administrative rights\" might apply if admin access is needed to resolve the issue, \"Purchase\" seems more fitting as it relates to procurement.\n\nSince the user is asking to categorize the ticket, I should produce a JSON object with the selected category.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
