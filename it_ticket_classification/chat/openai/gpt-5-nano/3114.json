The best fit for categorization is \"Internal Project.\" It sounds like I need to produce a JSON object to represent this category accurately. The format I should use includes defining the type as an object and listing \"Internal Project\" as the category. So, my response will be a JSON object that aligns with that schema.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI see the schema specifies only a \"category\" field in the JSON object. It should look like this: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. The text does mention \"dashboard,\" which could fall under either \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project,\" but since the user asked to categorize this IT Ticket, I'll just focus on delivering the JSON. I want to keep it straightforward, so I'll provide exactly this without any extra content or explanations."
