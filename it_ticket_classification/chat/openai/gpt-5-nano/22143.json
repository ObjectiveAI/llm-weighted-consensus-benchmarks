Since it's mostly about the order status, the \"Purchase\" category fits best. I also considered \"Hardware\" since a mobile phone is hardware, but since it's not directly about a hardware issue, I'll go with \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll return it formatted in a JSON-like structure.**Formulating JSON response**\n\nThe instructions tell me to respond with a category object that matches a specific schema. This schema indicates I need to output a JSON object with a \"category\" property. Since my analysis determined the relevant category is \"Purchase,\" I'll structure my output as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} according to the requirements. It seems there's no need for extra text or quotes around the category, so I\u2019ll keep it clean and straightforward, delivering it as a JSON object."
