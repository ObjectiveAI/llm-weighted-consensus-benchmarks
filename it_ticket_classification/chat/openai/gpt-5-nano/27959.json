They mentioned \"opening up a space confluence\" and \"rockets procedure,\" which implies that they're trying to set up a Confluence space for an internal project involving documentation. Given that the request is about creating a space, it likely falls under \"Internal Project.\" However, it also touches on \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since they'll need those to open a wiki. It's a bit tricky to pinpoint!**Evaluating ticket categories**\n\nI need to determine the right category for this IT ticket. The user is asking to \"open up a space\" in Confluence for a project called \"rockets,\" which likely involves internal collaboration for documentation. I think \"Internal Project\" fits best, as it focuses on setting up the space. While \"Access\" could relate to granting rights to that space, there's no direct request for permissions. \"Administrative rights\" might come into play if they need those rights to create the space. It's a bit nuanced!**Determining category for ticket**\n\nThe user's content indicates they are looking to create or open a Confluence space, specifically mentioning procedures and documentation management. I believe this falls under \"Internal Project.\" The system requires a JSON object for the response, and the allowed categories are clearly defined. I\u2019m confident that \"Internal Project\" is the most appropriate choice. Thus, I should respond concisely with just the JSON object:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
