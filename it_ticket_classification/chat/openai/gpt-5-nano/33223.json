The valid categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nThe user\u2019s message seems related to onboarding, specifically mentioning \"new starter\" and some confusion around a \"starter form date.\" This suggests it might fit into the HR Support category since it deals with onboarding and employee forms. So, I'll output a JSON object with \"HR Support\" as the category.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nThe user\u2019s ticket mentions \"new starter\" and \"starter form date,\" suggesting it's about HR onboarding. The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and a few others. Since the context leans towards onboarding, the best fit seems to be HR Support. However, there\u2019s also a possibility it could relate to Access if it involves forms for system access. I think HR Support captures the essence better, as it encompasses tasks like these without a specific onboarding category.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI'm looking at the ticket again, and while \"Administrative rights\" is another category, the message centers more around \"starter form date,\" pointing towards HR Support. So I decide to categorize it as HR Support and prepare to output:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nHowever, I realize that the required format specifies a full JSON object structure, which includes \"type\":\"object\" and properties. There's a schema I need to follow, so I must ensure the final output adheres to that format even though I might typically just provide the value. This schema might be new to me!**Preparing JSON output**\n\nThe user likely expects a straightforward response with the category, so I'll prepare to output:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nIt's better to keep it simple and follow the instruction to just provide the JSON object without any extra wording. The user specifically asked for categorization, so I want to ensure I deliver precisely what they need. I\u2019ll go ahead and produce that now!"
