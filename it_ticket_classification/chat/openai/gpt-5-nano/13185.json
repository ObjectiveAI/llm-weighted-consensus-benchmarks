The content mentions a former employee, onboarding forms, and expectations for July, which suggests it\u2019s about access for a new employee. I\u2019m thinking \u201cAccess\u201d is the best fit since it directly relates to secure IDs. However, it could also be categorized under \u201cHR Support\u201d due to the onboarding forms. Both categories are relevant here!**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nThe content talks about a \"new starter,\" \"starter forms,\" and \"joiners,\" hinting at onboarding procedures. The mention of \"secure ID\" suggests it's about access credentials, making the best-fit categories either \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\" I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" because it relates directly to secure IDs. The final output will need to be a JSON-like object, specifying the category field as \"Access,\" following the given schema. I'll wrap it all up nicely!**Formatting the output**\n\nI need to return a JSON object for the category, which in this case is \"Access.\" I\u2019ll ensure that it follows the proper format without unnecessary commentary. The instruction emphasizes that I should only include the category. However, it isn\u2019t prohibited to add a brief justification if it adds value. Still, the most straightforward and compliant response is simply: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Now I\u2019ll finalize the output!"
