It talks about \"agile cameras\" and \"devices cameras,\" which suggests it falls under the \"Hardware\" category, as cameras are hardware items. There\u2019s also a mention of an \"Internal Project,\" which could imply it's related to an IT project. However, I think the best fit is definitely \"Hardware\" since it centers on camera deployment and asset management. So, I'm leaning toward that category.**Creating JSON category object**\n\nI need to produce a JSON object that specifies the category for the IT ticket. The instruction is clear: I should categorize this ticket as either \"Hardware\" or any other allowed values. After considering options, I believe \"Hardware\" is the best fit because it\u2019s about hardware provisioning. I'll format the response as requested: a concise JSON object without any extra text. So, it should look like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"} \n\nLet\u2019s ensure that\u2019s properly formatted!"
