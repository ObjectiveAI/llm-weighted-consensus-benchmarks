The categories available don't include \"Software,\" which seems relevant, but can\u2019t be used here. The closest fit seems to be \"Miscellaneous,\" as it doesn't fall under other categories like Hardware or HR Support.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" and format it properly in JSON: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.
