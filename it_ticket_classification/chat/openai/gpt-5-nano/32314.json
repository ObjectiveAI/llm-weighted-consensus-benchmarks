The other options like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" don\u2019t apply. We're focusing on issues that are procurement-related, so \"Purchase\" should work well. I'll format the response in a JSON-like structure. It feels solid to go with \"Purchase\" for this expense reporting situation!**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI see the instruction specifies how to format the category in JSON. The category should simply be set to \"Purchase.\" The platform requires this structure, so I'll respond directly without any extra commentary. The response will look like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"} \n\nKeeping it minimal feels like the right approach here!"
