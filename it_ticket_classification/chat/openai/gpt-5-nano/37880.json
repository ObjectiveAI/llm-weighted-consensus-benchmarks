It seems there was an unexpected error during a backup job, which may be linked to recovery points. I think the best categories might be \"Storage,\" since it deals with backups, or perhaps \"Hardware\" if it relates to the server itself. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" could also come into play, but they seem less applicable here. Let's decide!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI believe the best category for this IT ticket is \"Storage\" since it mentions recovery points and an alert related to a data source on a server, which ties back to a backup job. While \"Hardware\" is also a possibility because it's a server, the specifics about data sources and unexpected errors support \"Storage\" as the most fitting choice. Now, I need to format this as a JSON object for the system. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI'm considering the nuances in the message, which repeatedly mentions \"critical alert,\" \"data source,\" \"computer server,\" \"last recovery points created,\" and an \"unexpected error.\" This clearly indicates an error during a backup job on a server. Therefore, it makes the most sense to categorize this ticket as \"Storage,\" given its relation to recovery points. I need to format the response correctly, so here it is: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}."
