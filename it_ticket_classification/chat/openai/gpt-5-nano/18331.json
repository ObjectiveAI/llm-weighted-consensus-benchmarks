They want to obtain a document template and might be asking about accepting or declining something. With the categories available, it looks like \"Access\" fits best since it involves permissions. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also work if it pertains to granting access to specific resources. I need to decide which category to choose.**Categorizing IT request**\n\nThe user wants to access the sales marketing department, which likely involves a folder or system. They also mentioned contributing on a specific Tuesday in March and requested a document template. The \"Access\" category seems fitting since they aren\u2019t specifically asking for administrative rights. The instructions are clear, and I\u2019ll categorize this IT ticket using a JSON object format like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll keep it concise, focusing solely on the required information.**Formatting response correctly**\n\nThe system message specifies the required response format, which is a JSON object containing a category. I need to ensure that my response matches the outlined structure. So, I\u2019ll format it simply as {\"category\":\"Access\"} without adding any extra text. It\u2019s important that I stick precisely to the format to meet the expectations outlined in the message. Let's keep it straightforward!"
