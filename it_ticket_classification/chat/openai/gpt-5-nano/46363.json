The text is a bit mixed up but focuses on requesting leave and mentions unused annual leave days and a warning. This points to an HR-related concern. Among the categories available, \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate choice. I\u2019ll format my response with a JSON object specifying \"category\": \"HR Support.\" That seems clear and straightforward!**Responding with JSON Format**\n\nI see that the instruction at the top gives a schema where the category needs to be a string enum, so I should respond with a JSON object. The user asked for the category of the IT ticket, so the output should simply be {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It seems the system expects this straightforward format. I\u2019m keeping it minimal as per the guidelines and will just deliver the JSON without any additional notes. Here we go!"
