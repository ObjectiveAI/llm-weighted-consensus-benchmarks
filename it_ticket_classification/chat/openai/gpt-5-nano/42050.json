I could go with \"Miscellaneous\" since it\u2019s general, or \"Internal Project\" if it's more about a specific internal project. There's \"Access\" if they need access to the reports, but the mention of \"device broad st created\" feels odd. If it involves getting rights for report generation, \"Administrative rights\" might fit better. The core seems to be about a \"queue performance by period\" report, so I\u2019ll figure out the best fit.**Deciding on report categories**\n\nThe user mentions that a \"queue performance by period\" report wasn't received, which could mean they actually got it on Friday. They\u2019re asking for help with obtaining these reports, so I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s an \"Administrative rights\" issue regarding access, but there\u2019s no clear access problem. The phrase \"device broad st created\" might indicate a location, yet it's unclear. I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the safest choice since it pertains to reports rather than hardware or access.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe provided categories include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" and since this ticket is focused on obtaining reports, \"Access\" seems fitting. The user mentions that they haven't received the \"queue performance by period\u201d reports and asks for help, indicating an access issue. It\u2019s not necessarily about permissions, but in IT ticket routing, I'd categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" if the user couldn't generate reports due to restrictions. However, since there's no explicit permission mention, \u201cAccess\u201d feels like the right choice. Now, I'll craft a JSON-like object to categorize this ticket appropriately.**Crafting JSON output for ticket**\n\nThe system prompt has a schema that requires a JSON object format. The user wants me to categorize the IT Ticket, so I need to ensure I use one of the defined categories. I think \"Access\" is appropriate since the user is asking for help with report availability. Although \"Miscellaneous\" is possible, the focus is on access to reports, so I'll go with \"Access.\" Now I'll just produce the output with no extra text, sticking to the format. Here we go:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
