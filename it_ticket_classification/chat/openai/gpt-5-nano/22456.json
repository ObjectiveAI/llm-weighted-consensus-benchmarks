My first thought is that it could fit into categories like HR Support or Access, given it involves onboarding a new employee. Since it's about completing a form and pertains to HR processes, I think HR Support might be the most appropriate choice. I\u2019ll output the JSON object with the selected category now.**Determining Category for Onboarding**\n\nI'm trying to categorize a ticket about onboarding a new starter. It could fall under HR Support or Access, as both involve aspects of this process. On one hand, it mentions \"complete form\" and joining, which aligns with HR. Yet, it also involves granting access to systems. Given that it's specifically about a new employee completing forms related to compliance, I think \"HR Support\" is the simplest and most accurate category for this ticket.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
