There\u2019s a mention of changing the location of a tower, which could indicate a relocation. Given the content, it seems like it fits best into the \"Hardware\" category because it's primarily about replacing broken devices. However, it might also fit under \"Purchase\" if they're requesting new equipment. Let's go with \"Hardware\" for clarity.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket clearly requests new hardware\u2014a monitor, keyboard, and mouse\u2014due to broken items, which makes it hardware-related. It falls under \"Hardware\" for replacement or \"Purchase\" for new devices. However, since it focuses on the need for replacements, \"Hardware\" is the most suitable category. I'll create a response in a structured format as a JSON object that simply states: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I won't add any extra explanations; keeping it concise is key!**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nThe instruction is to categorize the IT ticket, and I\u2019m considering the user\u2019s request for a \"new monitor, keyboard, and mouse.\" While it could be viewed as a procurement request, since their current items are broken, it more directly relates to hardware replacement. The phrase \"please assign provide monitor keyboard mouse mine broken\" reinforces this. The mention of relocating hardware also points towards \"Hardware\" being the most fitting category. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned that their items are broken, specifically saying \"mine broken,\" indicating a need for a replacement. The request also refers to relocating hardware with \"changed location tower,\" which reinforces its connection to hardware. So, I\u2019ll categorize this IT ticket as hardware-related. I\u2019ll keep it concise and deliver the output as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This clearly addresses their request without any unnecessary details."
