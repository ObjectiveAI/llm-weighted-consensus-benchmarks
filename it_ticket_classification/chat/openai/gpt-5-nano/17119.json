They mention an \"inch monitor,\" which probably needs a size clarification\u2014maybe it's an 18 or 24 inch monitor? It seems they want it added under their user name, requested installation, and are looking for receipts after the product purchase order procedure. So, I can categorize this ticket under Hardware, Access, Purchase, Administrative rights, or similar. There's a lot going on here!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI need to choose an appropriate category for this ticket from the allowed options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. This ticket is about requesting monitor installation and involves a purchase order, so it could fit under \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" It also mentions wanting receipts post-purchase, indicating it's related to procurement. Typically, I'd categorize this as \"Purchase\" since it involves a purchase order procedure, but \"Hardware\" makes sense too. Let's pick what fits best!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket is requesting a monitor installation, which suggests it fits best in either \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" The mention of the purchase order procedure leans towards \"Purchase,\" but since it's fundamentally about the monitor, I think \"Hardware\" is more appropriate. It seems like the core request revolves around installing the hardware. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format required, indicating the category as \"Hardware.\" It might help to include a brief rationale for clarity. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ll structure it: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
