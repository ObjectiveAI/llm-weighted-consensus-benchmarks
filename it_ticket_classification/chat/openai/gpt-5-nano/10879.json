The user\u2019s message is messy but seems to ask about creating a shared mailbox, permissions, and calendar access. It looks like a request related to Access or Administrative rights since it involves managing who can view the calendar and potentially deleting something that\u2019s no longer needed. So, it points to Access management.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe most fitting category here is \"Administrative rights\" since it relates to granting or changing permissions for calendar access and shared mailbox management. The user mentions rights and visibility, which solidifies this choice. I should respond with a JSON object format as per the provided schema, saying: {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}. Since the user didn't explicitly ask for explanations, including a minimal justification could be helpful, but it\u2019s not necessary. I'll just stick with the JSON output for clarity.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
