The message mentions a \"new starter\" and an attached \"starter form,\" suggesting it's related to HR onboarding. Given the terms like \"manager section lead,\" it seems to fit best under \"HR Support.\" However, there's a possibility it could also relate to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it involves onboarding and possibly permissions, but the focus is definitely on the starter form for HR purposes.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI believe the best category for this ticket is \"HR Support\" since it's clearly about a new starter form. The other categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" don't fit. \"Administrative rights\" is too specific, and \"Access\" typically refers to permissions for IT systems. The content is focused on form attachments and onboarding. In many IT ticketing systems, onboarding forms are categorized under HR, making \"HR Support\" the most logical choice.**Creating JSON Output**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"manager section lead\" and \"attach starter filled,\" indicating it's likely for processing by IT for onboarding purposes, like enabling accounts and access. Since the ticket is essentially sending an HR onboarding form to capture details, I should categorize it as \"HR Support.\" \n\nNow, I need to format the response as a JSON object with just the category value. It should look like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"} \n\nI'll ensure we respond with this exact output."
