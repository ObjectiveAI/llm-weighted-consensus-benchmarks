The request to fill out a starter form suggests it\u2019s HR-related. Given that context, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it under \u201cHR Support.\u201d There\u2019s a slight possibility for \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d but HR Support seems most fitting.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the text: it mentions \"fill starter form,\" which suggests onboarding. The phrase \"new starter July PM\" likely indicates a new person starting in July. While I considered \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" those don't quite fit. The focus is on filling out a starter form due to a date change, which signals it's an HR onboarding matter. So, I'm inclined to categorize it as \"HR Support\" rather than \"Access,\" which is more about user accounts. Let's go with \"HR Support\"!**Formatting IT Ticket as JSON**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket and return it in JSON format. The instruction states to use a specific category schema, which includes valid options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. Based on my earlier analysis, I\u2019m deciding on the category \"HR Support.\" So, I\u2019ll format my output as required. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll make sure the formatting is precise. Let\u2019s go ahead and finalize this!"
