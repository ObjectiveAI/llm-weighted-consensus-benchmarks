They mentioned messages disappearing along with an error message suggesting a restart. First, I\u2019ll consider the category list: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. This situation seems to relate to data loss, potentially regarding email or messages on a device, so I'll focus on finding the right category for that.**Classifying data loss incidents**\n\nI\u2019m dealing with an IT ticket concerning \"lost messages\" and recovery requests. Since this involves data loss, I need to determine the most fitting category. The \"Storage\" category could cover data loss or recovery, while \"Miscellaneous\" works if the specifics are unclear. \"Access\" might apply if there are account access issues, but there's no clear hardware problem. Given the context, I think it makes the most sense to categorize this ticket as \"Storage\" and format it as a JSON object for the response.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
