Since there isn't a specific \"Software\" category available, \"Miscellaneous\" would be the most fitting option among the provided categories. I'll prepare a JSON output with the selected category.**Finalizing IT Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket. While the user mentions some PC issues, the primary concern is the Excel error. Although \"Hardware\" could apply, the absence of a \"Software\" category leads me to choose \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll provide the output in JSON format as instructed.
