The ticket discusses upgrading existing testing infrastructure and mentions \"virtual machines running automated tests.\" Given the focus on a hardware upgrade, it seems like the best fit could be \"Hardware.\" However, it might also fall under \"Internal Project\" or \"Purchase.\" Ultimately, since the main emphasis is on the hardware aspect, \"Hardware\" seems the most appropriate category for this ticket.**Determining ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the content of the IT ticket, which discusses a \u201chardware update\u201d and an \u201cupgrade existing testing infrastructure.\u201d It mentions \u201cvirtual machines running automated tests,\u201d clearly focusing on hardware. While it might also fit into \"Internal Project\" due to the testing upgrade aspect, the main emphasis is on the hardware upgrade. Therefore, I believe the best category is \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with \"category\": \"Hardware.\"**Formatting response correctly**\n\nThe user requires the response in a specific format: a JSON object with the field \"category\" that includes enumerated values. I need to make sure there's no extra content. The instructions clearly say to output only the category, and I should simply respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.\n\nI\u2019ll double-check the case for consistency, ensuring \"Hardware\" is with a capital H. Alright, I'm all set to provide the final response!"
