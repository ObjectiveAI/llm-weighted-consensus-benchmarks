The user mentions things like using toil days, problems with submissions, and flight details involving Dublin. It looks like it revolves around time off in lieu or TOIL. Given this context, it seems most appropriate to classify this ticket under \"HR Support,\" since it involves leave and related queries.**Identifying category for HR issue**\n\nIt looks like we\u2019re dealing with an HR or leave management issue rather than something related to IT hardware or access. The category list includes \"HR Support,\" and that seems to fit best given the user's concerns about TOIL and leave management. They mentioned \"problems regarding toil days submission\" and \"input leave,\" indicating it's about leave management. Therefore, I'll format the response in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Clarifying JSON response format**\n\nI see that the required format is a JSON schema-like wrapper that defines the structure of the expected output, specifically for the category. It specifies: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[...]}}} which shows what kind of data to include.\n\nIt seems I need to provide the category field with the actual value. Since \"HR Support\" is within the allowed categories, I will format the response as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This follows the schema and includes the necessary value.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
