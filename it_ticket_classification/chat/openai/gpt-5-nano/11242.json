The request mentions \"new starter,\" \"induction,\" and \"completion attached return form,\" which suggests it's related to onboarding. \n\nI\u2019m thinking the best fit might be \"HR Support\" since it primarily involves assisting with a starter form. However, it could also fall under \"Access\" if it relates to provisioning. Interestingly, \"Administrative rights\" could work too, if admin access is necessary. I\u2019ll weigh these options carefully!**Deciding on the category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket. \"HR Support\" might not fit since it usually pertains to HR issues, and yet the ticket involves onboarding. I think it\u2019s more relevant to IT as the user is asking for help completing the starter form. This leads me to lean towards \"Access,\" as new starters often need account provisioning. Although \"Administrative rights\" might apply if admin access is mentioned, I believe \"Access\" is the best choice here. I\u2019ll respond in the specified JSON format for categories!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
