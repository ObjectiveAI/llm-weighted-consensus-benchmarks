They mention issues with mobile submission and Chrome not working, suggesting something related to access or functionality. Since they also reference \u201cOracle Hi\u201d and how the app works well, I think it best fits under \"Access.\" This aligns with their problem of not being able to submit via mobile while other platforms are functioning well.**Analyzing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the user\u2019s issue regarding \"Oracle\" software and mobile submission, which seems to relate to access or device compatibility. Their inability to submit via mobile suggests this is an access issue, especially since they mention having a mobile app for another system that works well. Given that they tried using Chrome on a laptop and still faced issues, I believe this ticket fits best under the \"Access\" category, as it highlights problems with accessing or submitting through different devices.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
