The details mention an urgent change related to a line manager, possibly due to leave or replacement. This falls neatly into the \"HR Support\" category, but it could also connect with \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" Given the focus on HR functions, I'd lean towards classifying it as \"HR Support\" to ensure the request is directed properly.**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nFor this IT ticket, I see that the best category is likely \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it involves changing a line manager in Oracle Fusion, it suggests a need for access changes or permission adjustments. The details like \"urgent change\" and \"please approve\" indicate it\u2019s a request for someone going on leave or needing a replacement. Therefore, I'll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and prepare to respond with a JSON object: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
