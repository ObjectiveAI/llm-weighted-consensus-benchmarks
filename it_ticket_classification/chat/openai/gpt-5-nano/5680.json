It mentions things like \"merge build\" and \"remote connection,\" and seems to discuss issues with deployment and configuration changes. \n\nGiven this, the most fitting categories might be \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" The mention of \"remote connection\" leans towards an access-related concern. \n\nSo, I'll lean toward categorizing it as \"Access.\"**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI'm evaluating how to categorize this IT ticket based on the text provided. It seems like \"Access\" might be the right fit, especially since \"reconfigure\" and \"deploy fails\" indicate deployment issues. There\u2019s also a chance \"Administrative rights\" might be needed if admin privileges are involved.\n\n\"Internal Project\" could apply too, considering the mention of internal tasks. Overall, since I need to respond with a JSON object, I\u2019ll format it accordingly for the final response.**Selecting the category**\n\nI need to respond with the JSON object for this ticket. It looks like \"Access\" fits best since it mentions things like \"remote connection,\" \"deploy fails,\" and \"remote configuration changed.\" While \"Administrative rights\" might apply too, the best option seems to be \"Access\" for remote tasks. The ticket itself is a bit unclear, but given the context, especially with mentions of build and deployment, \"Access\" seems like the closest match. I\u2019ll keep the format consistent as required!**Finalizing the category selection**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing the ticket as \"Access\" given the mentions of \"remote connection\" and \"remote configuration.\" Those terms imply access-related issues. While \"Administrative rights\" could also apply if admin privileges are needed, it's unclear if that's necessary here. The wording doesn\u2019t explicitly request admin rights, so sticking with \"Access\" seems like the best choice. I\u2019ll respond in the required JSON format without any heavy formatting. Here\u2019s the final output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
