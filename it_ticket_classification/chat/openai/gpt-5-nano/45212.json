The mention of confusion and deletion makes it seem related to either \"Storage,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since the focus is on the document library and its management, it would most likely fit under the \"Storage\" category. It\u2019s all about organizing those documents effectively! I'll mark it accordingly.**Determining Category for IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the category for the IT ticket regarding the user's request to delete a duplicated library. The text mentions needing to delete, which suggests it's about managing storage, specifically related to the document library. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if permissions are involved, the user hasn't indicated access issues. Therefore, \"Storage\" appears to be the most fitting category. I\u2019ll confirm this by responding with a JSON format indicating the category as \"Storage.\"**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI need to respond with a specific JSON format to categorize the IT ticket. The required structure clearly indicates that the \"category\" field must match one of these enumerated types. Since this ticket is about deleting a document library, \"Storage\" is the appropriate category. I\u2019ll ensure to format it correctly and output exactly: \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}\n\nNo extra text is needed, just this succinct JSON object to meet the system's requirements!"
