It's not about hardware, access, or storage. I see it fitting best in the \"HR Support\" category due to those mentions of employees leaving and forms. I could also consider \"Administrative rights,\" but \"HR Support\" seems more appropriate.**Determining Category for IT Ticket**\n\nI'm considering the category options for the user\u2019s text about \"bulk leavers testing.\" It seems like this request relates to testing a form for interns, likely for the off-boarding process. This fits more with HR processes rather than IT hardware. While I thought about \"Access\" since it could involve deactivating accounts for leavers, it doesn\u2019t explicitly mention that. So, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"HR Support\" and prepare the output in the correct JSON-like format.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
