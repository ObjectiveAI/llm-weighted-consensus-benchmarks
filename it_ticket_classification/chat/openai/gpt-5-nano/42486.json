The user mentioned that their phones were having problems but seemed to be resolved, yet they're still skeptical as they can receive calls but get disconnected when they answer. This seems related to the telecom or phone system. Given the category options, \"Hardware\" looks to be the most appropriate choice since it's primarily about phone hardware infrastructure.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI'm considering the right category for this IT ticket, given the phone issues mentioned. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Storage\" don't seem applicable, and \"Purchase\" is irrelevant. While \"Miscellaneous\" could work since it's a voice system issue, it feels more like a hardware or network concern. Since \"Network\" isn't an option, I'll go with \"Hardware,\" which aligns best with the user's issue. I'll respond in the required JSON format with the selected category included.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
