So, I should likely categorize this under \"Hardware\" since it involves a physical component of the laptop.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user seems to want to upgrade RAM by transferring it from an old laptop to a new one. This action is definitely hardware-related, which makes \"Hardware\" the most appropriate category. There could be other interpretations, like \"Internal Project\" or \"Purchase,\" if they're considering purchasing RAM, but since the focus is on the hardware upgrade, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware.\" I just need to respond with the JSON format for the category without adding any extra details.
