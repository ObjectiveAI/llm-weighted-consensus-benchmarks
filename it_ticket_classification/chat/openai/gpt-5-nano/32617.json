They might want to close projects in Oracle on a specific date and reference a planned annual leave for a senior. The options I have are varied, including categories like Access and Administrative rights. I\u2019m trying to determine which category fits best, but it could potentially be a request concerning Administrative rights. I'll decide on that.**Selecting the ticket category**\n\nLooking at the phrase \"close projects oracle wednesday,\" it suggests closing internal projects in Oracle, which fits the \"Internal Project\" category. Although it could relate to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" I think \"Internal Project\" is the best choice here. The mention of \"annual leave senior\" could connect to \"HR Support,\" but since I need to choose one category, I'll stick with \"Internal Project.\" \n\nI\u2019ll format my response in JSON as required.  \n{\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}"
