Since the text revolves around HR matters related to leave requests, it fits well under the \"HR Support\" category. So, I'll classify this ticket as \"HR Support\" since that\u2019s the most appropriate category.**Formatting the IT ticket category**\n\nI need to determine the proper category for the IT ticket. While the issue relates to the leave system and could potentially fit under \"Access,\" it more clearly fits under \"HR Support,\" as the user is addressing a leave request. I\u2019ll ensure I respond in the correct JSON format specifying the category. The correct entry will look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll double-check that the format is precise and then proceed with outputting the JSON."
