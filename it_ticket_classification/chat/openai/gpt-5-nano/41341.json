The main topics seem to be related to leave requests, approval flows, and timecard submission problems. This certainly falls under the scope of HR issues, so I think \"HR Support\" is the best category for this ticket. It involves leave management systems and the related complications that arise from them.**Categorizing leave issues**\n\nThe issues I'm seeing are related to the leave request approval flow, problems with the approvers list, and trouble submitting timecards or hours. Given that it's primarily about the leave management system, \"HR Support\" seems like the best category. I might consider \"Access\" if the user's access rights are blocking them from viewing the approvers list, but HR Support is the main focus. I'll categorize it as an HR issue and suggest high priority for the user's problems.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
