It\u2019s a bit jumbled but highlights overall issues with degraded reporting performance and loading data charts, alongside problems downloading reports in Excel and Word formats.\n\nGiven the categories provided, this seems to fit under \"Miscellaneous\" since it's about a general performance issue rather than a specific hardware or user access problem. I'll decide this is the best category for this ticket.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis IT ticket seems related to the reporting system, so I\u2019m considering categories from the user\u2019s list. \u201cDegraded reporting performance\u201d points towards it likely being part of an internal project, making \"Internal Project\" a suitable choice. \n\nOther categories like \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d \u201cAccess,\u201d \u201cStorage,\u201d \u201cPurchase,\u201d and \u201cHardware\u201d don\u2019t fit the context.
