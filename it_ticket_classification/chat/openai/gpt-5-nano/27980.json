It looks like I need to consider where this request fits \u2014 possibly in \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Storage\" could be a good fit since it deals with document storage and version control. Although \"Administrative rights\" might be relevant, it seems the user isn't asking for permission, so I\u2019m going with \"Storage\" as the best guess for this task."
