They mentioned that \"safari servers are down\" and requested help with accessibility. Since the main issue appears to be related to server downtime, it could fit into either \"Hardware\" or \"Access.\" After considering the content, it seems most appropriate to categorize this ticket under \"Hardware,\" as it specifically addresses a problem with server functionality.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this ticket properly. The phrases refer to \"servers are down,\" which is related to infrastructure and would likely fall under \"Hardware.\" The Access category seems less suitable here since the issue isn't about user access, but rather an operational failure. While the user mentioned accessing \"safari machines,\" which could suggest a specific cluster, the core issue remains a server outage. Therefore, I'll assign this ticket to \"Hardware\" to reflect that accurately. I should respond with a structured output indicating the category.**Formatting response properly**\n\nThe prompt asks for the category to be output in a JSON-like format. I see the need to define a category object with a field labeled \"category,\" and the options available include \"Hardware.\" So my response should simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI want to follow the instructions closely, ensuring that there's no extra text. I just need to confirm that \"Hardware\" is capitalized correctly, which it is. Alright, I\u2019ll provide the final response now."
