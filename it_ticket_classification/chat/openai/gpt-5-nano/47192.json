The message is about an \"Oracle sign issue,\" which could refer to a signing problem or confusion regarding the sign-in process. It mentions issues with the password needing to match their domain one, indicating a possible login issue. The user's request for help and high importance tag underlines the urgency of resolving this sign issue. It looks like I should prioritize this ticket!**Categorizing IT Ticket Further**\n\nThe message includes terms like \"password same your domain,\" \"approve access,\" and \"signing password.\" I\u2019m wondering if I should categorize this ticket as \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" The options available are \"Access,\" \"Security,\" or \"Internal Project.\" Given the user's request to \"approve access,\" it leans towards \"Access,\" but \"Administrative Rights\" might fit better if it's about granting permissions. I should opt for the more specific category if it relates to admin rights in IT. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object with {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
