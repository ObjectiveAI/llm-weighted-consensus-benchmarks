They\u2019re asking for advice or alternatives to improve the picture quality. The user also mentioned editing their profile and changing the photo. It doesn't fit traditional categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"HR Support,\" so I think I\u2019d classify it as \"Miscellaneous\" since it's an IT-related issue focused on profile pictures.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at different categories for this IT ticket. The options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the issue concerns the quality of a profile picture, it might fit under \"Miscellaneous,\" as it doesn\u2019t really involve login or permissions like \"Access\" does. I'll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" and suggest next steps, such as checking the image resolution requirements, uploading a higher-resolution image, and considering using an avatar or connected directory.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
