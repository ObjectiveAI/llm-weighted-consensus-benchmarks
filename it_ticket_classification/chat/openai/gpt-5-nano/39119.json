The content mentions \"cables\" and \"meeting room issues,\" which suggests a technical problem. It seems most fitting to classify this under \"Hardware\" since it involves cables, but it could also relate to an \"Internal Project.\" While \"Access\" could have been relevant if it were about access control, that seems unlikely here. \"Miscellaneous\" is a fallback option.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nThe best category for the ticket is \"Hardware\" because it involves labeling cables in a meeting room. While \"Meeting room\" could imply \"Facilities,\" that's not one of our categories. I need to respond with a JSON-like category object in the required format, ensuring it matches the specified schema. The assistant must output a JSON object containing the chosen category, which here is \"Hardware.\" So, I\u2019ll structure my response accordingly to meet the expected format.**Deciding the category format**\n\nThe content mentions \"labelling cables,\" signaling that it aligns with \"Hardware\" rather than a software issue. Given it relates to meeting room concerns and physical equipment, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" I want to ensure my response is properly formatted since it\u2019s meant to be parsed by a grader, so I\u2019ll output exactly the JSON object with no extra text involved. Therefore, I\u2019ll finalize it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
