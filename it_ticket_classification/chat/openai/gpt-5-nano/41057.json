It doesn't fit with hardware, HR, access, storage, or the others very well, so I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous.\" It could be \"Internal Project\" too, depending on what they're asking about.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's ticket is about a job stuck in a queue, which doesn't fit hardware. It seems to fall under \"IT ops\" or \"System/DevOps,\" but those aren't options. So \"Miscellaneous\" is the best choice. The user specifically asked for a categorization, and I need to respond with a JSON format that includes the category. I\u2019ll finalize it as {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} without any extra text, as that's what they need. Let\u2019s go with that!"
