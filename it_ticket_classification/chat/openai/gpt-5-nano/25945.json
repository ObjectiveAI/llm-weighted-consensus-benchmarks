The options available for categorization include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the message talks about a purchase order and mentions installation and receipts, I'll interpret this as fitting into the \u201cPurchase\u201d category. Now, I should format my output as a JSON with the chosen category.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI see that the message mentions \"please log installation\" and \"mandatory receipts,\" suggesting it's about a new purchase order process. The word \"Purchase\" comes up frequently, making it the primary focus. Though I briefly consider \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d and \u201cHardware,\u201d it feels more centered around logging the purchase and installation details. Ultimately, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \u201cPurchase,\u201d since that fits best. Now, I'll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. That should work!"
