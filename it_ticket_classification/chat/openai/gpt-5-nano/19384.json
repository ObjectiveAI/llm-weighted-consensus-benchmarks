I\u2019m considering categories like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project,\" but definitely not \"Hardware.\" It could fit \"Administrative rights\" since it involves a control panel and confirmation, but that category usually applies to elevated privilege requests. So, I need to determine the most suitable category for this ticket.**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nI'm reviewing the content about the \"server side redirection rule for mailbox.\" It mentions needing confirmation and a control panel, which makes me think it could be categorized as \"Administrative rights\" since it involves permissions. \"Access\" usually pertains to user provisioning, but this request seems more aligned with control settings. It could be considered \"Internal Project\" if it's for implementing something new. Since the user is relying on me to classify this ticket, I\u2019ll lean towards \"Administrative rights.\"{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
