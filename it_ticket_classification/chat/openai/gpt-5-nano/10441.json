The ticket seems to involve security groups and firewall rules. It looks like it primarily concerns access control, making \"Access\" the most fitting category. So, I\u2019ll prepare the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I should keep the output concise, just showing the JSON.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to follow the format for the response as a JSON object containing the category. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward without any extra text. The ticket mentions updating security group rules and ports, which all relate to access control. Therefore, \"Access\" feels like the most appropriate category here. My final response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
