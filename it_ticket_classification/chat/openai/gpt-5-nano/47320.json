The user reports that their laptop screen is not working, but they can use an external monitor. Clearly, this is a hardware issue. The best category to assign here is \"Hardware.\" I'll return a structured response in JSON format with just that category. While it's primarily about categorization, I could also add a brief note suggesting it's a hardware issue that likely requires a screen replacement.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to provide the required format for the response, which is a JSON object. The instruction highlights that the assistant should respond in the necessary format, specifically with the category field. So, I\u2019m crafting the output as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any extra text or explanations. The user\u2019s mention of \"sent Friday\" and \"laptop screen working\" doesn't change the fact that it's a hardware issue. I'm sticking to the guidelines and keeping it clear and concise."
