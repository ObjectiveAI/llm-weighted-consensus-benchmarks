It mentions \u201caccess on issues\u201d and seems to ask for access to locations or presentations, making me think it's about access difficulties. The likely categories to consider are \u201cAccess\u201d and \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d Given the context, \u201cAccess\u201d seems the most suitable as it fits the request for viewing libraries and presentations, but I need to weigh if \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could apply too.**Classifying IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user is asking to categorize an IT ticket, with options like \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket mentions \"access on issues,\" \"view,\" and \"presentation,\" suggesting they likely want access to libraries and presentations. Given that the request isn't explicitly about administrative rights, it seems more aligned with \"Access.\" \n\nI\u2019ll format my response in JSON as instructed, providing a brief justification for why I selected \"Access.\" This will ensure clarity in the categorization process.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
