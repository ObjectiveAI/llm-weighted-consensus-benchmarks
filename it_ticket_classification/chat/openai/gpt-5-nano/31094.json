I want to ensure the categorization is clear and accurate, so I'll format it properly in JSON with the \"Access\" category.**Categorizing ticket issue**\n\nI see that the categories for this IT ticket include \"Administrative rights,\" but that's not really relevant here. The mention of the \"Oracle mobile expense app\" suggests an expense-related issue, and \"password reset\" clearly indicates an access problem. The connectivity issue with the Android app further reinforces this.\n\nSo, I'm concluding the category should be \"Access.\" I need to format the output as a JSON object with the category key. Therefore, I'll present it as {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
