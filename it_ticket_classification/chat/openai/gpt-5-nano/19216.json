I need to choose from the list of categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. This ticket clearly relates to HR since it involves requesting leave, so HR Support seems like the right choice. While I consider Administrative Rights, it doesn't quite fit here. I'll categorize it as HR Support.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe ticket involves adding an annual leave day, which means I should categorize it as \"HR Support.\" I'll need to format the response as a JSON object, following the specified structure: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Although \"Administrative rights\" could be considered, \"HR Support\" is clearly the best fit since it deals with leave. I\u2019ll make sure the output is just the JSON object as per the user\u2019s request. Here we go!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
