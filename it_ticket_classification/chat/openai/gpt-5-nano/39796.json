They mentioned problems like messages staying in the outbox and duplicated meeting reminders. Based on the provided categories\u2014like Hardware, HR Support, and Access\u2014this seems primarily like a software issue. However, since \"Software - Outlook\" isn't listed, \"Miscellaneous\" appears to be the best fit for their described issues. It\u2019s definitely not about hardware, so I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous\" for this one.**Finalizing IT ticket response**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that the category for this IT ticket is \"Miscellaneous.\" Now, I should craft the response in a JSON format as instructed. The system specifies that the response must include a \"category\" field with enumerated values.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll generate the output like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. It seems clear I shouldn\u2019t add any extra text\u2014just the JSON object as requested. Let\u2019s keep it straightforward and deliver just that!"
