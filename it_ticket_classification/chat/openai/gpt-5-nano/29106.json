The mention of \u201cprocurement\u201d and \u201crequisition\u201d suggests it fits best under the \u201cPurchase\u201d category since they relate to purchase workflows. However, I should also consider the possibility of it being a UI improvement issue, which might lead to \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d I\u2019ll finalize the category in the required JSON format.**Finalizing category JSON**\n\nThe best fit for this ticket is \u201cPurchase\u201d since it relates to procurement and requisition display. I considered \u201cAccess\u201d due to references to view tabs, but it\u2019s not about access rights. \u201cInternal Project\u201d would be relevant if it pertained to an internal project, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.
