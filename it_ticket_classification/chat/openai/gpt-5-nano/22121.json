The text mentions creating groups like \"climb squad\" and \"fly squad,\" which suggests this is an admin task related to access control. The suitable categories provided include \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Access.\" Since this involves managing groups, I think \"Administrative rights\" fits best due to its focus on setting up access and ownership.**Deciding on a ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m weighing the category for the IT ticket. It involves creating groups, so \"Administrative rights\" seems fitting since it focuses on granting permissions. Alternatively, \"Access\" could apply as it's about access to these groups. I need to format my response as a JSON object per system instructions, stating the category. Even though \"Internal Project\" might fit, the creation aspect leans more towards \"Administrative rights.\" So, I'll go with that choice and finalize the output.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
