Given the context, I'll select \"Access\" as the appropriate category, as it directly pertains to the login credentials and access problems the user is experiencing.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm thinking about the right category for this IT ticket. It seems like \"Access\" best fits since the user is having issues with Outlook access. The user's description indicates a problem with email client access. I need to respond with a JSON object containing the category, following the output format. The valid output would indeed be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nLet\u2019s keep it simple and deliver just that JSON, with no extra text included."
