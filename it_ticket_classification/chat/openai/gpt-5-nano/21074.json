The request suggests it relates to access, specifically adding the user to a February PM group or meeting. Based on the categories available, this seems to fit best under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I'll make sure to classify it appropriately.**Categorizing access request**\n\nThis appears to be an access request, likely fitting under the \"Access\" category since the user is seeking to gain access to something. However, \"Administrative rights\" could apply if elevated privileges were involved, though the phrase \"add me to February PM\" seems more about membership in a project or distribution list. I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" Now, I need to craft a concise JSON object confirming this category as requested. The output will include category: \"Access,\" but I should consider if \"Internal Project\" might be appropriate too.**Delivering access request category**\n\nThe user's request to \"add me to February PM\" seems more like they want to join a mailing list or a project management group. The mention of \"head\" could imply a leader or subject. The phrase \"add hello please add thank head\" is a bit jumbled. Nevertheless, it's clear that this is an access request. I'll keep it simple and respond with just the necessary JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"} to match the schema provided and avoid any extra explanations."
