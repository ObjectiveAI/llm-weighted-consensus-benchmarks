The request is quite unclear, as it keeps mentioning \"ownership\" without much context. I'll refer to the categories I have: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the focus on ownership, it seems related to access rights or administrative rights. So, I think I'll go with the \"Access\" category for this ticket.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s request seems to revolve around \"ownership\" and could relate to admin rights or access control. Given the available categories, I think \"Access\" is the most fitting. I need to format my response as a JSON object with a \"category\" field following the specified structure. Since the user didn\u2019t ask for an explanation, I\u2019ll keep my output concise. I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Just double-checking if it might be \"Administrative rights,\" but I believe \"Access\" fits best.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI noticed there's a specific category for \"Administrative rights\" that could be more fitting. The user's request heavily emphasizes \"ownership,\" which might mean they're asking for admin rights. The phrase itself is unclear, but it suggests they want to maintain ownership or rights over something. \n\nComparing it to the broader \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights\" feels more precise in this case. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Administrative rights\" and respond with: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
