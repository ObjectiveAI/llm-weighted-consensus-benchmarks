The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the ticket seems related to an application issue, it looks like it best fits under the \"Miscellaneous\" category because it doesn\u2019t clearly fall into any of the hardware or access-related issues. I'll prepare this as a JSON object.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT ticket about Outlook not starting. While \"Software\" isn't an option, \"Miscellaneous\" could work, especially since it's the catch-all category. There's a chance it could relate to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" if it involves permission issues. However, since the user asked to log the ticket for a starting issue and it's mainly about Outlook, I'll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous.\" Here\u2019s the JSON output:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
