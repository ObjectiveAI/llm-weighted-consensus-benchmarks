The provided categories include \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context of onboarding and mention of an induction form, it seems reasonable to categorize this ticket under \"HR Support,\" as it relates to the new starter process. I\u2019ll output this as a JSON object with the appropriate category.**Determining the Ticket Category**\n\nThe user is asking for help with a \"return form\" and mentions \"empty part,\" which raises the question of whether this falls under \"Administrative rights.\" However, it seems more related to onboard form completion, leaning towards \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Access.\" The mention of a \"new starter\" suggests involvement with HR, but IT could also handle necessary access rights. Given the context, I believe \"HR Support\" is the more fitting category for this ticket.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions needing assistance with a \"return form\" and highlights an \"empty part,\" suggesting someone hasn't completed a section. I considered if it could fit under \"Internal Project,\" but that doesn't seem right. \"Access\" is relevant since onboarding involves granting access, although it could also involve \"Administrative rights.\" Ultimately, the best option appears to be \"HR Support\" since it's about a starter form for onboarding. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
