The categories I have to choose from include Access, Internal Project, Administrative Rights, and others. \"Access\" seems fitting if it's about uploading, while \"Internal Project\" might apply if it's a specific task. If it\u2019s unclear, I might go with \"Miscellaneous.\" I need to be careful to select the most accurate category!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user's request mentions \"uploading contacts into Friday PM,\" which might refer to a project management tool. They ask to upload an Excel sheet, suggesting this could relate to \"Administrative Rights.\" I need to find the best category since their content indicates an operational task involving software usage or data processing. It could fit under \"Internal Project\" because it's an internal process, or \"Access,\" but that's more related to login issues. However, \"Administrative Rights\" sounds like the most appropriate choice given the context!**Deciding on output format**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket, and their message is clear in that it\u2019s not a call for help. They\u2019ve provided text for categorization, and I need to present it as a JSON object with a \"category\" field. I\u2019m considering which category fits best, leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" Uploading contacts may fit \"Internal Project,\" especially if it's part of a data migration or onboarding process within an internal project. I'll make sure to format it correctly!**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nThe ticket mentions details about subsidiaries and liabilities, which isn\u2019t directly relevant to IT. I considered various categories: \"Administrative Rights\" might fit if uploading is requested, but it\u2019s not explicit. \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Hardware\" don't apply. \"Access\" is ambiguous, and \"HR Support\" isn't relevant either. Given that the task involves uploading contacts into Friday PM for subsidiaries, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best choice. So, I'll format the final output as JSON: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
