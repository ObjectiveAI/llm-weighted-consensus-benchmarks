The message clearly indicates a request to add a user for access to this project, possibly through Active Directory. Given the context, it seems to fit better in the \"Access\" category rather than \"Administrative rights,\" though both are options. I'll need to decide which category best aligns with the ticket's needs.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user's request is about granting access to Confluence for a project, which fits in the \"Access\" category. It seems they want to add a user, potentially relating to Active Directory, so it's about provisioning access rather than administrative rights. Even though the \"Internal Project\" category could also apply to the vacation rentals project, the core request is for access. Therefore, I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate category to use for this ticket.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
