It mentions \"Oracle,\" which could refer to a job or the software itself, like Oracle HR payroll. The user is likely trying to add a new job role. Given the context, it seems to fit best under \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll make a decision soon!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket, \"add new job oracle.\" It could be \"Administrative rights\" if the user wants to create a new role, but since the request is specifically to add a job named consultant, it seems more like adding a job title in the Oracle HRIS database. \"Internal Project\" might fit if this is project-specific, but it looks like \"HR Support\" is the best category since it relates to HR processes for adding job titles. I\u2019ll go with that!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nIn IT ticket triage, there's an \"HR Support\" category that fits tasks related to HRIS. Since the user is requesting to add a new job titled \"consultant\" in Oracle, this seems to align directly with \"HR Support.\" It could also fit in \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s part of a specific project, but the clearer choice is \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll categorize it as such and include a note: \"Ticket category: HR Support - adding a new job title in Oracle (HRIS).\"{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
