The options available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket seems to mainly focus on a hardware request for a surge protector and mentions assigning someone. So, it really fits best in the \"Hardware\" category. However, \"Purchase\" could also apply if it's about procuring the equipment. I'll go with \"Hardware.\"**Classifying IT Request**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"surge protector location,\" which seems to refer to needing the location of a surge protector and possibly assigning it to someone, likely the senior tester. It's a bit ambiguous, but since it relates to hardware, we should categorize it as \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll respond in the required JSON format without extra explanation. I\u2019ll just provide the information they need, which means I\u2019ll output: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`."
