The user describes errors with submission codes from last week. Given that this relates to HR and payroll, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit. However, it could also be \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are involved. But the unclear phrase about \"using codes always use\" is tricky. If it's too ambiguous, I might consider \"Miscellaneous.\" Anyway, I need to choose the best category!**Categorizing IT issues**\n\nI\u2019m considering the phrase about the \"Oracle time entry issue submission for last week giving errors.\" It seems like a problem with HR, or it could relate to Access if they need system permissions. However, since \"Software\" and \"Oracle\" aren't categories we can choose from, \"HR Support\" is the most fitting option. I\u2019ll need to respond in the required format, which is a JSON object. So my final output will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
