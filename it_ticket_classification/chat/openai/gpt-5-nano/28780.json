The ticket is messy but primarily seems about migrating a site\u2014moving old records, site transfer, uploading files, and managing editing rights. It also mentions access rights, deadlines, and closing down the old site. Based on this, I believe the most fitting category is \"Internal Project,\" as it centers on site migration and content management.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI'm trying to determine the best category for this ticket. \"Internal Project\" seems fitting since it's focused on migration. \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it primarily concerns editing rights, while \"Access\" would be appropriate for site access issues. The ticket emphasizes guidance on migration, uploading, and archiving files. Given the main objective is site migration, I'll go with \"Internal Project.\" Now, I need to respond in the required JSON format with the chosen category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
