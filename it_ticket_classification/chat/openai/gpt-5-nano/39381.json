I'll consider options like \"Storage\" since it relates to backups and recovery points. While \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t seem fitting, \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could also apply. However, I think \"Storage\" is the most accurate category for this alert.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
