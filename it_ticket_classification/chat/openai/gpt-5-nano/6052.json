I need to format my response as a JSON object, specifically using the structure {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. The system expects this precise format without any additional text. So, I will present my final answer in plain text: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Let's make sure I deliver just that and nothing more!"
