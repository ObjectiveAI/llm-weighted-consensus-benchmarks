Given the categories available, this request appears to relate to storage. Snapshots are typically a storage feature, so I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as Storage. While there are mentions of assigning a senior engineer, it doesn\u2019t seem pertinent here. I should respond in the required JSON format, stating the category as \"Storage.\"**Validating JSON format**\n\nI need to follow the required format for categorizing the IT ticket. It seems I\u2019m supposed to structure the output as a JSON object with specific properties. It looks like the schema indicates I should include \"type\": \"object\" with \"category\" as a property. However, from previous tasks, I recall simply returning {\"category\":\"Storage\"} was acceptable. To be safe, I'll go ahead and provide the full object to match the schema precisely. So, here\u2019s the output: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}."
