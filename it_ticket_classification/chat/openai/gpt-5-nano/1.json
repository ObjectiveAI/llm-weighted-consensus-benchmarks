The user seems to be requesting to classify it likely under \u201cHR Support\u201d since it specifically mentions a \"work experience student.\" The ticket references aspects like duration and name, which leads me to think it relates to an intern or similar role. My goal is to output this as a JSON-like structure, focusing on responding clearly with the chosen category.**Interpreting the IT support request**\n\nI think this message likely pertains to onboarding an intern, possibly regarding the duration of their internship. Categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access\" could fit this. Since it mentions a \"work experience student,\" it seems the user might want to inquire about details or create a ticket for HR. The repetitive phrase about the \"work experience user\" doesn\u2019t point to a clear IT issue, making \u201cHR Support\u201d seem like the best categorization choice.**Determining ticket category**\n\nSince there isn't a clear technical issue in the message, categorizing this as \"HR Support\" seems safest. It's likely about onboarding a work experience student, but it could also relate to \"Administrative rights\" if access is involved. I\u2019ll need to format my response as a JSON-like object with the category. Although \"Access\" might fit, the mention of \"duration\" suggests it's more about details than access itself. So, I'll go with \"HR Support\" in the response.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
