The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nI think the request relates to setting up monitoring for polls, which seems to fit best under \"Internal Project.\" So, I\u2019ll output a JSON object with \"category\": \"Internal Project\" in the format specified.**Interpreting IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m interpreting the ticket regarding adding polls to monitoring, specifically mentioning \u201cassets,\u201d \u201cavailability report,\u201d and \u201cdashboard.\u201d It seems that the user is referring to monitoring systems. \n\nI\u2019m considering categories: \u201cInternal Project\u201d could fit well if it's for a project, while \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d might work if it\u2019s unclear. The mention of \u201cassets\u201d hints at IT assets but doesn\u2019t directly relate to \u201cAccess.\u201d Overall, it suggests a monitoring-related project rather than a straightforward hardware request.**Categorizing ticket options**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the ticket based on the given categories. It seems to be about monitoring asset availability and dashboards, and I\u2019m leaning towards \"Internal Project\" since it relates to an internal project task.\n\nThere\u2019s a chance it could fit into \"Miscellaneous\" if it\u2019s not clear-cut, but it usually seems like requests for monitoring might point to needing \"Administrative rights\" if admin access were required. However, it doesn\u2019t specifically mention access credentials, and since it\u2019s about a project task, I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project.\"**Choosing category for ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the ticket as \"Internal Project.\" I considered \"Access\" briefly if they needed to adjust monitoring access for assets, but there's nothing explicit mentioning that. So, sticking with \"Internal Project\" makes sense.\n\nNow I need to prepare the output. The format is a JSON object, and I'll ensure it matches the required schema. So, I'll provide it as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Time to send that response!"
