The ticket mentions changing the annual leave approver, which is an access or permissions issue. It could fit under \"Access\" since it relates to approval authority, but it also aligns with \"HR Support\" since it involves HR functions related to annual leave. The content mentions changing the approver role multiple times.**Classifying the request**\n\nThe user is requesting help to change the annual leave approver, which indicates a need to modify the approval workflow. I think the best category for this would be \"Administrative rights,\" as it involves changing who has the permission to approve. However, I\u2019m also considering \"Access\" because it relates to approval authority. Given the explicit mention of \"approver\" and \"change,\" I must carefully choose the category. I lean towards \"Administrative rights\" since it reflects the admin capability to set the approver.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
