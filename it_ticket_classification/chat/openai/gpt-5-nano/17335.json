Since it doesn't specify an IT issue, I might lean towards \"Miscellaneous.\"**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe safest category seems to be \"Miscellaneous,\" although I\u2019m also considering \"Hardware\" if the user is talking about a hardware item. But backpacks usually aren't classified as hardware devices. \n\nCould \"backpack\" refer to something software-related, like \"Backpack Thursday\"? Given how ambiguous the text is, it makes sense to classify it as \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\nI'll provide the JSON format the system expects with the category property. So, here it is: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
