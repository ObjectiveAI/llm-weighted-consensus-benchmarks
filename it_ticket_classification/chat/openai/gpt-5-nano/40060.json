They\u2019re asking for help updating annual leave hours in accordance with Colombian legislation. It seems to fit best under the \"HR Support\" category since it\u2019s about HR functionality, even if it's not strictly IT-related. However, I want to keep in mind the limited categories available and ensure it aligns with what we've got. So, \"HR Support\" seems like the right call!**Categorizing ticket for JSON response**\n\nI\u2019ve got a ticket that seems primarily about updating leave hours, which points to \"HR Support\" as the best category. While \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Internal Project\" don\u2019t quite fit, I feel confident in my choice. We need to format this in JSON as per the user's request. The expected format shows a simple structure with the \"category\" field. So, my response will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I could also add a brief explanation for clarity!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
