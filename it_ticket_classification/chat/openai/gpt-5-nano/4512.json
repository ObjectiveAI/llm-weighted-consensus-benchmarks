The available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Based on the ticket content, \"Access\" seems most appropriate, but there\u2019s also a chance it could fall under \"Administrative rights\" due to the mention of permissions. Since it's likely about viewing planning epics, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" here.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket that says: \"access to hi resources link view planning epics visible.\" Given the context, it doesn't seem related to hardware or storage, so \"Access\" feels like the right choice. However, since there's a mention of \"view planning epics,\" it could also fit under \"Administrative rights,\" indicating a need for permissions. Still, for simplicity, I'll go with \"Access.\" \n\nI\u2019ll need to format this as a JSON object as instructed, so the output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Finalizing the output**\n\nFor this task, I need to keep it simple and just provide the JSON object as required. The output will be {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That's a valid response, and I'll avoid any extra text since the instructions are clear: just categorize and format it as JSON. I know \"Access\" aligns with the specified categories, so I'm confident in my choice. Time to deliver the output!"
