The message mentions both a monitor and keyboard, indicating it's likely related to hardware. Given the urgency with phrases like \"importance high\" and \"moved asap,\" I think it's best to assign it to the \"Hardware\" category. However, it could also be considered \"Purchase\" if they\u2019re asking for a replacement. The message does have some jumbled parts, but that's my assessment!**Categorizing IT request**\n\nThe user\u2019s request clearly indicates an urgent need for hardware relocation or replacement, as it involves a monitor and keyboard. Since it's not related to access or software, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" According to the instructions, I need to respond in JSON format, creating the object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. While \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option for moving equipment, \"Hardware\" fits best here. So, I\u2019ll proceed with just the JSON output!"
