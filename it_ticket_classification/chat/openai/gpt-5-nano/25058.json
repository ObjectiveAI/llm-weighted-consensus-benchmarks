The user wrote about \"oracle hours\" on a specific Tuesday in December, and they seem to need help assigning someone. I think it could fall under categories like \"Administrative rights\" if it relates to user permissions, but it might also connect to \"Access\" if it\u2019s about granting access. There are other possibilities, like \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I need to think carefully about the best fit.**Categorizing scheduling request**\n\nThis ticket is about scheduling Oracle hours on a Tuesday in December, and it feels like a request for scheduling tasks. I\u2019m considering categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" if it's linked to a specific project. However, it could also fit into \"Miscellaneous\" or potentially \"Administrative rights,\" since scheduling might be seen as an administrative task. The user\u2019s request to assign someone makes me think about \"Administrative rights,\" but overall, \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" might be the best fits here.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering classifying this IT ticket, which mentions adding Oracle hours. It seems to indicate a work item within a project, possibly categorized as \"Internal Project.\" The request is a bit jumbled, but the phrase \"please assign\" shows they want to assign someone. While there\u2019s mention of \"HR Support,\" it doesn\u2019t feel like HR is relevant here. I believe \"Internal Project\" is a safer choice, or maybe \"Miscellaneous\" fits too. Ultimately, I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" and output a JSON object for the category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
