It might fit under \"Access\" due to the license and subscription focus, but it could also be \"Purchase\" since it pertains to buying a license. \"Administrative rights\" might apply if admin access is needed for installation.**Finalizing Category Assignment**\n\nIt looks like the ticket is focused on license assignment and activation, so \"Access\" is definitely the best fit. Now I need to prepare the response in the required JSON format. The instructions specify to provide only the category, and it should be spelled exactly as \"Access.\" So, I\u2019ll structure it like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text or notes, just the JSON output. Here we go: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
