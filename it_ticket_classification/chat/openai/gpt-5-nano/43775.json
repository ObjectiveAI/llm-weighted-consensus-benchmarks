The user mentions issues regarding no access to newly installed network ports, alongside requests for assistance with link access. This seems to fall under \"Access\" or possibly \"Hardware,\" given the context of network connections. There's also the possibility of it being related to an \"Internal Project\" since it involves newly added equipment. It sounds most fitting for the \"Access\" category.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize this ticket as \"Access\" since it's primarily about gaining access to network ports. While it could also fit under \"Hardware\" due to the mention of physical devices like patch panels and switches, the core issue seems to be access to those links. The instructions imply that I should output a JSON object, so I\u2019ll keep it concise and simply write: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It feels like the right choice!"
