It mentions \"certificate\" multiple times, which seems important. I\u2019m thinking it might relate to an SSL certificate, but could also fit into other categories like \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights\" if it's about permission requests. It doesn\u2019t seem to fall under \"Purchase,\" \"Storage,\" \"Hardware,\" or \"HR Support.\" Given the context, it likely relates to generating a certificate, so I'll categorize it appropriately.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI need to figure out how to categorize an IT ticket. The content is a bit jumbled and doesn't clearly point to any specific category. \"Internal Project\" might apply if it's about certificate generation, but since I\u2019m unsure, I think \"Miscellaneous\" could be the safer default. \"Access\" might also be relevant since the mention of a certificate could relate to access control, but I'll lean towards \"Miscellaneous\" to keep it simple. I'll prepare a JSON object with that category."
