The options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. From the ticket details, it looks like \"po\" refers to purchase orders and approvals. This makes \"Purchase\" seem like the best fit. It's largely about procurement issues, waiting for approvals, and activation codes. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase\" and respond accordingly.**Responding with category format**\n\nI need to ensure the response is in the correct JSON format specified in the user\u2019s instructions. The final output should be exactly: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It seems there\u2019s no need for any extra commentary. The focus is solely on providing that category. The schema outlines that \"category\" must be a string with defined options, but based on prior tasks, I\u2019ll just stick with the basic requirement. So, I\u2019ll confirm the response as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
