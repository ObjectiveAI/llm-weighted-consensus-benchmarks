It sounds like an access management task. The \"Access\" category seems most appropriate here. \n\nI\u2019ll format the response as a single JSON-like object with the selected category field. So, the prompt would read, \"Categorize this IT Ticket:\" along with the defined options.**Formatting the IT ticket response**\n\nI'm figuring out the expected output format for this IT ticket, which should be a JSON object structured like: {\"category\": \"<Choice>\"}. The instruction mentions that bullet lists are okay, but the required format is specifically a category object. \n\nThe ticket covers several aspects, such as accounts and SIP extensions, but the main focus is on account provisioning and access control. So, I believe \"Access\" is the most fitting category. \n\nThus, I\u2019ll respond with the simple JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, ensuring no extra text is included."
