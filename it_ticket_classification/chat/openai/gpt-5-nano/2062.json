If I streamline the process, it might help with faster resolutions. I wonder if I should consider priority levels as well. Maybe I could divide tickets based on issues, such as hardware or software. I just want to ensure we\u2019re sorting them effectively so that everything gets addressed in the right order. Let's clarify the categories we should use!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user shared a text that asks me to categorize an IT ticket. It appears to contain a leaver form with multiple details about a person leaving, including dates, locations, contact information, and various requests. Now, I need to decide which category fits best for this ticket. The options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the content, it seems like \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" could be suitable categories.**Categorizing IT Access**\n\nThe content I\u2019m dealing with is a user leaver form, listing leave dates, locations, mailbox access, roaming profiles, and various approvals. It looks like it\u2019s focused on IT access related to an employee leaving, specifically about deprovisioning access. I think the best category is \"Access,\" since it clearly relates to access rights revocation. The JSON response format would be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. While \"Administrative rights\" might seem relevant too, \"Access\" feels most appropriate given the context.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
