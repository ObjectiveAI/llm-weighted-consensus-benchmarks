The term \"pipe mapping issue\" could refer to data mapping or something related to software processes. It doesn't easily fit into the main categories, so it seems likely to belong to either \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The phrase \"delete original message\" seems like a request to clear a ticket, leading me to lean toward \"Miscellaneous.\"**Deciding on categorization**\n\nThe text mentions \"delete original message,\" which could point to an admin task, but I can't be sure. There\u2019s also a chance it relates to \"Storage\" or \"Hardware,\" but not storage hardware. Perhaps \"Internal Project\" if there\u2019s a specific internal project named \"Pipe mapping.\" However, the context is too vague. So, I think categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" is the safest choice. I\u2019ll format that as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
