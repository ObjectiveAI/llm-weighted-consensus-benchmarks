The user mentioned a request for an external monitor, which likely fits under the \"Hardware\" category since it involves physical equipment for work. The instruction calls for a JSON-like object, so I\u2019ll need to format the response accordingly. It\u2019ll look something like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I want to ensure it follows the schema specified, and this makes the most sense given the context!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThis ticket is a hardware-related request, which leads me to lean towards categorizing it as \"Hardware.\" It\u2019s also possible to view it as a \"Purchase\" since they're requesting an external monitor, which could imply a need to acquire it. However, since the request doesn't explicitly mention buying, \"Hardware\" might fit better. I need to choose the most appropriate category between the two, and in this case, I'll go with \"Hardware\" for clarity.**Categorizing the ticket properly**\n\nI\u2019m thinking \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category here, while \"Purchase\" could indicate a request for buying something. The user didn't give specifics on budget or procurement, so I\u2019ll focus on the request for an external monitor, which clearly relates to hardware. Since the phrase \"request for external monitor\" directly connects to hardware needs, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" My output will be a simple JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, without additional explanations for clarity.**Preparing final JSON output**\n\nI realize that the output needs to be in a strict JSON format for proper parsing. This is crucial, as it needs to be exactly what\u2019s required by the receiving code. There\u2019s no room for error or extra text here! So, I\u2019m focused on providing just the necessary details, ensuring it's properly structured. I\u2019ll finalize the output to match the required format\u2014this will keep it clean and effective for any further processing!"
