Given that it\u2019s about changing a process, categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" seems best. However, there's a chance it might fit under \"Administrative rights\" if changes involve permissions. If it doesn't fit any specific category, \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback option. I think \"Internal Project\" is still the most suitable choice!**Finalizing JSON category output**\n\nFor the request to adjust an approval workflow, it makes sense to classify it as an \"Internal Project,\" since that fits within the IT project scope. I need to ensure the output is formatted correctly as a JSON object. The structure should be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, and I should avoid adding any extra text\u2014just the JSON object itself. Since the user wants a clear classification, I\u2019m sticking to the required format to deliver exactly what\u2019s needed!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
