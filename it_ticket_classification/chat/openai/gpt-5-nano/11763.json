However, it could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" if I emphasize those specific rights.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIn IT ticket systems, when someone is leaving, I disable their access, remove mailboxes, deactivate their AD, and more. This situation clearly pertains to access control, so I'll categorize the ticket as \"Access.\" It differentiates from \"Administrative rights,\" which are more about admin privileges. The ticket mentions \"AD rights,\" but I'm unsure if that relates to admin rights removal. Since the main focus is on offboarding and access removal, the safest choice is \"Access.\" I'll output it as {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Formatting JSON properly**\n\nI need to make sure the output follows the proper JSON structure. The instruction specifies that the final response should be a category object. Based on the schema given, it looks like this: \n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}\n\nSo I\u2019ll output the JSON object:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI\u2019ll keep it straightforward, without any unnecessary text or reasoning, just the JSON response."
