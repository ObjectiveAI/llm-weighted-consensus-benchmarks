The categories I have in mind are hardware, HR support, access, miscellaneous, storage, purchase, internal project, and administrative rights. It's essential to analyze the content of each ticket carefully to determine the appropriate category. I'll need to ensure that this process is clear and user-friendly, so let\u2019s focus on defining each category effectively!**Cleaning Up Ticket Text**\n\nI'm dealing with a messy ticket text regarding a laptop and keyboard issue. The main point seems to be that the left Ctrl button on the laptop keyboard isn't working. There are also a lot of unnecessary legal disclaimers and repeated statements, which make it hard to focus on the actual problem. I should extract the relevant details to clarify what's needed and ensure the ticket properly addresses the specific issue at hand.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve identified that there\u2019s a hardware issue with the laptop keyboard, so the appropriate category is \"Hardware.\" I briefly considered other categories, like \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but those don\u2019t fit. The output needs to be formatted as a JSON object featuring the category string. So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. It seems that a brief note isn't necessary for this instruction\u2014just the category will suffice!"
