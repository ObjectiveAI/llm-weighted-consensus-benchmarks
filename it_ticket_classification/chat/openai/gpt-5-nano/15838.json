The ticket content seems a bit chaotic, but I\u2019ll look for central themes. The user references issues with reports and potential bandwidth increases. Given the technical nature, I think \"Miscellaneous\" might fit best, but since it\u2019s about network monitoring, it may also touch on \"Internal Project\". I\u2019ll need to decide carefully!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants to categorize an IT ticket related to network monitoring, mentioning bandwidth, packet loss, and Cacti graphs. It sounds like they might be dealing with empty graphs or capacity reports. I\u2019m thinking it could fit under \"Internal Project,\" as it feels specific to an internal monitoring setup. However, \"Miscellaneous\" might be a broad catch-all for it. Since the focus is on configuration, I lean towards \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll finalize this JSON object with the chosen category!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
