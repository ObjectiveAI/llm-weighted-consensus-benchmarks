The user\u2019s message mentions \u201cforbidden software\u201d and \u201cinternal audit,\u201d which seems to align with policy compliance. I need to determine if this fits into categories like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it also mentions file sharing and restrictions, \"Access\" might be the best fit. It looks like I\u2019ll need to delve into the specific context to finalize the categorization.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing whether this IT ticket should be classified as \"Administrative rights\" since it mentions reminders about forbidden software. However, it doesn\u2019t really request any administrative action directly. It might fit into \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"HR Support\" too. Looking at the categories, \"Access\" seems pertinent since the message discusses monitoring forbidden software and potentially revoking access. It hints at auditing user rights, which aligns with the Access category quite well.**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI'm deciphering the user's request about forbidden software and whether it falls into specific categories. The phrase \"please remind ask these forbidden\" adds some ambiguity. \"Miscellaneous\" might be a catch-all for general IT tasks, while \"Storage\" relates to file storage issues mentioned in the text. However, given the focus on \"forbidden software\" during an audit, it could also connect to \"Access\" related to system privileges. With limited categories, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the safest option, but I could also ask for clarification.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket and likely prefers just one label. I\u2019m torn between \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" as the ticket mentions forbidden software and audits. The reference to \"games based file sharing\" and installed clients suggests an issue with what software is installed. It seems policy enforcement is a key theme, potentially making \"Internal Project\" relevant, particularly since it ties back to the internal audit. I might lean towards \"Administrative rights\" due to the implications about installation permissions, but there's no clear mention of that.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
