The user has specifically asked for categorization, and the content mentions an \"attached form\" and details needed to close. However, since it also relates to access removal, it could fit under \"Access.\" Given the context of removing accounts when interns finish their internships, \"Access\" seems like the most fitting choice, so I\u2019ll go with that category.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nLet's take a closer look at categorizing this ticket. The phrase \"leaver for interns\" likely refers to a \"leaver form,\" typically used when employees leave, and in IT, there's often an \"Access rights\" category for offboarding. I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" as the category since it aligns with the context. The expected response should be in JSON format, which should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll ensure that no extra text is included; just the JSON output.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
