The message indicates they\u2019ve attached a starter form and need help with its completion. Given the available categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Access,\" it seems most appropriate to categorize this under \"HR Support\" since it pertains to onboarding. While it doesn't directly mention \"Onboarding,\" \"HR Support\" fits the context best.**Clarifying the ticket category**\n\nThis request seems to be about filling out a starter form for a new employee, which I think fits into \"HR Support\" since it's related to onboarding. However, it could also relate to \"Access\" if it involves system access. The mention of \"starter form\" and \"help completion\" makes me lean toward \"HR Support.\" Yet, if the form pertains to granting administrative rights, \"Administrative rights\" could be appropriate. It's tricky to decide, but \"HR Support\" appears to fit best overall.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nLet's look at the message that mentions a new starter and a request for help completing an attached form. This indicates it's an HR onboarding form rather than something about granting admin rights. Therefore, \"HR Support\" is the best category. While \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant in another context, it doesn't fit here because the focus is on completing the form. So, I'll create a simple JSON object to categorize it as \"HR Support.\" Time to format that response!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
