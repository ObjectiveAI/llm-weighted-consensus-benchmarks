It seems to mention \"Windows upgrade\" and issues related to \"insufficient space on partition\" and \"disk cleanup.\" These details indicate that the core issue is about storage space concerning the Windows upgrade process. I should classify this ticket under the \"Storage\" category since it's primarily about managing space for the upgrade. I\u2019ll make sure to accurately capture these issues in the ticketing system!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the appropriate category for this IT ticket. The main issue is about insufficient space on a partition for a Windows upgrade, which clearly falls under \"Storage.\" While it also mentions upgrades and announcements, the core concern remains the lack of disk space. So, I'll categorize it as \"Storage\" and output the response in JSON format. It\u2019ll look like this: {\"category\": \"Storage\"}. Keeping it concise is key, no extra text needed!"
