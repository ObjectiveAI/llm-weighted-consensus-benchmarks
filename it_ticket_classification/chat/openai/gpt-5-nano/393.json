The categories include options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" etc. The ticket mentions sending reports, assigning, and sharing files, which makes me think it's related to accessing reports or shared folders. \n\nI'm considering categories like \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Storage.\" It seems like it could be an issue related to permissions for accessing shared folders or reports.**Evaluating ticket categories**\n\nI'm considering the category for this IT ticket. \"Access\" seems likely because it relates to permissions and folder access. \"Storage\" could fit if the issue is about the location of shared folders. \"Administrative rights\" might relate to assigning permissions to send reports. \n\nHowever, since the user mentions needing to \"assign\" and \"send a report,\" these lean more towards \u201cAccess.\u201d Yet, the reference to \"shared folders\" also hints at \"Storage.\" I need to choose one category, but it's tricky!**Deciding on category type**\n\nThe main issue in this ticket revolves around how to share or copy reports to another user. I think the \"Access\" category fits best as it covers permissions and access to shared folders. The user mentions not being able to find these folders, which relates to their storage location, but the focus seems to be on sharing and permissions. \n\nI need to make sure to output the chosen category as JSON, setting it to \"Access\" since it\u2019s the best fit for this situation.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
