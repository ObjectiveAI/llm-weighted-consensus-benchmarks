The user mentions struggling with the workflow where, despite trying to reassign a manager, they encounter a screen popup with only a close button and can't proceed. There\u2019s a focus on the approval process and the message persisting even after attempting to approve. This certainly requires some technical assistance. I\u2019ll make sure to redirect it accordingly!**Categorizing IT ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m looking to categorize this ticket based on the categories list: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The ticket focuses on changing the manager and the approval process, making \"Access\" a potential fit, since it\u2019s about role changes and approvals. \"Administrative Rights\" could also apply, given the possible permissions issue. The user mentions issues with the approval button only having a close option, which might indicate a bug in the workflow system. I\u2019ll assess this carefully!**Categorizing IT ticket issues**\n\nI\u2019m categorizing the ticket based on high-level IT categories for triage, focusing on either \"Administrative Rights\" or \"Access.\" The user faces problems like not being able to change or approve the manager, and messages appearing even after attempts to approve. This indicates potential issues with workflow approvals in an ERP system. \"Administrative Rights\" seems to handle user permissions, but the inability to change managers might suggest either a permissions issue or a bug. Triage would likely label it as \"Access\" if the actions are restricted by permissions.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the category for the ticket. \"Administrative Rights\" seems relevant since it\u2019s about user and manager assignments and the need for approvals. However, the issue appears to be more about functionality than just rights, as the user is unable to approve due to a UI issue. Alternatively, \"Internal Project\" could apply if it's a bug in a custom system. Given the user's concerns about processes related to ERP or SharePoint, I should go with \"Access\" for this ticket.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
