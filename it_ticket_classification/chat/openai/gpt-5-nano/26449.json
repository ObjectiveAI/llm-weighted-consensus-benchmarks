The phrase \"move users groups permissions\" might mean they want to update these permissions. I think the best category for this request would be \"Access\" since it deals with user permissions. There's also \"Administrative rights\" as a possible subcategory, but \"Access\" seems most fitting for this ticket.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket seems to involve changing user group permissions, which might mean updating access rights. I think \"Access\" is the best category since it directly relates to user permissions. Although \"Administrative rights\" is a possible subcategory, I want to keep it general. \n\nI'll need to respond with a JSON-like object based on the instruction format provided, so my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"} to align with the required schema.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
