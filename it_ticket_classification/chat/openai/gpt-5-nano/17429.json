I'll likely categorize it as \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\"**Categorizing as Purchase**\n\nI think the best fit for this ticket is \"Purchase\" since the user is requesting a backpack for equipment at a site. It could also be viewed as \"Hardware,\" but I need to choose one category. The message doesn\u2019t fit other categories like access or HR support. Since they mentioned needing the backpack tomorrow, it feels more like a procurement request. I'll categorize it as \"Purchase\" and respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
