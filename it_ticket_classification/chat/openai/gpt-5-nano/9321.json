The user is asking for more wire ports, suggesting their request is related to network hardware. It seems like it could go under \"Hardware\" due to the mention of ports on a switch. There's a slight chance it could fall under \"Purchase\" if they're requesting to buy more ports, but \"Hardware\" seems the most fitting. So, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Hardware.\"**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering whether to classify this IT ticket as \"Purchase\" for buying more wire ports. The phrase about \"getting more wire ports\" suggests they're looking for a hardware upgrade, possibly for a switch. In some systems, \"Storage\" would apply to storage devices and \"Access\" for user permissions. However, \"Hardware\" feels like the best fit since they want ports to support demos. While \"Purchase\" is a possibility, it seems they mainly need additional hardware. So, \"Hardware\" is the way to go!**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI need to determine the best category for the IT ticket the user asked me to categorize. Based on their request, \"Hardware\" seems like the most appropriate fit. Since the instruction suggests using a JSON-like format, it makes sense to respond with that structure. I will output the relevant category as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This should meet the user's needs without adding any extra text."
