The ticket is about a new project related to Oracle Fusion and mentions several keywords like attachments, date, language, and database platform. Given that it's about an IT project and refers to Oracle Fusion, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best category. It really focuses on specific project details and database-related information, which supports this choice.**Crafting category JSON**\n\nIt looks like the ticket is best categorized as \"Internal Project.\" I need to respond with a JSON object that specifies this category. Based on the instructions, the category should be formatted correctly. The ticket mentions project specifics like \"project code Oracle Fusion,\" \"database platform,\" and other relevant details that confirm it's not about hardware or access.\n\nI'll craft the final response as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This should meet the requirement for the output format, and I'm being mindful of the specified channels for response!"
