The categories I have to choose from are quite specific, like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Given that the ticket appears to relate to device alerts, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it under Hardware. Let me finalize that!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing the content, which revolves around device alerts related to printers and scanners, particularly mentioning duplex units and various covers. This all indicates that the ticket is about hardware. Since the details highlight hardware alert notifications, it makes sense to categorize it under Hardware. I should respond with a JSON object according to the provided schema, confirming the category as per the instructions. Let\u2019s format that correctly!**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI need to create a JSON object with the category field set to \"Hardware.\" It looks like this: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. I want to make sure the formatting is correct since it has to be a well-structured JSON object. While the instruction mainly requests the category itself, I\u2019m wondering if I should add a brief justification for clarity. However, it seems like just delivering the JSON is what\u2019s most important here. Let\u2019s go ahead and finalize that!"
