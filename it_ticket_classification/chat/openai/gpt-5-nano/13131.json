The provided categories allow for options like \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the content focuses on test management and backlog issues, it probably leans more towards \"Internal Project.\" However, there's no clear category directly related to their feature request for a new filter. It's a bit tricky, but I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit.**Classifying the feature request**\n\nThe ticket is a feature request for a filter in Zephyr, aimed at separating backlog tasks from test cases. I think the best category for this is \"Internal Project,\" since it's about an internal tool feature. While \"Miscellaneous\" is an option, it doesn't fit as well. The response needs to be in a specific JSON format: I\u2019ll output it as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} to comply with the required schema. That should effectively communicate the categorization!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
