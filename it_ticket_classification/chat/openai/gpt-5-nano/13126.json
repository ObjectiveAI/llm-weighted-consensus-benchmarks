The \"Miscellaneous\" category could work too, but it seems more specific to access issues.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out how to categorize this IT ticket. It's likely not about hardware or storage, but possibly relates to \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it mentions removing a user from what might be a mailing list. The user says they keep receiving irrelevant emails, hinting at wanting to unsubscribe. \n\n\"Administrative rights\" seems fitting, but \"Access\" also fits if it\u2019s about permissions. I\u2019ll probably go with \"Access\" for the category, as that seems the most appropriate. Now I just need to format that in a JSON object!{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
