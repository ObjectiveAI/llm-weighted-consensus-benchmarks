I'll have to analyze the content closely to choose the best fitting category. After that, I will output a JSON object that includes the selected category as a string value from the allowed enum.**Categorizing IT Ticket Content**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a messy ticket text that includes phrases like \"update com,\" \"two addresses same person,\" and mentions about recreating and creating user accounts.
