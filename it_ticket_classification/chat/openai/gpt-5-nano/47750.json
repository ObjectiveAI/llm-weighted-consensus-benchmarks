It's definitely not about hardware, storage, or purchases. It might fall under \"HR Support\" since it concerns payroll systems. \"Internal Project\" could work too, but \"Administrative rights\" might fit if it relates to permissions. Let's evaluate options carefully!**Identifying Ticket Issues**\n\nThe user is facing a \u201cblank window\u201d when trying to approve something, which could indicate a UI issue. It might require access or permission, leaning toward \"Administrative rights.\" The categories I've got include \"Access,\" which addresses login or access rights, and \"Administrative rights,\" specific for permission issues. The mention of \"design lead\" doesn\u2019t directly clarify their role. Given the context of the Oracle Fusion timecard approval and the UI bug, \"Access\" seems like the best category to choose!**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nThere's no specific \"Software\" category, but \"HR Support\" fits well since Oracle Fusion deals with HR and payroll for timecard approval. The options include \"Internal Project\" and \"Administrative rights,\" though. The user said, \u201cplease help... window blank,\u201d which might suggest they lack the necessary permissions to approve. Given the context, \"HR Support\" seems like the best classification for this case. I'll prepare a response in the required JSON format, categorizing it as \"HR Support.\"{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
