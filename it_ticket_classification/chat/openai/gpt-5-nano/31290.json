The categories available include \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights\". I\u2019ll interpret the ticket's content carefully to determine the best fit. Since it mentions expense approvals and changes in responsibility, it might relate to \"HR Support\" or \"Miscellaneous\". Finally, I\u2019ll output the corresponding JSON object with the selected category.**Interpreting IT ticket content**\n\nThe message is somewhat unclear but mentions \"oracle expenses approval\" along with changes to the expense stage and reassignment. It sounds like there's an issue with the Oracle expenses approval process. Given that it deals with expense approval, it seems likely to relate to the \"Purchase\" category since this involves procurement and expenses. I\u2019ll also consider \"Administrative rights\" but it doesn't seem to fit as well. I need to confirm the best category based on this information.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
