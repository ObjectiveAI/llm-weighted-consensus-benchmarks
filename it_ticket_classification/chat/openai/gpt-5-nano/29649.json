It seems pretty clear that the best fit is \"Purchase,\" as it's primarily about ordering an item. While \"Administrative rights\" and \"Miscellaneous\" could be contenders, \"Purchase\" is the most relevant. I'll format the answer in JSON as requested: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}.**Classifying IT Category**\n\nI see that the system message outlines a category schema, which includes options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. Based on the details provided, I'll conclude that the most appropriate category is \"Purchase.\" Since the user is asking to categorize the IT ticket, I'll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. There's no need for extra notes since the instructions clearly request just the category in JSON format. Let's keep it simple and direct!"
