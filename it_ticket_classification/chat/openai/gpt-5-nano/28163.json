I\u2019ll format my response in the required JSON schema: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Creating JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nThe system specifies a category for the IT ticket that needs to be categorized. The required format is a JSON object with the \"category\" field. Based on the list of allowed categories, I'll select \"Access\" for this ticket. Although the user didn't explicitly ask for justification, I could provide a brief note about deprovisioning ServiceNow accounts for leavers. Nevertheless, the primary response will just be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Finalizing JSON Response**\n\nI\u2019m ready to finalize the response as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Even though \"Administrative rights\" could seem relevant, this case is about disabling accounts rather than granting access. So, \"Access\" clearly fits better. While I could add a note about the reason, the user primarily asked for just the category. To be on the safe side, I\u2019ll stick to the main requirement and respond solely with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
