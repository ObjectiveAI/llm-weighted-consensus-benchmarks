This ticket mentions mailbox size increase and storage-related issues, which means it clearly falls under the Storage category. Technically, it could be classified as Access if they requested permission, but since it focuses on storage, I\u2019ll categorize it as Storage. My final response will be a JSON object with category: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Finalizing the JSON output**\n\nI need to ensure the category value is \"Storage,\" which is valid. Since the user only asked for categorization, I should stick to providing just that single field, so I\u2019ll respond solely with the category. I\u2019ll produce the JSON as follows: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. It\u2019s important to avoid any extra text or whitespace, adhering precisely to the expected output of just the JSON object. Delivering it clearly is key!"
