The user's message is quite jumbled, but it refers to \"add column,\" \"reports,\" and \"storage report order.\" They also mention \"administrative rights,\" which is one of the categories. Since the ticket focuses on storage and reports, I think \"Storage\" is the most appropriate category here.**Choosing a category**\n\nThe user mentioned \"Administrative rights\" as a category but didn\u2019t use it as a tag. I need to pick the most fitting category. The message hints at creating or updating reports and possibly discussing access rights or assigning reports. It\u2019s quite challenging to interpret, but it looks like the focus is on adding columns and managing storage reports. Given the context, \"Storage\" might be the best choice, though \"Administrative rights\" could also work due to the mention of assignments.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nThe phrase \"storage report order\" aligns perfectly with the Storage category, so I\u2019ll categorize it as such. The instructions specify responding in a JSON format, so I\u2019ll present it as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I need to make sure there\u2019s no extra commentary or text, just the JSON object itself. Let\u2019s keep it clean and simple for a straightforward delivery!"
