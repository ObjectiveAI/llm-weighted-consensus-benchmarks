It could indicate a high-priority issue related to document migration, which might fit into \"Storage,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" However, it's not clear if access rights are explicitly required here.**Categorizing document management ticket**\n\nThe ticket requests to categorize a task involving the removal of a document, which likely needs permissions. It's not actually about resolving the request but finding the right category based on document management, removal, migration, and priority. \n\n\"Internal Project\" fits if it\u2019s related to project management; \"Storage\" applies if the document removal is about space; \"Administrative rights\" could be considered if permissions are needed. Given the mention of \"document migrated,\" I lean towards \"Storage\" or \"Internal Project,\" but it might also fall under \"Administrative rights\" for authorization reasons.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m tasked with categorizing this IT ticket, and I need to choose the best category from the allowed options. The request mentions a \"document,\" \"migrated,\" and \"remove,\" indicating it relates to document management. \n\n\"Storage\" could work for document removal or storage cleanup, while \"Internal Project\" seems fitting if it\u2019s project-specific. Given \"December PM document\" likely refers to project management, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best choice to route it to the correct team. It seems simplest and most relevant!**Outputting IT ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s request is about removing a document from the December PM document and indicates high importance. Since they mentioned \"leader\" at the end, it seems like a form of address. Based on this context, I'm deciding on the category. \n\nI'll create a JSON-like object to respond: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. Since the instructions emphasize delivering just the category, I'll keep the response concise, without any extra text. I\u2019ll go ahead and provide that output now!"
