I need to be clear that the \"category\" format is defined as a JSON-like schema. The prompt gives a detailed structure, specifying that the output should be a JSON object representing the selected category. In this case, since the ticket is about a broken keyboard, it definitely falls under \"Hardware.\" So, my final response will be straightforward: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} with no extra text needed!**Producing in the category channel**\n\nI need to make sure that I\u2019m producing the response in the correct \"category\" channel, as that's what\u2019s specified for this task. Following the guidelines, I\u2019ll ensure my output aligns with that requirement. It\u2019s essential to keep everything organized and formatted correctly, so let\u2019s move forward with that and make sure to respond appropriately. I\u2019ll get this done!"
