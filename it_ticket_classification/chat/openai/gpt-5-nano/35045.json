They're having trouble submitting an Oracle time card, which relates to the HR/time tracking system. The best category for this issue seems to be \"HR Support.\" While \"Miscellaneous\" could be considered, it's more appropriate to label it as \"HR Support\" since it's directly related to submitting a time card. I'll provide a brief justification and suggest next steps for them to resolve the issue.**Formatting IT ticket category**\n\nThe user wants to know the category for their IT ticket, so I need to respond with a JSON-like format. The schema suggests I should reflect the category as an object. Given it's an HR-related issue with the Oracle time card, the correct category is \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with that category, ensuring no extra text or heavy formatting. So, I\u2019ll provide: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
