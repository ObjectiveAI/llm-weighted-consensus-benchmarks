The ticket mentions an access request looking for the same rights as a senior engineer. From the schema, I'll structure the response as a JSON object. The appropriate categories are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" as both relate to privileges. Since it's specifically asking for \"same rights,\" I believe \"Administrative rights\" fits best. I'll finalize this in the required JSON format.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI think the ticket should be categorized as \"Administrative rights\" because it specifically mentions requesting the same rights as a senior engineer. The phrase \"please require same rights\" strongly indicates that it's about admin privileges rather than just basic access. So, I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object to ensure it meets the system's requirements. I\u2019ll keep it neat: {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}. This is exactly what I need to provide."
