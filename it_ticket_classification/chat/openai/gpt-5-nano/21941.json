It seems like they\u2019re requesting to order a static IP address, which leads me to consider categorizing it under \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI see they mention \"technical consultant,\" which implies the ticket might be from them. It seems related to purchasing or provisioning a static IP address that\u2019s currently leased via DHCP. Given the categories available\u2014like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others\u2014ordering a static IP likely falls under \"Purchase,\" as it\u2019s more about procurement. While \"Access\" could fit if it\u2019s about access rights, \"order static\" leans me towards \"Purchase.\" So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
