The available categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since this is an HR-related issue, \"HR Support\" seems most fitting. However, it could also involve \"Access\" or possibly \"Administrative rights.\" I'll pick \"HR Support\" as the best option for this request.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI believe \"HR Support\" is the right choice for this IT ticket since it's related to leave requests, which are HR processes. However, there's a possibility it could also fall under \"Administrative rights\" if it's concerning permissions for submitting forms. The user mentions nothing happens when they try to submit, which could indicate a bug. Still, given it's about the annual leave form, I'll finalize my categorization as \"HR Support\" and format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
