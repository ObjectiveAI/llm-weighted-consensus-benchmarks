The provided text is very messy but seems to focus on access and rights, especially phrases like \"please give rights.\" It appears that the best fit for this ticket would be \"Administrative rights.\" I want to make sure I'm classifying it accurately given the context!**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket text includes phrases about \"classified confidential proprietary information\" and \"preserving confidentiality.\" It frequently mentions \"rights,\" which leads me to think it fits the \"Access\" category. It mentions \"rights table\" and \"administrative rights,\" so I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Administrative rights.\" Since the request seems to be primarily about granting rights, I\u2019ll conclude that \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d is the best match. I just want to ensure this classification is accurate!**Delivering category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that the best categorization for this IT ticket is \"Administrative rights,\" since it's more precise than just \"Access.\" The user's request is clear: \"Categorize this IT Ticket.\" So, I should respond with a JSON-like object showing the category. Based on the system requirements, I\u2019ll output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nGot it! This delivers the necessary information without any extra commentary."
