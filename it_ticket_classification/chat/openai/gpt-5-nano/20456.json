The user seems to be asking for a folder to be copied, which points towards the \"Storage\" category. There\u2019s also a mention of \"Administrative rights,\" suggesting it might require permissions. However, it's not entirely clear if that\u2019s necessary. Overall, I'll lean towards categorizing this ticket as \"Storage.\"**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nIt looks like the request is about performing a file upload to storage. Based on the information, \"Storage\" seems like the most suitable category, especially since it's asking to copy a folder. \"Access\" could also be applicable if user permissions are needed, but since that's not mentioned, I'll stick with \"Storage.\" \n\nI'll format my response as a JSON object, specifically as {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. The guidelines indicate that I should just provide this without additional explanations unless requested, so I won't add any justifications."
