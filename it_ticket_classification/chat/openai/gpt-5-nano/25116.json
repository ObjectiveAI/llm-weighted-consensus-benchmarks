My initial thought is that it fits best in the \"Hardware\" category, since it involves a monitor. It could also be \"Purchase\" if they are requesting one, but it doesn't seem to fit any of the other categories.**Generating JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that categorizes the IT ticket. The requested format specifies that it should include a \"category\" field. Based on what I've gathered, I believe the category should be \"Hardware.\" It seems they are looking for a straightforward response, so I\u2019ll keep it simple and ensure it adheres to the schema provided. My final output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, without any extra text, just as instructed."
