Reading through the ticket, it looks like it's about missing time reports and attendance issues related to maternity leave. This is leaning toward an HR-related issue, so \"HR Support\" seems most appropriate. I don't think \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project\" fit. So, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with \"category\": \"HR Support.\"**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to classify the IT ticket and respond with a JSON object. The category here is \"HR Support,\" but I have to ensure it aligns with the specified schema. They want something in the form of an object with fields like \"type\" and \"properties,\" but I think the simplest response should just have the category value. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. If they need the full schema, they can let me know!**Deciding category for IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering whether \"Administrative rights\" could fit under \"HR Support.\" After thinking it through, I feel confident that \"HR Support\" is the right choice for this ticket. I should keep my response concise, so I'll go ahead and provide it as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That seems clear and straightforward!"
