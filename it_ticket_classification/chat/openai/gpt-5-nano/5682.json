The provided categories include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the user is specifically asking for editing rights, it seems to fit as an access permissions request. However, since \"Administrative rights\" might also apply, I should weigh these options carefully. It looks like \"Access\" is the most appropriate category for this request.**Categorizing event rights**\n\nFor the specific \"events calendar,\" it seems \"editing rights\" would fall under \"Access\" rather than \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019m realizing there\u2019s a difference between granting general access to data and providing admin privileges. Editing rights for a calendar likely qualify as role-based access instead of admin rights. Therefore, I should categorize this IT ticket as \"Access.\" Now, I need to make sure to output this as a JSON object with the required structure: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Outputting JSON format**\n\nI need to provide only the JSON object for the IT ticket. The instructions clearly indicate to output a JSON object with the category. So, I\u2019ll make it look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll ensure that there\u2019s no extra commentary or whitespace in the response since the platform might require valid JSON. This means sticking strictly to the format with only the \"category\" property and nothing else. Alright, I\u2019ll go ahead with that!"
