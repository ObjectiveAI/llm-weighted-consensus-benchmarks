It mentions \"access to confluence,\" which points to an access issue, and \"choose workstation required hardware section,\" indicating hardware. There's also a mention of an annual survey feedback that seems like HR, but not really IT. Given the overall focus on access, I'll categorize it under \"Access\" since that's the primary concern, even though there's some hardware mention.**Formatting ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket based on the user's request. It looks like I should respond with \"Access\" as the main category. The system requires a proper JSON-like output format, so it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nI want to ensure that I follow the formatting instructions exactly since the platform is expecting a specific JSON object structure. So, I\u2019ll confirm that my response includes just that category value in the required format.**Delivering JSON category**\n\nI need to format my response as a JSON object. The schema shows that there should be a \"category\" property with a string type. The actual data I need to provide is just {\"category\":\"Access\"} based on the ticket\u2019s classification. It\u2019s not the full schema definition; it\u2019s the expected output for this task. So, I\u2019ll make sure to present it clearly as that JSON object. Keeping it concise is key!"
