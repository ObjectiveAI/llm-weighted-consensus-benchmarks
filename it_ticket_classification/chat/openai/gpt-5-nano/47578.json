It seems the client is having trouble opening files; they download instead of opening. This might indicate a document access issue. They also mention needing to view weekly status reports while working abroad. So, it appears that this could fall under an \"Access\" issue. Overall, access concerns seem to be the crux of the problem here.**Defining access categories**\n\nI'm analyzing category definitions like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. The issue seems to revolve around accessing files, specifically trying to open them instead of downloading. This suggests it might be an access or permissions issue, possibly under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since the user needs to view weekly status reports, \"Access\" feels like the most fitting category. The urgency implied indicates they might require remote access while working abroad. Overall, \"Access\" should be the right choice here.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI believe the category should be \"Access,\" as the user is having trouble opening files, which relates to permissions. They want a response formatted as a JSON object with the category value, following the provided schema. This is simple: something like {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nI do need to consider other nuances, like urgency and the fact they want to view weekly status reports while working abroad. However, the main issue is clearly access, so \"Access\" is still the best fit here!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
