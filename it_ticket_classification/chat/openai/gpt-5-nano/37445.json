The ticket is about approving project time entries and mentions getting notifications. It seems to involve a change in the approval process, possibly related to access rights. If the user is struggling with approvals, it might fit under \"Administrative rights,\" especially if they're facing issues with the approval flow.**Categorizing Process Change for Approvals**\n\nThis ticket is more about a process change and how to respond to approvals. It might fit under \"Internal Project\" since it's about project time entries. However, it also discusses timecards and approval flows, leading me to think it could be \"Miscellaneous\" or \"HR Support,\" given the HR/payroll aspect. If the user lacks the ability to approve, it might be \"Administrative rights.\" But they mention being able to approve, so I'll need to choose one category.**Categorizing Access Issues**\n\nThe issue at hand seems to be related to access or permissions, specifically regarding who can approve. Since the user mentioned that approval is required and they used to be able to review timecards and press the approve button, it seems like an access issue. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" \n\nI'll respond with the category formatted as JSON, so it'll look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I consider providing a brief note, but the user just needs the category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
