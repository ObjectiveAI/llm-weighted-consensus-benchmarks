The details are a bit garbled, but it appears to be related to an issue with the employee search tool. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Internal Project\" if it involves a tool, or maybe \"Miscellaneous.\" It might fit under \"Access,\" but that's tricky since there's no mention of access denial. Could it be \"Administrative rights\" if special permissions are needed for the search? I\u2019ll decide soon!**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nI see there's no mention of rights, but the issue relates to the \"employee tool\" returning a message. Based on internal classification policies, it might best fit as \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" Given that internal tool issues usually go under \"Internal Project,\" I think this is the right category. So, I\u2019ll categorize this IT ticket as \"Internal Project\" and provide a brief justification. I'll respond with a JSON object as specified in the format!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
