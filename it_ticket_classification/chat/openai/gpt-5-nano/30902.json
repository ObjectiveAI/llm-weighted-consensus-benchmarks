The ticket mentions a \"new starter access card enabling,\" which seems to relate to access provisioning. That points me toward the categories \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The reference to \"Belgrade\" could indicate location or a project name, and \"friday pm\" sets the timing. Given the focus on enabling access for a new starter, I think \"Access\" could be the best fit for this ticket.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think \"Administrative rights\" usually refers to admin privileges, but this ticket looks more like it\u2019s about granting access for a new starter, which aligns with access provisioning. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access,\" which is listed as a category. Given the user\u2019s request to categorize the IT ticket, I should output a JSON object specifically showing the category. I\u2019ll format it simply as {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text to keep it neat and clear.**Finalizing category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that \"Access\" is indeed the appropriate category for this ticket. It aligns well with the context of granting access for a new starter. Now, I'll present the final output neatly. Making sure I keep it straightforward will help avoid any confusion. Let\u2019s go ahead and confirm that I\u2019ll respond with the defined category clearly labeled as \"Access.\" It\u2019s nice to wrap this up succinctly!"
