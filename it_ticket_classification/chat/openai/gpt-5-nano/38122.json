The user mentions \"constantly blocking,\" pointing to possible network problems. Given the options we have\u2014like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and Miscellaneous\u2014I think I might lean towards \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Hardware.\" But if this is about blocking access, \"Access\" could make sense too. I need to find the best fit based on the clues provided.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket. Since options like \"Performance\" or \"Network\" aren\u2019t available, I might lean toward \"Miscellaneous\" for performance issues. The user's description of \u201cnot working\u201d and \u201cvery slow\u201d aligns with that. Still, the possibility of \"Internal Project\" could apply if there\u2019s a project aspect mentioned. The key here is to stick with \"Miscellaneous\" since it's a catch-all for issues that don\u2019t fit elsewhere. I\u2019ll format the answer as a JSON object with the category specified.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
