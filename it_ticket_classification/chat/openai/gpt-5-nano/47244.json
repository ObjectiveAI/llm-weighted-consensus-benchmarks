It seems this aligns more with \"Administrative rights\" since they'd need admin privileges to edit forecasts. While I see it as an \"Access\" issue too, I'll lean toward categorizing it under \"Administrative rights\" because it implies a need for higher privileges to modify the data.**Determining category for access request**\n\nI'm reviewing a ticket where the user requests access to adjust forecasts, hinting at needing \"Administrative rights.\" The user mentions being \"unable to update forecasts,\" so this seems more about permissions than hardware issues. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Administrative rights\" since they want the ability to modify data, which goes beyond just viewing it. I need to format my response as a JSON object with the appropriate category.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
