The user needs help categorizing it based on a schema with options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and so on. The ticket mentions problems with a keyboard, supplier delays, loaning a laptop, and installing it temporarily. It\u2019s clear this is primarily a hardware issue with the keyboard malfunctioning. While it might also touch on \"Purchase\" for a replacement, the main category is likely \"Hardware.\"**Formatting Category Response**\n\nThe user needs a response in a specific format for categorizing an IT ticket. I should create a JSON-like object. Based on the situation outlined, I\u2019m going to respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This aligns with the instructions indicating they want only the category without extra text. It\u2019s important to stick to the required format and make sure it\u2019s clear that it relates to keyboard hardware repairs. So, the final response will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
