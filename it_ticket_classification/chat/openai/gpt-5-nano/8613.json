The allowed categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket seems tied to data management and cleaning up classifications. I\u2019m thinking \u201cInternal Project\u201d might be the best fit, but \"Administrative rights,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Access\" could also apply since it mentions updates to attributes and databases. Let\u2019s choose carefully!**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing this ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it involves data clean-up and updating classifications. While \"Administrative rights\" could be a possibility due to the mention of permissions, it seems more about database maintenance. So, it feels right to go with \"Internal Project.\" I need to respond using the specified JSON format and just provide the category without extra explanations. \n\nHere\u2019s the output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
