The user mentions it was sent Thursday and indicates that the brightness remains low even when charging or when trying different things. Since this clearly points to a hardware issue, I\u2019ll categorize it as Hardware. While Miscellaneous might seem possible, it's definitely more about hardware.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON-like category object format for the IT ticket. The instruction is clear: it should be in the form of a JSON object. The category I've determined is \"Hardware\" based on the ticket content. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll make sure the output exactly follows the required format: it should be just this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I want to ensure it's valid JSON without any extra text, so let's go with that!"
