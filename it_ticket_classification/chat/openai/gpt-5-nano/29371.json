If I had to categorize, I'd lean towards \"Access\" since it's more general. However, if it's specifically about user permissions for administrative rights, then \"Administrative rights\" could be more fitting. The ticket seems to involve clarifying permissions, and overall, \"Access\" seems like the best choice here."
