The available categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since this request involves purchasing hardware accessories, like ergonomic stands for laptops, I think the most suitable category is \"Purchase.\" I'll present that in the required JSON format as a category object.**Finalizing the category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to go with \"Purchase\" for the category. Since they specifically asked for this categorization, I want to ensure I respond correctly with the required format. The schema needs a category object, so I'll make sure my JSON is valid. It\u2019s important to present it as: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. I think that covers everything needed! Now I'll produce the final output in the correct format."
