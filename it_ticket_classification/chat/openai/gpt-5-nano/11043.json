This suggests it might be an internal project change. It could also relate to \"HR Support,\" since a PM change involves personnel. It's less likely to be about \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nI realize \"Administrative rights\" probably isn\u2019t applicable here since we're looking for the best category. It seems that \"Internal Project\" fits best because the ticket involves a change of project manager. The mention of \"Oracle July\" suggests it's related to a project management module, which reinforces that it's an internal matter. \n\nThe format must be correct, so I'll use this structure for the output: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"],\"value\":\"Internal Project\"}}}. Let\u2019s provide that exact JSON.**Responding with JSON**\n\nIt looks like I need to give a response that fits the provided JSON schema for category classification. The schema indicates I should respond with a JSON object that includes the \"category\" property. While the typical response is just the category name, I need to strictly follow the format here. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON exactly as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. No extra text, just that simple output!"
