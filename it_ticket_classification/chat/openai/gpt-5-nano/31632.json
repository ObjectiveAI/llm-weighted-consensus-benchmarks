It mentions that the change was approved on Friday, and there's a request for permissions to remain intact until the process completes. \n\nThis seems to fall into categories related to access, administrative rights, or possibly HR support. I need to decide on the most fitting category for processing this ticket.**Mapping IT ticket categories**\n\nThe ticket categorizes as IT-related, dealing with changing a project manager and maintaining permissions until the process concludes. \n\nThis closely relates to \u201cAccess\u201d and \u201cAdministrative Rights,\u201d since there\u2019s a focus on keeping permissions active. The user mentions wanting to change themselves, which adds some confusion due to unclear language. However, overall, it definitely concerns access control and managing permissions, so labeling it under \u201cAdministrative Rights\u201d makes the most sense in this case. It's important to ensure clarity!**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI see that the ticket could fit into \u201cInternal Project,\u201d but it's more focused on changing the project manager and maintaining permissions. This isn't about reporting a bug, so that helps clarify things.\n\nI could categorize it as \u201cAccess,\u201d which is the primary focus, and potentially \u201cAdministrative Rights\u201d as a subcategory. However, since it fits primarily under access management, I\u2019ll choose \u201cAccess\u201d for the main category. \n\nMy final output will be in JSON format as required: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This seems most appropriate!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
