I have categories like Hardware, HR Support, and Miscellaneous to choose from. The focus seems to be on hardware upgrades, like the wireless devices, but software upgrades are also highlighted. So it could fit under Internal Project or Miscellaneous, but I think Hardware makes the most sense for the wireless devices.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe categories don\u2019t have \"Software,\" but I need to fit this ticket into one that works. The user mentions a \"notification\" about a wireless upgrade and communicating with users, which points me toward \"Internal Project\" since it involves upgrading devices. \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" and \"Purchase\" don\u2019t apply, and while \"Hardware\" could fit due to the wireless devices, the software aspect leans me toward \"Internal Project\" for its communication focus. \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback, but I\u2019m leaning toward Internal Project as the best choice.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket seems to summarize a software upgrade that's been approved, with a note about notifying users. The information is a bit scattered, but I think it fits best under \"Internal Project\" since it relates to both the upgrade process and communication. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object that captures this category accurately as instructed. The prompt indicates that we shouldn\u2019t provide too much extra information, so I\u2019ll just include the category and avoid any fluff. Here\u2019s my response:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
