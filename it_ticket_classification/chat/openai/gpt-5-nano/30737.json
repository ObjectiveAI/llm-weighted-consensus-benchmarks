The categories I\u2019ll consider are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, and Administrative rights. The mention of \"new starter access card\" strongly suggests it falls under \"Access.\" The card is related to enabling access control, which makes sense. While it could also be classified as \"Administrative rights,\" I'm leaning toward \"Access\" being the best fit for this situation.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing the ticket as \"Access\" because it focuses on permissions and account management for a new starter\u2019s access card. Sure, the access card is a physical piece of hardware, but we have separate categories for that. The ticket's emphasis on enabling access suggests it's about granting permissions rather than just dealing with the physical card. So, I'll stick with \"Access\" as the best fit for this situation, aligning with the user\u2019s request.**Delivering category output**\n\nThe user mentioned \"new starter access card,\" which makes it clear this ticket should be categorized as \"Access.\" So, I\u2019ll prepare the output in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Since the instruction is to categorize the IT ticket, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and deliver this response without any extra explanations unless asked. Just the JSON format is what I\u2019ll present! Let\u2019s deliver this cleanly."
