I\u2019m considering categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but it could be \"Access,\" depending on whether they need permission. Since it relates to an IT project, \"Internal Project\" seems the best fit, but \"Miscellaneous\" could work as well.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like deleting code relates to an \"Internal Project,\" which seems like the best category due to its specific nature. However, there are no mentions of hardware or storage issues. Since it sounds like a scheduled deletion on Thursday rather than a permissions request, \"Internal Project\" feels right. The format I need to use is a JSON object. So, I'll keep it straightforward and output just: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This keeps it clean without extra text."
