The user mentions wanting to access the \"employee referral policy\" and \"accept decline requests,\" which suggests it's about permissions. I see two possible categories: \"Access,\" for permissions to view the document, and \"HR Support,\" since it relates to HR policies. However, since this is specifically about accessing a policy document, I'll classify it as an \"Access\" request related to HR.**Classifying access request**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to classify the IT ticket. It could fall under \"Access\" since it\u2019s about access rights to a policy, or maybe \"Administrative Rights,\" assuming they want to manage referrals. The user is requesting access to the employee referral policy and seems to want to accept or decline requests related to it.\n\nWhile \"Administrative Rights\" could fit, it seems more likely that this is an \"HR Support\" request since it pertains to HR policy. I need to choose one category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe instructions ask me to categorize this IT ticket. I think \"Access\" is the best choice since the user is requesting access to the employee referral policy. Their mention of accepting and declining requests suggests it's about access control for referrals. \n\nSo, I'll output a JSON-like object with the necessary format, which needs to include the \"category\" property. I'll deliver it as {\"category\":\"Access\"} and keep it concise, with no extra text."
