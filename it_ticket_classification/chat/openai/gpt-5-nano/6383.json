Given the context, the category \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" seems fitting. Since it relates to access control and privileges, I'll decide between those two categories to finalize the ticket classification.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019ve got a list of categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The ticket mentions \"remove approval rights,\" which points to \"Administrative Rights\" because it's about admin privileges. While \"Access\" could cover general changes, \"Administrative Rights\" feels more specific. The user's message is a bit confusing, but it seems like the Accounts Receivable Lead wants to revoke approval rights for someone. Given everything, I'll choose \"Administrative Rights\" as the best fit.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
