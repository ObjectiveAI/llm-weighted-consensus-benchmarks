The ticket text mentions a new migration site location and seems to ask for help with that. It could fit under \"Internal Project\" if it's project-related, but there are other possibilities like \"Storage,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it discusses tasks pertaining to a migration project, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best fit here.**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt seems the categories are important for routing the IT ticket. The text references \"location\" and \"upload files location,\" which suggests the user might be asking about where to find the migration site for uploads. While it could relate to \"Access\" due to permissions needs, they didn't explicitly ask for access. Given that it's more about the migration site, I think \"Internal Project\" fits best. So, I\u2019ll respond with the proper JSON format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
