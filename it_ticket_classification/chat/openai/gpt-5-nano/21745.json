The text is a bit garbled, but it likely involves topics like \"Maintenance windows Wednesday PM,\" an implementation request, \"color coding,\" and \"client allowed change windows.\" It seems they want to address warning messages and track changes related to a specific change request (CR) and planned dates. I\u2019ll take all these elements into account to properly categorize the ticket.**Choosing appropriate category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories provided in the system: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It seems the ticket relates to maintenance windows, change management, and change requests (CRs), leading me to think it might fit \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project.\" The terms \"change window,\" \"tracking changes,\" and \"planned date\" suggest it's about internal IT change management. Since it's specifically about maintenance and implementations, I should categorize it under \"Internal Project.\"**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI think I can categorize this ticket under \"Internal Project,\" since it involves change management features, which fits nicely with its content about implementing change windows and color coding. While \"Administrative rights\" could also be a contender due to terms like \"client allowed change window,\" it seems less fitting since that's not about permissions. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project.\" \n\nI\u2019ll prepare a JSON-like object containing this category, and I might add a brief note for clarification. It would look something like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
