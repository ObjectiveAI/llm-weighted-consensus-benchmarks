This specific ticket deals with external user access issues, particularly regarding Active Directory, credentials, and permissions. Since it revolves around granting access, it seems to fit best under \"Access.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could apply due to permission management, the main focus is on external users accessing resources. Overall, classifying it as \"Access\" seems most appropriate.**Finalizing JSON Response**\n\nI'm going to categorize the ticket as \"Access.\" The format requires a JSON-like object with a \"category\" key, meaning the response should simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nI\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra commentary or information, just the required output. Following the instructions closely, I\u2019ll deliver that JSON object as specified. This keeps everything neat and straightforward!"
