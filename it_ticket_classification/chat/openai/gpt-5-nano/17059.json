The message is pretty jumbled, but it mentions \"access to Oracle report,\" which seems urgent, and references a meeting today and a planning officer for an upcoming holiday. Given this context, it looks like the user is requesting access to an Oracle report. I think the appropriate category would be either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" primarily leaning toward \"Access.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing a message that emphasizes a \"leader wants report displays grades.\" The user asked me to categorize this IT ticket. It looks like I need to respond with a JSON-like object for the category, which should include a field labeled \"category.\" Given that the content refers to \"access to Oracle reports,\" I believe the appropriate category is \"Access.\" Although I considered \"Administrative rights,\" it seems more about gaining access rather than needing elevated rights. So, I'm confident \"Access\" is the right choice.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
