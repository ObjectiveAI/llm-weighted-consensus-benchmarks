The ticket contains phrases like \"resolved tasks visible backlog\" and mentions issues that remain visible even when marked done. This suggests it relates to software bug visibility issues. I'm thinking the best fit for this ticket would be \"Miscellaneous,\" since it's not clearly hardware, HR support, access, or any of the other specific categories listed.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm weighing the categories for the IT ticket, considering options like \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it's not about hardware, HR, or storage, I think it leans towards project management since it discusses backlog visibility issues. Given that \u201cInternal Project\u201d is more specific and aligns with the content, I should categorize it as such. The output should be in the expected JSON format as {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}.**Formatting IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nThe system specifies that I need to format the output as a JSON object containing a category string. I need to be clear and concise, so I'll follow that format exactly. The categories provided include options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others, but since I decided on \"Internal Project,\" my final output will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI won't add any extra text\u2014just this JSON format."
