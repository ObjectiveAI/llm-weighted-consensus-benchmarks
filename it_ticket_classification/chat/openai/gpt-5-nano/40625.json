The user seems to be reporting an issue where a recent change has made their approvals less visible. It sounds like they updated their line manager to someone in Bogota, but now they're still receiving approval requests for that person, which shouldn't be happening. They\u2019re asking for help in fixing this problem. I want to make sure I capture all these details properly!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to assign the IT ticket to the right category. The options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and a few others. This issue seems related to HR or Access since it involves timecard approval notifications and a change in line manager to Bogota. It could fit under \"Access,\" considering it's about notifications and user access. However, since it also deals with timecard approvals, it might belong to \"HR Support.\" I want to be accurate here!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like the issue revolves around notifications in a timecard approval system, which means it falls under HR or payroll. \"HR Support\" could be the best fit since it\u2019s HR-related. Alternatively, if it\u2019s about permissions affecting notification visibility, I might consider \"Administrative rights.\" However, since the user needs help with timecard approvals related to a line manager change to Bogota, I think \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate choice. I'll format my response in JSON!**Formatting category response**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket in a specific JSON format. The required response is either {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} or, more precisely, in the schema with \"type\" and \"properties\" around the \"category\" field. It's important to stick to the instructions. I realize I need to ensure I'm outputting the correct JSON structure that aligns with the schema, using \"category\" as a property. So, my final answer should clearly reflect this format!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
