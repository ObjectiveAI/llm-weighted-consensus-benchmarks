It mentions various roles and details around hardware, including mobile phones and devices, potentially indicating requests for approval and procurement. The categories I'm considering are \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase,\" given that it focuses on the allocation of hardware for new starters. It seems clear that \"Hardware\" is the primary focus here for categorization.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on categorizing this IT ticket and leaning towards \"Hardware.\" While it could also fit under \"Purchase\" because of the mention of orders and suppliers, the focus of the ticket is more on hardware provisioning and allocation. Therefore, \"Hardware\" seems like the best choice. I'll format the final answer as a JSON category object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, following the specified response format with minimal explanation."
