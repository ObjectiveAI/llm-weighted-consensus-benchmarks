While \"Administrative rights\" might apply in some scenarios, it feels more like a software/platform issue. \"Miscellaneous\" could work as a catch-all. Given the limited options, I'll need to select the best fit.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nI think platform freezing indicates a software issue rather than hardware. I'm considering categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project,\" especially if it's a company platform. The user hasn\u2019t mentioned any hardware errors, so I should focus on software. Since the prompt asks for categorization only, I'll need to choose the best option. The mention of \"specialist\" and an address suggests it might be from someone in an office, but my best guess is to categorize it as \"Miscellaneous.\"**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering that a typical support ticket for a platform freeze might fall under \"Internal Project,\" but that\u2019s usually for ongoing tasks. Since I need to categorize this IT ticket, I think the safest option would be \"Miscellaneous,\" especially for ambiguous issues. The freezing platform is software-related, but there's no specific \"Software\" category. So, I'll go with \"Miscellaneous\" since it covers general IT problems. I\u2019ll respond in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
