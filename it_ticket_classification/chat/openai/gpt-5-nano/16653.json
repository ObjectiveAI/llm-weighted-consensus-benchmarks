The ticket mentions access and an entity administrator, which suggests it relates to \"Access\". \"Find PO search lists\" indicates it\u2019s likely about administrative rights as well. Based on the provided categories, the most fitting choice is \"Access\" since it emphasizes granting access to a system or server, possibly labeled \"Thursday\". This makes sense as the main focus of the request.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at an IT ticket that likely involves getting access to a system for searching purchase orders. The mention of \"entity administrator\" suggests it relates to an admin role, which can fall under either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" However, since it's specifically about admin rights, \"Administrative rights\" seems like the most accurate choice. I will respond with a JSON object stating: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I don\u2019t think more details are needed right now, as the user asked just for categorization.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
