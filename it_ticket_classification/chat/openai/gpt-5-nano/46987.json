While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it involved privileged accounts, it seems primarily about lockouts. So, I'm going with \"Access.\" I\u2019ll output the JSON object format as needed: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI need to focus on providing the exact JSON object with the property \"category.\" The prompt hints they likely want just the category string based on the instruction \"Categorize this IT Ticket.\" The expected response format is the \"category\" style JSON. Since the guidelines outline a specific schema for the response, I\u2019ll confidently proceed with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's straightforward enough, so I won\u2019t include any extra text alongside it."
