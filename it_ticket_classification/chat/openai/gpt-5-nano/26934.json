The ticket text is somewhat muddled, but it seems to relate to hardware allocation and involves a purchase order. Some terms like \"teams adaptor\" might refer to a USB-C to Thunderbolt adapter. The user is asking to log the allocation and perform a receipt, which suggests it fits into the Hardware category. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as Hardware.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nThe content of this ticket is clearly about hardware allocation. It doesn\u2019t fit into categories like HR, Access, Storage, or Purchase. The mention of \"po\" suggests a purchase order, but I'm certain it belongs in the Hardware category. The message talks about logging hardware allocation and performing receipt for items like an Apple Thunderbolt adapter. My final classification will be Hardware, and I need to output this in the required JSON format, specifying \"category\" as the field.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
