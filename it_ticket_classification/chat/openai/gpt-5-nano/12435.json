The options for categories are listed in the system prompt, including \"Internal Project,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and others. Based on the content, it looks most aligned with \"Internal Project\" since it focuses on an Oracle ERP project code and mentions the need for further details. I'll go with that category!**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nThe request involves creating a code option for a new project, which aligns best with the \"Internal Project\" category since it's about project code setup. I considered \"Administrative rights\" if they needed permissions, but the text doesn't mention that, just requesting to create the option. I\u2019ve decided on \"Internal Project\" as the most fitting category. I\u2019ll output a JSON object with {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, since that's what the system expects. Let\u2019s keep it focused!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
