The content mentions a new location in Bogota and talks about requests around infrastructure, container locations, inventory items, and dedicated queues. It seems to be about setting up a new location, which makes it fit under \"Infrastructure\" or \"Internal Project.\" However, terms like \"storage\" and \"admin rights\" also pop up. Let's see which category makes the most sense!**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the phrase \"dedicated queue,\" which could relate to SN tickets and hint at \"Infrastructure\" as a department. Unfortunately, \"Infrastructure\" isn\u2019t an available category. Instead, \"Internal Project\" may cover the new location and infrastructure changes, while \"Miscellaneous\" is also an option. I need to output a JSON-like object, and I think \"Internal Project\" is a fit. I might also consider \"Storage\" due to the mention of inventory items. It's a tough call!**Choosing Category for IT Ticket**\n\nThe \"Internal Project\" category seems to be the right fit since it aligns with initiating tasks like moving to a new location and setting up infrastructure\u2014especially since the text explicitly mentions \"infrastructure.\" It\u2019s often used for internal IT changes or relocations. I\u2019ll go ahead and craft the JSON response. I\u2019ll make sure to double-check the capitalization for \"Internal Project\" to match the exact enum. I\u2019ll return just the JSON object without any extra text."
