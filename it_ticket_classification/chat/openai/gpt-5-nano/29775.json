The ticket discusses topics like feedback owners, task assignment, and complaints logged incorrectly, which suggests it's about managing feedback owners. It might fit into \"Administrative Rights\" due to user assignment concerns, but it could also fall under \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Access.\" This makes it a bit tricky!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket discusses \"assignment feedback owners,\" actions like \"disable\" or \"deactivate,\" and \"renaming feedback owners.\" It seems to deal with administrative aspects related to groups and permissions, suggesting that \"Administrative Rights\" might be the most fitting category. The mention of colleagues logging issues incorrectly points to possible process improvements. While it could also relate to \"Internal Project,\" it primarily concerns the management of feedback owners. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Administrative Rights\" for the categorization!"
