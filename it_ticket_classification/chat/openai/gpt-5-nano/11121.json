First, I'll examine the ticket content, but it's quite messy. It mentions licenses and an Excel update for employee dismissal documentation. There's also something about a July PM starter and automatically logging tasks for every license. So, it's a bit confusing, but I\u2019ll figure it out!**Analyzing the IT ticket content**\n\nThe ticket text is quite jumbled but talks about leavers and colleagues needing Snow accounts. It seems to relate to license management, employee onboarding/offboarding, and creation of starter forms. The request involves managing licenses and ensuring access for new hires while handling offboarding. This makes me think the ticket could fit into categories like Access or Administrative rights, as it deals with access provisioning and license allocation for users. I'll need to clarify further!**Determining the category**\n\nI need to classify this IT ticket into the right category. The options include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The request involves managing licenses for leavers and new hires, focusing on access provisioning and license management. Since it doesn\u2019t explicitly request elevating admin rights but rather creating service accounts and removing licenses, \"Access\" seems to be the best fit. So, I should prepare to respond with the JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward!"
