It mentions terms like \"clone button,\" \"change control,\" and \"incident,\" which could fit into categories like Internal Project or Access. There\u2019s also a mention of \"Administrative rights,\" possibly referring to permissions. However, I need to focus on the primary request within this jumbled text to determine the most appropriate category. I'll output a JSON with the chosen category.**Interpreting the IT ticket**\n\nThe message is unclear, but it mentions several terms like \"clone button,\" \"change control,\" and \"incident,\" which makes me think it might fall under \"Internal Project.\" There\u2019s also a possibility for \"Administrative rights\" if it involves permission requests. The user asks to create an incident about a \"topic assign,\" which could relate to change management as well. Overall, it feels like an IT operation request, so selecting the best fitting category is important here.**Choosing a ticket category**\n\nWe need to select a category for this IT ticket from predetermined options, but it doesn't fit neatly into \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" or \"Access.\" The ticket seems focused on change control and a clone button, which leans toward a feature or change request. I think \"Internal Project\" is the best choice since it relates to project tasks. It might also relate to implementing a fix in the UI, so \"Internal Project\" it is!**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m ready to respond with a JSON object for the categorized IT ticket. According to the instructions, I need to format it with a \"category\" field, which should reference the internal project category we identified. The final output will be a straightforward JSON: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Since the instructions ask for the category only, I'll keep it simple and just provide the JSON without extra notes. Let's make sure it's clear and accurate!"
