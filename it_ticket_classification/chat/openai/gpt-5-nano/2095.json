Since these details suggest technical deployment, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best category. Sure, \"Administrative rights\" could apply if permissions are needed, and \"Hardware\" might work if it's about device upgrades. However, the term \"Software Center\" indicates that deployment is the focus, leading me to settle on \"Internal Project.\"{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
