It mentions trying to delete a card and having an error when attempting to save changes. It seems to revolve around a time card, so it might fit into \"HR Support.\" However, since it involves permissions to delete something, it could also be considered under \"Administrative rights.\" It's a bit messy, but I think those are the best options!**Clarifying IT ticket category**\n\nI see that \"HR Support\" is one of the categories for classifying an IT ticket. The phrase \"time card change\" could relate to access control or a time and attendance card. It seems like there are issues with relocating a card or perhaps a person. Phrases like \"requesting specify location\" and \"deleting card\" raise questions about permissions. I think this ticket likely falls under \"Access\" for issues regarding permissions and badges, or possibly \"Administrative rights.\"**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe user mentions an \"error requesting specify location,\" which hints at asset management. With terms like \"card,\" \"location,\" \"relocated,\" and \"delete card,\" it seems to refer to access control. Based on the request to specify a location and the mention of deleting a card, the best fit for categorization is \"Access.\" I'll format the output as a JSON object with the category set accordingly. So, the final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.I\u2019m considering if \"Administrative rights\" might suit this ticket, especially since it involves permissions to delete a card. However, I remember that the user specifically mentions needing a \"time card change\" and reports an \"error requesting specify location.\" Given that \"Administrative rights\" generally refers to granting admin privileges and this ticket leans more toward access control, I feel that \"Access\" is the more fitting category after all. So, I\u2019ll finalize it as \"Access.\""
