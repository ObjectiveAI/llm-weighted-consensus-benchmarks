It looks like this issue could relate to hardware, since adding a printer often involves hardware or driver problems. It might fit under \"Hardware,\" or possibly \"Access\" if there are issues with administrator rights. The mention of \"senior tester en mobile\" hints at the user's role, which might be relevant in determining the category. Let's pin it down.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user has shared a sentence that seems a bit jumbled from a non-native speaker. They're asking about adding a printer on the 7th floor in an open space. It sounds like they might need admin rights to install it, given their inability to proceed. The mention of being a \"senior tester en mobile\" provides context, but I think the best categorization here would be \"Administrative rights,\" as installing printers typically requires those permissions. However, it\u2019s also linked to hardware issues since it\u2019s about a printer installation.**Categorizing printer issue**\n\nI'm analyzing whether to categorize the ticket as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" since it pertains to permissions for adding a printer. The \"Administrative rights\" category might fit best for issues involving hardware installation permissions. However, since the user is experiencing problems related to adding a printer on their OS, it suggests a software or OS-level concern, though there\u2019s no specific \"OS\" category available. \n\nUltimately, given the focus on the printer, I think \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate category for this situation.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI'm considering the appropriate category for this IT ticket. The \"Administrative rights\" category is relevant if the user lacks elevated privileges, but they didn't specify it. Given the ambiguity, I\u2019ll lean toward categorizing it as \"Administrative rights\" since the user can't add a printer, which suggests they might need admin access.\n\nTheir role as a \"senior tester en mobile\" hints at mobile testing, yet the issue concerns a printer on the OS. So, I\u2019m concluding that \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit. I\u2019ll format the final output as a JSON object with that category.{\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}"
