My goal is to sort it into one of the categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll carefully analyze the content to infer what it is about and choose the most appropriate category. It's a bit tricky, but I\u2019m determined to get it right!**Parsing user issues**\n\nThe user seems to be reporting multiple issues regarding some users having wrong cards due to code discrepancies. They want confirmation or approval for specific users below. It looks like test users were removed, and there\u2019s mention that they\u2019ve fixed these cards. So, this seems related to \"cards\" assigned to users, which could refer to access cards or customer cards. I need to clarify the specifics before raising a ticket.**Categorizing user request**\n\nI think this issue is related to security access cards or employee cards. The user mentioned that \"test users have been removed\" and that they \"fixed cards for users.\" They\u2019re asking for confirmation or approval data for specific users, which suggests it's about \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it deals with user access cards, I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as \"Access.\" Even though there's a possibility of it relating to admin rights, I'll go with \"Access\" for now and respond accordingly with a JSON format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
