I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project\" due to the mention of onboarding. The details are a bit garbled, though.**Evaluating IT ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket's content: phrases like \"new starter confluence\" probably suggest it concerns access to Confluence for a new employee, while the rest seems to involve some admin tasks like filling in dates or attaching files. The best fit is likely \"Access,\" but it could also relate to \"Administrative rights\" if admin permissions are needed. Still, it primarily indicates access rather than admin rights specifically, so that\u2019s my focus.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize this IT ticket as \"Access\" since it pertains to system access. I considered \"HR Support\" too, because it mentions a new starter, but this is fundamentally an IT ticket. The best response would be a concise JSON object that aligns with the provided schema. The format should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll just respond with that to keep it straightforward and focused on what the user needs."
