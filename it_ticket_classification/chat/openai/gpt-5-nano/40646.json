I'll prepare a JSON object to reflect this categorization accordingly. It looks straightforward that the user needs help with access rights!**Clarifying JSON output format**\n\nI need to ensure I'm responding correctly with the categorization for the IT ticket. The correct output is simply: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. However, I have to follow the specified format from the schema. It looks like the schema detail is more for guidance. The instruction emphasizes the need to categorize the ticket. Therefore, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object containing the category without needing to include \u201ctype\": \"object\u201d since it's not part of the output content. That makes sense!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
