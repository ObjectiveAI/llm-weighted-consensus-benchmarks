However, that category feels a bit too general for this situation. The ticket indicates a potential security incident, possibly phishing. Since there's no \"Security\" category, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access,\" but \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option for requests that don\u2019t fit neatly. Ultimately, I\u2019ll choose \"Access\" as the best fit.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe best category here is \"Access\" since it relates to access control and blocking potential attackers. I'll categorize the ticket as \"Access\" and respond with a JSON-like object format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nI\u2019m making sure to follow the instructions precisely \u2014 the user requested this format, and it's important. While I could include a rationale, the focus should be on delivering just the JSON object. So, I\u2019ll stick to the format without extra notes."
