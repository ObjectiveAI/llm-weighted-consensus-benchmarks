The text indicates they want to block the old badge and obtain a new one, which aligns with access control. \"Access\" seems to be the most appropriate category. Although \"Administrative rights\" could work too, it\u2019s primarily about badge replacement. I'll format the answer as a JSON object stating: {\"category\":\"Access\"} to meet the system requirements.**Structuring the response**\n\nI see there's a specific schema I need to follow for categorizing this IT ticket. The proper JSON format is straightforward, and I\u2019ll respond with {\"category\":\"Access\"} based on the user's request concerning their lost security badge. While I briefly considered \"HR Support,\" it\u2019s clear this is primarily about access control. The user only asked for a category, so I\u2019ll keep it simple and stick to providing just that category in the specified format."
