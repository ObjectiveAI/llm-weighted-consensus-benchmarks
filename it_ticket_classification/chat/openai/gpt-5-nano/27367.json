The content mentions a \"new starter\" and \"starter form,\" suggesting it's related to onboarding. It could fall under several categories like \"Access\" for system access, \"Administrative rights,\" or \"HR Support\" for onboarding processes. However, the phrases in the ticket are quite unclear, especially with words like \"care va la care ext.\" I need to decide carefully!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking the IT ticket is likely about onboarding a \"new starter\" and involves attachments for a \"starter form.\" It seems to suggest a request for creating user accounts and permissions, so it could fit under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since onboarding typically requires system access, I'll classify it as \"Access.\" Although \"Administrative rights\" is possible, there's no explicit request for that. It seems best to go with \"Access\" for this ticket.**Finalizing the category response**\n\nI could ask for clarifications, but the instruction is clear: just categorize the ticket. So, I\u2019ll simply provide the category as a JSON object. I\u2019ll respond with: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nThere really is no need for extra explanations since the prompt specifically requests categorization. Of course, if they prefer \"Administrative rights,\" that could work too, but the main focus remains on \"Access\" related to the starter form. Let\u2019s deliver that now!"
