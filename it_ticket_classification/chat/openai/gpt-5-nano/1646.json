They\u2019ve mentioned terms like \u201crecurrent notification,\u201d \u201cwireless vs wired,\u201d and \u201cautomated ticket.\u201d I'm considering that they likely want help categorizing it into one of the provided categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. There's also a mention of \u201cpc si validate,\u201d which might refer to \u201cPC System Integration validation,\u201d but none of the allowed categories cover ServiceNow or Networking. I need to choose the best fit!**Determining the category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to choose the best category for this IT ticket. It seems like it could fit under \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Administrative rights\" or even \"Miscellaneous.\" The ticket suggests it\u2019s about setting up automated notifications, likely involving telecom or network issues. Since it doesn't align with hardware, storage, purchases, or HR support, the most logical choice seems to be \"Internal Project.\" I should respond with a category object like: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Finalizing the category output**\n\nI\u2019m confirming the final output format for the category. It should be a simple JSON-like structure. I need to keep it clean and straightforward, specifically as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI must ensure there\u2019s no extra text or unnecessary details around it. Just that structured response will work perfectly! Let's stick to that."
