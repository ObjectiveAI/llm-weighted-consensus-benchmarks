The content mentions a locked account, so it's clearly about access. The available categories include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the user only requests a password change, \"Access\" seems like the best fit. Although \"Administrative rights\" might seem relevant, the focus is on accessing their account, not requesting admin privileges. The user's role as a \"design lead\" isn't crucial for this categorization.**Categorizing ticket response**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about the phrase \"Friday change.\" It likely indicates a scheduled request. Since this is about a password change and relates to access, I should categorize it as \"Access.\" The user prompt specifies that I need to respond with a JSON object containing the category. Based on the instructions, I'll format my output as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThere's no need for extra text since the instructions ask for just the category. I\u2019ll ensure the formatting is accurate."
