They've asked to remove a mailbox from their Outlook profile called the \"fusion control mailbox.\" It seems they've tried to remove it through settings but are still seeing it as an \"additional mailbox.\" Since this is mainly about accessing the mailbox, I think the \"Access\" category is the most appropriate choice for this ticket. It definitely relates to permission issues.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether the ticket should fall under \"Administrative rights,\" since removing a mailbox may need admin access. However, since the user is asking to remove a shared mailbox from their Outlook profile, \"Access\" seems to fit better, as it specifically relates to mailbox access. I need to output a JSON object with the proper format. So, I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, keeping it concise and adhering to the required format."
