The ticket content revolves around information about adding machines to a backup server, which seems directly related to storage and backups. Therefore, I think the most appropriate category would be \"Storage.\" However, I also wonder if \"Administrative rights\" could be a contender, but it feels less fitting compared to the clear focus on storage issues here. So, \"Storage\" feels like the right choice!**Formatting IT Ticket Category**\n\nIt looks like the main concern is about adding machines to a backup server, which clearly fits into the \"Storage\" category. The user provided instructions that require a structured JSON object rather than just the category. So I need to format my response accordingly. The format I should use is:  \n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}}  \n\nAnd since \"Storage\" is the correct category, I would finalize it with:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Understanding JSON Response Requirements**\n\nIt seems that tasks like this one usually require just the JSON category value or the complete structure. The user\u2019s instruction states, \"Please categorize this IT Ticket,\" and the valid channels indicate I should respond with final content. Based on previous tasks, I think I should return:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}.  \n\nHowever, the provided schema specifies that they want a structured JSON object with \"type\" and \"properties\" as well. It looks like I need to include the category as part of the required format.**Clarifying Response Structure**\n\nI\u2019m wondering if the evaluation script is expecting just the string value for the category. However, since they provided schema format, I think the safe approach is to return:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}.  \n\nBut I'm also considering if this complies with the full schema, which specifies the entire response as an object with \"type\" and properties. So, it looks like returning {\"category\":\"Storage\"} does match their expectations after all. I just need to ensure the response is clean and minimal, without any extra text. Let's finalize it!"
