The ticket discusses fixing network plugs in meeting rooms, mentioning they are defective and causing disconnections during calls, which creates a professional issue. Given the context, this appears to relate to hardware since it focuses on plugs and network sockets. Therefore, I think the most fitting category for this ticket would be \"Hardware.\"**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket, and while options like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" seem possible, the ticket specifically talks about fixing physical network plugs in meeting rooms, making \"Hardware\" feel appropriate. I won't include extra text since the instructions emphasize providing a structured response. I'll format my output in a JSON-like object as required: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This way, I\u2019m sticking to the guidelines and keeping it clear and concise."
