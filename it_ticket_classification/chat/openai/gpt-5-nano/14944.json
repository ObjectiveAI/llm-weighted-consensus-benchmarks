The text mentions creating two installation tickets connected to an order number and a tutorial. This suggests it's about installation tasks. \n\nI\u2019m considering whether it fits under \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, \"Administrative rights\" relates to permissions, which doesn\u2019t seem applicable here. \u201cAccess\u201d isn\u2019t relevant either. So, it looks like \"Internal Project\" is the best fit.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the category list: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The request involves creating installation tickets related to an order, which could point to \"Internal Project\" due to its task-oriented nature. However, phrases like \"order number\" might suggest \"Purchase\" as a potential category, too. Overall, I think \"Internal Project\" fits best since it\u2019s about creating tickets as part of a larger process.**Preparing IT ticket JSON**\n\nThe user is asking for a \"little tutorial\" on how to perform tasks related to the ticket. This points towards the \"Internal Project\" category. I need to format my response as a JSON object, specifically: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. \n\nThe instructions say to provide just the category without any additional commentary. So, I'll keep it straightforward and deliver only the JSON response. This will ensure clarity and adherence to the guidelines. Time to produce that!"
