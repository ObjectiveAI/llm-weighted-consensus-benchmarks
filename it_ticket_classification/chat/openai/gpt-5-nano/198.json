It's all quite messy! The allowed categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Given that the user's issues seem related to build failures and mirrored database purging, I think the best match would be the Storage category.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe user's message includes phrases like \"database mirrored\" and \"purge mirroring step executed,\" which signal issues with database mirroring and purge operations. I\u2019m torn between categorizing this as Storage or Internal Project. The context seems to point more toward Storage because of the mirroring and purging mentions. The repeated lines indicate tasks related to database activities. So I think the best choice would be to categorize it as Storage.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nIf I'm unsure, I might consider categorizing as \"Miscellaneous,\" but it seems clearer to go with \"Storage.\" The response should be formatted correctly as JSON. The instruction specifies to categorize the IT ticket, so I'll follow the schema provided, which requires the output to be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}\n\nI\u2019ll keep my answer concise, focusing only on the required JSON output without additional notes. Just getting straight to the point is often best!"
