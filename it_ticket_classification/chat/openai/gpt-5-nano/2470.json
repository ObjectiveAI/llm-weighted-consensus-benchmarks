It starts with a request for a new headset due to potential faults. The ticket mentions testing the unit and attempting troubleshooting with drivers and ports, but nothing seems to help. I'll categorize it into \"Hardware\" since that fits best with the user\u2019s description of the issue. This will help in routing it to the right support team.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket is clearly about a hardware device, specifically a headset, so it could fit under \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase\" since the user is requesting a new one. The content suggests the headset is faulty, leading to a request for a replacement. According to IT ticket taxonomy, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" The user specifically asked for categorization, so I should respond with the JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Keeping it clear and concise is essential!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis ticket describes troubleshooting that led to the conclusion that the headset is faulty, suggesting a request for a replacement rather than a new purchase. While \"Purchase\" is typically for buying new equipment, the core issue is a hardware problem. The phrase \"new headset request\" does indicate a purchase, but since the underlying issue is hardware-related, \"Hardware\" is the best fit. Therefore, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Hardware\" since it focuses on the faulty headset."
