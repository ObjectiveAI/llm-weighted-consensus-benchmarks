The text primarily mentions a new monitor and installation, suggesting it's about hardware. I'll categorize this as \"Hardware,\" since it directly relates to adding or installing a new monitor, though it could also touch on \"Purchase.\"**Finalizing category output**\n\nI'm considering that this ticket might also fit under \"Purchase\" since it hints at requesting a new monitor, but it mainly focuses on installation. So, \"Hardware\" seems right. The output should be a JSON object with the category specified, based on the provided format. Given the prompt specifically asks for categorization, I'll stick to outputting just the category in JSON format. My final response will simply be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Clarifying category decision**\n\nThe text is a bit jumbled, mentioning \"monitor add install new monitor\" and some greetings, but the key phrases are about \"install new monitor,\" suggesting a focus on hardware. So, I think it clearly falls under the category of \"Hardware.\" Despite the unclear wording, the repetition emphasizes the hardware aspect. Now, I\u2019m ready to produce the final category output based on this reasoning. It's all about clarity and accuracy!"
