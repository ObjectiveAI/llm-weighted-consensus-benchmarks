It takes multiple attempts to unlock any building door, and even after hearing the unlock sound, it often feels blocked. I'm wondering if I should request a new card or if this can be sorted out somehow. The most fitting category appears to be \"Access,\" as it specifically relates to access control. So, let\u2019s organize a concise categorization for this issue!**Outputting category object**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to respond with a JSON-like category object that includes \"type\" set as \"object\" and \"properties\" specifying the category from a given list. So, I\u2019ll output it as follows: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This keeps it simple and follows the instructions without adding extra explanations. Let\u2019s make sure the response looks correct and concise!"
