There\u2019s also the possibility that \u201cView\u201d refers to VMware Horizon View. Since the user is asking for a category rather than a solution, I'll propose \"Access\" as the best option.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI think I need to provide a concise response regarding the ticket mentioning connection issues with access to apps like Excel and the View app. Since the urgency is high, I should categorize it as \"Access.\" The format requires a JSON output with a category field, so I\u2019ll put:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nNow I'm wondering if I should use lowercase or exactly as it is. The enum shows a capital first letter, so I'll stick with \"Access.\" The prompt suggests not adding extra details unless asked, so I'll keep it simple and just return the JSON."
