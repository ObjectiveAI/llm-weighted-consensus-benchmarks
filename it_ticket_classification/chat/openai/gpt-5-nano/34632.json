I\u2019m thinking it fits under \"Hardware,\" since tapes are consumables for devices, but it could also be \"Purchase\" since it\u2019s about procuring items. The mention of \"yellow\" might relate to the color, and \"ext en\" could refer to an engineering extension, but I\u2019m not entirely sure.**Categorizing IT requests**\n\nI see the phrase \"hello guys we would need for tapes for label makers follows yellow.\" It seems a bit mis-typed. I should categorize this request. The best fit is \"Purchase\" because it's about procuring tapes. It could also be categorized as \"Hardware\" if consumables are included there. Typical IT tickets like this are generally for purchases. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} since that matches the schema with \"category\" as the required field.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
