So, I\u2019ll likely classify this ticket as \"HR Support\" or \"Miscellaneous\" based on its overall context.**Classifying the ticket**\n\nThis ticket could fit into a few categories, like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"HR Support.\" I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" since it mentions maternity leave, but it also discusses Confluence, low satisfaction scores, and feedback handling, hinting at a process improvement. The mention of assigning tickets for the October PM aligns well with \"Internal Project.\" Overall, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since it involves processes and ticket assignment.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether this ticket belongs to \"Administrative rights\" or \"HR Support\" because it mentions maternity leave. However, there isn't a clear HR action requested; it\u2019s more about assigning tickets and handling complaints. While \"HR Support\" is one of the categories, the request appears to be focused on low satisfaction scores and a feedback process. It seems to suggest a potential issue with Confluence, so categorizing it might lean towards \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Internal Project\" for process improvement.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
