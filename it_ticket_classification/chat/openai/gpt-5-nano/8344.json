They mention needing \"adapter display port male female\" for meeting rooms. There's quite a bit of repetition, and it seems like they\u2019re asking for these adapters specifically for those areas. Terms like \"transparency trail\" and \"annual leave\" are a bit unclear, but the main focus appears to be on the display port adapters. I'll categorize this ticket under \"hardware requests.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt seems like the user is requesting DisplayPort adapters, specifically male to female, possibly for meeting rooms. This suggests they need these adapters to connect to displays in those areas. I think I need to categorize this ticket properly. The categories available include \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase,\" which both seem suitable since it pertains to acquiring adapters. However, since it\u2019s a procurement request, I\u2019ll categorize it under \"Purchase\" for clarity.**Categorizing IT request**\n\nThe mention of \"meeting rooms floor\" suggests that the user is asking about hardware related to those spaces. The ideal categories for this ticket seem to be \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" There are garbled phrases in the request that don't affect the categorization. Since the ticket is specifically asking for adapters, I think \"Purchase\" is the best fit, as it implies a request to acquire these items. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with \"category\" set to \"Purchase.\"**Outputting categorization**\n\nThe user\u2019s request seems straightforward, and since it\u2019s about acquiring hardware, \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category. It\u2019s not about addressing a specific problem, but rather requesting items. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object, ensuring it aligns with the instructions. The allowed categories help confirm \"Purchase\" as the right choice. So, I\u2019ll present it clearly as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"} \n\nThis keeps it concise and meets the user\u2019s needs!"
