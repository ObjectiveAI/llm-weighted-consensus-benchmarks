I have a set of categories to choose from: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nHmm, based on the content, it seems like it may fit in \"Internal Project.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think this ticket is regarding internal project management tasks within Oracle. The mention of \"admin rights\" suggests user permissions might be involved. I\u2019m debating between \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Internal Project.\" Since it's about an Oracle project and task assignments, it\u2019s likely \"Internal Project.\" The user\u2019s request to \u201cadd chub adapt\u201d could indicate wanting to include that as a resource for task assignments. The \"assigning tasks report\" may also imply needing user access, which makes me question if \"Administrative rights\" could fit in here too.**Deciding ticket category and format**\n\nI see the request for \"add chub adapt\" might refer to a user or resource, and the \"assigning tasks report\" suggests it's about generating a report on task assignments. This aligns with project management within Oracle, so \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best category. Alternatively, if it's too vague, it could also fit \"Miscellaneous.\" But I think it clearly relates to internal tasks, so I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\"\n\nI plan to respond with a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} along with a brief note for clarity.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
