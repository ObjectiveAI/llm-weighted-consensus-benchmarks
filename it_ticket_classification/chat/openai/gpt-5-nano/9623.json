Phrases like \"granted rights,\" \"permissions,\" and \"add him confluence permissions\" all indicate it\u2019s related to access control. Other mentions of \"pricing engine\" and \"affiliates\" might relate to an internal project or miscellaneous details, but the focus is mainly on access.**Categorizing access rights**\n\nThis ticket is clearly about access rights to Confluence, which leads me to consider either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" as the suitable categories. The text includes phrases like \"permissions,\" \"granted rights,\" and \"add him confluence permissions,\" suggesting it\u2019s about changing permissions, possibly indicating administrative rights. Since it centers on granting rights, \"Administrative rights\" could be the most accurate choice. However, \"Access\" would also apply broadly. In summary, I'll lean towards categorizing it as \"Administrative rights.\"**Deciding on Confluence categorization**\n\nThe user seems to be asking about the Confluence pricing engine, which might refer to a project or feature within Confluence. However, the main concern appears to be access and permissions. I need to categorize this as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Based on the content of the ticket, which includes a request for access, it seems safer to go with \"Access\" as the broader category. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object with the category selected.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
