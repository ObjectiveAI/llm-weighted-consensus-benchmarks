The categories I have are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The ticket seems to request access to certain reports and mentions issues with exporting, which could fall under \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights\" if permissions are needed. The mention of an export issue might also qualify it for \"Miscellaneous,\" but I'd lean towards \"Access\" as the best fit overall.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI realize that \"Access\" might refer to general access issues rather than just admin privileges. In this ticket, the user is asking about accessing a \"banks and branches report\" and issues with exporting a report folder. Given this context, I think \"Access\" fits best. I want to ensure I format my output correctly as a JSON object. The required format is: {\"category\":\"Access\"} to align with the specifications provided. I'll just make sure to follow this precisely!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
