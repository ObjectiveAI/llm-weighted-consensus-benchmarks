They mentioned \"configure dashboard graphs\" in relation to ServiceNow, an IT Service Management tool. I'm considering options like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It doesn't seem to fit \"Hardware\" or \"Access,\" but it might be related to \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are needed for configurations. Overall, I'll need to choose the category that best represents the core task from the user's request.**Choosing the right IT category**\n\nThe user mentioned some unclear details, saying \"please assign she helped dashboard graphs.\" I think \"Internal Project\" could be the best fit because it relates to configuring dashboards as part of an internal project. \"Administrative rights\" might apply if permissions are needed, but it seems more about the internal task. Although \"Miscellaneous\" is an option, I believe \"Internal Project\" is the strongest choice. I'll need to format this in a JSON object for submission with the category specified.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
