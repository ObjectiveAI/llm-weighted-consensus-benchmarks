They mentioned things like \"notifications,\" \"approvers,\" and \"mailing attached,\" which could imply this ticket relates to access permissions or administrative rights. Since the phrasing \"getting these approvers\" seems to suggest a request for approval or rights, it leans towards \"Access.\" However, it could also fit \"Administrative rights\" if the user is specifically asking for those. I need to choose carefully without making too many assumptions.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"notifications Friday October PM importance high,\" suggesting it relates to scheduled notifications that are quite critical. Phrases like \"getting these approvers\" and \"mailing attached\" indicate a request involving access approvals. It seems \"Access\" fits best since it pertains to getting permissions. While \"Administrative rights\" could work, I think \"Access\" is more general. I should prepare a JSON-like object to categorize this ticket according to the required format, with a \"category\" field reflecting my selection.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
