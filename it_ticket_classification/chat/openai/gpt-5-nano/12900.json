I'm feeling like \"Storage\" might be the most suitable category here since they are concerned about managing their mailbox and storage effectively. It\u2019s a bit messy, but I've got a direction!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's message includes several issues around \"mailbox size increase\" and managing deleted items, indicating a storage-related problem. It seems they\u2019re frustrated with deleted items management and possibly want to increase their mailbox size. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they\u2019re asking to change a policy, I think \"Storage\" is the most fitting category here. So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object that specifies the category as \"Storage.\"{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
