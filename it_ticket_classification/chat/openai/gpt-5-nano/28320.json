The user's message is quite messy, mentioning \"update package\" and \"confluence,\" which might refer to the Atlassian product. It\u2019s not clearly structured, making it tricky to classify. Given the context, this might relate to an Internal Project, Administrative rights, Access, or possibly fall into Miscellaneous. I'll have to think carefully about it.**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nIt looks like the user's request is about updating a software package for Confluence, as \"update package\" pops up repeatedly. The text suggests they might be talking about maintenance on the Confluence server. I\u2019m considering the ticket categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since this seems focused on updating software, it could fit under Internal Project or Administrative rights, though it doesn\u2019t clearly mention access or specific rights.**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe user is asking for a categorization, and I think the best fit here is \"Internal Project\" since it\u2019s about coordinating updates across the Confluence system. It mentions things like \"head digital\" and \"subsidiaries\" hinting at project-related work. There\u2019s no hardware or purchasing involved. I need to respond with a JSON object in the specific format provided. So, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\u2014keeping it minimal and straightforward as instructed."
