I think \"please changed starting\" refers to that. Now, if I categorize this request, it doesn't fall under administrative rights, as that's more about access permissions. It might fit under HR Support for personnel changes. Ultimately, since it's about a project, I think the best fit is \"Internal Project.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIn IT ticket categories, \"Internal Project\" is relevant for project-related tasks. The phrase \"for project\" indicates this is specific to a project. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they were changing admin access, that\u2019s not clearly stated here. I think \"Miscellaneous\" would be a fallback. However, given the context, the best fit is \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object in the required format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
