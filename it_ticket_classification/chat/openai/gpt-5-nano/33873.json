It seems that the most fitting category would be \"Access,\" as it relates specifically to accessing a software tool. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also apply due to the rights mentioned. I think I'll go with \"Access\" as the best choice.**Outputting category JSON**\n\nI\u2019m working with a defined category object schema that specifies the allowed categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" My task is to produce a JSON object with just the category field based on the user's classification request. Since the best fit for the ticket is \"Access,\" I'll keep the output clean and simple, ensuring no extra text is included. The response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
