The ticket mentions someone bypassing alarms and gain access to parking areas. I consider categorizing it under \"Access,\" as it fits the description best. There\u2019s also the option of \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Access\" seems most fitting since it relates directly to a security vulnerability involving building access. Overall, \"Access\" is the best choice for this ticket.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that follows the required format. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nTo ensure I match the format correctly, the category needs to be wrapped in an object, aligning with the schema that specifies a string type for \"category.\" So, the output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nNo extra text is needed; I want to keep it concise and clear. Let's finalize this!"
