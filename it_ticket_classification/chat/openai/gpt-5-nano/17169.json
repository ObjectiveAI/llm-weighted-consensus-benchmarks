The ticket involves upgrading users from an old version to a new one. This includes steps like running reports, tracking assets, and issues encountered. It feels like it could fit into several categories: \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access\" since it covers deployment and asset management processes. There\u2019s quite a bit of content related to the upgrade process.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI'm evaluating an IT operations ticket related to upgrading software on client assets. It seems like it can be categorized as \"Internal Project\" since it involves software upgrades across the organization. While there might be some need for \"Administrative rights\" for installations, the ticket isn't requesting access but rather details steps performed like logging and advising. Given that no explicit rights request is made, I\u2019ll classify it as \"Internal Project\" and prepare to return the category in JSON format.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
