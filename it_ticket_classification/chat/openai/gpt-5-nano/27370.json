But it could also be about access provisioning for a new employee. Given the categories provided, I think \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate due to the onboarding context. However, \u201cAccess\u201d also makes sense if it's about setting up accounts.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket regarding a \"new starter,\" which probably relates to HR Support because it\u2019s about onboarding. However, the mention of \"starter form ext\" might imply a request for an extension of a form, or perhaps even a private message. In IT ticket triage, new starter tasks typically fall under \"Access\" for system access or \"Administrative rights\" for admin privileges. The \u201cext\u201d could also refer to a phone extension, which leans towards \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Categorizing the ticket type**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the category options for the IT ticket. The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the phrase \"new starter Friday October PM starter form ext,\" I would lean towards categorizing it as \"HR Support,\" since \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" suggest onboarding processes. Although some IT teams might classify it under \"Access,\" I feel \"HR Support\" is the best fit. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Delivering the JSON response**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize the IT ticket, so I need to respond with the appropriate JSON object. I'll make sure to provide just the JSON output, since the instruction specifies to output the category only. The chosen value for the category is \"HR Support.\" So, I'll present it in the required format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I think it's best to stick to the guidelines and keep it straightforward. Alright, here we go!"
