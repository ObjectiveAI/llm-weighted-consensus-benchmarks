It mentions \"unicorns com,\" which might refer to an internal portal, plus tasks like adding and removing. I'm seeing keywords like changes and occasion. These seem operational, so I'm thinking it could fall under \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll need to digest all that to determine the best category based on what the user intends.**Categorizing IT requests**\n\nI have a list of categories to consider for this IT ticket, including Hardware, HR Support, Access, Administrative rights, Internal Project, Miscellaneous, Storage, and Purchase. The user seems to be requesting to add or remove users or items, which could fit under \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" The text mentions \"unicorns com,\" with frequent terms like \"add,\" \"remove,\" and \"changes.\" This suggests a context that likely relates to adding or modifying user access.**Determining the right category**\n\nI'm trying to parse this IT ticket, which seems to involve user management, specifically adding and removing user accounts. This leans toward the categories of \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Typically, managing user accounts fits under \"Access,\" so that's likely the way to go. The phrase \"add her occasion\" is confusing, but it doesn't seem to strictly imply administrative rights. Since \"admin\" isn't explicitly mentioned, I\u2019d categorize this as \"Access\" and prepare a JSON object for that.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
