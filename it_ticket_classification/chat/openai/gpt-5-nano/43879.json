The user seems to be struggling with Spark Desktop, likely a video meeting app. They mentioned issues regarding client meetings and asked if something changed recently since it was working perfectly until yesterday. Given this context, I think the best category could be \"Access.\"**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe user is seeking help with Spark Desktop not working for client meetings. They mention \"investigation\" and their \"next annual leave in February.\" I need to categorize this ticket from given options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It seems to be an access issue rather than hardware, but there's no \"Software\" category. Since they didn't mention login issues, \"Access\" seems appropriate due to potential permissions or licensing problems.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nIn a typical IT ticket system, I would normally categorize this as \"Software,\" but that's not available. I considered \"Internal Project\" and \"Administrative rights,\" but there aren\u2019t any explicit mentions of rights issues. Since they can't use Spark Desktop, it could also fall under \"Miscellaneous\" for general issues. However, \"Access\" seems to be the best fit since they\u2019re facing access difficulties for client meetings. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
