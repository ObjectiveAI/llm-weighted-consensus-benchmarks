This ticket isn't about hardware, HR, access, storage, or purchase, and I'm unsure about \"Administrative rights.\" \"Miscellaneous\" might work for vague tasks, but \"Internal Project\" could fit since it feels like an internal process. Ultimately, \"Internal Project\" seems plausible for categorizing this, given its focus on closing change requests.**Deciding on IT ticket categorization**\n\nI'm considering the \"Miscellaneous\" category for ambiguous tasks, but the most accurate fit for this IT ticket seems to be \"Internal Project,\" since it's about change requests tied to project processes. Even though the options are limited, I think \"Internal Project\" works best. Now, I need to respond using the required JSON format, which means I'll create an object like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I'll make sure to format it correctly without extra commentary.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI need to output the category in the correct JSON format, which is simply: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. However, I realize there's a schema wrapper for the whole response, so it should follow that structure. Based on earlier prompts, I shouldn't add any extra commentary either. It\u2019s straightforward: I just want to ensure that the JSON object is accurate and properly formatted without any additions. I'll finalize it to match the schema requirements."
