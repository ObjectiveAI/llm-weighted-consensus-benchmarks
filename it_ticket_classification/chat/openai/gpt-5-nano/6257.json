However, \"Administrative rights\" seems to fit best here.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe content involves an ad policy update that allows regular users to update drivers and addresses issues with manually running driver updates. This is mostly about permissions related to allowing users to perform driver updates, so I'll categorize it as \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nI need to respond with a JSON object containing the category. The schema indicates it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I\u2019ll make sure the formatting is correct and straightforward, without any extra commentary.\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
