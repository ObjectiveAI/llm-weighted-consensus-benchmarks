The ticket mentions \"new account\" and \"creating instance,\" suggesting they're requesting a new account for a cloud instance. \"He order working metrics\" is unclear, but it might refer to something related. Overall, this appears to fall under Access, Internal Project, or Administrative Rights since it's primarily about provisioning a compute instance.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI see that there's a category called \"Internal Project,\" which might fit if this request is for an internal purpose. The mention of \"new account\" suggests they're looking for access, while \"by creating instance\" indicates they need a resource created. The most fitting category seems to be \"Access\" since it's specifically about a new account and instance. \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, but I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" and provide a brief justification in the requested format.**Formatting IT Ticket Response**\n\nI see the instructions specify a JSON response format with a category field. The provided schema outlines the acceptable categories. The closest match for this IT ticket is \"Access,\" as it aligns with the request for a new account and instance creation. Since the instructions emphasize just the JSON object, I\u2019ll ensure proper quoting without any extra text or commentary. I\u2019ll finalize the response as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
