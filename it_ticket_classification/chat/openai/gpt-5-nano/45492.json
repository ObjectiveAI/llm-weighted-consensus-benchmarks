My goal is to determine which category fits best based on the details shared.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing the best category for the IT ticket provided. The most fitting category seems to be \"Purchase,\" since it involves a purchase order submission error in Oracle. While \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option if things were unclear, the specifics point strongly towards \"Purchase.\" I need to format my response as a JSON object, including the \"category\" field with the value \"Purchase.\" It's essential to keep it straightforward and aligned with the required schema.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
