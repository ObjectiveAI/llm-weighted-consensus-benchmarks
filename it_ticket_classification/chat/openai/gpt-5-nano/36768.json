The user mentioned they're unable to access a network drive, and they've switched locations. The category options include \"Access\" and possibly \"Storage,\" but since the main issue is related to being unable to access the drive, \"Access\" feels like the best choice. I'll respond with a JSON object formatted correctly for this. The output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Delivering category response**\n\nIt looks like I need to respond with a precise JSON object that includes the \"category\" key. The category for the IT ticket is \"Access,\" so the response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I have to make sure not to include any extra text and stick to the instructions of providing just the category object. Alright, I\u2019m ready to deliver this clear and straightforward response!"
