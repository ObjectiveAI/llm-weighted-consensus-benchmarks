The content mentions \"backup approver for team during annual leave\" and requests a change. It seems to relate to access rights for assigning or changing an approver role. I\u2019m considering whether to classify it under \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d The first could refer to general access, while the latter is specifically about admin permissions. I think \"Administrative rights\" might be the most appropriate category here.**Finalizing Ticket Categorization**\n\nThe ticket is about designating a backup approver during annual leave, which involves changing approval rights. This points to \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d as the most fitting category since it specifically addresses admin privileges. \u201cAccess\u201d would generally relate to access issues, whereas this is about permissions. I need to provide the output in JSON format according to the specified schema. So, I'll go ahead and respond with: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. That should cover it!"
