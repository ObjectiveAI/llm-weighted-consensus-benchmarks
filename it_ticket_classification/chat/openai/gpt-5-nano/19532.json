They seem to be experiencing issues with adding someone to the testing strategic leadership team as an owner and faced permission errors. The message mentions that changes to public membership cannot be saved due to insufficient permissions, indicating a clear issue with access rights. Among the available categories, \"Access\" seems to be the most fitting choice for this ticket.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket, and it seems primarily related to access issues, specifically around permissions. The user\u2019s request to add someone as an owner involves access control, which fits best under the category \"Access.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could also be applicable, the more straightforward choice here is \"Access.\" This is because IT ticketing systems typically classify tasks involving permissions under access issues. I'll finalize the ticket by providing a JSON object indicating the category as \"Access.\"**Formatting the JSON response**\n\nI need to format the output according to the system's requirements. The user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, so I\u2019ll keep it simple and directly provide the JSON object. It should include just the category field structured as defined: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. There's no need for extra explanation since the user already provided the context. I'll ensure that the quoting and structure are correct. So, here it is: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
