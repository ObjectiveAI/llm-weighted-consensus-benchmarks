The text mentions issues with annual leave, which feels like it's related to HR rather than IT hardware. Since they specifically mention \"annual leave\" and a \"senior manager,\" it seems clear that this ticket is about HR support. While it\u2019s an IT ticket, \u201cHR Support\u201d is one of the options and fits best here. So, I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support\".**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe content from the user indicates there's an issue with annual leave requests, suggesting maybe the system is malfunctioning or the requests aren't being processed correctly. Given the repeated mention of \"annual leave,\" it makes sense to categorize this under \"HR Support.\" I realize that I need to present this as a JSON object based on the required format. So, I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
