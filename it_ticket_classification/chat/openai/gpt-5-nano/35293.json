The required format mentions a specific schema structure, but since the content is just the category, I think I can use a simplified version. So my response will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. The ticket content indicates a charging issue, confirming that \"Hardware\" is the correct category, focusing on a hardware-related problem with charging.**Delivering JSON response**\n\nI need to respond directly with the JSON object without any extra commentary or unnecessary text. The final response will simply be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This way, I stick to the user's request and keep it clean and straightforward. Let's deliver this!"
