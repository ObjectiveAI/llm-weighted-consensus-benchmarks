The category options I have include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and more. The email mentions a \"new starter\" and \"starter form,\" indicating it's related to HR onboarding. \"HR Support\" seems like the most fitting category, though \"Access\" could work if it's about system access for the new starter. I\u2019m leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the best choice.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI think this ticket likely requires \"HR Support\" since it\u2019s about onboarding a new starter, referencing \"joining ny\" and related phrases. While \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant, \"HR Support\" seems the most appropriate. I need to put this into the specified JSON format, ensuring to include the exact capitalization. So, my output will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This keeps it concise and accurate for the user's request!**Delivering the category**\n\nThe prompt specifies that I should categorize the ticket, and since \"HR Support\" is the appropriate choice, I'll just provide that as the output. The response format needs to be in a JSON object. While it might be tempting to add reasoning, the instructions focus solely on the category. So I'll stick to delivering just that: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This keeps it simple and aligns perfectly with the user\u2019s request!"
