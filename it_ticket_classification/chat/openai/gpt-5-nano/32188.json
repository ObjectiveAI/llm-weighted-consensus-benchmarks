It seems related to operations or admin tasks for meeting room provisioning. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Administrative Rights,\" but it\u2019s more about setting up meeting rooms than access rights. There's also \"Internal Project\" to consider, but something like \"Facilities\" might fit better, although it\u2019s not on the list. I need to pinpoint the best category for this task.**Categorizing meeting room requests**\n\nIt looks like \"Internal Project\" would be a fitting category if it involves adding new meeting rooms to a system. Alternatively, \"Administrative Rights\" could apply if the user needs permissions to make modifications. Since the request is mainly about categorization, I should suggest either \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" The word \"liaise\" indicates coordination too, which suggests this might be part of an ongoing effort to manage meeting rooms across different floors.**Understanding meeting room requests**\n\nThe user is asking to add new meeting rooms from the third floor, with mentions of \"Wednesday PM\" and \"brand RD floor.\" It looks like they\u2019re consolidating multiple requests for adding meeting rooms across different locations. This task appears to be focused on provisioning these rooms in a system, making \"Internal Project\" a suitable category since it\u2019s an internal IT task. \"Administrative Rights\" could be relevant if it were about granting permissions, but that doesn't seem to apply here.**Deciding on category format**\n\nI'll respond with the category \"Internal Project\" for this IT ticket. It makes sense to briefly mention the rationale and possible sub-tags like \"Facilities\" or \"Access,\" but the main focus should be the JSON object. The user requested categorization, so I\u2019ll format it according to the provided schema.\n\nThe final output will be straightforward: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This aligns with the clear task of adding meeting rooms, making \"Internal Project\" the best fit. Let's stick to this format without extraneous commentary.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
