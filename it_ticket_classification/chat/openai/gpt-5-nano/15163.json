Maybe \"Hardware\" could relate to phones and dual ports, but this seems more focused on a new purchase order and licensing. It mentions shipping and logs, specifically in the \"receipts section,\" which supports the \"Purchase\" category. I should examine the content more to decide if it\u2019s a hardware issue related to the phone's voice dual ports.**Categorizing a purchase order**\n\nThe ticket starts with a request, mentioning a new purchase order for a phone with voice dual ports. It seems to focus on logging the allocation, considering mandatory receipts, and receiving the ordered item, which suggests it's related to the procurement process. So, I should categorize this as \"Purchase.\" The output needs to be a JSON object that reflects this category neatly. It should simply be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase.\"}"
