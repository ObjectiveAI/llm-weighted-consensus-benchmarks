It seems like \"Access\" fits best since the primary problem is about access, but \"Storage\" could work too because of terms like \"cluster resource\" and \"recovery points.\" However, the focus is more on accessibility than backup. If I have to choose, I'll go with \"Access.\" I'd return a JSON object outlining the category as \"Access\" in the required format, while following the specified structure.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nI see the instruction at the top clearly states to \"Categorize this IT Ticket.\" It looks like I need to respond with a JSON object that includes the category string. The task requires a \"category\" field, and since \"Access\" is one of the enumerated options, I'll provide that. The final output should be straightforward and minimal, without extra commentary. So I'll simply deliver: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
