It seems pretty clear that this falls under the \"Hardware\" category since they're asking for a specific hardware resource. Although it could potentially be viewed as a \"Purchase,\" the emphasis on \"temporary\" suggests it's more about hardware resource availability. \n\nSince the output format requires a valid JSON object, I'll ensure it's structured correctly: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Formatting the category response**\n\nI need to format the response according to the required JSON schema for the IT ticket category. The category should be represented as an object. So, it looks like I need to respond with just the category as a valid JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. \n\nI\u2019ll be careful to make sure it adheres strictly to the schema provided, with no extra text. It's just about sending back the object correctly. Let's deliver that now!"
