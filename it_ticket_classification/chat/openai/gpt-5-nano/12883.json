The user\u2019s text includes various topics like \"unable change area,\" \"reset password,\" and \"poll listening status down.\" \n\nI think \"Access\" fits best since it revolves around issues with passwords, logins, and credentials. Although \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, the focus on changing areas and resets seems more appropriate for \"Access.\" So, that\u2019s likely the right choice!**Classifying IT tickets**\n\nI'm analyzing a request that mentions \"per policy needs changed every month,\" which makes it a bit confusing. I need to pick the right category. Given the categories, \"Administrative rights\" refers to admin privileges, while this content involves \"credentials\" and \"permissions.\" It seems to focus more on access issues, particularly around logins and password resets. Even though there's a mention of an application issue, most is related to access, so I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" and respond in a JSON format."
