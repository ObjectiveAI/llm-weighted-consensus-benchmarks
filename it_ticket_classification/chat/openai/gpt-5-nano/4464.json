The categories to choose from include hardware, HR support, access, miscellaneous, storage, purchase, internal project, and administrative rights. It seems this ticket is primarily about canceling a meeting, which could fall under \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or even \"Miscellaneous.\" Ultimately, it feels like it relates to the management of a calendar meeting and updating who organizes it.**Determining the right category**\n\nI'm trying to figure out if this IT ticket should fall under \"Access\" due to permission issues for canceling a meeting or \"Administrative rights,\" which relates to the rights needed for cancellations. There isn't anything about hardware, storage, or purchases mentioned. Since the ticket revolves around removing an organizer who left, it feels like \"Access\" is the most relevant. This category likely covers the rights to modify calendar settings or meeting arrangements, which seems to fit here.**Categorizing the calendar issue**\n\nI see this is a classic \"calendar access\" problem. It could also relate to an \"Internal Project\" if connected to a project schedule, but \"Access\" feels more accurate since the user needs to remove the organizer's access to the meeting. The repeated phrases like \"to be canceled removed\" suggest the need to update permissions. So, to be safe, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and provide a note indicating it concerns canceling a meeting organized by someone who has left. My final output will be in the specified JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
