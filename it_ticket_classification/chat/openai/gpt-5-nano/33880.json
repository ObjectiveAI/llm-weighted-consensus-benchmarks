The allowed categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The user\u2019s message is unclear, but it seems related to device management, likely indicating it falls under \"Hardware.\" However, I should confirm this by carefully analyzing the request for more clarity.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm dealing with content that mentions device installation, accessories like back covers, and a few other details. It seems centered around hardware, particularly phones. So, I think \u201cHardware\u201d is the most fitting category since other options like \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d \u201cAccess,\u201d or \u201cPurchase\u201d don\u2019t really match as well. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object with the category field clearly labeled. Proper capitalization matters, so I\u2019ll ensure it reads correctly.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
