The user mentions \"read only access on exchange server administration,\" which clearly refers to access issues. Given the specific focus on administrative rights and access management, I think the best category to choose would be \"Administrative rights.\" Although \"Access\" is more general, \"Administrative rights\" fits more accurately since the request is about controlling access to the Exchange server specifically.**Choosing the right category for an IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking the ticket should be categorized under \"Access\" since it concerns access permissions. However, the presence of \"Administrative rights\" really stands out as well. The ticket is specifically about read-only access to the Exchange Server administration, which indicates administrative control. The phrase \"read only access\" emphasizes permissions in the admin area. Ultimately, I feel \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit because it's more precise to the privileges being requested.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
