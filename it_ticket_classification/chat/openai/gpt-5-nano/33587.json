The category options available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Given that this ticket pertains to purchasing hardware, I think \"Purchase\" is the best fit. I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object to reflect this category: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket revolves around a purchase request for IT equipment, specifically a monitor and keyboard. It's clear that this involves procurement and equipment allocation. I\u2019m weighing the best category and think \"Purchase\" is the most accurate since it's primarily about procurement. However, \"Hardware\" could also apply due to the physical nature of the items involved. Ultimately, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase\" to reflect the procurement process, but I see how \"Hardware\" fits too.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket, and I believe \"Purchase\" is the best choice because it focuses on the approval and allocation of hardware. The ticket mentions a purchase request for a monitor and keyboard, so it clearly falls under that area. I just need to output the JSON object as per the instructions, ensuring it matches the specified schema. I\u2019ll format it like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Let's stick to that without extra commentary."
