The \"HR Support\" category definitely fits, while \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they're requesting access details, but there aren\u2019t any specifics mentioned about that. The attachment likely has more information.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nA typical IT ticket for a new starter usually involves provisioning tasks like creating user accounts, emails, and access. However, the content here is quite minimal. The \"HR Support\" category seems to be the best fit since it pertains to hiring a new starter. \"Administrative rights\" might be relevant if they needed an admin account, but that's not mentioned. The instruction mentions responding with a valid JSON object, so I\u2019ll output: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
