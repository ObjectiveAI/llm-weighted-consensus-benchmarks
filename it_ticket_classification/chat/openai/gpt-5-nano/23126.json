The options I have are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, and a few others. Since the issue seems to revolve around access to report options, it might fit under \"Access.\" However, it could be seen as \"Miscellaneous\" too since it's application-related. But I'll lean towards \"Access,\" as it pertains to users not seeing tasks in the report options.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"accessing report option tasks shown\" hints at possible access or permission issues. The user mentioned \"oracle report time not showing tasks,\" which could imply a problem with the reported runtime or the task list. The wording is a bit ambiguous, but the category options include \"Access\" for access issues and \"Administrative rights\" for permission matters. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
