The user is having trouble submitting their time card, mentioning that something goes wrong when they click the next button and the submit button doesn't appear. This ticket is clearly related to timesheet submission, and it doesn\u2019t fall under hardware, storage, or purchases. I think \u201cHR Support\u201d fits best since it involves payroll issues, but \u201cAccess\u201d could be relevant if it\u2019s a permission problem. I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support.\"**Classifying the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user is experiencing issues submitting their time card and mentioned that the submit button doesn\u2019t appear, which could indicate a UI bug. However, the best fitting category is \u201cHR Support\u201d since it relates to timesheet submissions, not necessarily \"Administrative rights.\" I should respond with a JSON object that includes only the category. Following the instructions, I\u2019ll provide it in the specified format: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nThis keeps the response clear and focused, just as requested!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
