The categories available include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the urgency and mention of bad connections affecting calls, the ticket could fit into \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access.\" While it might sound like a \"Networking\" issue, that's not an option. Since it's not clearly hardware-related, I'll lean towards \"Miscellaneous.\"**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nGiven the vague nature of the problem presented in the IT ticket, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the simplest and most fitting category. While we could consider \"Hardware\" if the issues stem from hardware components, the user did ask specifically for categorization. Based on the provided specification, I need to respond with a properly formatted JSON object. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} since that matches the allowed enum and fulfills the request.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
