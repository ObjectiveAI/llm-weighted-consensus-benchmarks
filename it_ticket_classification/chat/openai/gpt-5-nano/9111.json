Given that RAM is obviously hardware and they mention disk space, the best fit seems to be Hardware since their primary focus is on upgrading RAM. Even though there's a mention of disk storage, the main concern is the RAM, so I'd lean toward Hardware.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nThe ticket clearly states \"additional RAM needed\" and mentions disk space, so it seems they're asking for more RAM and to ensure sufficient disk space. The action they want is to \"please install additional\" RAM. Thus, the main focus here is a hardware upgrade, specifically for RAM. While there\u2019s a reference to disk space, the explicit request points to \"Hardware\" as the appropriate category. So, I\u2019ll return this as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That feels right!**Outputting the category**\n\nThe user has asked to categorize an IT ticket, so I just need to provide the category in the specified format. I\u2019ll create a simple JSON object that states the category. Since we've determined that \u201cHardware\u201d is the most suitable, I\u2019ll format it like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That should meet the user\u2019s needs perfectly!"
