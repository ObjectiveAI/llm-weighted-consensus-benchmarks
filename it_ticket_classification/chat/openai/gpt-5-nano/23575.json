It looks like it could fit best under \"Internal Project\" since it's about automating the archiving process. \"Storage\" might also be relevant, but \"Administrative rights\" seems off. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project.\"**Finalizing the category**\n\nArchiving is mostly about storing contract files, but it also involves process automation. \"Internal Project\" really fits since this IT ticket is focused on automating the archiving process and includes various contract IDs and statements of work. I\u2019ll set the category to \"Internal Project\" and prepare the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. The user asked for this format, so I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and output exactly that. No extra commentary, just the JSON!"
