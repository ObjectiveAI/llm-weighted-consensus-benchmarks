Given the context, it seems like a hardware issue related to network and video conferencing. The best category for this ticket would likely be \"Hardware\" since it involves conference device hardware.**Choosing a Category**\n\nI'm considering if the category could also be \"Internal Project\" since the ticket refers to a specific project. It mentions things like a conference room being busy and a particular conference device. It seems there's a potential bug in the video conferencing setup, but it doesn't necessarily relate to software. Ultimately, I think \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category. I\u2019ll respond in a concise JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It\u2019s important to keep it straightforward and valid!"
