The request mentions things like \u201cprocure disks\u201d and \u201cstorage,\u201d suggesting it relates to hardware storage. Thus, I\u2019m considering categories like \u201cStorage,\u201d \u201cHardware,\u201d or \u201cPurchase.\u201d Since the main focus appears to be on hardware, I think \"Storage\" fits best. I'll classify it accordingly!**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at different categories: \u201cHardware\u201d relates to general hardware, \u201cStorage\u201d is specifically for storage devices, and \u201cPurchase\u201d involves buying something. The text mentions procurement and ordering disks, but the focus is on extra disks and external hardware. I think \u201cStorage\u201d fits best because it deals with disks for large files. However, since there\u2019s mention of procuring, \u201cPurchase\u201d is also a contender. Ultimately, I\u2019ll go with \u201cStorage\u201d for the JSON-like output!"
