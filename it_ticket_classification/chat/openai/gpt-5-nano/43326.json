The response should be a JSON object, simply stating \"category\": \"Access,\" as the user expects that structure.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to output a JSON object that categorizes the IT ticket. The user's instruction was clear: \"Please categorize this IT Ticket,\" so I should keep it simple. My output will just be: {\"category\":\"Access\"} because that's the category we decided on. I\u2019ll ensure the capitalization matches exactly. The system requires the response in plain format, so presenting it as JSON works perfectly. Let\u2019s go ahead and do that!"
