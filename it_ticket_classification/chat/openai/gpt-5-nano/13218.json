There's no specific \"Licensing\" or \"Software\" category, so I'll lean towards \"Purchase\" for clarity in this case.**Finalizing category response**\n\nThere's no specific \"Software\" category, and among the provided options, \"Purchase\" seems to fit best for this IT ticket. I considered \"Administrative rights,\" but the request isn\u2019t about installing software. \"Internal Project\" doesn't apply either. So, I'll categorize it as \"Purchase.\" The required response has to be in a JSON-like format. It should look like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nI'll make sure to deliver this without any extra text!"
