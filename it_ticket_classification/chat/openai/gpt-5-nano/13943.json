While I briefly considered categories like \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" it seems like \"Hardware\" is the best fit because it directly relates to the monitor and cables.**Outputting JSON for IT ticket**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to provide a JSON response with the category \"Hardware.\" According to the instructions, the output should be formatted as a JSON object with specific properties. I've confirmed that \"Hardware\" is allowed based on the content, which mentions items like \"monitor\" and \"cable.\" So, I will carefully prepare the response to ensure it adheres strictly to the required format: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
