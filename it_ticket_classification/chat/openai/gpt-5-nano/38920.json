The ticket mentions a broken laptop screen and an urgent need for a replacement. It expresses concern about accessing documents while traveling. There's mention of an external screen and possibly loaning a laptop. Based on the details, it seems most fitting to categorize this ticket under \"Hardware\" since it primarily deals with a physical device issue.**Categorizing IT ticket as JSON**\n\nSince the ticket deals with a hardware issue and an urgent need for a replacement, I should categorize it under \"Hardware.\" I briefly considered \"Purchase\" for a replacement laptop or \"Access\" for document access while traveling, but the main concern is the broken screen. It makes the most sense to classify it as \"Hardware.\" So, I'll respond with the required format: a JSON object stating {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This matches the system's expectations perfectly!"
