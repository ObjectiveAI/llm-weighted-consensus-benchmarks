The ticket mentions both accessing SP via link and issues related to viewing a document repository, so it really could fit under \"Access\" or maybe \"Administrative rights.\" I'll focus on the general category \"Access\" since it covers permissions and credentials clearly. I\u2019ll ensure to output a JSON-like structure for this category as per instructions.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI'm sorting through this IT ticket, and while \"Administrative rights\" seems to specify requests for admin permissions, the overall focus is on access to systems and credentials. The text is a bit jumbled, but it talks a lot about permissions and viewing a document repository. Although both categories of \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" could apply, the core seems to be about access, so I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format it as a JSON object with the category field included.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
