The mention of \"shared properly\" and \"free/busy data\" suggests it's related to access or scheduling. I\u2019m considering categories like \u201cAccess,\u201d \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d or even \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d Since this focuses on calendar access and usage data, I think \u201cAccess\u201d might be the most fitting choice to help resolve the problem effectively.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis ticket isn't about user permissions; it's focused on the calendar sharing setup for meeting rooms. I\u2019m considering categories like \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d which relates to permissions for free/busy viewing. However, since the ticket clearly states a meeting room calendar issue, \u201cAccess\u201d seems more appropriate. The phrase \"shared properly\" indicates it\u2019s about permission settings. Ultimately, choosing \"Access\" is the safest option for IT tickets regarding system access and configuration.**Formatting the output**\n\nI need to create a concise JSON-like output for the category of the IT ticket. Based on the prompt that says \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" I know to classify it under one of the specified options. The format requires a JSON object, so I\u2019ll just include: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. \n\nI won't add any extra commentary unless the user asks for it. The final response will be purely that JSON object to stay consistent with the expectation."
