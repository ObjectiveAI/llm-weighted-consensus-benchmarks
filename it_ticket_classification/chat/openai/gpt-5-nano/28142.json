I gather that the task is related to file uploads or version control, so I need to place it in the right category. \"Internal Project\" seems relevant, but \"Storage\" fits better since it's about uploading files. However, \"Access\" might apply if they need to log in, and \"Administrative rights\" is possible if they\u2019re asking for upload permissions. I need to think this through to get it right!**Choosing ticket category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I\u2019ll need to choose one appropriate category from the list provided, like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the request relates to uploading files and changes, I believe \"Storage\" is the right choice. I\u2019ll format my answer as a concise JSON object: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. That should do the trick!"
