They\u2019re asking for help to extend it, so this seems related to storage quota. The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. I\u2019m likely leaning towards categorizing it as Storage since it's a quota issue. While it could potentially tie to Access, it seems clearer to place it under Storage.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to provide the information in a JSON format with a specific category field. The system outlines that categories are predefined, and I want to keep it straightforward. So, my output will look like: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I should avoid being verbose and stick strictly to the format required, which expects a JSON object with the category key. After double-checking, I confirm that \"Storage\" is an allowed category, so this should be the correct response."
