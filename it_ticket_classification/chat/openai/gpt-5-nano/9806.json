The garbled phrases could imply a greeting and possibly refer to an attachment. I'm unsure, but it appears to be about onboarding, so I think HR Support might be the best fit for this ticket.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI have a list of IT-related categories to classify the ticket. The mention of \"new starter\" likely ties to onboarding, which leans towards HR Support. However, given the context of IT, it might fit better under \"Access\" for setting up accounts. There's also \"Administrative rights\" if admin privileges are involved. The term \"mobile\" could imply a mobile device request for the new employee, but there\u2019s no specific category for mobile. I think \"Access\" is the best choice here.**Choosing the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering if this IT ticket is a \"Hardware\" request for provisioning a mobile device for a new starter, but it does feel ambiguous. The mention of a \"new starter\" implies onboarding, which typically involves setting up access, accounts, or hardware. While \u201cAccess\u201d seems most fitting for creating accounts, I also see how it could relate to hardware if it involves a mobile device. However, since there\u2019s no explicit request, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll provide a JSON object for the response.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
