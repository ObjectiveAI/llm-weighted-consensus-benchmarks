The important details seem to focus on onboarding, with phrases like \"starting today\" and references to access rights. Given the context, I believe the most fitting categories from the provided list would be HR Support, Access, or Administrative rights. It's essential to interpret this correctly to ensure proper assistance for the user.**Categorizing as Access**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the most appropriate category for this IT ticket. It mainly revolves around a new starter, which suggests a need for onboarding access. Though there\u2019s a mention of a former employee that hints at revoking access, the focus here still feels like it\u2019s about granting access to a new employee. So, I think I\u2019ll categorize it as \u201cAccess.\u201d This fits best, as it prioritizes onboarding over administrative rights, which remain unspecified.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
