The focus seems to be on scheduling and time tracking, with phrases like \"working time is not correct\" and \"scheduled work part.\" I'm wondering if it fits under \"HR Support\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the ticket's content is quite messy, it could fall under a more general category. Let's consider which label best captures the essence of this ticket.**Categorizing time tracking issues**\n\nThe text seems to focus on issues regarding working time scheduling, possibly indicating a bug in the time tracking system or payroll. There are references to \"validation kick log,\" which might suggest a login issue or kickoff. I'm considering category options. While \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t fit, \"HR Support\" might be the best choice since it relates to working time, scheduling, and the recruiting context. Alternatively, \"Internal Project\" could suit a project specifically about scheduling. Let's finalize the best categorization!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
