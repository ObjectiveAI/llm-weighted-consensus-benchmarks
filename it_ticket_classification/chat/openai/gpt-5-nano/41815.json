The user's ticket mentions feedback surveys after a job, focusing on timecards, validation, and approval issues under a system called \"Fusion.\" While it seems about feedback and notifications, it fits into more than one category. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access\" since it indicates submission access issues for approvals.**Categorizing Feedback Ticket**\n\nThis ticket seems to be more about a feedback survey than a hardware issue. The content mentions needing feedback, surveys for improvements, and references to a system called Fusion. Given the available categories\u2014Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights\u2014my best options look like \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The ticket\u2019s mention of access issues for submitting approval cards suggests it could also fit under \"Access.\" It's a bit complex!**Parsing Feedback Notification**\n\nI'm looking at a very garbled feedback notification. It mentions multiple issues with reminders about job performance, timecards, and unresolved validations that prevent card submissions. Keywords like \"validation unavailable\" and \"unable to submit\" suggest an IT issue, possibly related to a system called Fusion. Overall, it feels like a request for feedback on services provided, but the message is unclear. I need to categorize this properly, but first, I need to decipher the key points!**Categorizing Feedback Issue**\n\nThe ticket discusses \"feedback notifications,\" \"timecards,\" and \"submission issues,\" suggesting it's related to a feedback survey system for time and expenses. I'm considering whether to categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" or maybe \"Internal Project,\" as it deals with the Fusion system. \"Miscellaneous\" could be a safe choice too, especially since it's not clearly about hardware, HR support, or access rights. I think I\u2019ll lean toward \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Internal Project,\" focusing on the overall context.**Categorizing Functional Issue**\n\nThe request about being \"unable to submit a card for approval\" indicates a functional issue, likely related to the internal system, possibly referred to as Fusion. I think categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since it relates to the internal Fusion project and timecards. I\u2019ll respond with the category formatted as a JSON object, following the developer instructions precisely. Here\u2019s how it looks: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That's clean and straightforward!"
