The user mentions a \"dashboard display error\" along with other terms like \"snapshot,\" \"map,\" and \"report.\" It seems like it could relate to a software bug. Unfortunately, the categories available don\u2019t include Software or Bug. The closest might be Access, as the error could indicate an access issue with the dashboard. But given the specifics, it seems more like a software problem. I\u2019m still unsure.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out how to categorize an IT ticket based on the user\u2019s message. The options I have are pretty limited. Initially, I thought \"Miscellaneous\" might fit, especially since it\u2019s not hardware or HR-related. But could it be an \"Access\" issue if it talks about a dashboard display error? However, it doesn\u2019t specifically mention access being denied. \"Internal Project\" does sound relevant too given the focus on data reporting. Still, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the safest choice.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
