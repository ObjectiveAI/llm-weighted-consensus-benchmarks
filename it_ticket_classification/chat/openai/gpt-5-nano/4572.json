It looks like it's a request for an additional monitor, which points towards hardware. However, it also brings up the idea of a purchase since it mentions providing a monitor. The phrase \u201cplease provide additional monitor working returned accordingly\u201d suggests they might be looking to borrow or request one rather than purchasing outright. I think the best fit for this ticket is \"Hardware.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the category for this IT ticket, which is either about a request for hardware or procurement. The mentions of \"additional monitor request\" and \"please provide additional monitor\" clearly point to a hardware request. Typically, in IT systems, the \"Hardware\" category is for existing requests, while \"Purchase\" is focused on acquiring new items. Since this is about providing hardware, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" Now, I need to format this in a JSON-like object for the output.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI need to create a JSON object that follows the required schema with the category \"Hardware.\" Since the request is specifically for an additional monitor, it fits perfectly under that category. The instruction is clear, asking to categorize the IT ticket, so I\u2019ll keep it simple and just respond with the category in the required format. I\u2019ll make sure it looks like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That keeps things straightforward and meets the requirements!"
