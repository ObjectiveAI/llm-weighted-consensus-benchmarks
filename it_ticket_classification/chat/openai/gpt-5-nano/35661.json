The ticket mentions issues with completing a monthly schedule due to a week status error, indicating it's related to HR processes. Since timesheets are generally connected to HR/payroll, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"HR Support.\" However, it could also fit under \"Internal Project\" since it pertains to an application issue. I need to finalize this categorization.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI need to determine the best category for the IT ticket related to an Oracle timesheet error. Considering the options\u2014Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights\u2014this seems primarily related to HR systems. Therefore, categorizing it as \"HR Support\" appears appropriate. I should provide the category in the required JSON format since the user requested it as part of their instructions. That way, I can respond clearly and concisely!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
