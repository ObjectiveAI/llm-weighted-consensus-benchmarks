The message suggests it's about onboarding a new employee and help with a completed \"new PM starter form.\" \n\nLooking at the provided categories, it feels like \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate one here since it relates to employee onboarding. I\u2019ll output it as a JSON object, specifying \"category\": \"HR Support.\"**Determining best category**\n\nThe user's message suggests they're referring to onboarding at the New York office and that it relates to account access or administrative rights. The categories include \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" \n\nSince it's about provisioning accounts for a new starter, \"Access\" feels like the best fit. It could also be related to \"HR Support,\" but the context leans towards IT, so I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" This choice aligns well with the need for system access.**Selecting IT category**\n\nThe ticket seems to be about HR onboarding for a new starter, but it needs to be categorized as an IT ticket. The message indicates they need help with a completed starter form, which typically requires creating user accounts, setting up email, and providing access to systems. \n\nGiven this context, \"Access\" is the most appropriate category. I\u2019ll output it as a JSON object with the category field: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra text needed!"
