I\u2019ll format the response in a JSON-like structure as instructed, creating an object with category set to \"Hardware.\" This should ensure clear and accurate communication of the ticket's classification.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category for the IT ticket. The system expects the \"category\" field to include one of the predefined strings. In this case, it should be {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll ensure there's no extra text or comments, just the formatted response. It's important to keep it clear and concise, focusing solely on providing the correct JSON object with the necessary spacing. So I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
