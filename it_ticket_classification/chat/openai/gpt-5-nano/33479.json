The content mentions a change in the type of contract and includes terms like \"application migration\" and \"variation SOW.\" It seems that this might fit into a few categories: \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Purchase.\" Given the focus on contracts and application migration, I'll need to determine the most appropriate fit based on the provided schema and details.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this ticket as \"Internal Project\" because it involves a project change. The main topics include a contract type change and application migration. While \"Administrative rights\" might come to mind, that usually pertains to permissions rather than project changes. \"Miscellaneous\" could handle vague items, but since there's specific mention of application migration, \"Internal Project\" fits best. I\u2019ll finalize the category as \"Internal Project\" and note that it relates to changes in the contract for application migration.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
