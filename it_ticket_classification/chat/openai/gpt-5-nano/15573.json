They provided specific keywords like \"forwarder access,\" \"leaver,\" and \"disable accounts today.\" It seems they want to set up mailbox forwarding for someone leaving. The mention of terminating access and disabling accounts suggests this is related to access management. Given the context, I'm thinking it falls under the \"Access\" category. Let's proceed with that classification!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm handling multiple requests related to access, mailbox forwarding, and account disabling. Based on the information, the category should be \"Access\" since it involves managing user access. It's possible to consider \"Administrative rights,\" but it doesn't seem to fit as well here because it's more about mailbox rules than admin privileges. So, I'm confident that \"Access\" is the safest category. I'll format the response as a JSON object to reflect this. Let's go with that!**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI see the instructions specify that I need to format my response as a JSON object. The user wants to categorize an IT ticket, and based on my assessment, the correct category is \"Access.\" I need to ensure that my response strictly follows the required JSON structure. \n\nTo confirm, I'll craft the output as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This fits the given enumeration, and it\u2019s clear and concise, just like they asked. I'm ready to provide the JSON now!"
