The provided categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the request seems to relate to software development tools like Jira or Azure DevOps, \"Internal Project\" feels like the most fitting category. \"Administrative rights\" might apply if it was about permissions, but primarily, it looks like it\u2019s an internal project.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nThe user's request about adding an estimate field to a project management tool indicates this is a feature change, falling under \"Internal Project.\" It's important to categorize this IT ticket correctly. While \"Miscellaneous\" could work if it doesn't match, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best fit. I doubt \"Administrative rights\" applies since it's not about permissions. So, I will prepare the response in the required JSON format with the appropriate category. Here it goes: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}}.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nThe prompt provides a schema for the output, specifying that I need to generate a JSON object with a \"category\" field. The user's request regarding categorization leads me to use \"Internal Project\" as the category. The schema only requires this field, so it seems I shouldn\u2019t add anything else. I\u2019ll format the response as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This way, it adheres to the requirement with no extra commentary included."
