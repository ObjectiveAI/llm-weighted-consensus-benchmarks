Let's explore the most relevant category!**Parsing user issue**\n\nI need to parse the content of a message from a user facing a federated login issue. It seems they received an error saying, \"something went wrong,\" and they're advised to try again later or contact support if the problem persists. The message mentions including technical details like a correlation ID and the date of the issue. It also indicates that the user should ensure they're using the correct address when logging into the federation site. I\u2019ll work on clarifying this information!**Categorizing access issue**\n\nThe user mentioned logging into the federation site and inputting credentials, encountering an \"unknown issue.\" It looks like this is definitely an access issue, so I\u2019m categorizing it as \"Access.\" \n\nNow, I need to provide this in a proper JSON format per the schema I received. The output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This keeps it concise and accurate without any extra text, just as requested!"
