Let's get that done!**Outputting JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nThe content from the user indicates they can't access a folder, so categorizing it as \"Access\" is definitely the way to go. I need to ensure the response is a valid JSON object, specifically formatted as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s important to stick to the schema provided.
