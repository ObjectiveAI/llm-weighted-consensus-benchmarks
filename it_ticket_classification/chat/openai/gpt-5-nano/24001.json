They've mentioned the \"wallet project setup form,\" which seems related to a software development project. Given the context, this likely fits under \"Internal Project\" since it talks about coding and additional requirements. However, it could also be viewed as \"Miscellaneous\" or even \"Access\" if they're asking for access permissions. I need to weigh these options carefully to ensure accurate categorization.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m seeing mentions of \"setup form\" and \"code per attached form,\" which suggests this could be a request to develop something. The phrase \"end wallet project\" may indicate it's about completing a task related to an internal project. The \"Internal Project\" category seems most appropriate for this. While \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" don't fit, \"Miscellaneous\" could work if it\u2019s unclear. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and prepare a JSON object to reflect that.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond in the specified format, following the JSON schema provided: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}. The task is to give a JSON object with a category value matching those enums.\n\nSo, I'll just write: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I have to avoid adding any extra text since the instructions clearly state to output only the JSON. Proper capitalization is crucial, so I'll ensure it's exactly \"Internal Project\" as listed."
