It doesn't seem relevant to \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" \"Storage\" and \"Purchase\" also don't fit, so it looks like \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate category for this ticket.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nI believe \"Hardware\" is indeed the right category for this IT ticket. We need to format our response as a JSON object according to the specified schema. The required format looks something like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.\n\nIt\u2019s clear from the ticket that there are device issues and maintenance needed for the meeting rooms, confirming that \u201cHardware\u201d is the best fit. We should just stick to the JSON format without adding any extra text.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
