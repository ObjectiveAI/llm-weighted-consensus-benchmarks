The ticket mentions \"assigning access cards,\" which directly links to access control issues. I think the best category for this would be \"Access.\" While it could fit under \"HR Support,\" it clearly aligns more with the \"Access\" category based on the details like \"cards available\" and the emphasis on assigning these access cards specifically for graduates. So, I'll go with \"Access.\"**Outputting JSON Format**\n\nI need to output a JSON object for the category field based on the schema provided. The instruction specifies that I should format it like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That's straightforward! However, I see the schema indicates a \"type\":\"object\" structure. This means I should ensure my output really aligns with that. To be safe, I'll stick to the expected JSON schema format and confirm that my final response will be {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
