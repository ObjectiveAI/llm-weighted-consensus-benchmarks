The user's message about a new purchase order mentions a camera purchase, installation logging, and mandatory receipts. Given that it primarily relates to purchasing and receipts, the likely category for this ticket is \"Purchase.\" While I considered \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" neither fits. It doesn't seem related to HR support, so \"Purchase\" is the best tag for this ticket.**Evaluating Ticket Categories**\n\nI need to determine the best category for this IT ticket based on its content. There's a mention of \"Administrative rights,\" but that doesn't seem relevant here. \"Hardware\" comes to mind since it involves a camera, but the ticket focuses on purchasing and installation. The categories \"Purchase\" and \"Hardware\" are both applicable, but I can only select one. Given the emphasis on the purchase order and receipts, \"Purchase\" appears to be the most fitting category for this ticket.**Categorizing the User Request**\n\nThe user has provided a message about a new purchase order for a camera and asking to log the installation. The mention of \"mandatory receipts section\" indicates it's related to procurement. Since the main focus is on logging a purchase, I should categorize this ticket as \"Purchase.\" I need to respond with a concise JSON object format specifying the category. So, the output will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} \u2014 nice and clear!"
