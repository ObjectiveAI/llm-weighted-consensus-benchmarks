It mentions \"remove access rights,\" maternity leave, and various other terms. The core action seems to focus on removing access rights due to maternity leave, which leads me to believe it fits best under \"Access.\" It could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" if the removal pertains specifically to admin access. Overall, it seems likely to be categorized as \"Access.\"**Deciding on category classification**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize this ticket under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The user's request to \"remove access rights\" seems to pertain to maternity leave. Since it doesn't specify admin rights, I believe \"Access\" is the better choice.\n\nNow, I realize I need to output this in a JSON-like format. So, I should respond with a category object set to {\"category\":\"Access\"} and keep the explanation minimal. That should do the trick!**Providing category in JSON format**\n\nThe instruction is to provide only the category in a JSON format. I'll deliver: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text, even though the user might want more details.\n\nI'm double-checking if it could be \"Administrative rights,\" but the phrasing suggests it's about removing access for someone going on maternity leave, not specifically about admin access. So, it\u2019s best to stick with \"Access.\" I'll make sure the JSON is valid. Ready to go!"
