The user asks to categorize a lengthy string mentioning \"service now feedback reminders,\" \"survey,\" and \"feedback.\" I think it most closely aligns with \"Miscellaneous,\" since it's about feedback and processes rather than fitting into the other defined categories. I want to make sure I categorize it correctly based on the content provided!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI notice that the existing categories are quite limited and generic. This particular ticket seems to revolve around feedback reminders and surveys. It could potentially fit into \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it doesn't mention hardware, access, or storage, I lean towards \"Miscellaneous,\" as it serves as the only catch-all category. Although it could touch on \"Administrative rights,\" there's nothing explicitly mentioned about permissions. \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the best fit for this ticket!**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with the required JSON format for the category, as specified in the task. The instructions clarify that I should output a JSON object with the \"category\" field. The valid categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since I've classified the ticket as \"Miscellaneous,\" I'll ensure my response matches exactly. So, I'll provide just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Let's go ahead and do that!"
