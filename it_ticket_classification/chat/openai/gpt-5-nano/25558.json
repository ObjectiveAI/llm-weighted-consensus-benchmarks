Given the context, it seems most appropriate to classify this as \"Purchase\" since they are referring to a purchase order and also hinting at installation needs. I'll ensure to output this in the correct JSON format.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m trying to determine the best category for an IT ticket regarding a new purchase of a wireless mobile mouse. The message mentions both \"purchased wireless mobile mouse\" and \"please log installation.\" The categories I have include \"Purchase,\" which fits since it\u2019s about a new order, and \"Hardware,\" which makes sense due to the equipment involved. After considering it, I believe \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category, but I\u2019ll ensure to structure my output correctly in JSON format.**Determining JSON format for category**\n\nI'm tasked with providing a JSON-like output for the category of an IT ticket. The system message offers a clear structure for the output. I see that I need to respond with just the category as a value within a JSON object. The ticket refers to a \"new purchase\" and a \"purchased wireless mobile mouse,\" alongside a request to \"log installation.\" Considering these details, \"Purchase\" stands out as the most fitting category, and I\u2019ll format it as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Finalizing category determination**\n\nI\u2019m weighing the options for categorizing this IT ticket. While \"Hardware\" could technically apply since it\u2019s about a mouse, the ticket emphasizes a \"new purchase,\" which leads me to decide on \"Purchase\" as the primary category. There\u2019s a distinction in the IT help desk taxonomy, where \"Hardware\" usually relates to installation requests, but here, \"Purchase\" fits best. Therefore, my response will be a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
