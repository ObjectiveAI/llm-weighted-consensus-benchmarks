It seems to relate to certificate errors for meetings with external clients. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The mention of \"certificate error\" points to potential security or access issues, suggesting it might fit \"Access.\" However, if it's about admin rights related to meetings, it could also be \"Administrative rights.\" I'll have to categorize it appropriately!**Evaluating ticket categories**\n\nThe ticket discusses certificate errors for meetings with external clients that have been resolved, leaning towards a notification. I wonder if it fits \"Miscellaneous,\" but it could also be \"Internal Project\" if it involves fixing those errors. It clearly doesn\u2019t fit categories like hardware, storage, purchase, or HR. \"Administrative rights\" might relate to security rights, but \"Access\" seems like the best fit due to its connection to authentication and authorization issues for meeting logins.**Checking ticket details**\n\nThe text is a bit messy, but the main topic is focused on \"certificate errors for meetings with external clients\" that have been resolved. I think this leans towards categorizing it as \"Access.\" Alternatively, it could fit \"Internal Project\" if it were about addressing those errors, though it\u2019s not clearly a project. Since the user requested to categorize the IT ticket, I should remember to return a JSON-like category object with the appropriate category value specified.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
