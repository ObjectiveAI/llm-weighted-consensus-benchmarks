It sounds like this is mainly about access control or approval rights. The mention of configuration changes suggests they should be able to approve incoming requests now. Since the ticket highlights approval rights, I think the best category would be \"Access,\" though \"Administrative rights\" might apply too.**Categorizing ticket for access rights**\n\nThe ticket discusses trouble with approving share requests related to site configurations. It seems to primarily focus on access control and approval rights, so the most fitting category would be \"Access.\" There\u2019s also a mention of \"Administrative rights,\" but I think \"Access\" better captures the issue of approving those requests. Lastly, I'll format the category as a JSON-like object, ensuring it meets the required structure. So, the category is set as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
