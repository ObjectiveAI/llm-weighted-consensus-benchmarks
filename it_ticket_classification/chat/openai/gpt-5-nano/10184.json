However, the mention of \"steps monitor\" is a bit vague and might confuse things. I\u2019ll focus on hardware since that seems most relevant.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to make sense of the user\u2019s request: \"please provide steps monitor.\" This might refer to setup instructions for a monitor. Overall, I should categorize the ticket effectively. Based on the available list, I think \"Hardware\" fits best, especially since they're asking for a monitor. However, \"Purchase\" could also be a valid option since it\u2019s a procurement request. I\u2019ll finalize my output as a JSON-like structure: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Confirming IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket is a request for a monitor, which I see as a hardware request typically linked to purchasing or provisioning. The phrase \"provide steps monitor\" could have suggested \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but to play it safe, \"Hardware\" is definitely the best category. I need to ensure I format my response correctly as a JSON object. So, I\u2019ll finalize it as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. No extra text, just that."
