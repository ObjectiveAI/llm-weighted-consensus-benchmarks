The ticket doesn\u2019t fit clearly into hardware or access, so it could be classified as \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" while \"Storage\" might relate to mailbox storage.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIn this IT ticket triage, I see the user might be requesting creation of new email accounts related to automation, which could fit under \"Access\" since it involves granting new mailboxes. However, there's no explicit request for access. Another possibility is \"Administrative rights\" if they're seeking permission to create those emails. It could also be an \"Internal Project.\" Given the context, the best fit appears to be \"Access,\" especially since it seems related to creating access to mailboxes.**Creating JSON category output**\n\nThe instructions indicate I need to output the category as a JSON-like object, which follows a specific schema. Since the user asked to categorize the IT ticket, I believe the response should be straightforward. I should provide a JSON object with the category, specifically: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to make sure \"Access\" is capitalized correctly, as per the list. I'll keep it concise and show no extra explanation, delivering only what is required."
