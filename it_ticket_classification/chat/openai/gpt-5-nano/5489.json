However, \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could also be possibilities if I'm not certain.**Categorizing IT Ticket Response**\n\nI'm considering \"Internal Project\" for categorizing the ticket since it's about a pilot for an automated expenses process. I might also consider \"Administrative rights\" if it discusses permissions, but that's unclear.\n\nI'll format my response as a JSON-like object, following the required schema neatly. The output will look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I want to make sure that it's wrapped correctly to meet the expected format.**Finalizing Category Response**\n\nThe schema provided shows the allowed values, and I've seen in previous tasks that the response format is simply: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.\n\nGiven that the content references a \"new expenses approach\" and various administrative details, it aligns well with \"Internal Project.\" So I\u2019ll finalize the response as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I won't add any extra text, just sticking to the required format!"
