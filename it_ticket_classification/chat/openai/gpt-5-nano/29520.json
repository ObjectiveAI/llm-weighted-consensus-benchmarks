The user mentions logging a build and purchasing, which points to either \"Purchase,\" \"Hardware,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The phrases suggest it\u2019s about building a machine, so I think it\u2019s likely either a hardware-related issue or a purchase request. Since there are mentions of receipts and receiving items, my best guess is the category could be \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware\".**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket, focusing on aspects like \"Purchase\" for procurement or \"Hardware\" for tasks related to building a machine. The phrase \"build his machine\" clearly points to a hardware task, which typically falls under the \"Hardware\" category in IT ticket classifications. While \"Purchase\" could apply if it were about buying items, logging a build process suggests it's more related to hardware. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware\" and format it accordingly.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
