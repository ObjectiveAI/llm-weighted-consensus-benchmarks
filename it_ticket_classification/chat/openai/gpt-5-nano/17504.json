The categories to choose from include \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Hardware,\" and several others. \"Access\" seems most appropriate since the ticket involves compromised access. \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if scanning requires elevated permissions. Ultimately, I think \"Access\" is the best fit given the context, while \"Internal Project\" could apply if it's part of an internal hub.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI see that the ticket involves terms like \"virus,\" \"scanner,\" \"hacked,\" and \"input needed.\" Since there's no \"Security\" category available, the best option seems to be \"Access\" due to potential access compromise. I want to ensure I stick to the categories provided: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Ultimately, I\u2019ll output the category in the specified JSON format, which will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's important to keep it straightforward and provide just the necessary content."
