The user mentioned \"internal audit access cards,\" \"key holders,\" and \"report export,\" which indicates it relates to access card usage. It primarily fits into the \"Access\" category since it focuses on who has which cards and how to generate reports. There might be a minor overlap with \"Administrative rights,\" but the main focus is definitely on access management.**Finalizing Ticket Categorization**\n\nThe \"Access\" category definitely seems like the right choice for this ticket. While I considered \"Internal Project\" and \"Administrative rights,\" they aren't fitting since it's really about access cards for an internal audit. I just need to respond with the required JSON format for this ticket, keeping it simple and to the point. So, I\u2019ll provide: {\"category\":\"Access\"} as my final answer, using the exact enum value needed."
