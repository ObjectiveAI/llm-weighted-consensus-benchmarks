It includes phrases like \"new starter,\" \"return maternity leave,\" and \"administrator,\" which suggest it's related to HR, particularly onboarding. However, in an IT context, it seems to imply a need for \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" for the new starter. So, I should focus on whether it\u2019s about access provisioning due to her returning to work. It looks like it's mainly HR-related, but I might lean toward \"Access.\"**Categorizing ticket format**\n\nI have to categorize the IT ticket, and I\u2019ve got the predefined categories ready. The user's text highlights \"new starter,\" suggesting onboarding, and \"return maternity leave,\" which means access needs to be reinstated. It seems \"Access\" is the best fit for this case because it\u2019s about user account provisioning. \"Administrative rights\" might also be necessary, but Access feels more appropriate. I should create a JSON-like object that includes the relevant category based on this information.**Formatting response correctly**\n\nI need to respond with the right format for the IT ticket category. The instructions specified that I should output a JSON-like object containing just the \"category\" field. The options include \"Access\" and \"HR Support,\" and since the ticket mentions maternity leave, it could imply HR support as well. However, since it's primarily about user access provisioning, I'll go with \"Access,\" making sure there\u2019s no extra text. The final output should be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
