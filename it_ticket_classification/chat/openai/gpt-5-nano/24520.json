The ticket mentions \"PO replenishment\" and suggests it's about a wireless optical mouse, which fits into the Hardware category. It also references Purchase due to the mention of purchase orders. So, I\u2019m seeing this as primarily relating to both Hardware and Purchase. Now, I\u2019ll determine the best fit for this ticket based on the content provided.**Categorizing Ticket as JSON**\n\nThe user\u2019s request indicates they want someone to log a replenishment and process a receipt, which makes me think this falls under procurement. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase.\" The ticket\u2019s content includes \"PO replenishment\" and mentions a mouse, leading me to confirm it as a valid request for a purchase. I need to ensure I output a valid JSON object with the required category format. So, it will just be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
