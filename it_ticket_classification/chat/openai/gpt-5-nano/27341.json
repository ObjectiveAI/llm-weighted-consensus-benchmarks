The user is concerned about limiting access to specific folders due to sensitive information, mentioning \"access control lists\" and \"restrict folder.\" It seems like the appropriate categories to choose from are \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or even \"Storage.\" Given their focus on controlling permissions, I\u2019m leaning toward selecting \"Access\" as the best fit.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on the ticket that deals with restricting access to folders and managing ACLs. The likely categories are \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but since this ticket is about restricting access rather than granting admin privileges, \"Access\" seems more suitable. I need to respond with a properly formatted JSON object. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Additionally, I might consider adding a brief note explaining the categorization before outputting the JSON object as instructed.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
