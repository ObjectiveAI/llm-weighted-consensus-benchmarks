The categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I'll analyze the user\u2019s text, which mentions a purchase and installation. It seems like the most fitting category would be \"Purchase.\" I'll structure my output as a JSON-like format that includes the category key for clarity. That's my plan!**Parsing IT ticket details**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the content that mentions a \u201cnew purchase\u201d and \u201cpurchase order,\u201d possibly referring to the brand Deepcool, which is related to hardware. Key phrases indicate a focus on installation and receipts. Since it\u2019s clearly about a new purchase order and logging installation, I think the best category here is \u201cPurchase.\u201d However, it could also fit under \"Hardware\" due to the mention of a cooling device. Ultimately, \"Purchase\" seems to be the best fit for this ticket.**Finalizing category response**\n\nThe ticket seems to relate to the procurement process, so I think the right category is \u201cPurchase.\u201d The output should be in a JSON-like format detailing this categorization. The instructions specify that I should provide a JSON object with the property \u201ccategory\u201d set to the value from the enumerated list. So, my response will simply be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} without any extra commentary. Keeping it minimal and clear is the goal here!"
