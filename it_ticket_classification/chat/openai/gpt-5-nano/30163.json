The word \"pas\" might mean \"not\" in French, which adds another layer of confusion. I need to make a decision here.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket and produce a JSON with a category type from an allowed list. The content includes phrases like \"performance imports,\" \"unit costs,\" and references to an \"application developer.\" The direct categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Hardware\" don't fit. It seems like it might fall under \"Internal Project\" since it involves the application developer performing imports. I think \"Internal Project\" is the most appropriate choice regarding data import tasks.**Evaluating ticket category**\n\nI'm considering categorizing this IT ticket based on its content, which is a bit unclear. The phrase mentions \"lot tickets,\" \"perform imports,\" \"unit costs,\" and \"application developer.\" It sounds like a request for data imports potentially scheduled for Tuesday. This leads me to think that \"Internal Project\" fits best, as it relates to an internal application development task. I plan to respond with a JSON object to categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" The format will be: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
