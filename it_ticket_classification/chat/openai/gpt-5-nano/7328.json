The ticket mentions \"socket adapter\" and \"software consultant,\" which gives me some clues. I think it could fall under \"Hardware\" since a socket adapter is a device, or perhaps \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s related to a specific project. \"Miscellaneous\" might also work due to the unclear details. Overall, I need to pick the most fitting category based on these factors.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket. The user mentions wanting to \"provide a software consultant,\" which indicates a request for help, potentially for an \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" However, since it\u2019s about a hardware issue with a socket adapter, the \"Hardware\" category seems most suitable. I need to respond in the required JSON format. So, I\u2019ll output a JSON object with \"category\": \"Hardware.\" That feels like the right choice!**Formatting the response**\n\nI\u2019m ready to respond with the required format. I\u2019ll provide a JSON object that simply states, {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, adhering to their instructions closely. The guidelines specify I need to use the exact format without any extra text, so I\u2019ll keep it clean and straightforward. Just to be clear, the allowed categories include several options, but \"Hardware\" is the most fitting for the ticket. Alright, I\u2019ll go ahead with that!"
