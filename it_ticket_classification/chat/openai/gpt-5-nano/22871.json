The request involves aspects like \u201cmaternity leave\u201d and mentions specific days for cancellation. The challenge is that none of the categories seem to fit perfectly. \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d might be the closest since it relates to calendar management, but it generally refers to permissions. There isn\u2019t a clear option for scheduling changes, so this is tricky!**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT ticket. The request involves removing calendar invites, which is somewhat about administrative actions. I think \"HR Support\" could relate to maternity leave, but it mainly deals with a calendar service issue, not a specific HR request. I could go with \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Administrative rights\" might be better since it involves modifying calendars. It\u2019s tricky because there\u2019s no specific \"Calendar\" category. I\u2019ll output a JSON object with \"Administrative rights\" as the category.**Determining the best category**\n\nI think \"Administrative rights\" is the most suitable option for categorizing this IT ticket, given the context of removing calendar invites and modifying scheduling. \"Miscellaneous\" is another possibility, but I need to choose the most relevant category from the provided options. I\u2019ll craft the response as a JSON object with the category as \"Administrative rights.\" The system expects the correct structure, which I'll follow carefully to meet the requirements. So, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.**Following the response format**\n\nI need to ensure I follow the required JSON schema for categorizing the IT ticket. The safe approach is to create an object as specified, which includes \"category\" as one of the allowed values. Given that \"Administrative rights\" is the most relevant choice, I should output it concisely. In line with previous tasks, it seems right to structure my response as: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. This way, I\u2019m meeting the requirements without adding unnecessary explanations.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
