The ticket text indicates issues with accessing documents and errors related to credentials. It clearly falls into the \"Access\" category. While it mentions \"Administrative rights\", the main concern is access to the documents. So, the appropriate category is \"Access\". I'll ensure to format the output as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Formatting the Response**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize the IT Ticket, so I need to provide a simple JSON response without any extra text. I\u2019ll just focus on the \"category\" key. My response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to keep it brief and avoid any unnecessary comments. Just delivering exactly what the user needs is the goal! This will keep things clear and straightforward for the user."
