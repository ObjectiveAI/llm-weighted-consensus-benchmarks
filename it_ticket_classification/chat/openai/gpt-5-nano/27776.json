The text is quite messy, but it seems to revolve around \"engagers,\" which might refer to a specific group role. Based on the content provided, it doesn't seem to fit neatly into any specific category, but it might lean towards Administrative rights given the repetitive context. I'm considering how best to classify it based on this understanding.**Classifying IT Ticket Requests**\n\nThe requests in the ticket mention \"add engagers,\" \"include engagers,\" and \"removed,\" which suggests it might be related to permissions. This could point to an \"Access\" category, especially if they want to add users to a system or distribution list. There's also a possibility for \"Administrative rights\" if they're looking for admin capabilities. However, without clarity, it seems best to classify it under \"Access\" since it involves granting access to users. It doesn't relate to hardware or storage.**Classifying IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket phrases like \"please include engagers\" and \"added employees\" suggest a request for adding users or granting permissions. In IT ticket triage, this typically falls under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since they're asking to add engagers to something, it seems most fitting for the \"Access\" category. I need to confirm there's no better fit, like \"Internal Project,\" which doesn't apply here. So, I'll respond with the JSON-like object as {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI need to format the response correctly according to the given schema. The category should be a string with one of the allowed enumerations. Based on the ticket, the appropriate category is \"Access.\" Hence, the JSON output should strictly be {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no additional text, just the JSON object as specified. Let\u2019s finalize this!"
