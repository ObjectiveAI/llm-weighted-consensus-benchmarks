The user has provided information about monitors, specifically Mac monitors, and is inquiring about different types and brands available. It seems related to hardware, so I think \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate category. However, since the inquiry involves asking about monitor types and brands, it could also fit under \"Purchase\" due to the potential procurement aspect mentioned in the ticket.**Finalizing the IT ticket category**\n\nI see that the categories don't have a separate \"Procurement/Purchasing\"; instead, \"Purchase\" is the closest match. The ticket content focuses primarily on monitors, specifically Mac monitors, and mentions logging a request. Since the main subject is related to hardware, I conclude that the best category is \"Hardware.\" \n\nTo wrap this up, I'll respond with a JSON object that includes the category field set to \"Hardware.\" So, it will look something like {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
