They mention wanting to \"request sonar for server,\" \"plans install sonar,\" and \"benefits regards design lead.\" This sounds like it could fit under \"Internal Project\" if it relates to installing the tool, or possibly \"Purchase\" if they want a license. If I can't clarify, \"Miscellaneous\" might be a safe pick.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI want to categorize this IT ticket, and I'm thinking the best options are \"Internal Project,\" \"Purchase,\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" The user asked me to categorize it, and since it mentions planning and installing Sonar, the likely choice is \"Internal Project.\" However, it could also imply a \"Purchase\" for a Sonar license. This ticket includes a lot of context about benefits and roles, so ultimately, I'll output the appropriate JSON category field based on that assessment.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nThe output I need to provide is just a JSON object with the category, based on the user\u2019s request to categorize this IT Ticket. I\u2019m following a schema that specifies allowed categories. Given the context, I want to choose \"Internal Project\" since it's about implementing Sonar on a server for internal benefits. It doesn't fit the other categories like hardware, HR, or purchase since there's no mention of costs. So, I'll produce the following: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
