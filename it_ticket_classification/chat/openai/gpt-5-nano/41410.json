Given this context, it looks appropriate to categorize it under \"HR Support,\" as it relates to managing personnel changes.**Figuring out ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket, which might relate to changing a line manager\u2014likely a workflow error in an IT application. This doesn't seem like a hardware issue, but it could fit under access or administrative rights. The mention of \"Oracle\" suggests it's part of an HR system. \n\nSince \"line manager\" ties into HR, it makes sense to categorize this ticket as \"HR Support,\" which is available in the options. So, that's probably the best choice!**Choosing the right category**\n\nI'm looking at the provided categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Although HR Support is listed, the ticket seems more focused on an IT system error. Given that the user brings up \"line manager,\" there could be an HR system involved.\n\n\"Access\" might apply to login or permission errors, while \"Administrative Rights\" doesn\u2019t quite fit this context. I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate category, as it relates to the application error mentioned. It could also be linked to an internal project in the system.**Deciding on category choice**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the available categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Since the user's ticket relates to changing a line manager, it suggests a connection to an HR system, possibly involving Oracle. \n\nIf I had to choose, \"Access\" seems fitting for addressing a submission error. The user mentions an \"error occurred when tried to submit change line,\" which likely indicates permission or workflow issues. Given the context, I'll categorize this as \"Access,\" as it pertains to an error in accessing or submitting a change in the application.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
