The user message is about modifying recurrent tasks in Snow, likely referring to ServiceNow. Since it's specifically requesting modifications to recurrent tasks, it seems the best fit might be \"Miscellaneous\" since that doesn't quite fit in any other category. None of the options specifically cover ITSM or Internal Projects.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm narrowing down the category for the IT ticket and considering \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the request is to modify recurrent tasks in Snow, which is associated with ServiceNow and relates to internal IT projects, \"Internal Project\" feels like the right fit. It's not about hardware, HR, or any of the other categories. Now, I need to format my response as a JSON object, with \"category\" set to \"Internal Project.\"**Crafting the JSON response**\n\nI'm looking at the instructions for formatting my response, and it indicates that I should output a JSON object with a category property. I considered that \"Internal Project\" is the best fit for this request about modifying recurring Snow tasks, which relates to internal IT project maintenance. While \"Miscellaneous\" could also work, sticking with \"Internal Project\" seems most appropriate. So, I\u2019ll finalize the answer as a clean JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That\u2019s all I need!"
