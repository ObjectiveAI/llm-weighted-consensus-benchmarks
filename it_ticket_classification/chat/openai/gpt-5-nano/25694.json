Phrases like \"access to new Wednesday,\" \"allow write location,\" and \"reports\" suggest it's about gaining access to view certain documents or forms. Given the context, I think the best category would be \"Access,\" while \"Administrative rights\" could also fit since it sounds like they might need elevated permissions. I'll form a JSON object with the selected category.**Evaluating ticket access request**\n\nThe user seems to be asking for access to a reporting system, mentioning terms like \"view,\" \"write,\" \"location,\" and \"reports.\" It sounds like they need permission to both view and possibly write reports, but \"Administrative rights\" would only apply if they need extra privileges. The phrase \"new Wednesday November pm\" might indicate a scheduling request. I think the best category for this ticket would be \"Access,\" since it primarily concerns basic access rights.**Determining access category**\n\nI'm thinking that the request might actually be more about \"Administrative rights\" since there's a mention of writing at a specific location. However, it seems the user is primarily asking for access and permissions. They mention needing \"access to new,\" which hints at needing basic write permissions rather than administrative privileges. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Access\" and output it in the required JSON format without any extra text. Let's keep it simple! \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
