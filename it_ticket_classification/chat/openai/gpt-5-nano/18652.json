The predefined categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the content focuses on grades and surveys, it seems to fit best under \"Miscellaneous,\" but I\u2019ll consider the context carefully to ensure it\u2019s correctly categorized.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m weighing several category options for this IT ticket, which is centered around a survey system. It could fit \"Administrative rights\" if it involves users modifying grades, but it also relates to removing grades assigned on specific days. \u201cInternal Project\u201d might work since it\u2019s project-specific. \"Miscellaneous\" could apply since it's a general request. There are mentions of fairness in reporting results, leading me to consider \"Access\" too if it's about modifying or deleting responses. I\u2019m carefully considering all these angles!**Parsing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m working to categorize this IT ticket. The title suggests that the user wants to delete grades from specific days, and they express concerns about fairness in how surveys are handled. It looks like they\u2019re referring to a \u201cThames issue,\u201d which could relate to a project or a specific system, possibly in the London area. The focus seems to be on issues related to self-rating in surveys and maintaining accurate statistics. I'm gathering all the details to decide on the best category!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants to adjust or delete grades, likely to maintain data integrity within the survey system. I see that \"Internal Project\" focuses on project work, while \"Administrative rights\" relates specifically to permissions for editing or deleting grades. The user's mentions about being \"logged under name\" hint at access issues too. Ultimately, the context points to \"Administrative rights\" as the most relevant category since they seek permission to fix fairness in their grades. However, I\u2019ll keep \"Miscellaneous\" in mind if needed!**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object to categorize the IT ticket accurately. The instruction specifies the format as {\"category\":\"...\"} and the chosen category is \"Administrative rights.\" I must be careful to match capitalization exactly, noting that \"Administrative rights\" has a capital 'A' and a lowercase 'r.' So, I'll format the output simply as {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} without any extra commentary. The user has asked for the category, so I'll keep it straightforward."
