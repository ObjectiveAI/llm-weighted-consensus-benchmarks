The best categories might be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" as they align with granting manager privileges. I think \u201cAccess\u201d is a fitting choice for this situation.**Providing JSON category**\n\nIt looks like the user is requesting to assign a manager role for the Oracle system, which implies they need \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll set \"Administrative rights\" as the category. I need to provide a JSON object that matches the required format. The output must include the specific category property typed as a string, so I\u2019ll respond with the JSON: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. It\u2019s important that I follow this format to ensure the app receives the correct information.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
