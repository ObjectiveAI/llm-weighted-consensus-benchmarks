It's about a shared mailbox issue where emails sent from the shared mailbox aren't appearing in the Sent folder. Since this is related to email permissions and access rather than hardware, storage, purchase, or internal projects, I think it fits best in either the \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" category. It\u2019s interesting how specific user issues can guide the categorization!**Configuring shared mailbox behavior**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this issue related to the behavior of shared mailboxes and sent items. It could fit under \"Access\" since it relates to mailbox permissions. The user wants sent items to go to the shared mailbox's Sent folder instead of their personal folder. While \"Administrative rights\" might also be relevant, there\u2019s no specific \"Email\" category to choose from, so \"Access\" seems like the best fit. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object indicating the category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
