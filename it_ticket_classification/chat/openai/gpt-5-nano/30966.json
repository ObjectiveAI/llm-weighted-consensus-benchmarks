The input mentions a \"defect tv adapter\" multiple times and refers to a meeting room setup. Given the nature of the issue, it seems to fit under the \"Hardware\" category. \n\nI'll format the response as a JSON object based on the category schema provided. This will ensure clear communication of the chosen category for the ticket. I\u2019ll do that right away!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI see the content focuses on a \"defect tv adapter\" in a meeting room, which points to a hardware issue. It's likely causing problems with presentations. I initially considered \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" but those don\u2019t fit here as clearly.\n\nThus, categorizing it as \"Hardware\" seems right. I'll ensure the output matches the required JSON format accurately. The final output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Finalizing category output**\n\nI need to make sure the spacing and format are correct for the output. The schema lists the category value as \"Hardware,\" and I\u2019m confirming based on the content mentioning a \"defect tv adapter\" in the meeting room. The request to \"change tv adapter\" indicates it's a hardware issue.\n\nSo, yes, I'm confident this falls under \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll finalize the answer as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
