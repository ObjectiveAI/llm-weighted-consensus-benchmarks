That\u2019s the right classification based on the ticket content!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user seems to need a monitor or an adapter, which raises some questions about categorization. While \"Purchase\" might feel relevant since they are requesting something, the phrases like \"adapter for two monitors\" clearly point to hardware. The mention of \"want his monitor\" implies someone might want their monitor back, likely due to a colleague leaving. Ultimately, the appropriate category for this IT ticket would be \"Hardware.\" So, I'll output the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
