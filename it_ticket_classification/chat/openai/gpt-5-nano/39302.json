They're mentioning an \"oracle error\" and issues while trying to submit something, which could indicate a problem with the system. They\u2019re also referring to \"manage cards,\" which suggests an issue with functionality. Given that they mentioned \"browsers loading infrastructure manager,\" this could relate to the \"Access\" category, as it's about accessing a tool. I'll go ahead and categorize this as \"Access.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt looks like the issue relates to software (Infrastructure Manager) and browser compatibility. I need to decide on the best category from broad options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given that they're experiencing an error with managing cards, \"Access\" seems fitting if it\u2019s about system login. However, it could also fall under \"Miscellaneous\" for general IT issues since they mentioned the tool without specifics. I\u2019ll lean toward categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous.\"**Deciding ticket category**\n\nThe user's ticket mentions a general error related to submitting something for \"ST July,\" which might relate to an internal project. There's also mention of managing cards, suggesting it could involve \"Access\" if it requires permissions. I need to follow the instructions to categorize this ticket in the correct JSON format. Given the lack of specifics on access rights, I'll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" since it covers general IT issues. So, the output will be: {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}.**Analyzing ticket details**\n\nThe ticket indicates an \"oracle error,\" suggesting a problem with the database when submitting something for \"ST July,\" possibly related to scheduling. The user mentions that each time they click \"manage cards,\" they encounter an error, likely connected to the Infrastructure Manager feature. They\u2019ve tried using Internet Explorer, but their wording is a bit unclear. Overall, this appears to be a software issue with the application rather than anything related to hardware, storage, or HR.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
