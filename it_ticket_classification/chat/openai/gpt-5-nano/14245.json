It mentions things like \"new purchase\" and \"PO,\" indicating it could fit under \"Purchase,\" since it seems relevant. However, there are also terms like \"hub port off switch\" which could suggest it relates to hardware, too. I should output a structured JSON-like object with the category key indicating either \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" However, I'm leaning more toward \"Purchase.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s request is about logging allocations and mandatory receipts, which indicates a purchase process. It seems to fit best under the \"Purchase\" category, but \"Hardware\" might also apply. Since the text clearly mentions \"new purchase,\" \"PO,\" and \"receipts,\" I'll categorize it as \"Purchase.\" So, I need to respond with a simple JSON object that states this clearly without additional commentary. I'll make sure the format is as required: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
