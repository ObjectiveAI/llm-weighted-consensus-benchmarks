It seems unlikely that \"Administrative rights\" would fit, but \"Access\" might work if it concerns network resource access. \"Hardware\" could apply if devices need addresses, while \"Internal Project\" could be relevant since \"Orion\" implies a project. Overall, it seems connected to network address configuration.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how to categorize the IT ticket regarding \"addresses needed static addresses work orion.\" It could fall under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\", focusing on network addresses. If it's part of a project named \"Orion,\" then \"Internal Project\" might be appropriate. However, since this discussion centers on network configuration tasks and not admin rights, I lean towards \"Internal Project.\" It seems like the best fit because the actual need is for static IP addresses rather than user access.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI'm considering categorizing the IT ticket about \"static addresses\" for the \"Orion\" project. While \"Miscellaneous\" is an option if I can't decide, I want to pick the best fit. \"Hardware\" could apply if it's about devices needing static IPs, but that's not guaranteed. \"Access\" could suggest user control, yet that doesn't fit here since it\u2019s about network addressing. Given the context, \"Internal Project\" makes the most sense, indicating a specific project requirement. I'll proceed with that as the category."
