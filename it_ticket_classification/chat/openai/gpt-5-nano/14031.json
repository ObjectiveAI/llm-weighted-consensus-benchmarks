I need to choose from categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. Given the ticket details, it seems most relevant to classify this under Purchase, since it talks about a new purchase and related procurement tasks. I'll proceed with that classification!**Categorizing ticket request**\n\nThe user message is a bit jumbled but mentions a \"new purchase,\" \"PO\" for purchase orders, and \"Deep Cool,\" which is a brand for PC cases. I need to categorize it, and it seems related to hardware since it's about purchasing hardware and tracking receipts. The most appropriate categories appear to be either \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" If I have to choose, I'll go with \"Purchase\" since it explicitly mentions purchase orders and allocations, which fits best.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize the IT ticket. The typical categories include Purchase for procurement and Hardware for actual hardware assets. Since this ticket deals with POs and receipts, it aligns best with the \"Purchase\" category. There's also mention of \"log allocation,\" which hints at asset management, but that's not on the list. I'll respond with a JSON object indicating the category as \"Purchase,\" ensuring it fits the required format. \n\nHere's the answer: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
