The fragment suggests this ticket likely falls under onboarding, so the most fitting category seems to be \"HR Support.\" I'll format it as a JSON object, specifying the category appropriately.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nWhen it comes to categorizing an IT ticket for onboarding, there are several relevant categories to consider. The fragment mentions \"new starter,\" suggesting a focus on user access or possibly administrative rights. \"Access\" makes the most sense here since it involves granting user permissions. \"Administrative rights\" could also apply if elevated permissions are needed. Given that this ticket pertains to onboarding, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Preparing IT ticket response**\n\nThe prompt requires me to provide a JSON object that includes a \"category\" string. In this case, I\u2019ll format my output as follows: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I don't need to add any extra commentary unless the user specifically asks for more details. Since the user simply requested to categorize the IT ticket, I\u2019ll stick to delivering that response efficiently."
