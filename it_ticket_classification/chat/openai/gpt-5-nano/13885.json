They\u2019re asking for an additional monitor, which might suggest a need for hardware procurement as well. I should classify this ticket under \"Hardware,\" but I\u2019m considering \"Purchase\" if it's focused on acquiring the additional monitor.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket based on the details provided, like \"find floor\" suggesting a location and \"attaching file untitled ex seat\" hinting at an attachment. My main focus is on the references to hardware, such as monitors and towers, which makes \"Hardware\" the appropriate category. Since \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" aren\u2019t relevant here, I\u2019m settling on \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll craft a concise JSON response for the output."
