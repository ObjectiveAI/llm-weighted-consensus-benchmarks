I must ensure to produce the correct JSON format with the selected category.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing this IT ticket, which mentions received items and a docking station adapter. It seems related to hardware procurement and installation. The user\u2019s phrases like \"new delivery\" and \"please log\" indicate they want to document the receipt of this hardware. \n\nThe categories available are Hardware and Purchase. Since it primarily concerns new hardware, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" I must ensure the JSON format matches the required structure for submission. So I'll create the output as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
