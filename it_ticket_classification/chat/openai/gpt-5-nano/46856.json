The user's request to update permissions emphasizes the administrative aspect. Thus, I\u2019ll categorize it based on the need for higher-level rights related to domain access.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket is primarily about user access issues, so it fits better under the general \"Access\" category instead of \"Administrative rights,\" since it\u2019s not specifically about admin-level permissions. I need to respond in the required format, which is a JSON object with the category field. It\u2019s important to stick to the prompt and provide just the JSON object for clarity. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra explanation."
