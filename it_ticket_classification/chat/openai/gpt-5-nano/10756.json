It mentions things like \"new project code\" and \"client engagement.\" Based on the categories available, it seems like \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. However, there are also mentions of attached forms, which could imply \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" I think \"Internal Project\" is likely the right choice here!**Creating JSON for ticket**\n\nThe text suggests we're dealing with a project, specifically mentioning \"forms attached,\" which points towards categorizing it as an \"Internal Project.\" I need to format my response as a JSON object that matches the expected schema. The correct output should clearly state: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll stick to quoting exactly, avoiding any extra words. It seems this category aligns best with the mention of project codes and client engagement, so \"Internal Project\" it is!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
