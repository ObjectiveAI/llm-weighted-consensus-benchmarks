There are various categories available like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. Given the context, it seems like this issue pertains to access or possibly a project-related problem. I'll have to analyze it closely to determine the most appropriate category to assign.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nThe user's message includes phrases like \"locked project field\" and \"notification failure,\" which suggest it involves access issues. It seems like there's a problem with permissions, specifically regarding fields in a system. The available categories are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context of access to a drop-down and locked fields, I think \"Access\" fits best. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant, providing a more specific category. I need to decide which suits the ticket best.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nThe mention of a \"locked field\" suggests there are permission restrictions, which makes \"Administrative rights\" a suitable category. However, we also have the option of \"Access.\" I need to choose between these two based on the user's input. The IT ticket involves terms like \"mandatory field locked empty,\" hinting at permissions as well. I should respond with a JSON formatted object based on the schema provided, either as {\"category\": \"Access\"} or {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}. It's a matter of deciding which is more fitting!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning toward categorizing this ticket as \"Access\" since it deals with locked fields. Although \"Administrative rights\" might fit because it relates to field settings, the message focuses more on access issues rather than granting permissions. The user has mentioned multiple problems, including a \"pre-survey notification failure.\" Since the ticket has several issues, \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option, but it still falls under \"Access.\" I will choose \"Access\" for the primary concern about the locked field.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
