I'm not quite sure if \"AMP\" refers to \"Asset Management Program,\" \"Amplify,\" or \"Active Monitoring Program.\" Given the confusion, I need to choose one of the categories available: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It's a bit tricky!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket discusses \"license expiration,\" \"replacement,\" and \"install AMP,\" which might suggest it fits neatly under \"Purchase,\" given the focus on licensing and renewal. It could also be \"Administrative rights\" if installing AMP requires special permissions. However, since the ticket centers around license-related terms, \"Purchase\" seems like the right choice. I\u2019ll output the category as a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}, since it appears to capture the essence of the request clearly.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
