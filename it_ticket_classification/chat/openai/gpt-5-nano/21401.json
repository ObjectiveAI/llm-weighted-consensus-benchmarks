The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. That said, this ticket is focused on access control and ownership. So, \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" seem like the best fits for this situation. I\u2019ll go with \u201cAccess\u201d since it directly relates to ownership changes.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI see that the text mentions terms like \"add owner to development,\" \"owner added,\" and \"additional owner.\" This seems related to project ownership and permissions. I need to categorize it as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since there's a specific category for \"Administrative rights,\" that fits perfectly! \n\nI should respond with a JSON object as per the required format: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}, ensuring I only include the necessary text without any extra comments."
