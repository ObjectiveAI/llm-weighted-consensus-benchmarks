I\u2019m weighing my options here!**Finalizing category response**\n\nSince \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" and others don\u2019t fit, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing the ticket as \"Miscellaneous.\" The user requested to categorize the IT ticket, and I should respond with a clear JSON format. So, that would be {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}, which matches the provided schema. I want to ensure that's the only content in my response, keeping it clean and concise. Adding a brief justification could help clarify my reasoning, but it seems the JSON format is what they're looking for!"
