Given the context, it seems to best fit under the \"Access\" category since it relates to account accessibility and setup problems.**Categorizing Jabber request**\n\nJabber is a communications tool, and there's a request to deactivate a Jabber account on Thursday PM due to issues related to migration. The mention of \"jabber has disabled\" and \"extension setup disable jabber\" indicates it's about user account management. I think the best category for this would be \"Access\" since it's all about enabling and disabling accounts. I could consider \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Access\" feels most on point. So, I'll respond with:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
