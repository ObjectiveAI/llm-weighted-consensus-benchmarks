The phrases \"returned maternity leave\" and \"thank officer\" suggest it may relate to access after leave. From the available categories, \"Access\" seems to fit best due to the mention of \"access,\" along with the context of returning to work. I'll categorize this ticket as an Access request.**Classifying IT ticket request**\n\nThe user provided a confusing message that seems to request access to the 4th floor, possibly for someone returning from maternity leave. In this IT context, it looks like a request for access control. While it could touch on \"HR Support\" due to the maternity leave mention, this request is primarily about restoring or granting access. So, I think the best category here is \"Access,\" instead of \"Administrative Rights,\" since that typically relates to system privileges.**Creating JSON for IT ticket**\n\nThe user's message seems to indicate that someone is back from maternity leave and needs access. This suggests the category should be \"Access.\" Following the required format, I need to produce a JSON object that reflects this correctly. Specifically, it should look like: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nHowever, since the guidelines mention a structure involving \"type\":\"object\" and \"properties,\" I\u2019ll ensure my JSON matches that schema. In the end, I\u2019ll output the correct JSON format with the category included as specified.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
