The ticket mentions various tasks like adding new folders, uploading documents, and change requests. It looks like the content relates to folders and possibly the view ribbon in a software interface. Given the focus on creating folders and uploading docs, it might best fit under \"Storage\" or \"Access.\" There\u2019s also a hint of scheduling, since it mentions \"Thursday December.\"**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s request seems to involve folder creation, uploading documents, and handling change requests. The mention of \"Thursday December PM\" could hint at folder naming. I\u2019m considering categorizing this under \"Storage\" due to the focus on folder and document handling, or possibly \"Administrative Rights\" if creating folders requires special access. There\u2019s also the chance it pertains to \"Internal Project\" if it relates to a specific initiative, but I lean toward \"Storage\" as the best fit.**Determining ticket categorization**\n\nThe user requested help with creating folders, which feels like an administrative task, suggesting \"Administrative Rights\" may be fitting since permissions could be needed. However, based on the ticket content, categorizing it as \"Storage\" makes sense since it focuses on folders and documents. There\u2019s also a chance it\u2019s related to \"Internal Project\" due to mentions of change requests and specific dates. The reference to the \"View Ribbon\" hints at a possible software UI context. So, balancing these options is crucial!**Categorizing ticket in JSON format**\n\nThe user mentioned \"view ribbon,\" linking to editing folder structures in Office apps, which relates to storage tasks like uploading documents. Considering this, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Storage,\" as the main focus is on folders and documents. The ticket doesn\u2019t reference hardware, HR, or purchases, nor does it mention access explicitly. Therefore, I\u2019ll prepare a minimal JSON response with the \"Storage\" category to fit the required format. Here it is:  \n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Storage\"}}{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
