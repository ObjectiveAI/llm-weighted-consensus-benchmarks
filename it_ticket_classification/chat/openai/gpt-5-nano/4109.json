I\u2019m leaning towards \u201cPurchase\u201d as it relates to the ticket's content about costs and invoices.**Determining the category**\n\nIt seems like \u201cPurchase\u201d is the best fit since the ticket is about purchase invoices, cost categories, posting, and cost recovery codes. The mention of \"PO raised\" confirms that it relates to a purchase order. I need to craft a JSON-like object with the category set to \"Purchase.\" The format specifies that I should structure it as: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}` while keeping in mind the overall schema from the instructions. The user just wants the categorization, so I\u2019ll focus on delivering that clearly.**Clarifying output format**\n\nI need to ensure my response matches the platform's requirements, as it indicates I should provide a JSON object that aligns with their schema. The schema shows the fields like type and properties, but my actual output should reflect the data instance: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. While the instruction emphasizes parsing the output, it seems I should still stick with presenting the category value in the proper JSON format to meet their expectations. It's important to keep it simple!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
