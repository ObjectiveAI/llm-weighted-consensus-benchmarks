The ticket mentions removing addresses and seems related to disabled ad accounts. This suggests it could fall under \"Access\" since it's about Active Directory accounts. However, if it's about changing these accounts, it might also fit into \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll need to decide based on the content to find the best category for this ticket.**Finalizing category output**\n\nThe user's request includes mentioning \"addresses corresponding ad accounts disabled,\" which makes me think they want to disable certain Active Directory accounts related to those addresses. Given this, categorizing it under \"Access\" seems fitting since it relates to account permissions and access issues. I need to respond strictly in the required JSON format without any extra commentary. So, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"} to match the necessary schema."
