The phrase \"password reset request\" suggests it falls under \"Access.\" The mention of \"unlock currently locked\" and \"administrative rights\" adds to that, but there's also concern about \"virus attachments\" and potential security issues. However, since the categories are limited, I'll focus on the primary purpose of the request, which clearly points towards the \"Access\" category for the password reset.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing the ticket as \"Access\" since it's about resetting a password and unlocking an account\u2014clear access issues. So, I need to respond with a JSON format. The expected structure is clear, with the category falling into the allowed options. I'll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I briefly considered \"Internal Project\" due to mentions of viruses, but it really is all about access here. I'll keep it concise\u2014no extra explanations needed unless requested!"
