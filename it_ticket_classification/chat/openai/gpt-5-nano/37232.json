The categories I can choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given their mention of needing help with submitting a sheet, it seems like an IT issue. The most appropriate category might be \"Access\" since it's related to submitting something online. I'll format this in a JSON object.**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nI need to identify the right category for the IT ticket about submitting a form or spreadsheet. If the issue is related to permissions, \"Access\" could fit, while \"Administrative rights\" might work if they're having trouble due to lack of admin access. Without more context, \"Miscellaneous\" seems a safe choice since it covers general IT issues. I want to be careful to choose the most suitable category and format it in the required JSON object.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
