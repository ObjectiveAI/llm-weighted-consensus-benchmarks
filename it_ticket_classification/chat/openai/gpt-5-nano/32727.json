The ticket content mentions onboarding a new starter in New Jersey, discussing credentials, a starter form, equipment allocation, and a mobile phone. Based on this information, it seems the most fitting categories are likely \"Access,\" \"Hardware,\" or possibly \"Administrative rights\" due to the focus on user access credentials and equipment.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket seems focused on onboarding a new starter, mentioning badges, credentials, access, and provisioning equipment. The strongest category appears to be \"Access,\" as it's primarily about credentials and system access. While \"Administrative rights\" is related, it\u2019s not explicitly requested. The content includes tasks like preparing credentials and allocating devices. Following the requirement to respond in a JSON format reflecting the category, I'll confirm: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's finalize that!"
