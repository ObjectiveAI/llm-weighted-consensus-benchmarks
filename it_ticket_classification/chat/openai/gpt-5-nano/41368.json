The system message prompts me to categorize it, and I have a specific category schema to follow. There\u2019s a list of categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others that I could choose from. It sounds like the user is dealing with a login issue after a password change, which seems to fall under \"Access.\" So, I'll classify the ticket accordingly.**Interpreting IT Ticket Issues**\n\nIt seems the user is having trouble logging into ServiceNow after changing their password. The error message indicates \"name or password invalid,\" yet they can log in elsewhere with the same password. The message was a bit jumbled, but the main idea is clear: they\u2019re experiencing login issues related to their password. Given this context, it would be reasonable to categorize this ticket under \"Access.\" Let\u2019s go with that for clarity!**Categorizing IT Ticket Correctly**\n\nIt looks like this is an access issue related to authentication. I should categorize it as \"Access\" because the problem involves a password change, not \"Administrative rights\" unless specifically mentioned. The response needs to be a plain JSON format according to the schema provided. The final output should strictly contain the category without any additional text. So, I\u2019ll format it as {\"category\":\"Access\"} to keep it clear and straightforward!"
