The request is about not being able to submit a timecard, which seems to relate to HR or access permissions. \n\nThis ticket might fit under \"HR Support,\" since timecard submission is typically connected to HR functions. However, it could also be an access issue. After considering the available categories, \"HR Support\" appears to be the best fit since it directly addresses the timecard submission problem.**Classifying ticket category**\n\nThe user mentioned they're unable to submit a timecard, which might be due to issues like missing permissions. The mention of \"administrative rights\" fits here, but they also refer to \"review senior tester,\" indicating potential roles. \n\nHowever, the main problem is the timecard submission failure. Between \"HR Support\" and \"Access,\" the timecard issue is HR-related. I think \"HR Support\" is the better category since it's clearly about payroll functionality. Hence, I\u2019ll classify it as:\n\ncategory: \"HR Support\" \n\nI need to format this as a JSON object now.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
