Phrases like \"approver,\" \"two approvers,\" and \"recent change\" stand out, pointing towards a possible issue with an approvals workflow or administrative rights. It seems like the user is addressing some kind of approval process amidst upcoming holidays. I should determine the best-fitting category from the list: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing the user's message, focusing on key phrases like \"approver,\" \"members approved once by myself,\" and references to \"upcoming holiday in March.\" This suggests a ticket related to access approvals or administrative rights, particularly regarding who can grant approvals. The options are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" with \"Access\" being broader for permissions, while \"Administrative rights\" is more specific. Given the mention of simplifying the approval process, it seems \"Administrative rights\" might be the most fitting category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
