I think it could be a change request or deployment issue, focused on testing environments. \n\nI might categorize it as \"Internal Project\" since it's about deployment and infrastructure changes. However, if it's more about access control for network ports, \"Access\" could be relevant too. But it seems \"Internal Project\" is the best fit.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
