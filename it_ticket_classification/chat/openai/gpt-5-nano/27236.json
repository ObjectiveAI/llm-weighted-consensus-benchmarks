It seems they want to access a library for collaboration and information sharing. To categorize this IT ticket, I need to choose from the available options, which include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I think \"Access\" might fit best.**Defining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user's request includes terms like \"access request,\" \"library,\" and \"collaboration,\" with access being the central focus. I need to decide between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" but since they're primarily asking for access to a library, it seems clear that \"Access\" is appropriate. The response should be in a JSON format, specifically: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to keep it simple and avoid any extra text!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
