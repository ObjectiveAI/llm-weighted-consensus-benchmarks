I'll prepare a JSON object to output the appropriate category field.**Interpreting the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket content mentions \"additional monitor\" several times, along with requests for functionality across \"multiple physical machines\" and connecting \"different environments\" urgently. It seems the user is asking for more monitors to be ordered to meet specific requirements and expects them to function properly. Given the focus on procurement, I think it best fits within the \"Purchase\" category, although it is also hardware-related. So, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Purchase\" for the most accurate classification.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI see that we have a \"Purchase\" category specifically for procurement tasks. In this ticket, the user mentions \"order\" and \"additional monitor\" along with a sense of urgency and involvement from a design lead. This suggests it's indeed an internal request for procuring an additional monitor. While it\u2019s also related to hardware because of the monitor aspect, I believe \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category here since it aligns with the request for acquisition.**Deciding on the category**\n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing this ticket as \"Hardware\" because it's primarily about a physical monitor. The mention of \"multiple physical machines\" also suggests potential hardware compatibility issues. While \"Purchase\" could also fit, since the ticket emphasizes acquiring an additional monitor based on requirements, it\u2019s more accurate to label it as hardware. Since there's no mention of budget or specific procurement details, I'll go ahead and prepare the final output as a JSON object that states:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"} \n\nIt seems the user just needs the category in this case."
