They mention \"disable on Windows Hello\" and reference \"keyboard shortcuts,\" which suggests they're asking about its functionality. The core issue seems to be about disabling Windows Hello sign-in. It's likely we'll categorize it under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I need to interpret their request accurately to choose the right category based on their needs.**Categorizing login method**\n\nThis ticket is about disabling Windows Hello, which relates to access control. The options include categories like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since disabling Windows Hello is primarily an access or identity management task, it's likely best categorized as \"Access.\" The user seems to be asking for help on how to disable it, without any indication it involves hardware. I think I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and provide a brief justification in a JSON-like format for clarity.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
