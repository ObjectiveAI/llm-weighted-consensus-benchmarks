The message indicates there was wrong notification content that confused the user, as it referenced a different book than requested. It seems to be tied to an IT issue, likely involving the library system's notification content. I need to pick from the provided categories, and while \"Software\" isn't an option, this issue appears to fit under \"Miscellaneous.\"**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for this IT ticket. It could fall under \"Miscellaneous\" since it isn\u2019t a typical issue listed like \"Hardware\" or \"Access.\" The problem appears to be a software bug related to wrong notification content from the library system. While \"Internal Project\" could fit due to the mention of \"design lead\" and \"batch approval,\" I think \"Miscellaneous\" is still the most appropriate choice here. I\u2019ll prepare to output a JSON response with the chosen category.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the best category for this IT ticket. The expected format is clear: I should respond with a JSON object. While \"Internal Project\" could be more specific given the context of the library system, \"Miscellaneous\" still fits better since many guidelines suggest classifying issues that don't fall under standard hardware or software categories as such. Since \"Software\" isn't an option, it seems best to stick with \"Miscellaneous.\" So I\u2019ll prepare the concise JSON response: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
