The ticket talks about adding different task types in a project management system and mentions urgency, client details, and project specifics. This suggests it could fit under \"Internal Project\" because it's about managing tasks internally. \"Administrative rights\" might be too specific, as it mainly deals with permissions. Overall, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best choice for this request.**Deciding on the category format**\n\nI see that the user\u2019s request involves categorizing an internal project change, specifically for a project management system task type addition. It fits perfectly under \"Internal Project.\" I need to provide a response in a specific JSON format, which includes detailing the category. It looks like I should output exactly as requested: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. I\u2019m ensuring the structure aligns with the provided specifications to keep everything clear and accurate for the user.**Clarifying the JSON response**\n\nI'm considering the instructions, which indicate that the response needs to be in a JSON format for a category. Typically, I\u2019d provide the category simply as `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. However, they mentioned a full schema wrapper, which makes me think they might want more structure. Still, since they specifically asked for just the category, I\u2019ll stick with that, ensuring a concise response with no extra commentary: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`."
