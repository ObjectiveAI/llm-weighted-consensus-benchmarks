The message includes phrases like \"not conf room belgrade\" and mentions a device showing \"signing.\" It may suggest the room is not properly configured or operational. I\u2019ll interpret this as a request related to hardware issues, particularly with the conference room display. Considering the context, \"Hardware\" seems to be the most fitting category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing an IT ticket regarding a device in a conference room displaying \"signing.\" This suggests the device may not be functioning or the room isn't properly configured. I think the best category for this would be \"Hardware\" since it deals with a device issue. Although \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" might be relevant if it's about room access, the operational display points to hardware. I'll plan to respond with a JSON object like {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Interpreting IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m trying to interpret the user's input about a conference room device in Belgrade that shows \"signing.\" It seems to indicate that the display might be stuck or malfunctioning, possibly signaling that it's not configured properly. However, since the user only wants a category classification, \"Hardware\" feels like the right choice for this device issue. While \"Access\" could fit if it were about user login, it isn't. I'll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
