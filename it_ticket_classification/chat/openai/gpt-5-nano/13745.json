The user\u2019s request mentions adding or removing members, which could imply access rights related to a project. The terms \"com pm\" might refer to \u201ccommunity project management\u201d or \u201cCommunications PM.\u201d Since this seems to focus on member management and access, the most fitting categories could be \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" I need to choose the best one!**Choosing category for IT ticket**\n\nThe mention of \"add members\" and \"remove\" definitely points toward user management and access control. While \"Administrative rights\" seems relevant, I think \"Access\" is a better fit since it specifically addresses user access management. The input clearly discusses modifying membership for something referred to as \"com pm,\" which appears to be a group or project. I'll categorize it as \"Access\"\u2014it seems best for this situation. I should respond with something like: {\"category\": \"Access\"}.**Responding with category**\n\nI\u2019m ready to categorize the IT ticket. The allowed categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others, and I\u2019ve decided on \"Access.\" So, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI need to make sure it's a valid JSON object since the instructions say the response should have a \"category\" property. I\u2019ll keep it simple and just present that JSON without any extra text. Let\u2019s go ahead and answer!"
