                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket regarding a new starter. The user provided text mentions a \"starter form,\" \"joining February,\" and staff locations. It seems to center around onboarding and access needs, so it could fit either the HR Support or Access categories. Since onboarding generally requires IT access for account creation and permissions, I believe \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category for this ticket.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nIt looks like the ticket refers to a new project manager and onboarding details. I\u2019m parsing phrases like \"new starter PM starter form\" and \"joining February,\" which might imply requests for access to storage staff locations. That could suggest the Storage category, but it feels off. I should focus on onboarding tasks, which typically include setting up user accounts and email\u2014leaning toward the Access category for IT. Since I need to format the output as a JSON object, I\u2019ll ensure it reflects the category choice accurately.**Choosing the right category**\n\nThe ticket requires me to define the \"category\" as one of the specified strings in a JSON object. While I initially considered \"HR Support\" due to the new starter form, I\u2019m realizing it\u2019s actually more about IT, specifically provisioning access. That makes \"Access\" a more appropriate category since it aligns with tasks like creating logins and app access. The details like \"locations\" and \"storage staffing\" are unclear, but I need to prioritize IT needs for this ticket classification.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nThe phrase \"new starter\" clearly points to provisioning accounts, so I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" While \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility, it isn\u2019t strictly necessary here. Categories like \"Storage,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Miscellaneous\" don't fit the context, nor do \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" Since the primary aspect of this ticket relates to onboarding, \"Access\" is the most suitable choice. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with just the category. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
