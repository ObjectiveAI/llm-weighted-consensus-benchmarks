They mention \"log install additional memory process completed,\" pointing toward a hardware upgrade for RAM. There are also phrases about \"receipts,\" \"attached screen capture,\" and \"how receive memory.\" While \u201cbubble envelope\u201d hints at packaging, the focus seems to be on hardware. Thus, I think the appropriate category is \"Hardware\" rather than \"Storage,\" since RAM relates to hardware, not storage.**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON-like category object, as the system expects this specific format. The required schema has a property for \"category\" that needs to be one of a few defined strings. Based on the user\u2019s garbled message, it mainly points to \"Hardware\" since they want to log an upgrade for installing RAM. Although there\u2019s mention of \"receipts\" and \"order number,\" the primary action is related to hardware. So my final output should be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Delivering JSON response**\n\nI need to respond strictly with the JSON object as instructed, without any extra text. The instruction is clear: I should provide a category object. Therefore, I'll deliver: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"} \n\nThis format meets the requirements perfectly, and now I can move on!"
