The available categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" Since this request is specifically for a replacement wireless mouse, I think the best choice is \"Hardware.\" While it might also relate to \"Purchase,\" that category typically pertains to procurement, and here it\u2019s simply about the hardware request.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s message about a replacement wireless mouse seems to be a bit repeated, which might indicate a mis-typing. It appears they have requested and received a wireless mouse. I\u2019m convinced this is a hardware-related request, so the category should be \"Hardware.\" Other categories like \"Administrative Rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous\" don\u2019t apply here. I need to respond with a JSON object formatted correctly, including the \"category\" key set to \"Hardware.\"**Delivering IT ticket classification**\n\nI\u2019m considering nuances in the ticket: it could potentially be classified as \"Purchase\" since it involves a replacement request. However, the user mentions they've received the replacement and refers to \"supplies,\" which might mean the supplier is involved. For a safe classification, I believe \"Hardware\" is the best choice. I need to respond correctly with just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} as instructed, ensuring no extra text or errors in the format."
