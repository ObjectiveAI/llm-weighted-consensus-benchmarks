Since it might relate to an internal project or a general inquiry, I\u2019ll consider those options while assessing the details. Let's see how it fits!**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nThe user\u2019s message discusses a \"new report request\" that involves a custom report related to \"receivables aging by ledger\" and outlines specific layout changes. This doesn't seem to fall under hardware, access, or HR support. Based on the content, it feels more aligned with \"Internal Project,\" since it's about developing a new report. Alternatively, \"Miscellaneous\" could also fit. I'm thinking \"Internal Project\" is likely the best choice to classify this IT ticket properly!**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about the categories provided for this IT ticket: \"Internal Project\" seems like a good fit, especially since it involves a request for a custom report related to \"receivables aging by ledger\" and some layout customizations. Those elements indicate a development task in an ERP or BI environment. I believe \"Internal Project\" is the best choice because there's no mention of access, hardware, or permissions. I'll format the response as a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
