The text mentions issues like \"approval,\" \"pending request,\" and \"per diem VAT out expense problem.\" It seems to relate mostly to expenses and approvals. So, I think \"Purchase\" is the best fit here. Other categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" \"Hardware,\" and \"HR Support\" don't really match. It definitely looks like a purchase-related issue.**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe ticket sender is asking for an investigation regarding the approval workflow, specifically mentioning \"problems for approval\" and asking for a better overview. This clearly relates to the purchase order process, so I think the best category here is \"Purchase.\" While \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback if unsure, the details strongly indicate it belongs under purchasing. According to the instructions, I need to respond with a structured JSON object, so I'll provide: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. No extra content\u2014just the category!"
