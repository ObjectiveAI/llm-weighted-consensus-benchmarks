I feel \"Internal Project\" is more appropriate if it\u2019s specific to a project. However, the ambiguity makes \"Miscellaneous\" a decent option too. Ultimately, due to the focus on dashboard assistance, I'll go with \"Internal Project,\" as that seems to fit best.**Finalizing the category selection**\n\nI think \"Internal Project\" is specific since the user is focused on dashboards related to a project. However, if it\u2019s just a generic request for IT help, \"Miscellaneous\" seems more fitting. In IT ticket triage, \"assistance with dashboards\" typically falls under \"Applications\" or \"Software,\" but those aren\u2019t options here. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous,\" as it serves as a safe catch-all. I\u2019ll provide a JSON object with the category and a brief note about the request's details.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}  \n\nI think this is the concise output needed. While I could optionally ask for clarifications, the user\u2019s request was specifically to categorize, not to triage. So my final answer will just be this JSON object clearly indicating the category."
