It seems like a task related to IT or development, focusing on URL paths and environment switches. I'm considering whether it fits best under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" since it doesn't involve hardware, access, or HR matters. I think \"Internal Project\" might be the most suitable category, given it\u2019s about implementing a redirect rule in a production environment.**Deciding the category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit for this task since it involves internal software projects. \"Miscellaneous\" would work as a backup for general tasks, but I believe \"Internal Project\" captures it well. I also need to output this in a specific JSON format as per the instruction. I\u2019ll keep it concise and structured as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, without any extra comments. It's time to proceed!"
