The ticket text states: \"add terminal\" repeatedly and indicates high priority for testing purposes. It seems like they want to add a terminal, which could point to either Hardware or an Internal Project. The choices are pretty limited, so I need to decide which category fits best.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe content of the ticket indicates a request related to adding a terminal multiple times. It's a bit unclear, but I\u2019m leaning toward classifying it as either \"Internal Project\" or \"Hardware.\" If they\u2019re referring to a terminal device, that would fit \"Hardware.\" If it\u2019s a project task, then \"Internal Project\" works. The mention of \"testing purposes acceptance\" suggests criteria for approval, but doesn\u2019t explicitly request software or hardware. I'll have to pick the most suitable category from the options given.**Classifying terminal request**\n\nThe user\u2019s request to \"add terminal ... testing purposes acceptance\" points to a task for adding a terminal in a testing environment, suggesting it falls under \"Internal Project.\" I could also consider \"Access,\" but there's no mention of specific access privileges. \"Administrative rights,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Storage\" don't fit either. Since it sounds like adding a terminal in a system rather than a physical piece of hardware, I\u2019ll stick with \"Internal Project\" and prepare that JSON-like category response.**Creating category object**\n\nThe instruction is to categorize the IT ticket, and the tool requires a structured category object. I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It\u2019s important to ensure that the formatting is correct since the system expects the \"category\" field as a string. Although I might be tempted to add a brief explanation, the user only asked for the categorization, so I\u2019ll stick to just providing that structured object. Let's go ahead and finalize that response!"
