The ticket mentions \"Belgrade conference room wired network connections not working,\" which suggests issues with network connectivity. The terms \"not working\" and \"working\" might indicate different states. We have categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it's about wired connections, \"Hardware\" seems most fitting as it covers network equipment problems. However, \"Miscellaneous\" could fit if it doesn't align clearly. So, I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" for this ticket.**Deciding on category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards \"Hardware\" for the IT ticket since it\u2019s about physical network connections in a conference room. Other options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Internal Project\" don\u2019t apply here. So, \"Hardware\" is definitely the most fitting choice. I\u2019m preparing to return the response in the required JSON format, ensuring it\u2019s concise and straightforward. I\u2019ll output just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Let's get that done!"
