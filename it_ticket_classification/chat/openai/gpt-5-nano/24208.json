The ticket mentions a lot about memory, allocation, and storage. It seems related to hardware upgrades or possibly storage issues. While \u201cHardware\u201d fits because it includes memory upgrades, \u201cPurchase\u201d also makes sense due to the mention of ordering resources. I\u2019m weighing which category to use based on the context.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket content includes requests for allocating additional memory, installing memory, and deploying resources. There's urgency expressed with phrases like \"please advise best finish asap.\" They do mention ordering a hard disk, but the main focus is on the memory shortage. Given this context, I think the best category is \"Hardware,\" since it relates directly to memory upgrades, even though \"Storage\" could also be applicable for the hard disk mention. Ultimately, I'll categorize this as \"Hardware\" and format my response as a JSON object.**Formatting the output**\n\nI need to create a JSON object for the IT ticket category, following specific instructions. The chosen category has to be one of the enumerated options. Given the focus on memory and additional resources, \"Hardware\" fits best. So, I\u2019ll format my final answer as a simple JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I want to make sure it\u2019s clean and straightforward without any extra text. Alright, here it is: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Let's finalize that!"
