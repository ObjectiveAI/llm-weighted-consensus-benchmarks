Alternatively, it might also go under \"Purchase,\" relating to the license key. Since there's no explicit \"Software\" category, my best guess is to pick \"Administrative rights\" for this ticket.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket. I need to provide a JSON-like object with the key \"category\" and a relevant value. It seems like \"Administrative rights\" fits because the request involves installing software, which usually requires admin privileges. However, I wonder if \"Purchase\" might be an option since the mention of a license key could imply a purchasing action. But since the request involves installation, \"Administrative rights\" appears more appropriate in this case.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI think the IT ticket could fit under \"Administrative rights\" since the request involves installing software, which typically needs admin privileges. There\u2019s also the option for \"Miscellaneous\" if no specific category applies, but since the user is asking for categorization, I need to choose one. The required output format is a JSON object with the category field, so I\u2019ll stick to: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I\u2019ll ensure proper capitalization matching the categories list. No extra text or explanation needed!"
