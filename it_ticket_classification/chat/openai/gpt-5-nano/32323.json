It doesn't really seem to fit a hardware-related category. I wonder if it might fit under \"Administrative Rights,\" but I\u2019ll need to check if that\u2019s appropriate given the request is mainly about reporting.**Choosing an IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket. \"Internal Project\" could fit since it relates to reporting on capacity links. \"Miscellaneous\" might work, but it seems more general. \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Hardware\" don\u2019t suit this ticket at all. Since the content revolves around creating various reports, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as a fitting category. I need to format this as a JSON-like object too. So I\u2019ll present it as such!**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object indicating the category. The required format specifies that I should present my answer as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I have to make sure that it follows the schema, which expects \"category\" as a string from the specified list. There\u2019s no need for extra text, so I just focus on delivering that clean JSON format. I\u2019ll ensure everything is correctly formatted and confirmed before sending it."
