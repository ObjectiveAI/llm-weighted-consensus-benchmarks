The message is a bit jumbled with phrases like \"oracle guide,\" \"wednesday guide,\" and \"how run report.\" It seems like they're asking for help with an Oracle report. The categories available are limited, and this ticket could fit into \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Administrative rights,\" since it might involve permissions. But it doesn't seem to clearly fall under \"Access.\"**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user is looking for guidance on Oracle and how to run a report. I need to categorize this ticket appropriately. Given the choices, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the best fit since there's no specific \"Software\" category. \u201cInternal Project\u201d might work if it were related to a specific project, but the user didn't mention one. I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Miscellaneous\" and prepare the output in the required format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I'll stick to just that!"
