They mentioned a \"modem,\" which implies hardware, but \"connection required while being on client premises\" hints more at network access. Given that context, it sounds accurate to assign the category as \"Access\" since they need physical network access during the visit. I'll format the output as a JSON object with the appropriate category.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI need to create a category object with a \"category\" string. Based on the user's request, \"Access\" seems to be the right choice since they focus on network connectivity on client premises. The mention of \"modem\" might suggest hardware, but it's primarily about access for a short visit. So, I'll return the JSON object as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll make sure to keep everything concise and follow the format required."
