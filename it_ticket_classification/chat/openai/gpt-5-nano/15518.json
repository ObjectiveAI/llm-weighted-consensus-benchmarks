The user shared a long string of phrases, and the ticket appears to be related to an employee's access card activation and account reactivation. It mentions key terms like \"access card,\" \"AD user access,\" \"enable groups,\" and \"returning employee,\" which indicate this is primarily about access. I'll make sure to place it in the right category!**Categorizing employee requests**\n\nI see that the request involves activating an access card for an employee returning to work. It includes phrases like \"returning employee,\" \"enabling groups,\" and \"reactivate AD user,\" indicating it's primarily about account access. The user also mentioned forms and tickets that need addressing. I need to categorize this ticket accordingly. This will help ensure the right actions are taken to assist the employee efficiently and quickly!**Preparing JSON response**\n\nIt looks like the request falls primarily under the \"Access\" category due to mentions of AD accounts, access cards, and enabling or reactivating those accounts. Now, I need to prepare the answer in the required JSON-like format for clarity. The format should look like this: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s nothing extraneous included, as the guidelines specify to provide only the JSON object. Let\u2019s go ahead and finalize that!"
