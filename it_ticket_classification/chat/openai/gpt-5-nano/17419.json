I could categorize it as \"Access,\" since it deals with system access and viewing active users. But \"Administrative rights\" is also relevant since it requests specific permissions. The best fit seems to be \"Access,\" but considering the emphasis on permissions, \"Administrative rights\" might be the more accurate category. Ultimately, since the ticket mentions both access and rights, I'll go with \"Administrative rights.\"**Crafting JSON response**\n\nSome systems require \"Access\" for credentials and \"Administrative rights\" for permissions. Since the user mentioned \"rights,\" I think \"Administrative rights\" fits well. The task is to respond with a JSON object that includes the category. The command states that it should follow the specified JSON schema, so it looks like I need to provide just the category without any extra commentary. \n\nGiven the context and emphasis on \"rights,\" I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
