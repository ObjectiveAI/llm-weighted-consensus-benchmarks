The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The user\u2019s issue seems related to a name display problem, which might fit under \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"HR Support.\" Since it\u2019s specifically about a name change in the system, \"Administrative rights\" might be the closest fit.**Deciding on a ticket category**\n\nI need to select the best category for this IT ticket. \"Administrative rights\" seemed like a choice at first since it involves changing data, but it doesn\u2019t fit well since it\u2019s not about permissions. \"HR Support\" might work if it's regarding an employee's name in HR records, but since this is an IT ticket, I could opt for \"Miscellaneous\" if I'm unsure. I should provide a category with a rationale and format it as a JSON object.**Selecting the right category**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out how to categorize the ticket about a name change, which might fit under \"Administrative rights\" since it involves the user name in the system, but that might not be the best choice. \"HR Support\" could be appropriate if it\u2019s about an employee's name, especially if the user wants to change it to \"Tudor Thursday.\" While \"Access\" usually pertains to login issues, given the context, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" since it relates to a person\u2019s name.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
