It seems like someone pressed a button only once, but multiple notification emails were still sent. I\u2019m considering categorizing this as \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It doesn't seem to fit with issues like hardware or storage. Since it\u2019s about process and emails, \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit, unless \"Internal Project\" is a closer match.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
