The user mentioned a \"sheets error\" and problems with past dates on holiday requests. From the categories available, it seems this relates to HR support, making \"HR Support\" the most appropriate category. However, there's a chance it could fit \"Administrative rights\" if it's about permissions to add dates. Since the user said they can't modify absence records, maybe \"Access\" is another option.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket under the \"HR Support\" category, which fits typical HR system issues. The requirement is to output a JSON object formatted correctly. It looks like I should respond with {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} while ensuring there\u2019s no extra commentary, just the JSON. The instruction suggests that only a single category is needed, given that the schema indicates \"category\" as a string. I want to confirm I'm following the format perfectly!**Determining the right category**\n\nThe user mentioned \"absence\" and a \"sheets error.\" While it could relate to an \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s a bug, the context suggests it\u2019s about managing absence records. It looks like this is an issue with the HR system, especially since it involves past dates in absence management. So, I\u2019m concluding that \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category. I\u2019m ready to deliver this categorization!"
