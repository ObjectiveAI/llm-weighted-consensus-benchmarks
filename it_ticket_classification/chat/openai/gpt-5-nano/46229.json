So, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Administrative rights\" because it indicates misaligned access privileges. Finally, I'll format my answer as a JSON object with the correct category.**Finalizing the response**\n\nI\u2019m preparing to respond with the category for the IT ticket as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. It's clear that the instruction only requests the category, so there\u2019s no need to include an explanation. I want to ensure that the format is correct, as the app expects this specific JSON structure. It's straightforward, but I\u2019ll double-check everything to make sure I\u2019m getting it right! Let's finalize this response."
