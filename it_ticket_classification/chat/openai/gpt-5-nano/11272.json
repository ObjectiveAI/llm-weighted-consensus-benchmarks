It mentions important terms like \"guest password,\" \"guest changes weekly,\" and \"high importance.\" Given these details, it seems related to managing access and might involve administrative rights as well. However, the focus on passwords suggests that the most appropriate category is \"Access.\" My plan is to respond with a JSON object reflecting that category accurately. So, I'll classify it as \"Access.\"**Outputting JSON category**\n\nThe instructions clearly state I need to respond with a category in JSON format, specifically mentioning the structure I'll use. It looks like I\u2019m set to output `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. Now, I wonder if it should include anything extra, but the focus is on access management rather than administrative rights, even with the mention of \"administrator.\" I\u2019ll stick with \"Access\" and format it neatly as a JSON object, excluding any additional text. Here it goes: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`."
