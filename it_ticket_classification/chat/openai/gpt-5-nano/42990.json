The user mentions traveling, and perhaps they need to receive messages while away. The closing \"best\" seems standard.\n\nThe problem leans toward connectivity rather than hardware. I think the best category here is \"Access,\" as it fits with login or remote access issues. So, I'll output the JSON object as follows:\n\n{\"category\": \"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
