So I'll format my response accordingly, ensuring I follow the given structure.**Classifying Mailbox Access**\n\nIt seems this ticket is about granting access to a mailbox and searching folders, which falls under \"Access.\" The categories provided include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" but granting mailbox access typically aligns with \"Access,\" not administrative privileges. Based on the user\u2019s request, it\u2019s clear they need mailbox access. So, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the category defined as \"Access\": {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This fits the user's request perfectly!**Providing JSON Response**\n\nI need to keep my response straightforward and only provide the required JSON object for the category. The instruction clearly states to format it as JSON, and the category we determined is \"Access.\" So, I\u2019ll output it as follows: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I won't add any extra commentary; just the clean JSON is necessary. This should meet the user's request perfectly!"
