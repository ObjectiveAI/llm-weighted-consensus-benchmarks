It mentions \"prospect,\" \"contract signed,\" and \"active client.\" This feels more business-oriented or CRM-related, rather than strictly IT. The categories I have are \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Given the context, it seems it could fit under \"Miscellaneous.\" So, I'll choose to categorize it that way and format my output accordingly.**Deciding Ticket Category**\n\nI think I should return the category as \"Miscellaneous\" since the ticket content is unclear. It talks about \"prospect,\" \"contract signed,\" and \"active client,\" indicating it's likely related to client classification and sales\u2014not IT. I wonder if it could fit under \"Access,\" especially if it involves permissions, but there\u2019s no explicit mention of that. Given its ambiguity, \"Miscellaneous\" seems the best option to cover everything without forcing it into a less fitting category.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
