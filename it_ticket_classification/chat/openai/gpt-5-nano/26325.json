The predefined categories include options like \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" and several others. I think the most relevant category here is \"Purchase,\" given the context of a new monitor and installation. So, I'll format my response as a JSON object specifying this category. This should provide clarity and meet the user's expectations effectively!**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI'm working on categorizing the IT ticket based on the user's message, which talks about a new purchase order for a monitor, installation, and required receipts. Given these details, the most fitting category seems to be \"Purchase\" since it's focused on the purchase process and associated items. Although \"Hardware\" is relevant too, the emphasis is on the purchase order. So, I'll go with \"Purchase\" as it best captures the main intent of the message.**Formatting response**\n\nI\u2019m going to respond with a JSON object that includes the category \"Purchase.\" The format needs to be exact according to the schema, which is {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I should keep it straightforward and avoid any extra explanations since the task is clear. So, yes, I'll include only the category key as expected. This will keep things concise and within the parameters set out in the initial instructions!"
