I think I should ask the user for clarification to ensure I select the right category.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the phrase \"snow user\" and considering it likely refers to \"ServiceNow user.\" Depending on the context, it could fall under \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" Generally, provisioning service accounts aligns with \"Access,\" and granting admin privileges fits \"Administrative rights.\" Given the phrase relates to users in ServiceNow, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" Since the user requested a JSON format for the response, I\u2019ll ensure to structure it accordingly with the appropriate category.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that states {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s essential to follow the specific format and avoid adding any extra text. Since the user's request was to categorize the ticket, \u201cAccess\u201d fits perfectly as it corresponds with the context. Even though \"Internal Project\" might seem relevant, \"Access\" is clearly the best fit. So, I\u2019ll keep it simple and provide just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
