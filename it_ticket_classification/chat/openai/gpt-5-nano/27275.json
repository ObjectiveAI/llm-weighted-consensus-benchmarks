The user mentions high importance and several issues regarding access to tools like Confluence and Git. They also mention a configuration plan and ownership. Given the categories I have, this ticket relates to user access and administrative rights, so I think it best fits under either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
