The available categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" While it seems related to administrative scheduling, the maternity leave aspect leans towards \"HR Support.\" However, since it's specifically about canceling a meeting, \"Administrative rights\" might also apply. I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" in this case.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether the category for the IT ticket should be \"Internal Project\" since it\u2019s related to a release planning meeting. The available categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it involves permissions, the focus on canceling the meeting suggests it\u2019s more about scheduling. Since there\u2019s no specific \"Scheduling\" category, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit. I should respond with the appropriate JSON object for the category.**Outputting JSON for category**\n\nI need to create a JSON object with the category set to \"Internal Project\" for the IT ticket. The instructions clearly say to categorize the ticket, so I should keep it straightforward and just include the category. According to the schema, I\u2019ll format it as follows: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s valid JSON without any extra text or phrases. Let's get that done!"
