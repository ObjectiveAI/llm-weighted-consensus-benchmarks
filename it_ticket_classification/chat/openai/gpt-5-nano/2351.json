This likely falls under the Access category since it relates to mailbox management. The mention of \"infrastructure ext phone\" suggests that the IT infrastructure team might be involved. I should assign it to Access for appropriate handling.**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m handling an IT ticket about removing an attached mailbox from an ex-employee. It seems to focus on deprovisioning their email mailbox. Since \"attached mailbox removal\" appears repeatedly, this might be the subject of the request. The best fit for categorizing this ticket seems to be Access, as it's about access control for the mailbox. While I considered Administrative rights, that's more for granting or revoking admin rights. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as Access and prepare to respond in a JSON-like format.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to output a JSON object for this IT ticket about mailbox removal. The category options are clear: Hardware, HR Support, Access, etc. It seems like the best fit is \"Access\" since it directly relates to removing mailbox access for an ex-employee. While I considered \"Storage\" because it's about mailbox storage, \"Access\" is more appropriate given the situation. So, I'll craft the response as a JSON object with just the category, making sure to keep it concise and straightforward."
