The user's request indicates they need a new hard disk because the current one is dying. Since it's both a hardware issue and relates to storage, I think the best fit would be the \"Storage\" category. But since it also involves a hardware replacement, \"Hardware\" is relevant too. It\u2019s a bit of a toss-up!**Determining the appropriate category**\n\nI'm looking at the categories \"Hardware\" and \"Storage\" for the IT ticket. Since the issue is about a hard disk drive, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Storage.\" Even though some might consider it a hardware repair, the dedicated \"Storage\" category seems more fitting here. I need to present this as a JSON object, so it will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I\u2019ll make sure not to add any extra text and just provide the JSON output."
