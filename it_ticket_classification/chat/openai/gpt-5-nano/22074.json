The user\u2019s message includes \"software developer,\" which could indicate it's about an \"Internal Project.\" There\u2019s also the mention of \"add to social Friday,\" which sounds like a request to add a social media feature. The ticket doesn\u2019t fit into categories like Hardware, HR Support, or Storage. Since it's ambiguous, the \"Miscellaneous\" category might be the safest choice, but it could be \"Internal Project\" if it's related to scheduling social posts.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nThe ticket isn\u2019t strongly indicating a specific project, so I'll respond with a JSON format that categorizes it as \"Miscellaneous.\" The instruction specifies that the output needs to be a correctly formatted JSON object with a \"category\" field. I\u2019ll keep it clear and straightforward without any extra commentary, crafting the response as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}\n\nThis ensures we follow the prompt\u2019s requirements while providing the necessary categorization efficiently."
