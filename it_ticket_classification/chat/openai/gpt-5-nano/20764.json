The key hints are \"resupply,\" \"mouse,\" and mentions of a purchase. It looks like a hardware request since \"mouse\" indicates a peripheral. I could go with the \"Hardware\" category since it involves physical devices, but there's also a hint towards \"Purchase\" due to the request for resupply. So, I\u2019ll focus on \"Hardware\" as the best fit.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI believe this ticket could fall under \"Hardware\" since it mentions a mouse, which is indeed a hardware item. There's also the mention of \"resupply,\" implying that small hardware items need restocking. While \"Purchase\" may fit due to the request for buying items, the focus appears to be on hardware rather than pure procurement. Categories like \"Storage\" and \"Administrative rights\" don't seem relevant here. So I'll categorize this ticket as \"Hardware\" and provide a JSON object in the required format.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nThe system requires that I respond in a specific JSON format, specifying the category. The category should be set to \"Hardware\" because that's what fits best. The required format looks like this: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. \n\nI should double-check that I'm using the correct casing since it needs to match the enum exactly. The instructions say to respond with just the category, so I won\u2019t add extra explanations. I'll finalize it as `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}` and make sure it's all set!"
