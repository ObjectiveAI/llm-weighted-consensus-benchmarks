Since \"Miscellaneous\" or perhaps \"Hardware\" due to potential update delays seem most fitting, I'll consider \"Miscellaneous\" as the safest choice.**Outputting category response**\n\nThe user's request is clear: they want me to categorize an IT ticket based on the provided text. The instructions specify a JSON-like category format: {\"category\": \"value\"}. I\u2019ll stick with the category options given, and since \"Miscellaneous\" seems fitting for the issue described, I should simply output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Although adding a short rationale could help, it\u2019s best to follow the instruction strictly\u2014so I'll just include the category in the JSON format."
