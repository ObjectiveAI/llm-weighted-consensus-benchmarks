The ticket text involves rescheduling a reporting task and mentions logging changes and creating metric displays about rescheduling. I have several categories to consider: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" After parsing the ticket, it seems to fit best under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll select the most appropriate category accordingly.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the ticket about \u201creporting Thursday PM\u201d and metrics display. It seems like the user wants to log reschedule events and create a metric for how often things are rescheduled along with their old values. This definitely feels like it aligns with an \"Internal Project\" since it's focused on project metrics and reporting. While \"Miscellaneous\" could apply to general requests, \"Internal Project\" fits best here, particularly with the focus on building metrics and scheduling changes.**Formatting the JSON response**\n\nI need to create a JSON output that categorizes the IT ticket. The required format is a JSON object where \"type\" is \"object\" and it must include the \"category\" property. Based on the ticket's context, the correct category is \"Internal Project.\" I want to ensure that I format it correctly, sticking to the specified enumeration. So, I'll craft the simple response as follows:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
