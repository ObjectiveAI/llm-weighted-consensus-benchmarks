This suggests it\u2019s mainly about approvals and purchasing. So, I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object reflecting this categorization.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nThe instruction specifies a special format for the JSON object. I need to create one with the category field set to \"Purchase,\" adhering strictly to the required format. The prompt emphasizes categorizing the IT ticket, so I understand the output must be a JSON object that reflects this. After realizing I need to provide a concrete instance, I confirm that the appropriate response is: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Let\u2019s proceed with just that output!"
