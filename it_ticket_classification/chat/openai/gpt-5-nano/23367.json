It includes phrases like \"new purchase,\" \"log installation,\" and \"mandatory receipts section,\" which indicates it's related to purchasing something. Given these clues, the most fitting category seems to be \"Purchase.\" \n\nHowever, I\u2019m also considering \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" but those don't align as directly. So, I'll go with \"Purchase\" for clarity.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the content that mentions \"log installation,\" \"purchase order,\" and \"receipts,\" which points toward a purchase. While there's a possibility it could relate to \"Administrative rights\" for installation, it\u2019s not definitive. Given the strong indicators of purchasing, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Purchase.\" \n\nI need to respond with a simple JSON object, so I'll format it as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} without any extra details. I feel confident that this is the right choice!"
