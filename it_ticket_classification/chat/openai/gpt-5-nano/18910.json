The text seems a bit garbled but mentions changing project codes and references annual leave requests. Given the nature of the request, it could possibly fall under \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or even \"Access.\" The repeated mentions of changing project codes make it particularly tricky, but I think my best guess is that it's about internal project management. I'll go with \"Internal Project.\"**Categorizing Project Code Change**\n\nIf a user needs to change a project code, it might fit under \"Administrative rights\" since that involves modifying the project details. However, the most relevant categories include \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" The user\u2019s request centers on changing a project code, which aligns more with \"Internal Project.\" The mention of \"annual leave requests\" seems unrelated\u2014maybe a typo. Overall, I think categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" is the best choice since it's primarily about project management.**Parsing the Ticket Request**\n\nI need to break down the user\u2019s request, which says: \"please change project code for to friday march pm...\" It looks like there might be some sentences mixed in there. The main point seems to be changing a project code, with a possibly implied deadline of \"friday march pm.\" There's also a mention of annual leave requests, which might relate to \"HR Support.\" However, the primary focus is still on changing the project code. I should categorize this request accordingly and possibly suggest clarifying questions if needed. We should output a JSON category field based on this analysis.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
