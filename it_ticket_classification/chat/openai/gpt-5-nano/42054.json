They mention re-submitting previously altered sheets from February that don\u2019t match the input created by employees. It seems like they're asking for clarification or guidance on who to contact, possibly the senior tester. Overall, this ticket is about data integrity and discrepancies in these submitted sheets, which is important to address.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user talks about Oracle issues and wanting to re-submit previously submitted sheets from February, possibly relating to access or data accuracy. I need to categorize this under our options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It likely fits under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The mention of an \"entitled party\" and a senior tester suggests there may be a data integrity or access rights concern, but they didn\u2019t explicitly ask for access privileges.**Determining the IT ticket category**\n\nThe user's request seems to involve permissions or potentially an \"entitled party\" tied to data access, though it's not explicitly stated. Based on the available categories, \"Miscellaneous\" is too general, \"Storage\" and \"Purchase\" don't apply, and \"Administrative rights\" refers to user permissions. Since the ticket concerns Oracle issues within a project, it might fit under \"Internal Project,\" especially given the focus on data integrity and possible application issues. I'll respond with a JSON object indicating the selected category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
