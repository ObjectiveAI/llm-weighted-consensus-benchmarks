It likely falls under the \"Access\" category due to its focus on user access behavior. However, if it relates to policy issues, it might also fit \"Administrative rights.\" I'll categorize it as \"Access\" and prepare JSON to reflect this.**Structuring IT ticket response**\n\nThe instruction prompts me to categorize an IT ticket and provide a JSON-like object with a category field. The instructions specify the required format: a category value among several options. Since the content includes \"Access,\" I\u2019ll make sure to respond strictly with that category. \n\nI'll format it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI need to pay attention to avoid any extra text or punctuation.
