It seems to focus on requests for closing inactive projects and asking for the closest possible ending date. The word \"zoom\" is mentioned, which might refer to a system or task. The relevant categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I think \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" fits best here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket is clearly focused on closing inactive projects and asking for an ending date. This leans towards project management, and \"Internal Project\" seems like the most appropriate category. The content does include \"Zoom,\" but it likely relates to managing the projects rather than scheduling a meeting. Since \"Internal Project\" fits best, I'll format my response as a JSON object. \n\nSo, my output will simply be: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI need to ensure that \"Internal Project\" is included in the enum for the JSON response. It should be a simple JSON-like object following the required schema. I want to avoid extraneous text and focus solely on the specified format. The final answer will be in the structure provided earlier, and it definitely should include quotes around the category value since that\u2019s how JSON works.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} as the final response.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
