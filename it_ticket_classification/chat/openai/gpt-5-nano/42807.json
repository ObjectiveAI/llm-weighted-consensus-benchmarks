It seems to mention an issue with \"blank time cards notifications,\" which might refer to a notification problem regarding blank cards. The repeated phrases indicate that it\u2019s related to time tracking. I\u2019m considering several valid categories for the ticket based on the system\u2019s instructions. Since it deals with time cards, it might best fit under HR Support or Access.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI think time cards typically fall under HR-related issues, so categorizing it as \"HR Support\" makes sense. However, I see the mention of \"blank time cards notifications,\" which could indicate a notification issue related to time cards. The phrase \u201ccard care\u201d might even point to access with physical cards, suggesting the \"Access\" category could also work. Given this ambiguity, I need to decide, and ultimately, I'll return a JSON object with the appropriate category based on the provided options.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
