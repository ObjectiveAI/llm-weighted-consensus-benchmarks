It seems to be about creating or running that image locally. I\u2019m considering the relevant categories: \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \u201cAccess,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" It's likely not about hardware since the focus is on software and procedures related to testing the server image. It seems most fitting to categorize it as \"Internal Project.\"**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm working on categorizing an IT ticket related to running a Windows Server image on a VM. It seems to fit well with \"Internal Project,\" as it's focused on internal testing. There's a chance it could be \"Administrative rights\" if special permissions are required, but that\u2019s not clear. \"Miscellaneous\" could work as a backup. Since there's no mention of access credentials, \"Access\" doesn't apply here. Overall, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best fit for the category.**Preparing response in JSON format**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that only includes the category according to the user's instruction to categorize the IT ticket. I'll structure it as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Nothing else is necessary since the instruction specifies that only the category should be outputted. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text or whitespace, just the JSON object. Let\u2019s finalize it as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Simple and straightforward!"
