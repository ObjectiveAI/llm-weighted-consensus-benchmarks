I\u2019m considering whether to categorize this as \"Storage\" or \"Hardware.\" Since it focuses on disk issues and enclosure, I think \"Storage\" is the best choice. It clearly doesn\u2019t fall under HR, access, or internal projects. Now, I just need to format the response into a JSON object that includes the category key.**Delivering JSON category**\n\nI see that the required format for this task involves providing a JSON object that categorizes the IT ticket. It looks like I should present the category alone, so I\u2019ll format it as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. The schema mentions types and properties, but since the instruction requests just the category, that simplifies things! Following the expected pattern, I'll ensure my final answer is this concise JSON object without any additional commentary."
