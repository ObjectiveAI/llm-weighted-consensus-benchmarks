The user's message suggests that the speaker has been down since Wednesday and they want someone to investigate. Based on this, I'm thinking the best category for this would be \"Hardware\" since it involves a physical device failure. \"Internal Project\" or \"Access\" don't quite fit, so \"Hardware\" seems like the right choice.**Outputting JSON response**\n\nI need to output a JSON object that categorizes the IT ticket. The prompt specifies just the category, which I understand means I should keep it simple. The structure I need is clear: it should contain the key \"category.\" Since \"Hardware\" fits the situation well, I can confirm that's a valid entry. I'll ensure there's correct formatting and escaping in my output. So, the final response will simply be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
