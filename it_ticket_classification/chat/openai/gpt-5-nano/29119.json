The ticket text is messy but seems to focus on access rights related to migrating sites, old folders, and file transfers. It highlights a deadline and guides for transferring files, suggesting it best fits the Access or Administrative rights category. It doesn\u2019t strictly qualify as Storage since it involves more than just file location.**Categorizing Migration Project**\n\nThis ticket appears to revolve around an internal project related to site migration, with references to old orders, transitions, and guides. \"Access\" could apply because it discusses granted owner rights, migrating sites, and permissions. The focus seems to be on the migration process, which suggests \"Internal Project\" might be the best fit. However, since it also touches on rights and access, it could be classified under \"Access.\" Ultimately, I want to choose the most appropriate category based on the primary focus of the ticket.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket seems to be primarily about an internal project focused on migrating a site and moving old folders, making \"Internal Project\" a fitting category. While \"Administrative rights\" could also apply due to mentions of owner rights and permissions, the ticket reads more like a project-level task with specific deadlines and file uploads involved. Therefore, categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" is the best choice, and I\u2019ll need to format my response correctly as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}."
