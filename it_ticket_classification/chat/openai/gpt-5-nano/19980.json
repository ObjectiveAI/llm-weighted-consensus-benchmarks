I should categorize it based on my best guess.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI think the \"Internal Project\" category seems suitable since it relates to a new system and documents for everyone. \"Purchase\" could work too if a new system is involved, but \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" and \"Storage\" don\u2019t fit. \"HR Support\" isn't relevant, and \"Administrative rights\" might apply if admin permissions are needed, but it\u2019s not explicitly mentioned. \"Miscellaneous\" is an option as a fallback. I should choose a category, provide a brief justification, and request clarification if necessary.**Categorizing the ticket as Internal Project**\n\nThe \"Administrative rights\" category feels a bit off. \"Internal Project\" seems like the best option, given that the mention of a \"new system\" suggests a project. \"Document allocated\" could imply distributing access to a document, but ultimately it relates to an implementation task. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll include a one-liner justification: \"Related to the deployment of a new system and distribution of a document to all users.\" I'll output it in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
