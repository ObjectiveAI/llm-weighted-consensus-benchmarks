However, it's clear they want to delete groups in AD.\n\nGiven that it's about access control, the most fitting category is likely \"Access.\" I\u2019m going to assign it there, based on the context provided.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering categorizing an IT ticket that relates to permissions and changes in Active Directory (AD). The options I have are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nSince it's about deleting groups, it fits best under \"Access\" rather than \"Administrative rights,\" which generally involves requesting elevated permissions. This situation is more about managing access groups. So, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" and respond with the necessary JSON format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
