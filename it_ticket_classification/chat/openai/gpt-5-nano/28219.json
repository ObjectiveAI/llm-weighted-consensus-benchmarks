The categories available are hardware, HR support, access, miscellaneous, storage, purchase, internal project, and administrative rights. Since this ticket is about a report, it doesn't fit those categories. I\u2019m thinking \"miscellaneous\" might be the best choice since it seems to cover various requests that aren\u2019t specifically listed.**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nI\u2019m exploring the best category for this IT ticket. The user hasn\u2019t specifically mentioned needing administrative rights, which could be relevant if they're asking for permissions for a report. \"Miscellaneous\" feels a bit too broad, and \"Internal Project\" might be appropriate since they're referencing a \"senior programme.\" I need to choose one fitting category based on the user's request and prepare a JSON object for that category. I'll ensure to follow the required format!{\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}"
