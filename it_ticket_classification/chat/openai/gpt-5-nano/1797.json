The mention of \u201cpassword reset,\u201d \u201cexpire today,\u201d and \u201cchange pc press ctrl alt delete\u201d stands out. It seems like this ticket relates to access issues, so I might categorize it as \"Access.\" I need to provide that in a JSON format with a category field indicating this choice. Let's make sure I'm clear and accurate in my categorization.**Identifying IT ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the user's message to categorize the IT ticket. The mention of \"Access\" makes sense because it discusses a password reset, implying someone needs help with login issues. The phrase about being on maternity leave adds an interesting layer, but since it\u2019s still IT-related, I settle on \"Access.\" There's also mention of \"Administrative rights,\" which could fit in too, but the primary focus here is definitely on login and password issues. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Access.\"**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm looking at the provided lines, and the mention of \"Administrative rights\" is a bit ambiguous. However, given that the content primarily revolves around a password reset and login access, I think the best category is \"Access.\" The references to expiration, PC, and the CTRL-ALT-DELETE command all support this choice. To comply with the instructions, I\u2019ll format it as a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to make sure my output matches the expected structure!**Returning category JSON**\n\nThe system specifies that I need to return the category as a string enum, so I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It seems that the instructions focus on simply categorizing, without needing additional explanations, even though it feels natural to want to provide context! But I\u2019ll stick to the requirements and just deliver the final JSON object. So, my final answer is: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's get that all set for the user!"
