I have a list of categories, and the best fits seem to be either \"Access\" to disable user access or \"HR Support\" since it relates to an employee leaving.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket since HR usually handles offboarding. It looks like the request is to delete an account or access rights, which makes \"Access\" the closest fit. The message suggests removing access for someone who has left, so that aligns with my choice. I\u2019ll just need to respond with the category \"Access\" and maybe include a brief justification. \n\nThe output format should be a JSON object to ensure it meets the requested structure.**Formatting IT Ticket Output**\n\nI need to provide the output as a JSON object, specifying a \"category\" field. The correct format based on the task is to present a JSON object with the category value. Given the previous analysis, I'll be outputting: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nWhile I could add some justification, the instructions seem to focus on just delivering the category itself. So, I\u2019ll keep it concise and stick to just the JSON format. Let's finalize that!"
