The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, and more. The content mentions \"overtime,\" hinting at HR, but since it's an IT ticket, \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit here. The term \"lieu leave\" could indicate time off, but I can't pinpoint everything clearly. I should choose the most appropriate category.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket details, which mention \"lieu leave\" and \"overtime,\" both of which seem to point towards HR matters. There's also \"regular work facility,\" potentially linked to IT, but nothing concrete stands out for administrative rights. \n\nThe \"Access\" category might work if it's related to accessing the leave system, though there's no mention of login issues. Given the overall unclear nature of the ticket, \"Miscellaneous\" seems the best fit. I should respond with the categorization in JSON format as {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
