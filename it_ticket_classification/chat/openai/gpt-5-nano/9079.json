The message is quite garbled, mentioning something about \"non starter for Wednesday\" and \"equipment needed.\" It sounds like they might mean \"no show starter for Wednesday\" and are asking if additional equipment is needed. I think this ticket could relate to \"Hardware\" since it involves equipment, but it might also fit under \"Purchase\" depending on context. Let's clarify that!**Categorizing Equipment Needs**\n\nThe request is to categorize a ticket about needing more equipment. This likely refers to hardware procurement, so it could fit under the \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware\" categories. Since the user is inquiring about whether more hardware is needed, I'll lean toward \"Purchase,\" as it suggests they are looking to procure new items. It sounds appropriate to craft a JSON object indicating this category. Let's finalize that with the expected format!**Outputting Category in JSON**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object for the category of the IT ticket. The user has asked me to categorize it, and based on the content, it seems appropriate to use \"Purchase\" since it relates to equipment procurement. The format I need to follow is straightforward, so I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll avoid any extra text or commentary to keep it clear and to the point."
