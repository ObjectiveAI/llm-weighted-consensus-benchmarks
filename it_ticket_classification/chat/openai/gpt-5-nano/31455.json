The ticket mentions needing file details and updating files, suggesting it might relate to an internal project. I need to focus on the details in the ticket and determine which category fits best from the options provided: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I'll parse the text for a clearer understanding before making my choice.**Analyzing ticket categories**\n\nThe text provided is a bit garbled, but I can pull out keywords like \"file details needed,\" \"run script,\" and \"updating common file.\" This could lead me to several possible categories. \"Administrative rights\" might fit because it involves access, while \"Storage\" could work if it's about managing files. It could also relate to \"Internal Project\" if it's about a specific project. Alternatively, \"Access\" fits for script permissions. The mention of \"every user Wednesday PM\" suggests some kind of scheduled task.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe user's request is a bit unclear, but I need to categorize it. \"Internal Project\" might work if it\u2019s about updating a common file with a script for employees, though that feels broad. \"Storage\" is also a possibility since it focuses on files. However, there are mentions of needing file details and keeping files, which points to storage. \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if the script requires special permissions, and \"Access\" might fit too. I'll choose one and prepare the JSON response.**Preparing JSON output for category**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to format the output as a JSON object specifying a category. The options include categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" and \"Internal Project.\" Given the context of \"script updating common file,\" it seems to relate to automation, which could lead me to \"Internal Project.\" Since this task involves updating a shared file on a schedule, that's likely the best fit. I\u2019ll finalize it in the correct JSON format: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
