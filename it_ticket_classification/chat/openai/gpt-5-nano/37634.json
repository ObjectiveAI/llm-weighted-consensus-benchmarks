Given the focus on reports and data management, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the most fitting category for this ticket.**Categorizing IT Request**\n\nThis seems like an IT request focused on reporting. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access.\" Since it's not about hardware, HR, or administration, I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" because it relates to an internal reporting tool. While \"Access\" might fit if it involved permissions, the request is about producing a report on approvers. It falls under development or reporting tasks, so I'm categorizing it as \"Internal Project.\" I'll be sure to format this in a JSON-like object for clarity.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
