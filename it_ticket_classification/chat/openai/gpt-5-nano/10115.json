The user's message seems a bit jumbled, mentioning \"new delivery,\" \"docking stations,\" and \"PO,\" which may hint at a purchase order. I think it could fit as Hardware since docking stations are hardware items, but it might also relate to Purchase because of the mentioned PO. If I have to choose just one, I'll likely go with Hardware.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket reads, \"new delivery net hello received items po po docking stations po please advise please log thank engineer,\" and seems quite cryptic. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Hardware,\" since it mentions docking stations, which are indeed hardware items. However, I also wonder if \"Purchase\" might be more fitting due to the inclusion of \"PO\" (purchase order) and references to delivery. I think I'll return a JSON-like object like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} for clarity but consider the context of both categories.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
