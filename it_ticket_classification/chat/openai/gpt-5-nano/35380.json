The message indicates there's an issue with the sign button after the Oracle session expires, leading to an error message. The user needs to reopen the browser to navigate the issue, and they've been experiencing this frustrating problem for months. It seems like this could fit into \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI'm looking at how to categorize an IT ticket concerning a sign-in button that doesn't work after the session expires. This seems likely to be a login or access issue. Based on the details, it sounds best categorized as \"Access,\" but I also considered \"Administrative Rights.\" There's also a mention to \"contact administrator,\" reinforcing the access theme. It seems like \"Access\" is the most appropriate choice, so I\u2019ll format the response in JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Ensuring the output format**\n\nI need to make sure that my output matches the specified format: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}. The final response should only include the category without any additional commentary. Based on our earlier assessment, the category is \"Access,\" so my response will simply be the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That keeps things clear and straightforward!"
