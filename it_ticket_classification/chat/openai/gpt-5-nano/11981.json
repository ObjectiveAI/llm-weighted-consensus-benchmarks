The ticket mentions \"service accounts for server instance,\" which points to managing access rights. It likely fits in either the \"Access\" category, concerning login credentials, or \"Administrative rights,\" related to granting permissions. Since it's about assigning accounts for July PM, it seems appropriate to classify this as \"Access,\" focusing on server access rights. Let's clarify which category works best!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe request seems to involve assigning an instance, specifically mentioning \"two service accounts for server instance.\" While it could fit under \"Internal Project,\" it aligns more closely with access control. Since it's about service accounts and server access, categorizing it as \"Access\" makes the most sense. It could also be \"Administrative rights,\" but service accounts usually have specific permissions rather than admin rights. Given the phrase \"assign instance,\" \"Access\" seems to be the best fit. I'll format the category in JSON as required!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
