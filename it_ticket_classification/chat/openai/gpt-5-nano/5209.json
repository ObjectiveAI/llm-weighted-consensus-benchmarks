It mentions requests about actions, notifications, and employee processes but is a bit convoluted. I need to assess if this fits into categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, or Internal Project-Administrative rights. To make it clear, I should output this in JSON format with the appropriate category type selected. Let's analyze the content more closely and determine the right fit!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI need to figure out the best category for this ticket. The content is a bit messy, mentioning things like missing action notifications and training materials, which suggests it might relate to administrative or process tasks. It could potentially fit into \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The details focus on training, submissions, and logging, but there's no direct request for administrative rights, which makes my selection a bit tougher. I think \"Internal Project\" might be the best fit here!**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this ticket as \"Miscellaneous\" since it\u2019s a bit of a mess with lots of text modifications and process changes. The categories listed include \"Miscellaneous,\" which makes sense here. I need to respond using JSON format, so the output should clearly reflect that decision. \n\nThe valid JSON object will look like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}, ensuring it includes the proper schema as specified. It's good to keep it clean and straightforward!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
