They mentioned having trouble connecting outside, but their wired connection works for everything else. It seems to be primarily about Outlook connectivity. I\u2019m unsure whether to categorize it as \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or possibly \"Hardware,\" though \"Access\" seems the most fitting due to the nature of the issue. But it doesn't quite match, as it\u2019s more about connectivity.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nI\u2019m tasked with categorizing an IT ticket, but the options available are somewhat limited. The user\u2019s issue seems to be about connecting to Outlook, which could potentially fit into the \"Access\" category since it involves accessing the email client. \"Miscellaneous\" is an alternative for anything that doesn\u2019t fit neatly. I should probably ask clarifying questions, but I need to provide a JSON output with the selected category as it relates to Outlook connectivity issues.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI think categorizing this ticket as \"Access\" makes sense since it's about connectivity issues with Outlook, even though it's not a login problem. The user\u2019s repeated mention of \"connect\" supports this choice. I need to ensure that my JSON output adheres to the required structure, so it'll look like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The instructions emphasize that I should focus solely on the category, so I won't add any notes\u2014just the JSON!"
