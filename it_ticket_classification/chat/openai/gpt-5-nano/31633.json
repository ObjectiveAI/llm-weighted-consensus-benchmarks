Since it's about a collaboration tool and renaming a specific entry, I'd likely classify this under \"Internal Project.\" It's a bit messy, but that feels like the right category!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe user seems to want to change a \"key,\" possibly related to a Confluence page or space. In Confluence, every space has a key, and renaming it could require administrative rights. So, I\u2019m thinking the appropriate category might be \"Administrative rights,\" as it's likely involves admin actions for renaming and updating keys. I considered \"Internal Project\" if it's about something specific like \"Friday PM,\" but \"Administrative rights\" feels more fitting due to the nature of the request!**Formulating the JSON output**\n\nI'm focusing on the phrase \"change key,\" which refers to changing the Confluence space key, something that requires admin rights for renaming the space. It's definitely not just about granting or revoking access; this is an admin operation. I need to follow the format for the output and ensure it's a JSON object with the category specified. So my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} and no extra text, which aligns perfectly with the instructions!{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
