It's clear the user is seeking a way to resolve their access difficulties.**Categorizing IT Ticket Requests**\n\nIt looks like the user is asking for access to a fixed assets meeting recording and has some concerns about file storage due to size issues. The main categories to consider here could be \"Access\" or \"Storage,\" with a possibility of \"Administrative rights\" or even \"Miscellaneous.\" The request focuses on gaining access to the meeting recording and also mentions challenges in locating a saved folder because of its large size.
