It mentions a cooler, a purchase requisition, a supplier, and other purchase-related terms. It seems to involve procuring hardware \u2014 specifically a cooler. Given the context of procurement and hardware references, the most appropriate category here would likely be \"Hardware.\" I'll label the ticket accordingly to reflect that it\u2019s focused on purchasing equipment.**Deciding on purchase category**\n\nThe ticket is primarily focused on the purchase requisition process for a cooler, which clearly relates to purchasing. I think the category \"Purchase\" fits best since it specifically addresses procurement, while \"Hardware\" could also apply since it's about a cooler device. However, it's crucial to stick with one category for the ticket, so \"Purchase\" wins out as the more relevant option. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with that category.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
