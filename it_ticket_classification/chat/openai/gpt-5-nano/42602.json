While it doesn't strictly fall under hardware, it\u2019s definitely an access control issue. The best category seems to be \"Access.\" Although, I wonder if \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they need their access rights adjusted.**Finalizing IT Ticket Response**\n\nIt\u2019s clear this is an access control issue, so the category \"Access\" fits perfectly. I\u2019ll return a JSON-like object formatted as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI need to stick to the exact requirements for submission, ensuring there\u2019s no extra commentary. It\u2019s interesting to think that \u201cth floor\u201d could refer to the 4th floor, but it\u2019s not necessary to clarify. My focus is to finalize this as \"Access.\""
