The user's inability to edit or add a time card suggests there may be access or permission issues. The categories available are \"HR Support\" and \"Access,\" which both seem relevant. Since this is an IT ticket related to time card access, I think \"Access\" might be the best fit for this issue.**Categorizing time card requests**\n\nThe user's request about editing or adding a time card likely means they're dealing with an HR system. They mentioned wanting to change existing cards, which hints at a software issue. I\u2019m considering whether to categorize this as \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" Since it\u2019s primarily about time cards\u2014an HR domain\u2014I think \"HR Support\" fits best. It doesn't seem to involve login issues or permissions specifically, so I'll stick with that categorization.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
