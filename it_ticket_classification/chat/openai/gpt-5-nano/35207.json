The content mentions CPU usage, applications, and troubleshooting, so the likely category could be \"Hardware,\" as it relates to performance. Other possibilities include \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project,\" but \"Hardware\" seems most relevant given the context. There isn\u2019t a specific category for \"Performance issue,\" so I\u2019ll go with one of the closest matches!**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to pick a category for the IT ticket based on the user's description. The mention of CPU usage and endpoint supports choosing \"Hardware,\" as it relates to performance issues. Although software is not an option, \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback, but it doesn't seem as fitting. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" since it connects well with CPU utilization. I\u2019ll output this in the required JSON format as: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}.**Confirming IT ticket response**\n\nI see the user mentioned \"block sometimes,\" which could relate to performance issues, but I\u2019m still leaning towards categorizing it as \"Hardware.\" Following the instructions, I\u2019ll prepare the response in a JSON format without any extra text. It needs to be concise and correctly quote everything. The final output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I'll make sure it adheres to the defined schema and is properly formatted. Let's go with that!"
