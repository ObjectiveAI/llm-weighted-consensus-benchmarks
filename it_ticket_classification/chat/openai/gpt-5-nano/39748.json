It seems like a new employee is struggling to access his laptop and possibly getting an account expired message. I think it could mean that he cannot sign into his laptop or is encountering issues related to a previously created account from an internship program. I should clarify: was there an account created earlier that\u2019s now affecting his access? This needs to be understood better!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like the new employee is having trouble accessing their laptop due to an expired account, likely tied to a previous internship program. I think the best category for this issue is \"Access\" since it directly relates to their logon issues. It could also fall under \"HR Support\" if it's focused on onboarding, but \"Access\" feels more appropriate here. I'll prepare a JSON object to reflect this, labeling the category as \"Access\" based on the context!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
