The mention of \"forbidden software\" and \"internal audit\" seems to indicate issues related to compliance. There\u2019s a focus on colleagues using games and file sharing, which could imply misuse of assets. From this, I\u2019m interpreting it as a compliance request, possibly needing a review of a report on the use of forbidden software.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, and it could relate to several areas: \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Internal Project.\" The main concern seems to involve an internal audit regarding forbidden software, with a request for a report and mentions of colleagues sharing games. It's unclear if they need access to the report or just want a reminder about the forbidden software. I should focus on access control and compliance when selecting the best fit category.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThis ticket could relate to policy enforcement or compliance. It mentions \u201cfile store\u201d and \u201cfile sharing,\u201d suggesting it might involve how assets are stored. The internal audit aspect points toward an \"Internal Project,\" as this is about evaluating forbidden software usage. I'm considering \"Administrative rights\" too, as it might concern access or installation rights for software. Given its focus on compliance and reporting, the best fit appears to be \"Internal Project,\" even though that label feels a bit vague.**Choosing a category**\n\nI'm weighing the options for categorizing this ticket. \"Access\" could fit since it deals with installation and restrictions on forbidden software, but there's no direct request for access. \"Administrative rights\" might pertain to controlling software installations or retrieving reports. The user's request to \"remind colleagues\" suggests a focus on policy enforcement, indicating administrative tasks. Given that the core issue is about auditing forbidden software, I'll categorize this as \"Internal Project\" since it relates to an internal audit task. \n\nNow, I should respond with a JSON object as requested, showing the chosen category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
