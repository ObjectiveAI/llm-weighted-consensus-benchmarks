The text mentions a leaver and details about deactivating a card, alongside confidentiality and environment printing issues. It seems relevant for the \"Access\" category because it involves deactivating access habits for a departing employee. However, it could also fit under \"HR Support.\" Still, considering the focus on card deactivation, I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate category for this ticket.**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019ve come across content that seems related to an employee leaving, which includes details about deactivating a card and mentions confidentiality. The right category to choose here would likely be \"Access,\" since it pertains to access removal for the card. I also consider \"Administrative Rights,\" but that usually involves software access privileges rather than physical card management. Given that it focuses on card deactivation, I\u2019ll stick with \"Access\" and prepare to output it in a JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
