We could suggest a sub-issue related to phishing emails or malware, but the output needs to be just a JSON object with the category. The user has asked me to categorize the ticket, so we'll present this simply as {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. It's important to keep the final answer strictly in that format without extra text.**Preparing output**\n\nI need to keep it simple and clear here. The instruction is to output only the JSON, without any additional text or explanations. So, I'll make sure to stick to that and just provide the clean JSON format in my final response. This will ensure the user gets exactly what they're looking for in a straightforward manner. Alright, let's proceed with just the JSON output."
