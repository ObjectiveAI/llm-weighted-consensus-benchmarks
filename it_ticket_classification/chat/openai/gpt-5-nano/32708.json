The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights, and Miscellaneous. It seems like \"Access\" could fit since they might need rights to download or install. However, they also mention \"download,\" which suggests installation is the priority. If nothing else matches better, \"Miscellaneous\" might be a fallback, but \"Access\" feels more targeted.**Categorizing ticket requests**\n\nIt seems there's no specific category for \"Mobile,\" so \"Miscellaneous\" is my best option for categorization. I need to format the response correctly as JSON, which includes the field for the category. I\u2019ll structure it as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. The user asked for a category, so I'll keep it simple by providing just that JSON object. I'll ensure it meets the required format. Let's finalize that!"
