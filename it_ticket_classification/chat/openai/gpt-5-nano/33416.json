The ticket mentions adding new colleagues to a PM mail and updating themselves, which likely relates to access or permissions for email distribution. \"PM\" could refer to project management, but other parts like \"head ext mob zone\" are unclear. I believe the user is asking for a guide to update their details in the system via a specific form.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the correct category for an IT ticket regarding access permissions. The user talks about adding new colleagues and PM mail, suggesting it relates to an email distribution list. I see two main categories: \"Access\" for general user access to systems, and \"Administrative rights\" for elevated permissions. Given the user's need to change details in a form, I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category. So, I\u2019d structure the answer as a JSON object indicating category: \"Access.\"**Formatting the IT ticket response**\n\nThe prompt is asking me to categorize an IT ticket and return the result in a specific JSON format. I\u2019ll need to ensure it looks like this: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}` and aligns with the provided categories. While the instructions say to respond with the category only, I think a brief note might add clarity for context. But I'll stick to the requirement for conciseness and just provide the necessary JSON response: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. Let's go ahead and deliver that!"
