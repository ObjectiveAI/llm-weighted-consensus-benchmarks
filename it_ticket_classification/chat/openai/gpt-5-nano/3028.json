It looks like it could relate to internal projects or administrative rights. I\u2019ll need to clarify the user\u2019s intent.**Categorizing satisfaction surveys**\n\nIt looks like the ticket is about satisfaction surveys, which doesn\u2019t fit in the categories of HR, hardware, or access. I\u2019m thinking it could be categorized as an \"Internal Project,\" given that it mentions revamping low scores and trigger systems. I\u2019ll consider the options: this ticket doesn't relate to storage or purchases either, so \"Internal Project\" seems to be the right fit! I\u2019ll craft the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Delivering category response**\n\nThe system requires a \"category\" field, so I need to respond with the appropriate JSON object. I won\u2019t include extra text \u2014 just the category object as instructed: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It's important to ensure correct spelling and that it exactly matches the enumerated value. The user's request was clear when they asked to categorize the IT ticket. I don't think there's a need for any clarifying questions here; I can deliver the response straightforwardly."
