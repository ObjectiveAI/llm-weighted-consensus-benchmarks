I think I need to choose the most fitting category for clarity.**Categorizing mailbox archiving request**\n\nThe ticket contains several mentions about the \"archive policy mailbox increase\" and seems to request an increase in capacity or retention policy. There are phrases about retaining messages and the need for steps regarding archiving. Given that it relates to mailbox storage policies, I believe the best category for this ticket is \"Storage.\" It seems clear this is about managing mailbox archive capacity. I should formulate the response as a JSON object with the category set to \"Storage.\"**Formatting JSON response**\n\nThe instruction specifies that I need to output a JSON object in a particular schema involving category options. Typically, I might respond simply with \"category: 'Storage,'\" but this time I need to adhere to the required format, which shows properties for the category. \n\nSince the schema indicates that the object has a \"category\" property, I should provide the response as {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. This seems to meet the expectations, so I'll finalize that as my answer without any extra text."
