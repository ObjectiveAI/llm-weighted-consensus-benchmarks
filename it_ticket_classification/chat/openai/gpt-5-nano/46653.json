The user mentioned various topics, including updating an absence report, history tracking, and issues with leavers from two years ago. I need to think about which category fits best from the list provided: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the content, \"HR Support\" seems to be the best fit.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing an IT ticket that involves access control and user data retention. It discusses displaying information, updating absence reports, and storing leaver data for historical tracking. This touches on data management, so \"Storage\" might fit for archiving and \"Access\" for visibility to others. \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant regarding permissions to clear the list. However, since it's primarily focused on the absence report and retention processes, \"Storage\" seems like the best choice.**Analyzing IT ticket text**\n\nI'm parsing a messy text regarding an IT ticket that centers on a few themes. First, it mentions \"leavers,\" referring to employees who left two years ago, with a focus on data retention and archiving. There\u2019s a mention of user display access that hints at privacy issues. Finally, it highlights a problem with updating an absence report, indicating that the leavers' list is outdated and older records need to be cleared. This all seems to point towards data management concerns.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants records cleared, and there\u2019s a desire for an explanation of the process and a fix to ensure automatic clearing. This indicates an incident related to data retention and privacy issues. Among the categories provided, \"Storage\" seems to best fit because it relates to retention and data purges. Although \"Access\" could work due to the display of information, it\u2019s less direct. So, I'll go with \"Storage\" and format my response as a simple JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Outputting category in JSON format**\n\nI see that the system requires a JSON object format for categorizing the IT ticket. The schema specifies that there should be a \"category\" property, which must match one of the enumerated options. Since \"Storage\" is the most fitting category, I\u2019ll keep my output simple and to the point: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I understand the need to follow this format precisely and will refrain from adding any additional notes, as the instruction emphasizes only providing the category."
