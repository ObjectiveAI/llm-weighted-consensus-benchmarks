I'll keep it simple since the task specifies to categorize the ticket.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to follow the system's instruction to respond with a JSON object format. The structure requires a specific schema, and I must return the category value. For this task, the category identified is \"Hardware.\" So, the output should be straightforward: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.
