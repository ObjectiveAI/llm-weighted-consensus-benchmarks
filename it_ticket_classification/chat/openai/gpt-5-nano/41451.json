They want me to categorize it into one of the options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nI need to output a JSON object with the selected category. I'll map the content to the most relevant category based on the text provided and format it correctly for the output. That should make it clear and functional for the user!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing a ticket that mentions a \"critical alert\" and some details about a data source, a computer, and recovery points. It sounds like there's been an unexpected termination causing issues, possibly related to backup or restore operations. Since it specifically talks about recovery points, I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"Storage,\" which fits well with backup-related issues. \n\nI\u2019ll go ahead and map this to the \"Storage\" category for clarity in my output!**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI'm looking over the categories again for the ticket. \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Miscellaneous\" don't seem relevant. \"Hardware\" might fit since it involves a computer reboot, but the focus on recovery points suggests it's more related to storage and backup issues. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Storage.\" \n\nI just need to ensure the format is correct according to the schema. So the final output will simply be {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. That should meet all requirements!"
