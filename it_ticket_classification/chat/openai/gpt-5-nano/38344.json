The categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket refers to terms like \"out switch,\" \"part number,\" and \"purchase order,\" which suggests it's about requesting hardware, specifically a switch product. It could fit under \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" There are mentions of set-top boxes and inputs, indicating it might be an HDMI or network switch being requested.**Classifying purchase requests**\n\nThe user is asking how to make a purchase order for a switch to connect multiple set-top boxes to a single TV input. This definitely indicates a hardware purchase request, which involves a procurement procedure. I need to categorize it, and \"Purchase\" seems most appropriate given that it's a clear request to acquire hardware. Since the ticket mentions \"part number,\" \"product,\" and \"purchase order,\" I will classify it as \"Purchase\" in the required JSON format.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
