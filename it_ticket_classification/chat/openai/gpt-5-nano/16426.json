The available categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since it relates to onboarding, I consider \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" Ultimately, I think it fits best under \"Access\" since new starters usually require access provisioning.**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe available categories include \"Administrative rights,\" which relates to admin privileges. A new starter would likely need access rights and accounts, possibly referring to \"ext\" for extension numbers. \"Starter form ext\" might suggest a request for an extension related to the starter form. I\u2019m thinking \"Access\" best fits, as it typically covers account setups and active directory needs for new starters. The mention of \"ext\" could imply phone extensions, reinforcing that \"Access\" is the right choice.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nLooking at the available categories, \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous\" aren't suitable, so I believe \"Access\" is the best fit for the new starter's account and extension provisioning. I need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category. The required format is straightforward: I\u2019ll just write {\"category\": \"Access\"} without any extra text. It\u2019s important to stick to this format, so I\u2019ll deliver only that!"
