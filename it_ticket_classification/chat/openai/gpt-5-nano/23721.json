The ticket seems to indicate that the user is requesting access to \"testing discipline\" scheduled for Thursday afternoon in December. Their mention of \"please give location\" suggests they're looking for more information about this access. Because of this, I\u2019ll go ahead and categorize this ticket as \"Access\" in the final JSON output.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI might also consider \"Administrative rights\" if they want access to a system or \"Internal Project\" for internal testing. However, \"testing discipline\" might refer to a school discipline or a lab environment. Since the ticket states they want to access \"testing discipline\" on a specific date, it seems more fitting to categorize this under \"Access.\" I'll prepare my final response in the required JSON format as {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
