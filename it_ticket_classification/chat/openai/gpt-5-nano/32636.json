The mention of \"oracle approval\" suggests it might relate to software, while the word \"delegate\" hints at an issue with permission. Overall, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit, considering the focus on internal tasks and the delegation involved.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out how to categorize this IT ticket that involves requesting delegation for approvals. Based on the user\u2019s message, \"delegate oracle approval for internal projects,\" it mainly concerns permissions and delegation processes. I think \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit because it focuses on granting approval rights. However, \"Internal Project\" could also apply since it\u2019s about internal tasks. Ultimately, I need to choose one category string that captures the essence of the request.{\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}"
