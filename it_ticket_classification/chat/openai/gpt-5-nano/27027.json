It looks like \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d might be the best fit here!**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m categorizing an IT ticket regarding administrative actions to adjust notifications. The options include \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Administrative rights\" seems to relate to changes in access, but this ticket focuses on removing notifications, which doesn't fit perfectly. While the \"Access\" category might apply if it involved notification settings, it's not about user access. It feels like \"Miscellaneous\" could also work here, as this action doesn't clearly fit into any specific category. JSON format will be used to present the category.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
