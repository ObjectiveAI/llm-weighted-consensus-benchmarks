The message mentions a \"project manager change,\" and there's a reference to \"head digital,\" which might suggest administrative changes or access rights. The user might also be asking for help related to the project manager's schedule on a specific date. Given these clues, it seems most fitting to categorize this under \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll prepare the output in the required JSON-like format.**Mapping IT ticket category**\n\nI need to figure out the right category for this ticket. It mentions a project manager change, which could indicate it's related to an internal project. \"Change pas\" might point to changing passwords, and phrases like \"let yourselves let anyone adjusted\" suggest access rights. There's \"head digital,\" perhaps as a sign-off. \"Access\" seems fitting since it covers password changes and permissions, while \"Administrative rights\" could work too, focusing on user permissions. I need to find the best fit.**Categorizing admin rights request**\n\nIn IT ticket systems, requests to change admin rights usually fall under a specific category. The text mentions \"administrative rights,\" which feels a bit ambiguous. The reference to a \"project manager change\" could relate to roles and access rights, making \"Access\" a likely category. It might also fit under \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s about internal changes in management. Given the context, I think \"Access\" is the safest choice since it broadly covers changing who can access project elements. \"Administrative rights\" would be narrower and more risky.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
