The schema specifies that the output should look like {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll stick with that to ensure clarity and correctness. It seems straightforward, but I want to ensure I'm following instructions accurately!**Confirming final response format**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that \"HR Support\" is the best category for this response. Since the instructions specify that I should return only the JSON object without any additional text, I\u2019ll stick to just that format. The final response will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It's important to follow these guidelines accurately, and I\u2019m making sure there\u2019s no extra formatting. Keeping it straightforward is my goal here!"
