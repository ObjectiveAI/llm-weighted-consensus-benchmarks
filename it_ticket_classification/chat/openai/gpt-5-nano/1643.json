I\u2019ll consider the content of the ticket carefully to determine which category fits best. It's important to make the right choice, so I want to take my time and ensure it's accurate. This will help streamline the process and make sure the right team handles it!**Identifying Offboarding Tickets**\n\nI see that the content refers to an offboarding or leaver form process. There are references to items like Active Directory (AD) rights, mailbox setups, roaming profiles, and details about mobile phone subscriptions. This suggests it relates to processing a leaver\u2019s information and rights regarding their exit. I'll ensure I'm categorizing this accurately to facilitate a smooth transition for the leaver and properly address all necessary administrative tasks. It\u2019s important to handle this carefully!**Categorizing Offboarding Process**\n\nI'm looking at a leaver's process that includes various elements like a departure date, mailbox, roaming profile, and AD rights. I think \u201cAccess\u201d is the most suitable category since it involves managing access rights connected to the leaver. Even though \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could also fit, it seems more focused on provisioning rather than de-provisioning. Since this is related to offboarding, I\u2019ll stick with \u201cAccess.\u201d I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object to reflect that category clearly!**Returning JSON Object**\n\nI need to return a JSON object according to the specified schema. I\u2019ll go with {\"category\":\"Access\"} since that\u2019s the appropriate classification for the IT ticket. I want to make sure I'm following the guidelines exactly, as the instructions specify that I shouldn't include any extra text\u2014just the JSON object. I'll output it clearly without additional commentary. Okay, here it is: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That should meet the requirements perfectly!"
