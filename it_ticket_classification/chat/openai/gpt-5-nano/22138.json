It mentions \"new list Thursday PM person\" which might indicate a request to create a new list on that day. The term \"panthers\" could refer to a project or group. Lastly, \"bubble brains\" might be the name of this list or project, where the user wants to add themselves. I'm leaning toward categorizing this under \"Administrative rights.\"**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating a request to create something and add themselves. It could fall under \"Internal Project\" or \"Access,\" as adding themselves hints at access rights, but there's no explicit request regarding permissions. The phrase \"add myself\" may indicate they're looking to be added to a list. Since they want to create a group or list titled \"Bubble Brains\" linked to \"panthers,\" I think \"Internal Project\" best fits, given it\u2019s about the new list.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the phrase \"new list Thursday PM person.\" This could suggest a scheduled group meeting. \"Panthers\" might refer to a team name. When they say \"also please create called bubble brains,\" it seems like they want to set up a project or list named \"Bubble Brains\" and add themselves to it. For categorization, \"Internal Project\" fits best. It could be \"Access\" if adding themselves implies gaining user access, but there\u2019s no clear request for permissions. \"Internal Project\" seems the most appropriate.**Formatting IT Ticket Response**\n\nI\u2019m considering that \"Administrative rights\" would apply if the user wanted admin rights, which isn\u2019t explicitly mentioned in their request. Based on the instructions, I need to respond with a JSON object. The category would be marked as \"Internal Project.\" \n\nSo, my final response needs to be in the specified format. It looks like I should produce something like:  \n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}  \nThis aligns with the user\u2019s intent to categorize their IT ticket correctly.**Finalizing the JSON Response**\n\nI see that I need to respond with the category properly formatted. The instructions suggest I should wrap it under a \"## category\" heading. However, I've noticed that earlier tasks have only required the plain JSON object without additional notes.\n\nTo keep it simple and concise, I\u2019ll format my response as:  \n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}  \nThis should meet the requirements without unnecessary complexity, ensuring clarity for the user while sticking to the expected response style."
