It seems to focus on configuring access rights and shared mailboxes. I need to figure out which category fits best, and \u201cAccess\u201d seems like a strong candidate.**Analyzing requisition requests**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a collection of requests regarding requisitions. There are phrases like \"owner of requisitions,\" \"generic creation,\" and \"added members.\" It's clear the requests involve configuring owners, groups, and mailboxes. One part mentions needing to add users and refers to specific properties for modification. Overall, these requests seem related to managing access and collaboration within shared mailboxes and personal mailboxes, with lots of jargon that could use some clarification to understand better.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThis request seems focused on creating a generic user account and adding owners and members to requisitions. It mentions shared and personal mailboxes, access rights, and how lists are accessed, pointing to permissions. My instinct is to categorize this as \"Access\" since it primarily revolves around permissions and mailbox access. While \"Administrative rights\" is also an option, Access fits better. I\u2019ll make sure to respond with a concise JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and avoid unnecessary elaboration.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
