They mention \"allocation new purchase\" and \"purchase order,\" which suggests it's related to purchasing. Key phrases like \"log allocation\" and \"mandatory receipts section\" pop up too. It seems best to categorize this ticket under \"Purchase.\" Though the message isn\u2019t very clear, the focus on purchase orders points me in that direction.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s input suggests it's focused on procurement, mentioning phrases like \"allocation new purchase\" and \"purchase order.\" So, I think the \"Purchase\" category is the right choice among the options provided. While \u201cInternal Project\u201d could apply, it seems more relevant to categorize this as a purchase matter, given the context around orders and receipts. \n\nI'll respond with the required JSON format, ensuring it\u2019s clean and straightforward:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
