The ticket mentions needing to fill out a form and includes the timeline, which leans toward HR. Although HR Support is not strictly IT, it can involve IT processes. I should consider whether to classify it as \"HR Support,\" but \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could be options depending on the specific needs mentioned. It's a bit confusing!**Deciding ticket categorization**\n\nThe ticket content mentions \"returning from maternity leave\" several times, and it\u2019s unclear if it refers to access re-enablement or updating the user's status. It might lean towards \"Access\" since it involves permissions or account setup, but there's also a strong HR aspect due to the maternity leave mention. Ultimately, I think the best fit is \"Access,\" as it relates to re-enabling permissions. I\u2019ll need to format my response into a JSON object with the category key.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
