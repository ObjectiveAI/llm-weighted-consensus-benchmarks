The ticket involves importing contacts and mentions \"import ad\" multiple times, which suggests tasks related to Active Directory (AD). The categories available are hardware, HR support, access, and more. Given the context, it seems like this should be classified as an \u201cInternal Project\u201d since it's focused on managing contacts within AD. I\u2019ll ensure it fits this category before finalizing the classification.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing how to categorize an IT ticket, considering options like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Since this ticket is related to Active Directory imports, it seems access-related and focuses on managing contacts. I believe \"Access\" is the most fitting category because it involves access control. While \"Administrative rights\" also applies, it leans more towards elevating privileges. Given that this is about adding to Active Directory, I'll go with \"Access\" for the categorization.**Formatting JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"import contacts to AD,\" which relates to access management, so I think \"Access\" is the appropriate category. I need to respond with a JSON object that includes \"category\": \"Access.\" The instructions show a specific schema format, so I\u2019ll ensure it adheres to that. My final output will be a simple JSON object like this: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. I\u2019ll keep it concise without any extra explanation.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
