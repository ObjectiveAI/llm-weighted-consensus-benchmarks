Since the content doesn't clearly fit into a specific category, it could possibly be \"Miscellaneous,\" or relate to \"Internal Project\" or \"Access.\" The term \"Snow\" might also reference the Snow software used in IT asset management. Since it's vague, opting for \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the safest choice.**Finalizing the IT ticket category**\n\nThe IT ticket I'm categorizing doesn't seem to fit into any specific category like hardware, storage, or access. The best choice here is \"Miscellaneous.\" I need to use the correct JSON format for this, which should look like {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I'll confirm that this is the single category the user wanted since their request was straightforward. Following the guidelines, my final response will strictly be the JSON object without any extra commentary. Here it is: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
