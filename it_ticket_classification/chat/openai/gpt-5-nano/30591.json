The ticket covers topics like database sizes and system specifications for both production and staging environments, with mentions of CPU and disk. \n\nGiven these details, it seems related to infrastructure and system requirements. Therefore, the most fitting category would be either Storage or Hardware. I\u2019ll go with Storage since it\u2019s more specific to databases.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI see the ticket mentions CPU and disk, which could point towards Hardware. However, \"database sizes\" definitely relates to Storage capacity. The categories available don't mention \"Infrastructure\" or \"Systems,\" so I think \"Storage\" is the best fit for this ticket, considering the focus on storage sizes. Since it\u2019s about categorizing rather than resolving the issue, I'll output a JSON object with the category set to \"Storage,\" following the provided schema.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
