The message mentions \"replenishment\" and \"package,\" which suggests it's related to inventory or purchasing. The user seems to be asking for a replacement wireless mouse, so it could fit into \"Hardware\" since it's about a physical device, or \"Purchase\" due to the replenishment aspect. I\u2019ll weigh these two categories carefully for the final classification.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket that mentions a \"package requested by feeling mouse mobile wireless mouse.\" It looks like the user is requesting a wireless mouse and asking to log a replenishment order, which indicates inventory management. In IT support, I typically categorize such hardware requests as either \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" Given that it involves procuring a new mouse, the \"Purchase\" category seems the most fitting. I\u2019ll create a JSON object to reflect this: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
