It's specifically a performance issue that may involve infrastructure changes. I can consider it as either an Internal Project or Miscellaneous, but \"Internal Project\" feels best because it addresses testing and load performance. The mention of weekend maintenance suggests relevant changes. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as an Internal Project and prepare a JSON-like object with that category.**Formatting the JSON response**\n\nThe required format is clear: I need to create a JSON object that specifies the category. The user asked to categorize an IT ticket, so I should respond with something like {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I see that the structure should include \"type\":\"object\" and \"properties\" with a defined category. It\u2019s essential to keep the response concise, with no extra explanation, and make sure to match the capitalization in \"Internal Project\" correctly. I'll finalize this now!"
