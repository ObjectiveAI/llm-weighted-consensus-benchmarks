The ticket mentions \"allocate back cover lite phone,\" which indicates they're likely requesting a hardware component. So, I have two possible categories: \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" Since it seems like they're asking about a specific part rather than a purchase, I'll go with \"Hardware\" for this ticket.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nIn ticket systems, hardware issues typically include devices and accessories, and \"back cover\" qualifies as a hardware accessory. If the user is looking to allocate a back cover, this would mean an inventory allocation. The two potential categories here are \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" I think I\u2019d lean toward \"Hardware\" since it concerns an internal asset. However, if it\u2019s more about procuring, \"Purchase\" might fit. Given it's a request for a physical part, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\"**Preparing IT Ticket Response**\n\nThe instruction is to categorize an IT ticket, which means I need to respond with a JSON object. I'll use the category \"Hardware\" since it's appropriate. The correct format is { \"category\": \"...\" } with \"type\" being \"object.\" So I\u2019ll structure my response as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.\n\nIt\u2019s important to ensure proper casing, and \"Hardware\" is a valid option. I\u2019ll keep the explanation brief since the user just wants the categorization. So, it will be just the JSON output."
