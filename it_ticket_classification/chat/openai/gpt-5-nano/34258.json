The ticket discusses errors in timecard entries, where the user cannot delete or correct them, indicating submission issues. Given that the ticket revolves around HR system problems, \"HR Support\" seems like the most fitting category. However, there's also a consideration for \"Access\" since it hints at permission issues. But ultimately, I think \"HR Support\" is the best choice for this ticket.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
