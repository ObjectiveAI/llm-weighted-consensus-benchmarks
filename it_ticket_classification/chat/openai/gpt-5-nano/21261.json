The phrases mention things like \"cleaning process clarifications,\" \"progress done,\" and \"drag drop progress issue.\" It seems related to software development or process clarifications. While \"Internal Project\" feels like a fitting category, I also see potential for \"Miscellaneous.\" However, specific terms like \"Software\" or \"Development\" aren't options here, which makes this a bit tricky. I'll lean towards \"Internal Project\" for this ticket.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI think the most fitting category for this ticket is \"Internal Project.\" It covers themes like project tasks, progress, cleaning process clarifications, and the drag drop issue. The instructions specify that I need to respond with a JSON-like object containing the \"category\" field with the string value. So, I\u2019ll output it simply as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I want to be straightforward and stick to the format without adding extra explanations. Let\u2019s get this done!"
