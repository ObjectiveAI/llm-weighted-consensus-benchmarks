The prompt provides a schema with eight categories like \u201cHardware,\u201d \u201cHR Support,\u201d and others. I need to analyze the text from the ticket to determine the most appropriate category. The ticket requests a monitor, so it seems that \"Hardware\" is likely the right choice. I'll ensure the output complies with the specified JSON structure.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket is clearly asking for a big screen monitor, probably for a work-related virtual machine. Given that it mentions needing to order a monitor, I'd lean towards categorizing this as \"Purchase\" since it focuses on ordering. However, I could also consider \"Hardware\" since it's related to a hardware request. Still, since the emphasis is on the ordering aspect, \"Purchase\" seems like the best fit for this ticket.**Formatting the output**\n\nI want to make sure I provide the JSON output correctly for the IT ticket categorization. The requirement is clear: it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I need to ensure it aligns with the specified format as an object containing the \"category\" field. Since the instructions suggest avoiding heavy formatting, I'll present the JSON plainly on its own line without extra bullet points. This keeps it straightforward and clear for the user."
