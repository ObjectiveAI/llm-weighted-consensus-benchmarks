For employee cards, it might be \u201cHR Support.\u201d I realize I need to ask for clarification since there are various interpretations. I\u2019ll propose initial guesses while prompting the user for more context to be accurate!**Categorizing card requests**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to categorize \u201ccards re card.\u201d If it relates to access badges, I\u2019d label it as \u201cAccess.\u201d But if it\u2019s about payment cards or hardware, I really need clarity from the user. I noticed the prompt includes a JSON schema that asks for a category object, which should follow the required format. Since I lack confidence in my categorization, I\u2019ll propose my best guess and ask for confirmation instead.**Deciding on category output**\n\nSince we're dealing with a single category, I can provide a tentative category while also asking for confirmation. The UI seems to require a JSON object, so I think a suitable response would be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI should clarify that this is based on the assumption that it\u2019s about access cards. However, the output must strictly follow the category object format. To avoid any parsing issues, it\u2019s probably best to just output the JSON object without any extra text.**Choosing the category**\n\nSince the user asked to categorize \u201ccards re card sorry,\u201d it\u2019s a little unclear what they meant. If I just say \u201cAccess\u201d and it\u2019s not what they intended, they might need to correct me. However, \u201cAccess\u201d seems to be the most plausible option. So, I\u2019ll proceed and output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThis should keep things straightforward, and it allows for future clarification if necessary."
