There's mention of high importance, so I'll lean toward \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, I think \"Access\" fits best since it's the core request. The response will need to be a JSON object with that category. Here we go:\n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Access\"}}**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI need to follow the specified schema, which tells me that the response must be a JSON object containing a \"category\" string. It seems the correct output should be a straightforward response of {\"category\":\"Access\"}. However, there is also mention of including a type object, but the primary need looks to be just the category itself. So I'll go with the clean response of {\"category\":\"Access\"} and avoid any extra text. Here we go!"
