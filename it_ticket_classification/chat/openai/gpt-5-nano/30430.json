The ticket text mentions something about a new project called \"Wednesday\" and issues related to completing screens. \n\nI'll refer to the defined category taxonomy, which includes options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since it's about a project, I think \u201cInternal Project\u201d might be the best category for this. I'll format this in JSON as required.**Classifying a UI issue**\n\nI\u2019m interpreting that the user is reporting a UI issue where they can\u2019t press a button to complete a screen that has mandatory fields. There are mentions of terms like \"mandatory complete screen\" and \"select different than none,\" which leads me to think this is related to an internal project, specifically one called \"Wednesday.\" Given the context, I believe \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category. So, I'll format my response in JSON with the appropriate category.**Outputting the category in JSON**\n\nI need to finalize a JSON object with the category field that we classified as \"Internal Project.\" The format should be straightforward, just like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. \n\nI\u2019m thinking that it\u2019s best to keep this simple and stick to just the JSON output without any extra notes or elaboration, since that's what the instructions specify. So, I'll deliver the JSON as it is without any additional explanation."
