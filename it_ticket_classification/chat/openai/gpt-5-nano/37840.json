It sounds like the user might be having difficulty accessing information related to their line manager or perhaps HR matters. I\u2019ll need to decide between categories like Access or HR Support for this ticket, since it involves visibility and possibly assistance with a system issue.**Categorizing IT issue**\n\nI'm trying to categorize this IT ticket, which seems to concern access to view a \u201cline manager.\u201d The message is pretty unclear but implies issues with permissions or visibility in the system. Given the mention of a \"line manager,\" it likely fits into the \"Access\" category, possibly relating to administrative rights.
