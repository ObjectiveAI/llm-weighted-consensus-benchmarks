So, my answer will be that the category is \"Purchase.\" I'll format the response as a JSON object according to the \"category\" structure.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nThe instruction is to provide a JSON-like response that includes a \"category\" field with specific allowed values. The format required is based on a schema, but I realize they want the actual content to be structured as a JSON object. Since this IT ticket should be categorized as \"Purchase,\" I\u2019ll simply respond with the correct format. So, my output will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It's concise and directly meets the requirements without extra text."
