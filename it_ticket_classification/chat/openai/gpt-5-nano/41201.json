It seems to revolve around logging hours and finding codes. This could relate to \"Access\" issues if they're having trouble accessing the timecard system, or it might fall under \"HR Support\" since timecards connect to HR and payroll. Given that the request is explicitly about a timecard, I'd lean towards categorizing it as \"HR Support.\"**Classifying the Ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"can't find code\" likely refers to a timecard code within the user's timecard portal. Since they mention logging hours but don't discuss login credentials, it seems they're facing an issue related to the timecard rather than access. This falls squarely within the HR/payroll domain, so categorizing it as \"HR Support\" makes sense. I'm going to respond with a JSON category object, confirming the classification as \"HR Support.\"{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
