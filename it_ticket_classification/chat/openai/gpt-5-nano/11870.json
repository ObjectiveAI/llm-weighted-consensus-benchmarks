It seems like the ticket is about an access issue to a \"team section\" due to recent role changes. The user mentioned \"roles changed recently,\" indicating a problem with permissions. I have to choose between the categories \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the issue is mainly about access, I think I'll go with \"Access\" as the most suitable category for this ticket.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket revolves around the user's inability to access a section due to recent role changes. While \"Administrative rights\" could relate to admin privileges, the user's description suggests the issue is primarily about access problems. They've indicated they're assigned a role, and since they didn't specifically request admin privileges, the best category seems to be \"Access.\" I should provide this as a JSON object, formatted according to the schema provided, with the category string included.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
