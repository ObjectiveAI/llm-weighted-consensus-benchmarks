This could fit under \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d However, since changing mailbox ownership is an admin task, I think the best fit is \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d It\u2019s about modifying mailbox permissions, which aligns with admin responsibilities.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI'm trying to figure out if \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" fits better for this ticket about changing mailbox owners. \"Administrative rights\" seems right since it's about ownership permissions, but it could just fit under \"Access\" too, since it's related to control over mailboxes. The mention of \"owner\" and \"mailboxes\" hints at an admin task, possibly in Exchange. I think I\u2019ll go with \"Access,\" as it feels more generic. Now, I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON-like object.**Finalizing category choice**\n\nThe ticket concerns mailbox ownership, which relates to access control. However, \"change owner for all mailboxes\" indicates it's really an administrative task to update those mailbox settings. The user\u2019s mention of \"re hi left owner\" likely means they want to reassign due to someone leaving, making this about access management. Since \"Administrative rights\" is specific to ownership changes, I\u2019ll go with that category. I\u2019ll present the response in the requested JSON format without extra commentary."
