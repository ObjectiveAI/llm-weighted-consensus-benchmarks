                    "reasoning": "**Evaluating category for request**\n\nThe categories for IT helpdesk seem to include hardware, HR support, access, and administrative rights, among others. The user wants to add public holidays to Oracle, which sounds like a system configuration change, often requiring administrative rights. It\u2019s not about hardware or storage, and it doesn\u2019t fall under purchase or access. Since it involves modifying holidays in an Oracle calendar, the best-fitting category might be \"Administrative rights,\" or maybe \"Miscellaneous\" if I'm unsure.**Analyzing category for Oracle request**\n\nIf the task involves adding data to the Oracle system, it sounds like a backend configuration change that may need admin privileges for modifying the calendar or holidays. The ticket category \"Administrative rights\" focuses on permissions rather than tasks. The user asks to \"add public holidays,\" which doesn\u2019t fit directly into a \"task request\" category. The \"Internal Project\" category seems fitting since this is about configuring the system to include Macedonian holidays, but it\u2019s not about access rights.**Considering category selection**\n\nI think \"Miscellaneous\" is a safe, generic option, but it might be better to provide a specific category and justification. The user asked to categorize an IT ticket, so I should suggest either \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nThe user's intent is to modify the Oracle system to add public holidays. While \"Administrative rights\" could work since changes might need permissions, the ticket seems more focused on the action itself. I\u2019d suggest \u201cInternal Project\u201d if it\u2019s part of a project to update holidays. Should I avoid asking clarifying questions, though?**Determining appropriate category**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize the request, so I should provide a category along with some rationale to avoid misclassification. This task involves a configuration change in the Oracle system, likely needing admin privileges, so I could suggest either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project.\" \n\nThe system requires a specific JSON-like response, producing an object with a category field. Given that the action is about adding public holidays, I think I\u2019ll lean toward choosing \"Administrative rights,\" since performing changes may indeed necessitate those privileges. However, the user didn't specifically ask for admin rights.**Selecting the right category**\n\nIn many companies, requests like this might be categorized as \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" In this case, \"Internal Project\" seems most suitable since adding public holidays to Oracle is a small change related to \"HR and systems configuration.\" \n\nEven though it involves modifying the Oracle system, I realize this task isn't focused on granted rights. So, I lean towards \"Administrative rights,\" since such changes usually need admin privileges. I\u2019ll stick to the format and simply deliver: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
