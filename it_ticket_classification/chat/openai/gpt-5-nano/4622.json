Given the mentions of \"workstation\" and \"notebook,\" it looks like they\u2019re asking for a keyboard for one of those devices. If I have to choose, I would go with \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" If it's about procurement, \"Purchase\" might make more sense, while \"Hardware\" fits a general request for a keyboard.**Determining category output**\n\nThe instructions say to categorize the IT ticket, so I need to create a JSON-like object. The possible categories are things like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and more. Based on the provided text that mentions \u201ckeyboard\u201d and \u201crequest,\u201d I\u2019m thinking \"Hardware\" is the best choice since it\u2019s a general hardware request. While \"Purchase\" could be appropriate if they want to procure a keyboard, \"Hardware\" fits more closely with the request for a device in general. So, I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Finalizing category for IT ticket**\n\nThe user has asked to categorize an IT ticket with a focus on the words \"request\" and \"keyboard.\" I\u2019m weighing my options: a \"keyboard request\" would generally be an asset request. While it could hint at \"Purchase\" for ordering, the content doesn't indicate a fault but rather a simple request. Since it\u2019s mostly about a device, I feel \"Hardware\" is the safest option. So, I\u2019ll go with the final output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
