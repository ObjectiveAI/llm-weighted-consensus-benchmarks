The categories include things like \"HR Support,\" but that doesn't seem quite right if it's just scheduling. \"Administrative rights\" isn't it either, since that's about permissions. I believe \"Internal Project\" might fit best, considering the context of contractor extension for planning.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nAlright, the ticket mentions a contractor extension and updating the end date to ensure it includes Friday. This seems like a scheduling or planning request related to project management. The most fitting category appears to be \"Internal Project.\" \"Administrative rights\" doesn't apply here since that concerns permissions, not scheduling. So, I'll respond with the appropriate JSON object to categorize it as \"Internal Project.\""
