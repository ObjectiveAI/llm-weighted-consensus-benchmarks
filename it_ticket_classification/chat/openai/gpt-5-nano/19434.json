The ticket mentions \"create knowledge base\" and \"permissions\" repetitively. It could relate to Access due to \"permissions\" or may fit under Internal Project or Miscellaneous. The overall content suggests it\u2019s about setting up a knowledge base and managing its permissions, so categorizing it correctly is essential.**Classifying ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions needing more details and references \"permissions,\" suggesting it relates to Access due to the focus on approvals. It also includes \"create knowledge base,\" hinting at an internal project. Ultimately, since the main concern revolves around access rights for the knowledge base, I\u2019ll classify the ticket as Access. I need to reply exclusively with the required JSON format, so it will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's keep it simple and do that!"
