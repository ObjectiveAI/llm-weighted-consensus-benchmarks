It looks like a security rollout message detailing issues like gateway timeouts, web app loading problems, and some attached screen grabs. The ticket talks about \"security rollout issues\" and mentions an \"anti-end client.\" It seems most relevant to either \"Internal Project\" due to the rollout aspect or \"Administrative Rights\" if adjustments to access are needed. Let's pick the most fitting category.**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"disable or order test if giving trouble,\" which is a bit unclear. Considering the options, \u201cInternal Project\u201d feels right for a rollout and deployment. While \u201cAccess\u201d could apply due to gateway timeout issues, it seems more aligned with deployment. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \u201cInternal Project.\u201d I need to respond in JSON format as specified. The output will just be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. No extra text is necessary!**Confirming Category Fit**\n\nI want to make sure I have the right category here. The content indeed talks about a rollout of security software with phrases like \"phase wide\" and requests for understanding during the process. This clearly points to it being an internal project. So, it\u2019s settled: I\u2019ll finalize it as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Now I just need to provide that as my response."
