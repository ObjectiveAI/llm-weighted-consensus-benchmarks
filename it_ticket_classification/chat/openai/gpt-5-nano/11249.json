The content mentions several keywords like \"new delivery,\" \"installation tickets,\" \"order number,\" \"administration,\" and \"invoice.\" It sounds like it could fit under \"Purchase\" since it refers to order numbers and POs. However, it could also be categorized as \"Hardware\" due to the mention of PCs. I need to parse this carefully to determine the best fit for the ticket.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket mentions installing two PCs and logging installation tickets, which gives me a couple of options. It could fit as \"Internal Project\" if it's part of a larger initiative. However, categories like \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase\" are also contenders. \n\n\"Hardware\" makes sense because it involves physical devices like PCs, while \"Purchase\" relates to the mentioned purchase orders and invoices. Yet, the primary focus seems to be on the installation tasks, so that might lean more towards \"Hardware.\" I need to decide which fits best!**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate category for this ticket since it revolves around PCs and installation tasks. Options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Miscellaneous\" don\u2019t seem to fit well. \n\nBased on the user's request to categorize the IT ticket, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with just the category. My final output is: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra commentary or anything beyond that!"
