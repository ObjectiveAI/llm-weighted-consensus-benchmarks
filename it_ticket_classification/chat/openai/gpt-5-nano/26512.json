If the user is looking to change user permissions, then \"Administrative rights\" might be chosen. But if it's about approval flow, that's more about process flow, not hardware. The mention of \"weekly Wednesday November pm flow\" might suggest some scheduling aspect. Overall, I'll lean towards categorizing it as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\".**Choosing category for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing the request as \"Administrative rights\" since it involves changing codes and modifying approval flow, which relates directly to admin permissions. The prompt asks to categorize the IT ticket, implying that the output should be in JSON format. I\u2019ll keep it simple and respond with just the necessary JSON structure without over-elaborating. My final answer will be: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. Conciseness is key here!"
