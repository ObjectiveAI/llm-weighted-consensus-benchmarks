The user\u2019s request is a bit jumbled, mentioning issues with direct reports missing time for Thursday in November, and there seem to be procedural issues with submitting weekly reports. This hints towards a problem related to HR Support or Administrative rights. I'll infer which category best fits this ticket.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI believe this request is about ensuring that direct reports submit their timesheets weekly. While I initially considered \"Administrative rights,\" it seems more fitting to classify it under \"HR Support\" since it deals with timesheets and reporting. \"Access\" could be relevant if they need system access but isn't the main focus. It seems this is primarily about HR processes. Therefore, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object indicating the category as \"HR Support,\" following the specified format.**Finalizing JSON Format**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category as \"HR Support.\" The given instruction indicates I should structure it correctly, so it could look like: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. But there\u2019s also a schema mentioned previously, which outlines the formatting. However, to keep things straightforward and avoid unnecessary content, I\u2019ll stick with just: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This keeps it concise and directly addresses the user\u2019s request."
