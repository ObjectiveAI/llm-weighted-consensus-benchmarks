It sounds like this involves sharing information and helping groups work together, which points towards an access-related issue. Given the context, I think assigning this ticket to the \"Access\" category makes the most sense. I\u2019ll make sure to confirm that classification!**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like the user is making an access request related to a library or list, along with mentions of collaboration tools and central storage. While it seems like an \"Access\" request, I also see references that could fit under \"Storage\" or \"Internal Project.\" However, the core issue is the access request. So, I'll categorize this under \"Access.\" I can format this as a JSON object to match the required schema. Here it goes!\n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Access\"}}**Outputting the category in JSON**\n\nThe schema dictates that I should return the answer in a specific format. For similar tasks, I typically provide the category string as JSON. Here, it confirms that I need to output just the category as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. While including justification might be nice, the instructions only ask for the categorization itself. So, to keep it simple and clear, I'll stick to just outputting the JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
