The ticket discusses timecard approval errors, changes in line manager flow, and high priority investigations. It seems to be predominantly related to HR system issues, particularly with the timecard approval process. So, I'm thinking \"HR Support\" is the best fit since it specifically addresses HR-related systems and concerns.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
