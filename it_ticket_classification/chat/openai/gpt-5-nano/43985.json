The user mentions urgency and the need for help, but at the heart of it, the problem is about access. Given the context, this clearly falls into the \"Access\" category because it relates to the guest password not working. So, I'll format my response as a JSON object, labeling the category as \"Access\".**Producing JSON Output**\n\nI'm preparing to categorize an IT ticket, and I've determined the output format should be a JSON-like object. The category is \"Access,\" as the issue revolves around a guest password not functioning, which is an access management concern. I want to ensure there's no confusion regarding whether \"Administrative rights\" might be more fitting, but it seems \"Access\" is indeed correct here. I\u2019ll deliver just the valid JSON without any extra commentary. So, the output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
