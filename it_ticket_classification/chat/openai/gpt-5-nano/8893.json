Since we don\u2019t have a specific \"Software\" category, I could consider \"Miscellaneous.\" If they need administrative access to make those changes, \"Administrative rights\" might be a fit too.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm figuring out how to categorize this ticket regarding display appearance adjustments. It involves software configuration, but since it relates to hardware (monitors), I\u2019m considering options like \"Hardware\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Typically, changing display appearance relates to settings, not hardware replacement. If it's a general request, \"Miscellaneous\" feels right, but if it involves monitors, I'll go with \"Hardware.\" I need to provide a JSON-like output with the chosen category based on the defined structure.**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that \"Miscellaneous\" is the best category for this vague request about changing the appearance of displays. While \"Hardware\" could work since it's about monitors, the request focuses more on themes and settings. Since \"Software\" isn't an option, \"Miscellaneous\" fits better. I\u2019ll wrap my final response in the required JSON object format with the following output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} \n\nJust keeping it straightforward without extra commentary. Let's go ahead!"
