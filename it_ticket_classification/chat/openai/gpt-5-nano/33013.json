The text suggests they might be asking for hardware or a purchase. Since they mentioned \"please provide video cable,\" it seems they might be requesting equipment, which points to the \"Hardware\" category. However, if they want to procure a new one, it could fit into \"Purchase.\" Each category has a different focus, so I must choose carefully.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI believe \"Hardware\" is the right choice since it's about a physical cable, but if the ticket requests a purchase, \"Purchase\" could work too. The content mentions \"provide video cable,\" which indicates a hardware request. Considering the system expects specific categories, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware.\" I need to format this in JSON, using proper capitalization. The required output is simple: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. So, I\u2019ll respond with that. Let's proceed!"
