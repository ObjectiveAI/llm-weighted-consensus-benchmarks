The user asked me to categorize the ticket, so my response should be a JSON object containing the category field. \"Miscellaneous\" feels right because there's no exact match. I briefly considered \"Access,\" but this isn\u2019t about permissions; it\u2019s about an email deliverability issue. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.
