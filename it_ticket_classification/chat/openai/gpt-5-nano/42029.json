The user is experiencing problems with submitting reports, saving print previews, and generating them correctly, which seems to indicate an application or access issue. Given the context, the most fitting category appears to be \"Access\" since it's related to their inability to submit expense reports. I'll format this into a JSON object based on the allowed categories.**Categorizing IT ticket options**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating the available categories for the IT ticket about an expense report issue. \"HR Support\" could work since expense reports relate to payroll, but \"Administrative Rights\" might fit if there\u2019s a permission issue. \"Access\" seems appropriate due to login and submission problems across multiple browsers indicating an application issue. I'll focus on outputting a JSON object with \"Access\" as the likely category since it best aligns with the user's request and context.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out how to categorize this IT ticket about expense report submission issues. Since the user can't submit or save print previews, it seems likely to be a software problem. The best category appears to be \"Access\" because it involves system access. \"HR Support\" is also a possibility due to the HR aspect, but given the context, I'll opt for \"Access.\" Now, I\u2019ll prepare to output the JSON object with the category set to \"Access.\"**Outputting IT ticket category**\n\nThe prompt requests me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to stick to the provided categories without adding anything extra. It looks like the most fitting choice is \"Access\" since the issues revolve around submitting expense reports and saving print previews. While \"Administrative Rights\" could be a consideration due to possible printing restrictions, that doesn\u2019t seem to apply here. So, I\u2019ll respond with just the required JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
