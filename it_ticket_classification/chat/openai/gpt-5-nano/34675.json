They mention \"Oracle\" and saving without a task selected, along with options for code and a message displayed during saving. Given the list of categories\u2014like Hardware, HR Support, and Access\u2014I think the best fit for this ticket could be \"Internal Project\" since it relates to software functionality. \n\nI'll format my response as JSON like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm debating between \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights\" for the IT ticket category. It doesn\u2019t mention hardware or storage. \"Internal Project\" seems fitting since it's about saving behavior and tasks in a project context. If it relates to a software bug in Oracle, that supports this choice too. However, I'm considering that \"Miscellaneous\" is safer if it seems unclear. Since the instructions are to categorize, I'll go with \"Internal Project.\"{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
