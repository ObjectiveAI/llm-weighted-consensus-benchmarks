The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The user provided keywords related to ServiceNow data refresh rates and filter updates. It seems like the ticket is asking about changing refresh rates in ServiceNow. I'm considering \"Internal Project\" or perhaps \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Access\" might apply if admin rights are needed, but it doesn\u2019t seem to fit for hardware, storage, purchase, HR, or admin rights.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the provided system categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. I\u2019m thinking \"Internal Project\" fits best since it relates to the ServiceNow data refresh rate, which seems project-specific. It could also be \"Miscellaneous\" if it's more general. Since the instruction is to provide one category, I'll choose \"Internal Project\" and format it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
