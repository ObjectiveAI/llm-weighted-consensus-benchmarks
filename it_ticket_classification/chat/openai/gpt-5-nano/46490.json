The user mentioned issues with \"console\" and something about building successfully but facing upload problems. Based on this context, it sounds like it might relate to \"Access\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" So, I\u2019ll lean towards \"Access,\" since it relates to issues with accessing something. Finally, I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object with the appropriate category. Let's do that now!**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket seems to relate to a software build and upload failure, so I\u2019m trying to find the right category. It could be \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" based on the details provided. The mention of \"console\" and the phrase \"built successfully but being uploaded\" suggest it\u2019s linked to internal processes, possibly involving a game console. Although it doesn't fit perfectly, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best choice since it pertains to the build and upload tasks.**Determining ticket categorization**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"console output you can build successfully but being uploaded,\" which makes me wonder if it relates to a gaming console. If it\u2019s about successful builds failing to upload, that sounds like a configuration issue for an internal project release. Given that, \"Internal Project\" seems like the most fitting category. I need to format my response correctly as a JSON object\u2014just one field for \"category\" with the value \"Internal Project.\" Let\u2019s do that!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
