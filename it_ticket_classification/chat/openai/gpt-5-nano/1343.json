The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given that this issue relates to software functionality, I think \"Miscellaneous\" might fit best, as it doesn't clearly fall into the other categories. I'll prepare the JSON output with the chosen category.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe user reported an issue with a \"proofing tool\" not working after an update, which indicates it's a software problem. I considered several categories: \"Miscellaneous\" for general software issues, \"Access\" if it's related to login rights, and \"Administrative rights\" if they need permissions to reinstall it. However, since there's no mention of hardware or storage concerns, it seems reasonable to categorize this ticket as \"Miscellaneous\" based on the overall context.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nSince the categories are limited, I believe \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit for this ticket\u2014it acts like a catch-all. So, I\u2019ll prepare the JSON output accordingly. The instructions specify that I should only output the JSON format for the category. I\u2019m ready to provide:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
