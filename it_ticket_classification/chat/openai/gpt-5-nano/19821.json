So, I'll categorize it as \"Administrative rights.\" I'll format this in a JSON-like object as required.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on the context clues. The term \"administration officer,\" along with mentions of \"planning officer,\" \"infrastructure,\" and references to holiday approvals suggest it's related to HR issues. \n\nGiven the limited choices, I'll categorize it as \"HR Support,\" since the content seems focused on approving leave and absences, which aligns well.
