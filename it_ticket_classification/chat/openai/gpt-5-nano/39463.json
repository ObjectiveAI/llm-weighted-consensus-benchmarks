The \"HR Support\" category seems most appropriate because it involves payroll and annual leave. While \"Access\" could work if they're having trouble with tasks, that doesn't fit here since the error isn't about system access. The user also mentioned an engineer submission. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object according to the provided schema.**Formatting JSON Object**\n\nI need to respond with the correct JSON object format for the category, which is \"HR Support.\" The required structure is straightforward: it must be inside an object with the proper schema. I want to keep it simple without any excess explanation. So, my final output will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It's important to double-check the spelling and spacing, and it looks good! Now, I'll finalize that response."
