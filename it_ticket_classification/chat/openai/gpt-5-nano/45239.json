The ticket content mentions Scottish holidays, specifically about adding public holidays to calendars and possibly extending holiday allowances. It seems to fit best under the HR Support category since it relates to employee benefits and holiday management. Let\u2019s make sure we correctly categorize it to streamline the resolution process!**Interpreting user request**\n\nThe user's message appears to be an IT ticket requesting the addition of Scottish public holidays to their calendar system. They mention needing these holidays visible in the calendar and possibly integrating them into their allowance. Key dates include Good Friday, Christmas, and Boxing Day, listed among other requests. It\u2019s important to ensure these holidays are updated so that everyone has access to accurate information. I\u2019ll work on processing this efficiently to assist them!**Categorizing access requests**\n\nThe user's request likely involves access or permissions related to their calendar. They want to add dates to the system, so I\u2019m considering categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" Typically, tasks like adding public holidays require administrative permission, suggesting \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit. While \"Access\" could apply, it's more straightforward to classify this as an admin change. \"Miscellaneous\" might work too since it doesn't strictly fall into other categories, but I think administrative fits best here!**Finalizing category selection**\n\nThe taxonomy includes \"Administrative rights,\" typically for requests to gain or modify those rights. However, this request is about adding dates to the calendar rather than changing admin rights. It\u2019s more about \"Access,\" since they want to modify calendar visibility and update the system with Scottish public holidays. Given that this does involve a system configuration change, it still falls under \"Administrative rights\" in most IT categorizations. So, I'll categorize it as follows: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
