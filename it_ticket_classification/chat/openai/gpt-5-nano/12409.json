This ticket discusses a request for laptop coolers, including aspects like supply and allocation. It\u2019s a bit messy, but it seems evident that it relates to hardware requests. I\u2019m considering whether to classify it as \"Hardware\" for asset management or \"Purchase\" since it deals with procurement. It seems both categories could fit, but maybe \"Purchase\"?**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nIn IT ticket categorization, tickets for hardware requests typically fall under \"Hardware,\" while those concerning procurement go under \"Purchase.\" This ticket mentions phrases like \"purchase these,\" \"allocation,\" and \"assign cooler,\" which indicates it\u2019s about procuring a cooler for a user. Although it might also fit under \"Hardware,\" since it deals with hardware requests, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase\" because it emphasizes procurement. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
