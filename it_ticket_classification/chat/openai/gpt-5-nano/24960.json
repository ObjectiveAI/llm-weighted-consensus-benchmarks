They mentioned various items like time sheet submission, vacation assignments, and starter forms, which seem related to HR tasks. The options I have to choose from include categories like \"HR Support,\" which fits well. Since the content clearly references HR-related tasks, I'll categorize this ticket as \"HR Support.\" It just makes the most sense given the context!**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that categorizes the IT ticket as \"HR Support.\" The required format specifies an object type with a category field. I'll construct the valid JSON according to the schema: it includes a \"type\" as \"object\" and a \"properties\" section that defines the acceptable categories.\n\nUltimately, the output should look like this:  \n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.\n\nI just want to make sure I\u2019m following the required format correctly!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
