The user seems to be requesting access to Confluence, which hints that it probably fits in either the \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" category. Since the string includes \"confluence access request,\" I think the best fit here is \"Access.\" It aligns directly with the user's need, and the ticket doesn't suggest administrative rights are required. I'll classify it as Access!**Formatting Access Classification**\n\nThe user wants to categorize an IT ticket, and the main topic is access to Confluence. I'll create a JSON object following the provided schema, which indicates I need to include the category property. The category is clearly \"Access\" based on the ticket details. So the final output should just be in this format: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to provide only this JSON object without any extra text. Let\u2019s proceed with that!"
