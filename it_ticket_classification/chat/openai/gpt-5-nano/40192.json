So, I\u2019ll return a JSON object with \"category\" set to \"Access.\" The format will be key since it needs to align with the specified requirements. I'll ensure it adheres to the needed structure!**Confirming IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether the ticket might also fit under \"Hardware\" due to sign-in issues on devices, but \"Access\" seems to be the best fit. The user isn\u2019t asking for solutions, just a categorization. \n\nI\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object with the category set to \"Access.\" Following the structure specified, I will ensure the output is just the required JSON without any extra text. That will be: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. Perfect!"
