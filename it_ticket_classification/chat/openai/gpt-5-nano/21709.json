The user provided text mentions \"bulk starter form school\", \"interns starting February\", and \"administration officer\", which points me toward a specific area. \n\nIt could relate to \"Access\", needing access for interns, or maybe \"HR Support\", given the context of starting interns and forms. \"Administrative rights\" might fit too if it's about granting those. However, I need to select just one category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket seems to focus on a \"bulk starter form\" and mentions \"interns starting February.\" This points me toward the \"HR Support\" category since it's about onboarding forms for those interns. \n\nWhile the ticket is IT-related, the content appears more aligned with HR processes than IT issues. The \"administration officer\" might be involved too. I think I should classify it as \"HR Support\" because it\u2019s clearly about the intern onboarding process rather than actual IT concerns."
