The most fitting category seems to be \"Miscellaneous.\" However, if it relates to an Oracle project, it could also be \"Internal Project.\" It's a bit unclear, so I'll go with my best judgment.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI could ask for clarification, but the instruction is to categorize the IT ticket directly. Since the text is messy, I'll choose \"Miscellaneous\" as the default option. It might relate to \"Access\" due to \"codes option\" or \"find codes\" in Oracle, but it\u2019s not directly about access rights, so \"Miscellaneous\" seems best. \n\nI need to format my response as a JSON object, specifically: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s formatted correctly with no extra text. Let\u2019s deliver that!"
