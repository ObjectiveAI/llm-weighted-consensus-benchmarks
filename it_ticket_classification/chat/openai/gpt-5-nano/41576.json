It sounds like something related to a technical issue. My best option here would likely fit under \"Access,\" as it relates to functionality not working correctly.**Classifying the support ticket**\n\nThe user seems to have tried multiple browsers, but nothing is working when they attempt to save or submit. This appears to be a technical support issue related to an application form, not hardware or storage. It sounds like a software bug preventing submission. \n\nSince there's no specific category for \"Software\" or \"Application,\" I should classify it as \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll format the final response as a JSON object indicating the category. \n\nHere it is: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
