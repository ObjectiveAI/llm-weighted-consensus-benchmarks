Since it predominantly involves pass activation and login credentials, it looks like it fits best under the \"Access\" category.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m weighing whether to categorize this ticket as \"Hardware\" or \"Access.\" The ticket mentions \"equipment\" and \"pass activation.\" For onboarding tasks, \"Access\" seems most relevant since it includes user account details. Although \"Hardware\" fits for equipment, it's not as explicit here. \"HR Support\" might apply if it's HR-related, but it's primarily an IT ticket. Given the focus on completing the starter form and access control, I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate choice!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
