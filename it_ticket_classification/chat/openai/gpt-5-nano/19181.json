The user has provided a detailed text in Romanian and English discussing the debate between wired and wireless connectivity. It seems to be focused on an \"Internal Project\" due to the analysis mentioned. The content hints at installing cables and considers whether to lean towards \"Internal Project\" or \"Hardware.\" I'll likely categorize it as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Responding with category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket, and \"Internal Project\" is one of the allowed options. The user has asked for this in a specific format. The output should follow the schema, which includes a category object. Therefore, my response should be concise with just the category formatted correctly as per the requirements. I\u2019ll output this as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} with no extra text, keeping it clear and straightforward for the user."
