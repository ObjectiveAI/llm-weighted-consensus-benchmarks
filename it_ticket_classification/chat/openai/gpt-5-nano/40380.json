It really seems to be an access issue. I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category here, as the user specifically mentions they can't access anymore. The request to investigate further indicates that action is needed on this matter. So yes, \"Access\" it is!**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object indicating the category as \"Access.\" The required format specifies the response structure, which is a bit more complex than simply returning the category. But it looks like I'm still following the guidelines\u2014my output should be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. \n\nSince the user specifically asked to categorize the IT ticket, I should focus on delivering just this JSON without any extra text or justifications. So I think I\u2019m ready to provide that!**Identifying Access Issue**\n\nThe user mentioned \"meeting links\" and that \"external colleagues cannot access anymore meeting links.\" This definitely points to an access issue. It may relate to external access, but the category \"Access\" indeed covers both internal and external issues. So, I think it's safe to conclude that \"Access\" is the appropriate category to assign here. I feel confident that I've identified the problem accurately!"
