The categories I have to choose from include Hardware, Purchase, and a few others. It seems most appropriate to assign this to \"Hardware\" since it's about a cable, which fits well under that category. While it could also be considered a \"Purchase,\" the request clearly indicates it's related to hardware, so \"Hardware\" feels like the right choice here.**Outputting category in JSON format**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the user's request for a cable. The instructions say I should provide a JSON object with a category field. Given the message, it seems the best fit is \"Hardware,\" although \"Purchase\" could also work as an alternative. However, since the request is clear about needing a cable, \"Hardware\" seems like the safest choice. So, I'll output the JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} with no extra commentary."
