It seems to concern a \"starter form\" for contractors, including information about re-starter forms and attached documents. The ticket mentions issues with selecting the proper unit and requests assistance with completing the forms for onboarding a new contractor starting in October. \n\nI should pull from predefined categories to ensure accurate classification. Let's clarify how to proceed with those categories next!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the allowed categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative Rights. I'm trying to find the best fit for the ticket described as being related to onboarding contractors with terms like \"starter form\" and \"help completion\". \n\n\"HR Support\" seems the most appropriate for onboarding forms and contractors, while \"Access\" might relate to unit access. However, given the context is more about forms and people, I believe \"HR Support\" is the right choice!**Crafting JSON response**\n\nI need to create a JSON object that categorizes the IT ticket according to the required format. The category options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. \n\nBased on my analysis, \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category. So, the correct JSON structure should look like this: `{\"category\": \"HR Support\"}`. I\u2019ll avoid any extra explanations and keep it straightforward per the user's request. Let's go with that!"
