The available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket mentions a new starter in Bogot\u00e1 and requests help with completion forms related to onboarding. It seems the most suitable category is \"HR Support,\" as it directly relates to onboarding a new employee. However, there may also be considerations for \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Categorizing New Starter Ticket**\n\nFor this ticket regarding a new starter, it seems to fit more into HR onboarding. The content includes phrases about completing forms and seating assignments, which suggest it's related to onboarding in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. While \"Access\" could also be relevant for setting up access, I believe the best match here is \"HR Support.\" The message indicates a request for assistance related to forms and seating, clearly not a hardware or storage issue.**Categorizing HR Ticket**\n\nThis ticket seems primarily focused on HR-related tasks such as onboarding, seating, and compliance. While \"Administrative rights\" could relate to user setups, it doesn't appear to be the main focus. So, it makes the most sense to categorize this as \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll prepare the response in a JSON object format with the category specified. The final answer will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It could be helpful to keep it straightforward!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
