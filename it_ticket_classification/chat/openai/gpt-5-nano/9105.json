The ticket mentions several components, including routers, switches, licenses, and equipment bundles across two locations. I should determine which category fits best from options like Hardware, Purchase, or Internal Project. Since it's all about assessing licensing needs related to hardware, it probably fits best under Hardware, but I\u2019ll consider the context to be sure.**Assessing ticket categories**\n\nI'm considering categories for this ticket, like \"Purchase,\" which might relate to procurement, or \"Internal Project,\" for assessing licensing needs. While \"Hardware\" fits due to mentions of edge/core equipment, routers, and switches, the primary focus is on the licensing review. There isn\u2019t a specific category for \"Software/License management,\" so \"Internal Project\" feels like the closest option since the user's request is about reviewing licensing across locations. I\u2019ll lean towards that for clarity's sake.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
