It mentions phrases like \u201cadd com as a member\u201d and \u201cinfrastructure,\u201d along with terms like \u201curgent\u201d and \u201cimplement rule.\u201d Given the context, it seems to fit an access-related issue, especially since it\u2019s about adding a member and permissions. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \u201cAccess,\u201d though \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could also apply since it involves user permissions.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket says, \"add com as a member of com march pm improve,\" which is quite unclear. Typically, I'd classify this as \"Access\" since it's about adding a user or permissions. Administrative rights could also fit if it's about elevating privileges. There are phrases like \"implement rule\" and \"add member,\" but it doesn't relate to hardware, storage, or purchase. I\u2019ll output the category in JSON format, choosing \"Access\" as the best fit for clarity.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
