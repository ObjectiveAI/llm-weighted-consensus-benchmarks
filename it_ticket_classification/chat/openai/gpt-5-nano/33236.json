It seems to suggest that an ex-employee is still getting notifications on their personal phone after leaving a couple of months ago. I think this could best fit into the \"Access\" category since it likely concerns their residual access. It might also fall under \"Administrative rights\" if the request is about removing that access. Let's go with \"Access.\"**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe message hints that an ex-employee, who left a couple of months ago, is still receiving notifications on their phone. This suggests they might still have access to something, like email or Slack. I need to categorize the request as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it relates to revoking access. Considering the options, \"Access\" fits best. I'll craft the JSON response to show the category clearly: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Delivering category response**\n\nThe user provided a schema for categorizing the IT ticket, requiring a JSON object with a category string. I'll respond simply with the necessary information: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. There\u2019s no need for additional reasoning since the instructions don't specify that. I\u2019ll just focus on delivering the category directly as per the user's request."
