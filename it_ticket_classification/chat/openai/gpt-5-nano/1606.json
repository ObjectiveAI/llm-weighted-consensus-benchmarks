It seems related to a new starter who might need account management, possibly disabling their account. From the provided categories\u2014like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" etc.\u2014I think the best fit would be \"HR Support\" since it's about a new employee and their credentials. I'll ensure the ticket reflects this so it gets handled correctly!**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing a message about creating credentials for a new starter who accepted a job offer. The mention of \"credentials per attached form\" suggests this ticket is focused on setting up user accounts, such as usernames and passwords. It also hints at possibly disabling an account for someone who withdrew from joining. Considering the context, the best category seems to be \"Access\" since it deals with user accounts. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply, it\u2019s not the primary focus here.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
