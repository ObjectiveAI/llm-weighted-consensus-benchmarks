The categories include things like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Access.\" This ticket is about failures in annual leave request submissions, which falls under HR processes but is tied to IT since it\u2019s about an HR system. \n\nI think \"HR Support\" fits best since it relates to HR processes, while \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" don't really apply here. \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous\" aren't relevant either. So, \"HR Support\" is the best choice!**Formatting JSON category**\n\nI need to ensure I output the IT ticket category in the proper JSON format. The task asks for a JSON object with the \"category\" key. From the options provided, I believe \"HR Support\" is the right choice since it relates to HR processes. \n\nThe UI only needs the value, so I\u2019ll keep it straightforward. The right output should look like this: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`. I'll double-check whether \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, but HR Support seems more fitting here.**Identifying the leave request issue**\n\nThe user has mentioned issues with the annual leave request form. They say it failed for the submission period in November, and there are references to drafts and sending requests for approval. Since it's related to the HR process, the \"failed\" error could suggest missing fields in the form. \n\nThis clearly falls under \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll make sure to respond with the JSON format indicating this category."
