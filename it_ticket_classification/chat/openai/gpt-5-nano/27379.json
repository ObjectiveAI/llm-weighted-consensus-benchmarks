The key phrases include \"database backup,\" \"enable database backup functionality,\" and \"function disabled.\" Since the user's request centers around backup functionality, the most relevant categories here seem to be \"Storage\" for data backup and \"Administrative rights\" for permissions to enable the backup. So, Storage feels like the best fit.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket about enabling database backup functionality. It can be seen as both a storage operation and possibly an access change since it involves permissions. However, I think categorizing it as \"Storage\" is the best fit. I also need to output this as a JSON object according to the system instruction. So, I\u2019ll ensure the response is just: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} without any extra wording.**Deciding on category**\n\nThe user's primary request revolves around enabling database backup functionality, which I see clearly relates to storage. So, I\u2019m leaning towards classifying it under Storage. It feels like the straightforward choice, given the context. I\u2019m confident that categorizing it in this way aligns well with the information provided. Now, I think it\u2019s time to finalize this decision and move forward with the response."
