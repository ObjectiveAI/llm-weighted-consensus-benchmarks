The user mentioned a \"starter form,\" which makes me think it\u2019s related to employee onboarding, pointing towards \"HR Support.\" However, it could also relate to \"Access\" if it's about setting up accounts. Considering the context of the starter form, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit for processing this ticket correctly. So, let\u2019s categorize it as \"HR Support.\"**Determining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI\u2019d lean towards categorizing this ticket as \"HR Support\" since it relates to onboarding a new starter. However, there's also the potential for it to be about \"Access\" if it's focused on granting new user access. The mention of a \"starter form\" suggests it's an HR process, and although \"Administrative rights\" comes to mind, there's no indication of that here. It seems logical to keep it as \"HR Support,\" given the context of onboarding and form completion.**Finalizing JSON for Ticket Categorization**\n\nI\u2019m categorizing this IT ticket related to onboarding. The user\u2019s message about a \u201cnew starter\u201d indicates it\u2019s about filling out onboarding forms, making \"HR Support\" the appropriate category. I want to provide the output as a JSON object in the correct format. It should include the \"category\" field as follows: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to deliver this bare JSON, aligning with the requirements for the ticket response. So, here\u2019s the final output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Clarifying JSON Schema**\n\nI see that the schema indicates an object with properties for the category. It looks like earlier tasks I've worked on needed a simpler output format like {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. To keep things straightforward, I\u2019ll stick with this plain format for the output. So, I'll provide the JSON specifically as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} since that aligns with what\u2019s typically required. This way, it\u2019s clear and concise!"
