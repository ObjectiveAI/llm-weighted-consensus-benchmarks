The text suggests it's related to onboarding a new employee starting in March and mentions filling out a starter form and returning it. I\u2019m thinking it fits best under \"HR Support,\" but it could also relate to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Overall, I\u2019ll go with HR Support as the most fitting category.**Categorizing Ticket for HR Support**\n\nIt looks like the user\u2019s message is about onboarding a new starter and returning a form, which falls under HR processes. The most appropriate category seems to be \"HR Support.\" Although \"Administrative rights\" could also be a contender, it doesn't specifically mention access tasks. Given that they want to fill out a starter form, I'll assign the category as \"HR Support.\" I plan to return a JSON object with the category value set to \"HR Support.\"**Structuring JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nThe user's instruction is to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to respond with a proper JSON structure for that category. The category I'm assigning is \"HR Support.\" I recall that the response requires a specific outer object format. \n\nIt looks like I need to structure it like this: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[...]}}}, but I will keep it simple and respond with {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I could also add a brief note, but the instruction is clear to just provide the JSON."
