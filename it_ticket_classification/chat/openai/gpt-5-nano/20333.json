It could fit under \"Access\" due to references to AD rights and mailboxes, but since it relates to the leaver process, \"HR Support\" also seems applicable. There\u2019s an \"HR Support\" category, so it likely falls there.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe content is focused on an employee leaving, mentioning terms like \"leaver form,\" \"leave date,\" \"AD rights,\" and \"mailbox.\" I\u2019m considering categories like \"Access\" or \"HR Support,\" especially because it involves offboarding and access provisioning. It looks like \"Access\" is the best fit here. The additional phrases about ticket logging aren\u2019t essential for the categorization. So, I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object indicating the category as \"Access.\" Here it is: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
