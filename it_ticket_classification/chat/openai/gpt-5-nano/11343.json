The most fitting is Hardware since it relates to equipment and meeting setups. However, if there\u2019s a chance they need administrative rights to join, that could also be a consideration. Overall, I'll produce the JSON format with the category listed as \"Hardware.\" Still, if anything feels ambiguous later, \"Miscellaneous\" could be reasonable too.  \n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}**Identifying the category**\n\nThe task is about meeting setup support, specifically regarding equipment connections. This clearly indicates a hardware-related issue. So, the best fitting category here is \"Hardware.\" Now, I just need to format my answer correctly in JSON. I'll produce a JSON object with the category labeled accordingly. It seems straightforward, so here I go!  \n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
