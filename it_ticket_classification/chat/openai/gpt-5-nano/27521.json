The keywords like \"urgent IT equipment,\" \"new starters,\" and \"equipment PO\" indicate it's related to procuring hardware. I think the best categories might be Hardware, Purchase, or Internal Project. I\u2019ll choose the most fitting category based on the content provided.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the best category for the IT ticket, which seems to focus on purchasing equipment, as it refers to a purchase order (PO). The message mentions \"urgent IT equipment,\" \"new starters,\" and the need to provide a PO, indicating it\u2019s more about purchasing. Although it could fit under Hardware or Procurement, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Purchase\" due to the specific mention of the PO. I\u2019ll output the category in the required JSON format."
