There are predefined categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. The text seems to deal with removing access rights for people who left, except for Confluence rights, and mentions location and registered numbers. From what I see, this case fits best under \"Access,\" but it could also be \"Administrative rights\" if it's specifically about managing those rights.**Finalizing category for IT ticket**\n\nI need to choose between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" for this IT ticket. The ticket is asking to \"remove access rights\" while leaving \"Confluence rights,\" which indicates it\u2019s related to access control. Since it's mainly removing rights and not granting them, I think \"Access\" is the simplest choice. I\u2019ll format it as a JSON object, like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. However, I wonder about the implications of \"Administrative rights\" in this context, just to be thorough.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
