The categories I can choose from are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It sounds like this request is related to onboarding, so \"Access\" fits well. However, \"Administrative rights\" might be more specific about privileges needed. I\u2019ll infer which category is the best fit.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user provided content about a new starter, asking to fill out an enclosed form and reference a date in February. This seems related to onboarding, which likely involves provisioning access or accounts. The available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. I believe \"Access\" suits this situation best, as onboarding typically involves granting access. My final response will be formatted like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let\u2019s stick to the required format!**Returning category value**\n\nI need to respond with the category value for the IT ticket. The instruction indicates that I should use a JSON object with a category property. While there's a JSON schema, it's not crucial to follow it closely. Based on what I\u2019ve gathered, I'll simply output the category as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll keep it minimal and straightforward by providing just the JSON. Let\u2019s go ahead and move forward!"
