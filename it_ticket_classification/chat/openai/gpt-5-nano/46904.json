I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" since it clearly relates to leave scheduling. \"Administrative rights\" wouldn\u2019t apply here since there\u2019s no request for permissions. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support\" in a JSON object.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThis IT ticket mentions SAP invoicing, but it's not related to hardware or access issues. It's more about an application problem with the absence scheduling feature, possibly linked to Oracle. I think I should categorize this as \"HR Support\" since it specifically relates to absence scheduling. While \"Access\" might fit if users can't access the function, the issue clearly describes an unavailable scheduling feature affecting invoicing, which reinforces \"HR Support\" as the best choice. I'll format it as a JSON object.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
