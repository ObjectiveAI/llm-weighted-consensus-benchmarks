It mentions a \"new purchase,\" \"log installation,\" and \"receipts,\" leading me to think it relates to procurement. The main theme seems focused on purchasing and installation, suggesting \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category. However, given the mention of installation, I\u2019m also considering \"Hardware.\" Since it emphasizes the purchase order and receipts, I'll lean towards categorizing it as \"Purchase.\"**Providing the JSON category**\n\nIt looks like the ticket is best categorized under \"Purchase,\" as it mainly deals with procurement and receipts. I need to format my response as a JSON-like object, requiring a specific structure: {\"category\": \"value\"}. The value must be one of the specified categories, and in this case, it will be \"Purchase\" with a capital \"P\". \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond precisely with: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}, ensuring it\u2019s valid JSON with no extra text.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
