It mentions approval withdrawal for annual leave, absence records, and tasks related to HR management. Since this clearly involves HR and leave management, \"HR Support\" is the right choice among the provided categories. The other categories don\u2019t really fit, so I'll confidently categorize it as \"HR Support.\"**Deciding the Ticket Category**\n\nI'm leaning toward categorizing this ticket as \"HR Support,\" given its focus on leave withdrawal approval and absence records. Although \"Access\" is also mentioned, it seems more related to HR than IT access. The user specifically wants to classify the ticket, so I\u2019ll use a JSON-like structure for my response. I'll format it correctly, ensuring it follows the specified schema with the category set to \"HR Support.\" That way, it\u2019s clear and adheres to the request!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
