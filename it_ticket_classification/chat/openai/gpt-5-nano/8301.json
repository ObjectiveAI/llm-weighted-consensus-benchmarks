It looks chaotic, but it seems to relate to an employee departure process in ServiceNow. The key components include details like leave date, location, a leaver form, roaming profile, Active Directory rights, and mailbox information. There\u2019s a lot to sift through, but focusing on these fields will help me make sense of it all and assist the user effectively.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket based on a list of allowed categories. The options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket seems to relate to a \"leaver\" process, mentioning access rights (like AD rights and mailbox), and the roaming profile. It\u2019s mostly about user offboarding, so the best fit is likely \"Access\" since it's focused on user access rights. Administrative rights could also apply here.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to choose one category for the IT ticket. \"Access\" seems to be the best fit, especially since it focuses on IT tasks related to a leaver's employee departure. \"HR Support\" could apply since it involves leaving, but since the ticket is technically about IT tasks, I'll stick with \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format the response as JSON for clarity. The final output will be:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}  \n\nI\u2019ll just go ahead and present this without any extra text."
