The possible categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The text mentions a \"new purchase,\" \"po,\" \"installation,\" and \"receipts,\" which suggests it\u2019s related to a hardware purchase and installation. Given this context, I think \"Purchase\" is the best fit, although I\u2019ll briefly consider if \"Hardware\" applies too.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions a new purchase order, installation, and a video feature, which suggests it's related to hardware procurement with installation. However, the main context is centered around the purchase and receipts. Therefore, the \"Purchase\" category seems like the best fit. I need to provide a JSON object formatted according to the specified schema, which means I\u2019ll go with: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nThis keeps it concise and direct, without extra commentary."
