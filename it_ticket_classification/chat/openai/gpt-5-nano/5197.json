The options I\u2019m considering are \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or maybe \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll choose the category that best fits changing ownership of a contact, focusing on aspects like \"assign owner\" and \"owner left.\" My next step is to output this in the specified JSON format.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThis ticket seems to relate to access control, specifically with phrases like \"change ownership\" and \"assign owner\" indicating a departing user. It points toward changing ownership in a system, which makes me consider categories like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since \"change ownership\" seems to fit best under \"Administrative rights\" as it\u2019s a specific category, I believe that's the one I'll choose. I'll output this in the required JSON format as {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
