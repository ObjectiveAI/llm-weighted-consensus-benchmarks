Looking at the allowed values, \"Access\" fits well since it relates to deprovisioning rights and mentions \"leaver\" processes. Although \"HR Support\" could be relevant because it's about an employee leaving, the focus is IT tasks. \"Access\" is broader and captures user accounts and permissions better, so I\u2019ll select that. I\u2019ll format it as a JSON object with \"category\": \"Access\".**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nThe tool's specification tells me to create a JSON object with the category field. Since we're categorizing this IT ticket and \"Access\" is the most fitting option, I'll set the category to \"Access.\" I need to ensure that the JSON is valid, and I could consider adding a brief explanation, but the main task is to provide the category object. So, I'll finalize it as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nTime to deliver!"
