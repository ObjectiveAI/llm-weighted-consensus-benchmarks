They mention \"access\" multiple times, along with things like \"training\" and issues prefaced with \u201cplease help.\u201d \n\nLooking at the defined categories, \"Access\" stands out as the most appropriate since the user is implying issues around permissions to view a board. The rest of the ticket text is quite unclear, but \"Access\" seems to fit best overall.**Categorizing IT Ticket Issues**\n\nThe key phrase here is \"access ... board cannot viewed because exist permission view,\" which indicates an access issue stemming from permission settings. The mention of \"copy platform induction training\" might suggest a request for training, and \"let has experience working zephyr\" adds some confusion. Still, the primary category seems to be \"Access\" as it clearly relates to permissions. \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, but since the focus is on viewing permissions, \"Access\" is likely the best fit.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
