This ticket seems related to contracts and mentions \"please advise,\" so it might be a request for access to view contracts. Since it includes terms like \"purchase\" and \"contracts,\" I'd lean towards classifying it as a \u201cPurchase\u201d issue. However, if it\u2019s about accessing a contract system, it could also fit under \"Administrative Rights.\" Still, no explicit mention of access makes me hesitate. Internal Project might apply if this involves contract migration.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
