Therefore, the most appropriate categories seem to be \"Administrative Rights\" for user access or \"Internal Project\" if it's for a specific initiative.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe user isn't explicitly requesting rights; they want to \"create named bid squad\" multiple times. There's also a mention of \"best test consultant,\" which might suggest they want an account for a consultant. However, \"named bid squad\" indicates a group creation. I need to categorize this under either \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" Given that it's about creating a group and granting access, \"Access\" seems most appropriate. So, the JSON category should be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
