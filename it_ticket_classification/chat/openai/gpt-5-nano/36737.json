The ticket mentions an issue with a dashboard displaying an additional column in the stats section. This sounds like a software application problem, not hardware-related. Given the allowed categories, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to fit best, as it doesn't fall into others like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" or \"Storage.\" It might also relate to an internal project or a software bug. So, I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous.\"**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nThe categories I have are limited, but \"Internal Project\" could work for internal tasks. However, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to fit better for this general IT issue since it pertains to a dashboard problem, not hardware. The ticket mentions logging an incident, so I need to consider the right format. I\u2019ll use a JSON object to categorize it, outputting {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}, since that simplifies things for the user while still reflecting the issue described.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
