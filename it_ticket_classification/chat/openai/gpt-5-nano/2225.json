It seems to involve access rights and permissions for supplier contracts. Based on the categories I have, it looks like this ticket should fit into either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it\u2019s about the rights to view and upload. So, I should focus on those two options while making my decision!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm debating between categorizing the IT ticket as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The phrase \"check rights\" implies checking permissions, especially related to viewing and uploading supplier contracts. Since \"Access\" is a broader term for permissions issues, it seems like the more appropriate choice. I'll go ahead and provide a JSON object with the category, as required by the system: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll keep it simple and just send that."
