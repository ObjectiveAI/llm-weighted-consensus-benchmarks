The user's request seems to relate to a \"change of PM name\" which I think could mean a project manager name change. There are mentions of reports and a user guide, suggesting it could fit under \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" I want to pick the best category that accurately reflects the user's needs based on the provided options.**Parsing IT ticket request**\n\nI\u2019m looking closely at the user\u2019s request about a \"change of PM name\" for the PAS project. It seems they might want to change the project manager\u2019s name, possibly connected to permissions. \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if that pertains to access for altering the PM name. They also mention needing updates on documentation and reports. Overall, this could fit into \"Internal Project\" due to its focus on projects and reports, but \"Administrative rights\" might be considered too.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering that the request about the \"change of PM name\" for the \"PAS project reports\" likely relates to updating the project manager's name in reports. This seems more like an administrative task, so \"Internal Project\" fits well. Although \"Access\" could apply if it involves permissions related to the PM name change, it's not explicitly mentioned. They also want a user guide, reinforcing the \"Internal Project\" category. So, I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
