This suggests it might relate to an \u201cInternal Project\u201d since those terms imply some active engagement in development. However, there's a possibility of \"Administrative rights\" as well. I'll focus on parsing the details more clearly, but it seems like \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category here.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m examining the categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Based on the ticket's content mentioning \"proof concept,\" \"code attached,\" and \"expedite process,\" it seems most likely to fit the \"Internal Project\" category since it deals with a proof of concept for an internal project. There\u2019s a possibility of it being \"Miscellaneous,\" but given the specific mention of \"Internal Project,\" that seems to be the best choice for categorization. I\u2019ll provide the category in a JSON format.**Responding with ticket category**\n\nI see the instruction is to categorize this IT ticket using a defined JSON format. The user probably expects a clear response, either just the category name or a JSON object. Given the options, \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems to be the right fit based on the ticket details. I'll provide that as the category. To be thorough, I could include a simple JSON object that outlines the category, along with a brief justification to clarify my reasoning.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize this IT ticket, and I see the instruction is to provide a clear category. I'll go with \u201cInternal Project\u201d based on the mention of a proof of concept and attached code, which indicates internal work. To be helpful, I plan to add a rationale that explains why this fits that category, emphasizing aspects like expedited processing and coordination. This way, I ensure my response is both direct and informative."
