The possible categories are things like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and so on. I need to output a valid JSON format that indicates the category. Since it seems to be a network connection problem, I could categorize it under Hardware or Access. I\u2019ll likely go with Access if it directly relates to network access in this case.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nSince there isn\u2019t a specific \"Networking\" category available, I\u2019m considering the closest options: \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Hardware,\" or \"Access.\" In IT, network issues often fall under \"Hardware\" or \"Access,\" but since this ticket focuses on connectivity without any mention of login, \"Miscellaneous\" seems more fitting. If it were a hardware issue, like a faulty cable, I could see \"Hardware\" being appropriate. I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous\" and respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Finalizing category output**\n\nI need to output just the JSON object without any extra text. The category I'll use is \"Miscellaneous,\" and I want to ensure it matches exactly with the allowed values: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The safest choice is definitely \"Miscellaneous.\" If the user wanted alternatives, I could explain my reasoning, but for now, I'll focus on categorizing as requested. So, the final output will be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
