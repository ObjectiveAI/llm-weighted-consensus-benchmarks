The user describes multiple issues, including an Oracle error and a timeout when trying to submit, as well as strange codes appearing on Fridays. It seems most related to application or system errors. I need to figure out which category this ticket best aligns with from the list.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm looking at the categories available for the IT ticket, and \"Miscellaneous\" seems to fit because it can cover general IT issues. \"Access\" could relate to login problems, but given the timeout error and submission issues, it's more an application-level concern. There aren't categories for \"Software\" or \"Applications\" in the list, which makes \"Miscellaneous\" the best choice. I need to format the response as a JSON object according to the specified schema.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
