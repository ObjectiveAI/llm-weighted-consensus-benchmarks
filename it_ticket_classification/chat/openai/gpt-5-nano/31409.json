It could fit into \"HR Support\" since it involves forms for new interns. However, if it's about access privileges, \"Administrative rights\" might be suitable too. I'll need to decide which category fits best.**Evaluating ticket classification**\n\nIf the ticket is about new interns and starter forms, it seems HR would be involved. Still, as this is an IT ticket, it might relate to setting up bulk starter forms in the HRIS system. The content is quite ambiguous. The user wants me to categorize it as a JSON object. My best guess is \"HR Support,\" as it's focused on new interns and their forms. However, if it's about automating a workflow for these forms, it could be an \"Internal Project.\" I'll weigh these options carefully!**Deciding on user onboarding classification**\n\nOnboarding new users typically involves \"Access,\" which includes provisioning accounts and email. The mention of \"new starter form\" suggests it relates to issuing forms for new interns and could involve access provisioning as well. The term \"bulk\" hints at a large-scale process. Given the categories available, my best match is likely \"HR Support\" since it\u2019s focused on interns and their forms. While \"Internal Project\" could also fit, \"HR Support\" feels like the safer choice since this isn\u2019t about hardware or storage.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
