The mention of \"missing direct report under career team section\" likely refers to a system like an org chart or employee directory.\n\nSince this seems like HR data management, \"HR Support\" feels like the best category. If they're looking to add her career to the system, it aligns well. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"HR Support\" and consider responding with a JSON object for clarity.**Structuring JSON Response**\n\nThe prompt specifies a category schema I need to follow. It looks like we'll be outputting a JSON object with the category set to \"HR Support.\" The user is asking for the categorization, so I\u2019ll just provide that category.\n\nI should ensure the response is strictly in JSON format without any extra explanation. So, the final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
