The ticket discusses \"devices extensions assigned devices currently labeled instead meeting room actual name.\" It seems to center on labeling issues, possibly related to devices in the meeting rooms. This could fit into several categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Hardware.\" I need to decide which one best captures the primary concern without overthinking it too much!**Deciding on category**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on the ticket details that mention reviewing devices and their extensions assigned to meeting rooms. It\u2019s clear that this relates primarily to hardware, so \"Hardware\" seems like the most fitting category. While \"Internal Project\" could also apply if it\u2019s part of a larger task, the emphasis on devices in meeting rooms makes me lean toward \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll output the JSON-like object to match the required schema: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This way, I\u2019m ensuring everything aligns correctly!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
