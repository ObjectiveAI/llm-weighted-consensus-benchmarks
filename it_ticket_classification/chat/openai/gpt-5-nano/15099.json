It looks like they want to change the project manager for Wednesday PM, emphasizing the importance of the request. There's also a mention of adding themselves to something related to Friday PM changes. So, this ticket likely relates to project management and could fall under Access or Administrative rights, as it\u2019s about changes in human resources rather than hardware or storage.**Classifying IT request**\n\nThis looks like a request to update a project management role, so I need to pick the best category for an IT ticket. The most fitting seems to be \"Administrative rights,\" since it's about changing who has PM rights. \"Internal Project\" might refer to tasks within project management systems rather than hardware or access rights. I also need to respond in a JSON-like format, selecting one category from the specified options. I\u2019m honing in on \"Administrative rights\" as the best choice.**Determining the right category**\n\nThis request involves changing project manager assignments, which relates to user roles. I\u2019m considering whether it fits under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \"Administrative rights\" sounds like the better choice since it explicitly pertains to the privileges needed to make such changes. The core of the request is to reassign a PM, and while \"Internal Project\" could apply, \"Administrative rights\" seems best for asking about role assignments in a project management tool.**Choosing the best classification**\n\nAlright, I see that the request involves changing project manager assignments for specific times, which aren\u2019t about global rights. However, being a PM likely requires access to modify tasks in the project. \"Internal Project\" is somewhat generic and may cover assignment changes, but it\u2019s not about bugs or features. Since the request is explicitly to change the PM role, I'd categorize it as \"Administrative rights,\" as that really fits the need for updating a role in the project. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Administrative rights.\"{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
