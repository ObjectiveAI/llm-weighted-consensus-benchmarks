The content involves a deleted project folder from a Nexus repository and touches on recovery, retention, and migration. It seems that \"Storage\" is the most fitting category since it's about data management. Other possible options were \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative Rights,\" but the focus is on data recovery.\n\nSo, I'll go ahead and categorize it as \"Storage\" and return it as a JSON object with the correct format.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nThe prompt indicates that I need to categorize an IT ticket into a specific JSON format, particularly a category field. They asked me to return a JSON object with a category string from the provided options. The schema gives me the categories to choose from, but it seems to be incomplete since it lacks required fields. Anyway, I'll focus on providing the output as requested, which will be something like {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I'll stick to just that."
