However, I might also consider \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous\" as potential categories. I\u2019ll need to weigh these options carefully to ensure accurate categorization.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis ticket is IT-related and talks about changes in absence status, which could indicate a bug in the HRIS or attendance system. The available categories include \"HR Support,\" which fits well. Although I noticed \"Access\" was also mentioned, it doesn\u2019t seem relevant since it\u2019s not about access rights. I\u2019ll categorize it under \"HR Support.\" I'll respond with a structured JSON format like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} for clarity.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
