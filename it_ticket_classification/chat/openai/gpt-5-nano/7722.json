The ticket text is a bit garbled but seems to focus on \"discipline,\" \"creating discipline name,\" \"effective date,\" and \"assign employees.\" It feels like they might be trying to create a new discipline within Oracle HR or ERP. I think \"HR Support\" fits best since it's related to HR functions, but \"Internal Project\" could be relevant too.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt seems this ticket is about creating a discipline name in Oracle, along with an effective date and assigning employees. This points toward HR system configuration, not hardware or access. While it might look like it could fall under \"Access,\" that's not quite right. The task clearly relates to HR functions, so I'll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" The final output needs to be a simple JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I'll make sure the formatting is correct when I respond.**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to make sure I format the response correctly for the category. The instruction says that the final output should be a JSON object specifically shaped with a \"category\" property, which is a string from the enumerated values. So, despite the confusion about the schema description, I\u2019ll just focus on providing the category name itself. Therefore, I\u2019ll respond simply with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That's it, no extra commentary needed!"
