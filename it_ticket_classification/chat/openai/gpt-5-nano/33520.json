The options include categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. The ticket mentions routers, polling status, and packet loss, which points to network hardware. I think \"Hardware\" fits best. \"Internal Project\" could work if it relates to ongoing monitoring. Since there\u2019s no specific \"Networking\" category, I'll lean towards \"Hardware\" to classify this ticket appropriately.**Structuring IT ticket response**\n\nThe instruction to \"Categorize this IT Ticket\" suggests I need to output a JSON object with a category type selected from the given list. The category should be a string like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" etc. Since the ticket discusses routers and network hardware, \"Hardware\" seems to be the best fit. I\u2019ll need to format my response correctly as a JSON object. So, I\u2019ll produce:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI want to ensure that's the format they expect!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
