The categories I can choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket seems related to HR Support since it's discussing public holidays and relocation details. I\u2019ll output this in a JSON format specifying HR Support as the category. Let's make sure to get this right!**Identifying the Right Category**\n\nI\u2019m parsing the information in the user's message which discusses \"location,\" \"public holiday,\" \"relocated,\" and various other terms. It looks pretty jumbled, but it seems to focus on HR-related processes about public holidays when someone is relocated. Since this is clearly tied to HR support, I believe the \"HR Support\" category fits best. So, I'll output the answer in a JSON format like this: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}` to ensure clarity!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
