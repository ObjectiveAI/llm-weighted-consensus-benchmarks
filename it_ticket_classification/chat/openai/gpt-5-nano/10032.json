The mention of completing forms, testing, and a compliance officer indicates this is likely related to onboarding. The appropriate categories seem to be \"HR Support\" for HR-related tasks or possibly \"Access\" for granting credentials. Since onboarding often involves access provisioning, the ticket could fit under \"Access\" or \"HR Support,\" depending on what needs to be done.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe content suggests it\u2019s about a new starter in Bogota needing help with a form related to their work location and compliance. The appropriate categories might be \"Administrative Rights\" or \"Access,\" given the focus on access for this new employee. However, since it also relates to onboarding, \"HR Support\" could be a fit due to the HR processes involved. I think \"HR Support\" is likely the best choice, especially since the user directly asked for ticket categorization.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to output a JSON object that categorizes the IT ticket. Considering it's about onboarding a new starter in Bogota and involves forms and compliance, the most appropriate category is \"HR Support.\" The ticket doesn't relate to \"Administrative Rights\" or \"Internal Project.\" I should respond with a precise JSON format that includes the \"category\" key and the correct value. So, I'll prepare the output as: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. This ensures it meets the required structure without any extra text.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
