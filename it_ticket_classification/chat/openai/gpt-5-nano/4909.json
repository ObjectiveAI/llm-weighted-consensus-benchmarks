They mention adding to a \"snow queue,\u201d which probably refers to ServiceNow. Using the terms \"add him\u201d and \"same name,\u201d it looks like they want to add someone to a queue, likely requesting access. Given this context, it seems appropriate to categorize this ticket as \"Access,\" since it's about granting someone permissions in the ServiceNow system.**Interpreting ticket categorization**\n\nThe user is asking for the categorization of a ticket, and I need to provide a response in JSON format with a category field. Based on the ticket's content, it seems the most suitable category is \"Access\" since it relates to adding someone to a queue, which implies a request for access or permissions. While \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant for elevated privileges, it doesn't apply here since the user is merely trying to add someone to a queue. I'll respond with a JSON object: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
