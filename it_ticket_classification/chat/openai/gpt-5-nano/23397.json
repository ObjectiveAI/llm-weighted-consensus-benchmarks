However, there's a category for \"Administrative rights,\" which isn't mentioned here. The user could also be referring to ServiceNow, abbreviated as \"SNOW.\" The phrase \"add to snow friday pm\" likely means adding a ticket to ServiceNow on that timeframe. I should respond with a JSON-like object categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous,\" since it feels like the safest choice without more context.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket might also relate to an \"Internal Project,\" considering it's about scheduling for Friday PM. However, since the user didn't specify, \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the best catch-all category. I want to keep things concise, following the user's instructions to just provide the category. The format will be a JSON-like object indicating the category as \"Miscellaneous.\" So my final response will be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Let's go with that!"
