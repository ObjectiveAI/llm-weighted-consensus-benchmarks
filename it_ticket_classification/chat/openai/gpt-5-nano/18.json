Given that it\u2019s about planning a workshop, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit. While \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility, it\u2019s not focused on system access, so \"Internal Project\" is more appropriate.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve realized that \"Administrative rights\" isn't the right fit. The category \"Access\" relates more to user rights or system access, but this ticket is about a workshop communication, which doesn't indicate any access issues. Therefore, \"Internal Project\" is definitely the most suitable choice. Now, I need to respond in the correct format. The output should simply be a JSON object with \"category\": \"Internal Project,\" like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I'll keep it concise, as justification isn't necessary.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
