The user's request is quite garbled, but key phrases include \"problem with submitting,\" \"error,\" \"importance high,\" and \"last application down.\" This sounds like an access issue or an internal project related to submitting something due to an application being down. I\u2019ll lean towards either Access or Internal Project for categorization.**Evaluating ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure this isn\u2019t a hardware issue. It could be related to \"Administrative rights\" if the user can\u2019t submit because permissions aren\u2019t defined. The phrase \"problem with submitting\" might indicate an \"Access\" issue, especially if submission rights are lacking. However, since the user mentions an \"application down,\" this might lean towards \"Internal Project\" due to the system outage. I\u2019ll be careful to select the best fit, potentially focusing on \"Access\" for login or permissions issues.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe text mentions \"cannot be submitted moment for last application down,\" which hints it could relate to access. However, it's not very clear. I\u2019m considering \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" as the best categories. It seems to revolve around a submission issue connected to an application outage. While \"Application outage\" could fit as an IT ticket, \"Miscellaneous\" is safest if things are vague. Given the mention of \"application down,\" I think I should go with \"Internal Project\" for internal submission issues.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize this IT ticket, and the best fit is likely \"Internal Project\" since it's about an application and submission error. I should justify this by mentioning the application outage involved. It seems like I need to output a JSON object with the category as \"Internal Project\" due to the schema requirements presented. I'll make sure to properly format it, stating: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nDouble-checking the spelling is important, so I\u2019m ready to respond correctly!"
