The ticket involves issues with malware detection, potentially needing an exception or whitelisting. I see how this relates to either \"Administrative rights\" or possibly \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\". Since it seems like whitelisting might require admin rights, I'm leaning towards \"Administrative rights.\" This categorization will help address the issue effectively!**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing the content about a software being detected as malicious. I see \"Miscellaneous\" as a broad option since there's no specific \"Security\" category. The mention of a REST client might suggest \"Internal Project,\" but that doesn't fit since it's not an internal project. However, the issue mainly involves software detection and exception whitelisting. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit due to admin privileges required, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the safest choice for this ambiguous IT issue.**Choosing the IT category**\n\nI'm considering that \"Administrative rights\" might be the right category for this ticket since the user is requesting an exception for safe software usage, which requires admin privileges. The user mentions a customized REST client flagged as malicious by antivirus, which adds context. So, I\u2019ll categorize this under \"Administrative rights.\" I could also suggest a brief summary about the situation and recommended actions, but my main focus is outputting the correct category in the required JSON format.{\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
