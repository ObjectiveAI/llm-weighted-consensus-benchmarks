The text mentions receiving constant messages and seems to describe an ongoing issue, possibly related to spam or phishing. \n\nGiven the options available\u2014like \"Access\" and \"Miscellaneous\"\u2014neither fits perfectly since security or email categories aren\u2019t included. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" since it\u2019s the most fitting for this issue, which doesn't clearly align with any specified category. Let's categorize it!**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nIn reviewing the content, it suggests investigating a potential email issue, possibly related to spam. This could align with \"Miscellaneous\" since it's a general problem that doesn't neatly fit other categories. While \"Access\" might relate to accounts, this is about receiving messages from various addresses.\n\nSince \"Security\" or \"Phishing\" isn't an option, I\u2019ll default to \"Miscellaneous.\" I can return a JSON object with this category. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
