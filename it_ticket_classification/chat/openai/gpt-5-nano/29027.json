I'm considering the categories of Internal Project, Access, or Administrative rights, but I think it fits best under \"Internal Project\" since it seems to focus on the progress of something internal.**Choosing a Category**\n\nI'm considering that if the ticket is about subscriptions and Azure, it might fit under \"Access\" for accessing resources or \"Administrative rights\" for changes in access control. However, since it seems focused on an internal project related to Azure, I think \"Internal Project\" fits best. The user's string is a bit chaotic, but the emphasis on Azure suggests a project context. So, I'll respond with a JSON object specifying \"Internal Project\" as the category.**Confirming Output Format**\n\nI need to output just the category according to the specified JSON format. Based on the schema, I\u2019ll return {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It seems like I should only include the \"category\" property, as the instructions mention simplicity for parsing purposes. The requirement is straightforward, so I\u2019ll focus on the correct syntax with double quotes. Let's make sure everything is laid out right and deliver this cleanly!"
