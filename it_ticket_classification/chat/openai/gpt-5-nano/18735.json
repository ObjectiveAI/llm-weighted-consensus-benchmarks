Analyzing the ticket content reveals it\u2019s about a new starter form and hardware requests, specifically mentioning a monitor and workstation. Since it relates to employee onboarding and hardware needs, it fits into both hardware and HR support categories. I\u2019ll mark it accordingly to ensure it gets to the right team.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at several options for categorizing an IT ticket: \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Hardware.\" The main issue seems to be about filling out required fields in a starter form related to a new employee's work location and hardware, like a monitor and workstation. Given that it\u2019s an onboarding issue, \"HR Support\" feels appropriate. However, since there are hardware requests, I might also consider \"Hardware.\" Ultimately, I think \"HR Support\" might be the best choice for categorization.**Deciding Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket deals with a \"new starter\" onboarding, primarily focusing on filling out a \"starter form,\" which aligns with the \"HR Support\" category. While the text includes specifics about hardware, the overall theme is onboarding. \"Administrative rights\" isn\u2019t relevant here. The \"Purchase\" category relates to hardware requests but doesn't match the main purpose of the ticket. Given the user's request to categorize, I believe \"HR Support\" is the best fit, and I\u2019ll prepare to output a JSON object with that category.**Formatting Category Response**\n\nI see that the instruction requires me to respond with a category in a specific JSON format. There's a category schema provided, so I need to determine which category fits best based on the content. The ticket is about a \"new starter\" and includes details regarding filling out a \"starter form\" and requests for hardware, like a monitor and workstation. Overall, it seems \"HR Support\" would be the most fitting category. I\u2019ll prepare to output that as a JSON object accordingly.**Classifying Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m classifying the ticket as \"HR Support\" because it relates to onboarding forms, which is clearly the main focus. Although there are details about hardware that could suggest \"Hardware,\" the instruction specifies choosing only one category. Since \"new starter\" strongly indicates onboarding, I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll make sure to format my response exactly as needed in a JSON object, like so: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"} \n\nNo extra commentary needed."
