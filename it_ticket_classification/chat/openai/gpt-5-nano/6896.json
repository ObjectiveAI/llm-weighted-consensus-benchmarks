It seems to touch on HR topics like \"change line manager,\" \"annual leave,\" and \"unapproved vacations.\" The mention of \"oracle\" might imply it's about the Oracle system, but overall, it sounds more aligned with \"HR Support\" rather than an IT issue since it includes aspects that are more HR-focused, like leave approvals and management changes. I'll categorize it under HR Support.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket seems to relate to IT issues, specifically regarding \"Access\" since it mentions changing a line manager in the Oracle system. The user is likely requesting help with system access, as well as mentioning \"annual leave\" and \"unapproved vacations.\" It's a bit confusing with mixed topics, but it could fit both \"Access\" and \"HR Support.\" However, it leans more towards an \"Access\" request since it involves system privileges related to Oracle. So, I think I'll categorize it under \"Access.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIt's clear this ticket belongs in an IT system, particularly since it mentions changing a line manager in Oracle. Parsing through the text, I see aspects related to HR, but the IT category applies more directly here. I need to produce a JSON object with the category specified. The valid categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and a few others. Based on the information, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Access.\u201d I'll format my response as a valid JSON object as per the instructions.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
