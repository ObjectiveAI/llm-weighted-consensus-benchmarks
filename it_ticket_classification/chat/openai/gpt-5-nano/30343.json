So, I'll categorize this under \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll need to respond with a JSON output that includes this classification.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI think this ticket is best mapped to \"Internal Project\" because it relates to an internal project for a service recovery test. I considered other categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and \"Hardware,\" but the key terms suggest it\u2019s more about documentation and procedures for disaster recovery. While \"Access\" could apply if it involves system access for testing, it isn\u2019t explicitly mentioned. So, I'll go with \"Internal Project\" for the categorization.**Finalizing JSON Output**\n\nI'll produce a JSON object with the category set to \"Internal Project\" as our categorized response. Since the content doesn\u2019t suggest a more specialized category, I'll stick to the predefined options. The format is clearly defined as a simple JSON object, so I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra text included. It\u2019ll look like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nAlright, let\u2019s wrap this up and finalize that!"
