Based on the predefined categories, it might fit under \"Administrative rights.\" So, I should output a JSON object indicating the category as \"Administrative rights\" to align with the schema requirements.**Analyzing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m examining the ticket and thinking \"new starter\" suggests onboarding, while \"administration officer\" likely refers to a role. Maybe this is about access, particularly \"VPN access date\"? The mention of \"pm\" might refer to a project manager. I need to select the best category from options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and more. Since there\u2019s a focus on a new employee, the \"HR Support\" category could fit, even though it leans more toward IT with access needs.**Deciding on the IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to make sense of this ticket. \"New starter\" suggests it's related to onboarding and likely concerns provisioning access and accounts. The category could be \"Access\" or perhaps \"Administrative rights\" if it relates to granting admin privileges. The phrase \"administration officer\" could just refer to the role instead of rights. There's also ambiguity with \"va date.\" It might relate to a start date for the new employee in Bucharest, and since this is IT-focused, \"HR Support\" isn't really fitting.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
