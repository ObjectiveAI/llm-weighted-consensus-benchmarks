The message is quite messy, but it seems to mention unwanted emails, perhaps indicating spam. The ticket could relate to \"unwanted emails from com,\" and I'm trying to figure out the best category for this. With terms like \"attached\" and \"frequently receiving,\" I might consider classifying it as \"Miscellaneous,\" or maybe even \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but I'm not entirely sure yet.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out which category fits best for the ticket. After considering options like \"Internal Project,\" \"Storage,\" and others, I realize none of those are suitable. \"Administrative rights\" seems off too. The situation appears to fall under \"Miscellaneous\" since it\u2019s a general IT issue, and maybe \"Access\" if it relates to spam or unauthorized access. The text mentions \"unwanted\" and \"attached,\" suggesting possible malware, but since \"Security\" isn\u2019t an option, I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous\" and output it as a JSON object.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
