The categories I have are things like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and so on. The user\u2019s message is a bit jumbled but does have keywords like \"new starter,\" \"admin,\" \"creation,\" \"lead,\" and possibly a request for \"Administrative rights.\" It seems like this might be about creating an account for a new starter, so I'll likely categorize it under \"Administrative rights.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think this ticket is about adding a new user and granting AD admin access rights. The categories I have are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" While \"Access\" feels a bit generic, the phrase \"new starter ad admin\" suggests it\u2019s more specific to granting admin privileges, which fits under \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket mentions aspects like \"creation\" and \"senior engineer ext information,\" supporting that the request is indeed for creating an AD account for a new starter.**Formatting ticket category**\n\nThe user provided a string that seems to indicate they're looking for something related to a new starter and possibly duplicating tickets. I need to categorize this IT ticket using a specific JSON format. Given the keywords like \"new starter ad admin\" and the idea of creating an AD user account, \u201cAccess\u201d appears to be the safest choice. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also work. To meet the requirements, I\u2019ll output the category as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
