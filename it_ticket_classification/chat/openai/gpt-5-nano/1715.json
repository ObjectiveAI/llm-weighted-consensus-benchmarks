The \"Administrative rights\" category doesn\u2019t quite fit since it focuses more on admin capabilities.

This ticket needs to be categorized, so I\u2019ll confirm the response format. The \"category\" field has to be one of the specified options, and in this case, \"Access\" fits well since it relates to trouble with passwords and complexity requirements.
