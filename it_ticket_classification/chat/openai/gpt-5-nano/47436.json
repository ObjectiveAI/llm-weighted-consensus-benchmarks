The user asked me to categorize the ticket text, which is quite messy and talks about connectivity issues and urgency. I'll need to decide which category fits best and then format the output as a JSON-like object with a \"category\" field. This might be a bit of work, but I can handle it!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions several connectivity issues, highlighting urgency and difficulties with connections, which suggests it relates to network problems, VPN, or remote access. The category \"Access\" seems most appropriate since it could cover login or connection issues. Although \"Hardware\" might apply if it\u2019s a device problem, the focus on connection suggests \"Access\" fits best. I'll structure the output as a JSON-like object with the chosen category explicitly defined.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to format the answer as a JSON object according to the specified schema. The only required field is \"category,\" and given the context of the ticket, \"Access\" is the right choice since it pertains to connectivity issues. I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra text, just the pure JSON output that matches the schema exactly. So, I\u2019ll finalize it with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This should meet all the requirements!"
