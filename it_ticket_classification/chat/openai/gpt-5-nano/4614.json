It\u2019s important to classify it correctly to ensure it gets to the right team. I\u2019ll look closely at the details of the ticket to make the best choice. Okay, let\u2019s go through those categories and see which one fits best!**Analyzing contract review workflow**\n\nThis text seems to outline a workflow related to contract reviews. I notice terms like \"approval rights,\" \"joiner process,\" \"approve contracts,\" \"counsel,\" and \"signature.\" It feels like there are several requests for help regarding contract review, along with mentions of deadlines and urgent tasks. It\u2019s important to clarify these details, like who should approve what, and make sure all necessary documents are uploaded and reviewed properly. Let's make sure to address every aspect!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this request. It could relate to \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or maybe \"Internal Project\" or \"Purchase.\" Since this is focused on contract review and mentions \"approval rights,\" it seems likely to fall under \"Administrative rights,\" as it involves the rights to approve contracts. The user is asking for help with contract review in what seems like an onboarding process, so I\u2019ll lean towards that category rather than hardware, HR, or other unrelated options.**Classifying contract management tasks**\n\nI see that there are terms like \"copy signed document,\" \"signature,\" \"attached agreement,\" and \"upload contract,\" indicating this is more about contract management rather than typical IT support. Within the given categories, \"Administrative rights\" feels like the best fit since it relates to approving contracts and contract review workflows. While some might consider it an \"Internal Project\" due to the joiner process aspect, the core focus is on approval rights. So, I\u2019m categorizing this as \"Administrative rights\" and will respond accordingly."
