Since they don\u2019t specify if it's a hardware issue or something related to access, I think the best fit is \"Miscellaneous.\" This category works for general IT issues that don\u2019t clearly fall into other categories like hardware or access.\n\nSo, I'll create a JSON object with the category set to \"Miscellaneous.\" The final output will be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
