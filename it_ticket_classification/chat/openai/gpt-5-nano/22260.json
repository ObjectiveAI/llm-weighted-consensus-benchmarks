Still, the ticket mentions phrases like \"buyer rights needed\" and \"preparer rights,\" making \"Access\" also a potential choice. However, \"Administrative rights\" is really a sub-type of \"Access\" with elevated privileges, so it\u2019s the best fit. I\u2019ll format my response as the requested JSON object, ensuring it clearly shows \"Administrative rights\" as the category. Let's proceed!**Formatting the JSON response**\n\nI see that the required format is a JSON schema-like object, specifically one detailing the category field's enum. In these tasks, I typically need to present the chosen category as a JSON string. Based on that, I'd output: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.\n\nThe schema specifies a JSON object, but it seems clear from prior tasks that I should simply include the category. To comply and keep it clean, I\u2019ll provide just the necessary JSON without any extra text. So here it is: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
