The ticket mentions terms like \u201cnew starter,\u201d \u201cstarter form,\u201d \u201cdue tomorrow,\u201d and a need for assistance. It feels like it\u2019s related to HR and onboarding processes. I\u2019m thinking the best fit might be \"HR Support.\" Although \"Administrative rights\" is another contender, it focuses on access permissions, which doesn't quite match. So, HR Support seems the most appropriate.**Clarifying IT ticket category**\n\nI need to re-evaluate the categories available for this IT ticket. The provided options do include \"Access,\" but it\u2019s clear that the ticket is focused on HR-related onboarding tasks. It mentions a \"starter form,\" a new employee, and that it\u2019s due soon. So hardware, storage, and purchasing don\u2019t apply here. While \"Administrative rights\" could be a consideration, it doesn't specifically mention access rights. Overall, \"HR Support\" feels like the best fit for this ticket.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a proper JSON object for this IT ticket categorization. The format requires an object with a \"category\" field that has a string value restricted to specific options. Based on the ticket, I\u2019ll output: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nIt's important to make sure that the string matches the enumerated value exactly, including the correct case and spacing. I just need to ensure it\u2019s formatted correctly, without any extra text, so I\u2019ll deliver just the JSON object."
