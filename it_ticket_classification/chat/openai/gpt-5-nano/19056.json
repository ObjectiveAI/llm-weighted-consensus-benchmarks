The user asked me to categorize it, and the text mentions server settings for emails that aren\u2019t deliverable to external domains. It seems to address issues of access rights and administrative settings affecting functionality. Given the keywords like \"rights\" and \"permissions,\" it looks like \"Administrative rights\" might be the best category, even though it also touches on aspects of access permissions.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m pondering the best category for this IT ticket. It seems to focus on aspects like access to external domains, server settings, and issues with undeliverable forms. While \"Access\" could fit due to login concerns, it feels too generic. The request emphasizes \"rights rules which affect functionality,\" pointing toward permissions. The repeated theme of investigating proper rights makes \"Administrative rights\" the most fitting category, as it captures the nuances of ownership and required solutions.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
