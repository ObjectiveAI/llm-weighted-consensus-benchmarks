It seems to reference a mouse request that was fulfilled, mentioning replacement and expressing appreciation for prompt service. This suggests it\u2019s related to hardware. The potential categories include \u201cHardware\u201d and maybe \u201cPurchase,\u201d but since it\u2019s specifically about fulfilling a hardware request, I think \u201cHardware\u201d is the most appropriate category here. It definitely aligns with typical IT ticket classifications!**Creating JSON response**\n\nI'm assigning the category \"Hardware\" for the ticket. According to the allowed category format, we need to format this as a JSON object. The instructions clearly say to categorize the IT ticket, so I\u2019ll create a response like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It\u2019s important to follow the structure without adding any extra text. I'll keep it concise and ensure the capitalization matches exactly with the given enum values. This will be our clean response!"
