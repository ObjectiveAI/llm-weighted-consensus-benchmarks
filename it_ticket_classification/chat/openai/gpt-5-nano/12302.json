The text mentions \"service now users password,\" \"users forgot,\" and \"configure automated logged st every details,\" among other things. Given these points about user passwords and authentication, it seems to best fit the \"Access\" category. This makes sense since it relates directly to access and login problems. Let's aim to handle this properly!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for the IT ticket based on the user's description. It might also relate to \"Administrative rights\" for permission resets, but \"Access\" seems more fitting since there\u2019s a focus on passwords and login issues. The mention of \"export\" and \"report\" leans towards \"Miscellaneous,\" but with the given categories, \"Access\" is the strongest choice. I need to respond with a JSON object in the required format, simply stating {\"category\": \"Access\"}. That's the plan!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
