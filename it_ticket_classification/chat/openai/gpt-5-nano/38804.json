They mention errors in reports, open requisitions, and candidates, but it\u2019s not clear. I\u2019m thinking it might fit in categories like \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access,\" but definitely not \"Hardware\" or anything HR-related. It seems more technical, so I\u2019ll focus on those applicable categories. It\u2019s a bit messy, but I\u2019ll sort it out!**Refining category selection**\n\nI see that the IT ticket might connect to \"HR Support\" due to mentions of requisitions and candidates. However, it really seems focused on an error related to reports within a system. The available categories don't exactly match up since there's no \"Reports\" or \"Software\" options. \"Internal Project\" feels broad, but it could fit if it's about ongoing IT projects. If there are access rights needed, \"Access\" might apply, but the user\u2019s message isn\u2019t clear on that. I'll need to choose carefully!**Choosing the right category**\n\nI see that the user mentions a difficult line that includes \"open requisitions,\" which leans towards HR systems. This makes me think we could categorize this IT ticket as \"HR Support\" since it relates to requisitions and candidates. The categories include \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Given the HR context of the issue involving a report, the best match seems to be \"HR Support.\" I should prepare the final answer in a structured, JSON-like format since that\u2019s what the user needs!**Formatting JSON response**\n\nAlright, I need to respond with a JSON object for the category label. The instruction shows that it should follow a specific schema, which outlines that the response needs to be structured as an object with a \"category\" field. Given the decision to categorize it as \"HR Support,\" the final JSON should look like: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to avoid adding any extraneous text and stick strictly to this format!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
