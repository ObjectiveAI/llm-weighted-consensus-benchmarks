They mention changing the owner of an Outlook mailbox, which indicates access management. The terms used suggest the ticket fits under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" Since the request emphasizes changing ownership and adding members to a mailbox, it's more about permissions. So, I'll choose the \"Administrative rights\" category for effective classification since it's directly related to access control for that mailbox.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The user mentioned changing the owner of an Outlook mailbox, which is indeed an admin task. \"Administrative rights\" feels like the most specific and accurate choice. While \"Access\" could be more generic, the context here clearly points to administrative privileges. So I\u2019ll go with \"Administrative rights\" and format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
