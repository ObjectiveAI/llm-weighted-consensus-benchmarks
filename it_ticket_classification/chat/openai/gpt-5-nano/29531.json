The ticket text is about \"new purchase po\" and mentions installation and receipts. Given that it relates to a purchase order, the most fitting category seems to be \"Purchase.\" Although there might be elements of \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" those don't really apply here. So, I'll classify it as \"Purchase\" and return that in a JSON-like object.**Formatting the JSON response**\n\nI need to format the response as a JSON object, specifically including the category field. Following the required schema, I should respond with a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I realize it's essential to ensure \"Purchase\" is one of the allowed categories. I'll keep the output concise and directly present the required JSON without any extra commentary. My final answer will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Seems straightforward, so let's go ahead and output that!"
