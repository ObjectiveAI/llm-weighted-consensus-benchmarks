The content hints it's about an employee leaving, as it includes terms like \"leaver,\" \"leave date,\" and \"location.\" It seems to involve HR and Access requests related to deprovisioning for the leaver. There are several mentions of approvals and details about their work setup. Overall, it looks like this is an HR/Access request for someone who is departing.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI need to decide on the best category for this IT ticket, which includes options like HR Support and Access. The ticket involves deprovisioning a leaver, mentioning access rights, profiles, mailboxes, and account removals. It seems to center around revoking access, so \"Access\" appears to be the closest fit. I could consider \"Administrative rights\" if that's being particularly requested. Given the technical nature of the tasks, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and respond with {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
