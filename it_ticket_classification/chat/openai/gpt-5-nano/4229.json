It mentions \"flash monitor\" and \"local support,\" suggesting it might relate to hardware. The key terms like \"monitor\" lead me to think it fits under the \"Hardware\" category. However, there's also uncertainty around phrases like \"please separate receiving.\" So, while \"flash monitor\" makes me lean toward hardware, I want to ensure that fits best before deciding.**Deciding on category**\n\nI've decided that the most fitting category for this IT ticket is \"Hardware.\" I don't think \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" apply here. I need to respond with a JSON object that clearly states the category. The format requires the field \"category\" to contain a string, so I'll output it as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll ensure it\u2019s properly formatted without any extra comments, just the essential information to keep it clear and tidy."
