It mentions the headset not working, references some days, and includes terms like \"needs order\" and \"additional drivers.\" The ticket could fall under \"Hardware\" since it focuses on the headset, but it may also touch on \"Purchase\" if an order is needed. However, since it mostly revolves around the headset, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\"**Outputting JSON for categorization**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket and respond with a JSON object. The category is determined to be \"Hardware.\" Based on the instructions, I should format my output as a JSON object containing this category. \n\nSo the correct output in the JSON format will be: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. I want to ensure it meets the requirements and is structured properly. Since this is specific to categorization, I'll stick to delivering the necessary JSON format with just the category field.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
