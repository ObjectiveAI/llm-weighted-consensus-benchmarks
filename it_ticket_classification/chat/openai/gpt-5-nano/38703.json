The possible categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the context, the main focus is on accessing the folder drive, which seems to fit well under the Access category. However, it could also relate to Storage. I should lean towards Access for this ticket.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nHmm, for this IT ticket, it sounds like the user is having trouble accessing a folder or drive. The mention of access rights and permissions leads me to believe that \"Access\" is the right category. Even though \"Administrative rights\" is noted, it ultimately fits within Access better. I want to make sure I follow the schema correctly, sticking to allowed values. So, my output will just be the JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
