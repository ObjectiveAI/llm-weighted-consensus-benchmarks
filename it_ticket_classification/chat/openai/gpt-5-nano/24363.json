The ticket seems to focus on a default setting related to a checkout option within a client application rather than a browser. Since it's about user experience and default behaviors, it might fit into \"Access\" or perhaps \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" The main point is changing a default setting that impacts usability.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThis ticket likely relates to \"Access\" regarding libraries in a client application. It could be about \"Administrative rights\" if changing default settings requires such privileges. Considering the provided categories\u2014like Hardware, HR Support, and Miscellaneous\u2014it seems to best fit \"Access\" because it involves default access to libraries versus a browser. The mention of an intuitive default setup implies a focus on user experience, though \"Miscellaneous\" might also work if it doesn\u2019t fit cleanly. Ultimately, \"Access\" seems to be the best choice."
