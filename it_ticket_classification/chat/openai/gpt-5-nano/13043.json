The request mentions needing \"access to Oracle Friday PM,\" which implies it's related to access. There\u2019s also a part about providing a \"write module\" for someone who joined, which suggests it could pertain to administrative rights or write permissions. Given the details, \u201cAccess\u201d seems to be the most appropriate category, but I\u2019m also considering \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d Overall, it centers around access to Oracle by Friday PM.**Processing IT ticket category**\n\nThe request to \"write module she joined\" likely means granting write access for someone who recently joined, which relates to access and permissions. Given that the main focus here is on access to Oracle, I think \u201cAccess\u201d is the best category choice. I need to respond in the specified JSON format, ensuring I include only the necessary content. So I\u2019ll respond with the category object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This way, I'm keeping it clear and direct!{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI want to make sure I deliver just the necessary information without any extra text. I noticed that \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d is an exact phrase option, but since I\u2019m going with \u201cAccess,\u201d it fits perfectly within the allowed categories. It\u2019s important I stick to this format for clarity. So, I feel confident that responding with \"Access\" is the right choice. Let\u2019s keep it simple and direct!"
