The main focus seems to be on disk allocation and storage needs. I\u2019m leaning towards picking \"Storage\" as the appropriate category since it aligns closely with the user\u2019s concerns about disk size and allocated storage upgrades. Internal Project could be a possibility, but \"Storage\" feels more fitting overall.**Preparing JSON Category Object**\n\nI need to reply with a JSON category object that fits the required format. The instruction specifies to include \u201ccategory\u201d with valid options. The system indicates I should use the final channel for this. It seems I need to output just the JSON object for the category. Given that \"Storage\" is the best fit based on the user's ticket content, I\u2019ll prepare the response as:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}  \n\nI'll ensure the formatting is accurate since that\u2019s crucial for clarity.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
