The phrase \"visible outer name\" could refer to a UI element. The request seems to ask for creating a new list for Friday afternoon and ensuring something named \"outer name\" is visible. It could fall under \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are needed, but it doesn't mention login or access. I need to pinpoint the right category here!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe ticket says, \"new list required,\" which might refer to a mailing list. It could be categorized under \"Internal Project\" if it's part of a broader initiative, but \"Miscellaneous\" might be the simplest choice given the ambiguity. The \"Administrative rights\" category focuses on permissions and doesn't quite fit the request. Since the content is unclear, I think I'll lean towards \"Miscellaneous,\" but I should also consider asking a clarifying question to the user.**Formulating category response**\n\nThe user\u2019s request includes a deadline: \"friday pm required,\" and a vague phrase about creating a \"visible outer name.\" I\u2019m considering if it\u2019s part of an \"Internal Project,\" but since the instructions state I need to select from specific categories, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit for this ambiguous ticket. \n\nI\u2019ll respond with a JSON object formatted correctly as {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}, ensuring it adheres to the required schema for the assistant's output.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
