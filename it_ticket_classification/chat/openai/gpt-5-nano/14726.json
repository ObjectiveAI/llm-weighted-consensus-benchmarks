The user's ticket text is a bit jumbled, mentioning various reports related to capacity reporting. It doesn't clearly fit into any specific category as \"Reporting\" isn't listed. I\u2019m thinking it could possibly belong to \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but I\u2019ll need to parse it further to decide.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI believe the closest category for this IT ticket would be \"Internal Project,\" as it seems to involve a project request, but \"Miscellaneous\" might work too for general inquiries. Categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Hardware\" don't seem relevant. The user specifically asked me to categorize the ticket, which focuses on reporting tasks that don't cleanly fit into any of the predefined categories, making my decision a bit tricky. I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nIt seems reasonable to categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it involves creating reports. Alternatively, I could consider \"Miscellaneous\" if I'm unsure. Typically, ticket categories classify project tasks as \"Internal Project.\" Since the user directly asked me to categorize it, I\u2019ll go with that option. I need to format it as a JSON object in the structure specified, so it will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I wonder if I should add a minimal note alongside that?{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
