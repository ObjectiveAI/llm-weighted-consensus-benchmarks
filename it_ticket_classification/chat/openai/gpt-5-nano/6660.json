It seems that they want someone deleted from the list and a new member added. \n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019m thinking it best fits under the \"HR Support\" category since it involves personnel changes within a team. Let's proceed with that classification!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to take action on this IT ticket by removing the departed tester from the mailing list and adding a new tester. Since this relates to managing user access and mailing lists, I think the \u201cAccess\u201d category fits best. While \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if there are permissions changes, this request is primarily about access management. I'll categorize the ticket as \"Access\" and prepare a brief summary of the request in a JSON object format!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
