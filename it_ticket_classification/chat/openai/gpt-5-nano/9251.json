The provided categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. \n\nThe ticket mentions \"request additional space\" and \"assigned to MS IT support team,\" which indicates it could be about Storage. There's also a reference to \"decisions\" and \"resizing pictures.\" Therefore, I\u2019m considering categorizing it under Storage, Miscellaneous, or Administrative Rights. It seems the best fit might be Storage.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI noticed references to \"deadline resizing pictures,\" which makes me think this is about resizing images and, more importantly, storage space for that purpose. The core concern seems to be a \"request for additional space,\" indicating it should be categorized as Storage.\n\nI\u2019ll respond in the required JSON format, matching the expected schema. So, my output will simply be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}\n\nI\u2019ll keep it concise, without any extra text or justification."
