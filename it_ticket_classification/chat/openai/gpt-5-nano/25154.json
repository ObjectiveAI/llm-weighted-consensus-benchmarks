The text clearly mentions \"annual leave requests\" and \"approve,\" which points to human resources. I\u2019ll go ahead and categorize this as \"HR Support.\" The final output will be structured as a JSON object with the appropriate category.**Creating JSON Response**\n\nThe instruction indicates that I should respond with a category, so I'll format my answer as a JSON object. I'll go with {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} since that aligns with the context of the request. It's a straightforward task, but it feels good to make sure I'm getting this right. Now, let's finalize that JSON response!"
