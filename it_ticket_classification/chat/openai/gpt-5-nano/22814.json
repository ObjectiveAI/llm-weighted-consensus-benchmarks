I'm seeing connections to compliance and confidentiality, pointing towards either \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights\" categories. \n\nSince it\u2019s related to onboarding a new starter and compliance, \"HR Support\" seems like the most fitting choice.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm considering that this ticket is likely about onboarding, which often involves user access to systems. The phrase \"new starter\" typically points to HR onboarding, leading me to think \"HR Support\" is the best fit. While \"Access\" could relate to system access, it seems more administrative and about onboarding. The content mentioning a \"compliance officer\" and \"information confidential\" also supports this. So, I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"HR Support\" for clarity and accuracy.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nThe content of the ticket mentions aspects like a \"new starter in Bogota\" and \"completed form,\" indicating it's related to HR onboarding. Given this context, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" The instructions are clear: I need to provide the category in a specific JSON format. So my response will be a straightforward JSON object: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nNo extra explanations are needed\u2014just the required format!"
