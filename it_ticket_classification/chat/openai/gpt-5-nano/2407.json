This ticket requests changing the person responsible who\u2019s on maternity leave, adjusting assigned accounts, and updating records. The mention of \"cannot make modifications\" suggests they need permission to change something, so \"Administrative rights\" seems like the right category for this task.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the ticket that mentions \"cannot make modifications\" and \"amend records.\" It seems to be about changing who is responsible and adjusting access permissions. The user is asking to categorize this IT ticket, so I\u2019ll choose one category. \"Administrative rights\" feels like the best fit here because it involves replacing someone due to maternity leave and updating records, which requires appropriate permissions. I\u2019ll create a JSON object with the category set to \"Administrative rights.\"{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
