They mentioned issues like \"net access blocked,\" \"automated requests,\" and \"malicious software,\" which suggests that network access is at stake. I have several categories to choose from, including \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and others. Given the context, \"Access\" seems the most fitting since it directly pertains to the blocked network access. So, I'll go ahead and categorize it as \"Access.\"**Responding with JSON**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category. The prompt includes a structure indicating it should be something like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The instructions mention categorizing the IT ticket, so I think I should just output the JSON without any extra notes. It's clear that I need to ensure the format is valid. Therefore, my response will solely be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No additional text, just the JSON!"
