The ticket's content is somewhat confusing, but it mentions issues with uploading documents and relates to folder structures and a storage repository. This likely connects to the categories of Storage or Access. Since it mentions the inability to upload documents, I'll lean toward the Storage category as the most relevant option for classification.**Deciding on Category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"folder structure\" and \"storage repository,\" which could fit into the \"Storage\" category. While there\u2019s a mention of \"tickets assigned,\" it doesn't indicate a clear issue with administrative rights. Since they didn't explicitly say anything about those rights, I think the best choice is \"Storage.\" I need to respond with a JSON object that includes: {\"category\": \"Storage\"}. It\u2019s straightforward, so I\u2019ll just deliver that without any extra commentary."
