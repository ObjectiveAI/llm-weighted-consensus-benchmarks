The allowed categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I'll determine the best match for the ticket, focusing on the \"new hardware request\" aspect. Finally, I'll output this as a JSON object with the appropriate category field.**Categorizing hardware request**\n\nThe user's ticket mentions several key phrases like \"hardware request,\" \"hard disk error,\" and \"serial number,\" which seem to revolve around hardware issues. I see three possible categories: Hardware, Storage, and Purchase. However, \"new hardware request\" strongly indicates that the most fitting category is \"Hardware.\" Even though there are references to storage issues, the primary focus is on requesting new hardware. So, I'll finalize my response as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} with the precise formatting required."
