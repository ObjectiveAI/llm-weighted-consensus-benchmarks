The categories available include HR Support, Access, and Miscellaneous, among others. It seems that the issue may be related to uploading resumes, which leans towards HR Support since it relates to resumes. It's interesting that IT would have HR Support as a category, but it makes sense for inquiries about the HR system.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nThe user's message asks me to categorize an IT ticket that seems to involve issues with the \"upload resume functionality.\" The phrasing is a bit messy, but the main takeaway is that the resume upload isn't working as intended, even though it mentions that submitting a friend's resume works. Since they want me to categorize it and not fix the issue, I'll need to choose the category that fits best without overthinking it.**Choosing IT ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best categories for a ticket regarding uploading resume functionality, likely related to job referrals. \"HR Support\" seems to fit well since it's about HR system features. \"Access\" could imply login or permission issues, but there's no specific \"Software\" category. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too general, while \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t apply here. Given that this involves HR processes, I think categorizing it as \"HR Support\" is my best option. Alternatively, if it\u2019s part of a project, \"Internal Project\" could work too.**Formatting the category response**\n\nThe user's message seems to ask about the \"upload resume functionality,\" which likely points to a feature issue in an HR system. \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category for this ticket since it relates to human resources systems. I need to respond with a JSON object formatted to indicate this category. It should look like: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I should also consider confirming if they'd like alternative options, just to keep the conversation open and clear.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
