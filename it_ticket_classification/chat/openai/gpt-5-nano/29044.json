It mentions needing users for a proof of concept and testing phase, along with infrastructure details. I'm considering two categories: \"Access,\" since it's about adding users for access to a project, or \"Internal Project,\" given the focus on the proof of concept and testing. I\u2019ll go with whichever seems to fit best!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m weighing the categories for the IT ticket. It mentions needing users for a proof of concept and testing phase, which makes me think \u201cAccess\u201d fits because it\u2019s about user access. However, after parsing the message, it really seems to involve project work, so \u201cInternal Project\u201d might be a better fit since it concerns project activities like implementing a PoC. I need to ensure I map it correctly to the provided categories!**Choosing the right category**\n\nI'm deciding between \"Internal Project\" and \"Access\" for this IT ticket regarding user lists needed for a proof of concept. The request centers on identifying participants involved in the PoC and testing, which feels more aligned with \"Internal Project\" rather than granting access. The mention of \"friday pm\" seems to be a deadline, but that's not essential to categorization. So I\u2019ll prepare the response as a JSON object with the category set as \"Internal Project.\"**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI see there\u2019s a specific JSON format required for the category, which looks like this: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}. \n\nI need to respond with just the JSON object, specifically categorizing it as \"Internal Project.\" Although I considered adding justification, the instructions show I should only provide the JSON without extra text. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll stick to the required format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let\u2019s do it!"
