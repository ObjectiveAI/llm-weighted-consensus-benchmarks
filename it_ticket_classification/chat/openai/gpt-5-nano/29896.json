The content indicates a problem with visibility after an expense report is approved, which sounds related to Access or Administrative rights. It could also fit into Miscellaneous since it\u2019s about viewing past expense claims. I\u2019ll carefully consider these options to ensure the ticket is categorized appropriately and sent to the right team for assistance.**Choosing the right category**\n\nFor this IT helpdesk ticket, categorizing it under \"Access\" seems fitting because the user is inquiring about viewing their expense history and losing visibility in the expense system. Although \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could also apply if their permissions changed, the primary focus is on access. The user requested categorization, and I need to format my response as a JSON object. So, I\u2019ll go with {\"category\":\"Access\"} since it aligns best with the issue described.**Finalizing category response**\n\nWhile \"Administrative rights\" might seem relevant since the user is facing visibility loss possibly due to permission changes, the primary focus is on their inquiry about how to view expense history and access past claims after approval. Thus, \"Access\" feels like the more fitting category. I\u2019ll follow the instruction to categorize the IT ticket and format my response accordingly as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Since they want just the category, I\u2019ll prioritize clarity and accuracy in my response!"
