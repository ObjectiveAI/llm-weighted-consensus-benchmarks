After reading through the long thread about hardware allocation for a new starter in Denmark, I see mentions of password resets, AD sync, device provisioning, and supplier details. While the key category seems to be \"Hardware,\" there\u2019s also some relevance to \"Access\" due to the credentials involved. However, \"Hardware\" feels like the primary choice here.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket that includes ordering hardware and budget approvals. It could fit into the \"Purchase\" category as well, but since it focuses more on hardware provisioning for a new starter in Denmark, I think \"Hardware\" is the best choice. The content mentions important terms like \"approve,\" \"PO number,\" and \"supplier order completed.\" I will format the output as a JSON object that specifies \"category\": \"Hardware.\" So, let's go ahead with that!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
