The phrase \"requester cannot be edited\" suggests there's an access problem, possibly tied to administrative rights. I should categorize this as \"Access,\" focusing on permission levels. It seems that this is more about the ability to edit the requester field in a requisitioning context. So, I'm considering \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" as the key categories.**Analyzing user request**\n\nI'm looking at the user's message, which is a bit jumbled but mentions topics like \"assign buyer entities,\" \"requisitioning,\" and \"requester cannot be edited.\" It feels like they\u2019re seeking help with user access and permissions in Oracle. I think I should categorize this request under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The phrase about the requester suggests it's about editing permissions, so \"Administrative rights\" could indicate a need for higher-level access. It's definitely focused on permission setup!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
