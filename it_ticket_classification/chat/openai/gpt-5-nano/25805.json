This definitely relates to HR support. I think the right category here would be \"HR Support,\" since it concerns HR onboarding forms. Even though there might be a chance to categorize it under \"Administrative rights\" if access was mentioned, it seems focused on the form. So, I need to output a category object with \"category\": \"HR Support.\"**Creating category assignment**\n\nI need to output a category object following the specified format, which requires a \"category\" string. The instruction is quite clear: I'm to categorize this IT ticket based on the JSON schema provided. It looks like they're asking for a straightforward assignment.\n\nSince the ticket mentions \"new starter\" and \"starter form,\" it relates to HR onboarding, so \"HR Support\" fits perfectly. I\u2019ll craft the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I won\u2019t add any extra text; just keep it simple!"
