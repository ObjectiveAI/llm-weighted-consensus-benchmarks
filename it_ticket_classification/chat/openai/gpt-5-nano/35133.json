Given the context, it doesn't seem related to hardware, HR support, or purchase. Instead, this is likely a software issue related to access or maybe an internal project. The best fit seems to be \"Miscellaneous\" since it covers various IT issues. So I\u2019m leaning that way!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out the best category for this IT ticket. The closest matches could be \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project,\" but there\u2019s also \"Administrative rights\" if access is an issue. The user mentioned they can't set a period and urgently need help, but there's no mention of any hardware or storage problems. It could potentially fit under \"Access\" if they're missing permissions, but that\u2019s not explicitly stated. Overall, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" since it covers a variety of technical issues.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nIn this case, I\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket. It seems to relate to a software issue, which could fall under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project,\" especially since it involves a report for a programme portfolio officer. Given the urgency and context about the Oracle report not running, \"Internal Project\" feels appropriate. However, since the ticket doesn\u2019t clearly fit into hardware or software, I think \"Miscellaneous\" might be the safest choice for a generic category."
