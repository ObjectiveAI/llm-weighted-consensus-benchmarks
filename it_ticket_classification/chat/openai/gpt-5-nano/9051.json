It looks like it fits into either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but since the main issue is folder access, I think \"Access\" is the best category. It\u2019s about permissions!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe message contains phrases like \"access to the folder,\" \"urgent,\" \"cannot work without,\" and mentions an \"attached starter form.\" This seems to relate to permissions for a folder, making \"Access\" the most fitting category. Some might consider \"Administrative rights,\" but since the focus is folder access, \"Access\" is clearer. Although I'm wondering if it's linked to HR due to phrases like \"starter form joining,\" it fundamentally seems to be an IT request focused on access. So, \"Access\" it is!**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe instruction asks me to categorize the IT ticket as a JSON object, specifically with the key \"category.\" The required format is straightforward: it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to ensure that I follow this format exactly. There\u2019s no need for extra information, just the JSON response itself. So, I\u2019m ready to answer this concisely as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
