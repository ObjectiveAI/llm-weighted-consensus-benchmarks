The user mentions \"signature,\" \"recently promoted,\" and \"update signature information.\" Looking at the allowed categories, it doesn't fit hardware, storage, purchase, access, internal projects, or administrative rights. I'm leaning towards categorizing this as \"HR Support\" since it specifically relates to a title change in the signature. Yes, \"HR Support\" is indeed on the list of allowed categories!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket. The ticket involves updating signature information due to a recent promotion. It seems this is more of an HR-related task rather than something technical. While it could potentially fall under \"Administrative rights\" if it involved permissions, the focus is on a title change. So, I'll categorize this under \"HR Support,\" which fits well given the context. I'll respond with the category in the required JSON format as specified!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
