The Oracle change might relate to access rights, so \"Access\" is also a possibility. Given the context, I\u2019m thinking \u201cHR Support\u201d or \u201cAccess\u201d could be the best categories to use.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions a \"line manager change,\" which seems to relate to HR, possibly a personnel update, and could also involve changes in the HR system or AD group. The \"Oracle change\" might refer to user account changes in an Oracle system, suggesting access rights could be affected. Since it's asking for help with these changes, the best categories might be \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I need to decide which fits best based on the context of the request.**Selecting category for IT ticket**\n\nI need to decide on the best category for this ticket. The ticket involves modifying Oracle access or roles, which could fall under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The \"line manager change\" seems like an HR process, so it likely fits best under \"HR Support.\" Since the user is asking for this categorization, they might want it formatted as a JSON object. I should choose the most appropriate category to reflect the request, possibly leaning towards \"Access\" for the Oracle aspect.**Deciding on category for IT request**\n\nIt looks like the key request here is about changing the line manager, which typically falls under HR processes, suggesting \"HR Support\" as a primary category. However, there's also mention of an \"Oracle change.\" If this refers to modifying access rights in an Oracle application, it could imply \"Access\" or even \"Administrative rights.\" But without more clarity on the details, I think \"HR Support\" is the safest option for categorization, focusing on the line manager change primarily.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
