They mention a \"new purchase po\" and refer to a \"galaxy mobile subscription\" that includes a device under a user name. There's also a request for \"installing device\" and updates related to \"mandatory receipts.\" Given that the ticket revolves around purchasing a device and handling receipts, the best category for this seems to be \"Purchase.\" It captures the essence of their request accurately.**Categorizing IT Requests**\n\nThe user wants to categorize their IT ticket. I think \"Hardware\" might fit since it involves a device, but given the focus on procurement and processing a purchase order, \"Purchase\" is the most appropriate choice. I should respond with a JSON object that clearly reflects this. The expected format is simple, just a category field to be structured as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.\n\nI can stick to this format without any extra commentary."
