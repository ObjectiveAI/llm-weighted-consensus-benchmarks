It mentions \"new starter tower,\" suggesting they\u2019re looking for a computer setup for a new employee. The timestamp refers to a start date in July. The mention of \"tester grade\" might indicate the job title. It seems like they need some HR or access forms. I\u2019ll have to pick a category that best fits this ticket.**Classifying IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm looking at the available categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The mention of \"new starter\" usually relates to user provisioning and hardware for new employees. Since it involves a \"tower,\" that implies hardware, but there's also talk of a \"start date\" and a form to create. I think the most fitting category here might be \"HR Support,\" considering all aspects of the ticket.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe main IT actions involve setting up a new user and their hardware. Since the ticket mentions hardware, it suggests onboarding a new starter. \"New starter tower\" points to providing a PC, and since the user requested a category, I think \"Hardware\" fits best because of that mention. Although \"Access\" could apply for granting system permissions, the presence of \"attached form\" hints at HR onboarding, which may not fit if we consider the available categories.**Categorizing IT Ticket to JSON**\n\nThe ticket needs to be categorized properly since it's presumably for IT. They might think of \"HR Support\" for onboarding, but it's more technical in nature. I realize I need to format this as a JSON object with the \"category\" field. The available categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. Given that \"new starter tower\" likely refers to a PC, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware.\" So, I\u2019ll finalize it as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
