It mentions things like \"password reset expire days\" and \"change pc press ctrl alt delete.\" These points suggest it's concerned with access to accounts or systems. Given the context, the best fit might be the \"Access\" category, as it deals with user login and account issues. I\u2019ll go with that to ensure it's categorized correctly!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like this IT ticket is related to password resets and access issues. The text mentions \"expire days\" for passwords and how to change settings, which indicates it's primarily about access control. The categories available are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Considering the focus on password expiration and resets, I think \"Access\" is the best fit. I need to respond with a JSON object to categorize it properly.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nThe task is clear: I need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category as \"Access.\" The format requires me to follow the schema exactly, without any extra text. So, I'll make sure my output is just this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThis aligns with the instruction given, and it's essential to keep it clean and straightforward! That's all I need to provide."
