This clearly relates to access and permissions. Considering that they specifically mention approval, \"Administrative rights\" feels like the more precise choice. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket under \"Administrative rights\" and prepare a JSON response.**Deciding on category format**\n\nI need to output a JSON object with the correct format. It should include a \"category\" string, and the allowed values are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Based on the user mentioning \"approval rights\" and issues clicking commands, it seems like \"Administrative rights\" is the most precise category. However, since it falls under access, I need to confirm that my final choice is indeed \"Administrative rights.\"**Providing JSON output**\n\nI need to respond with the JSON category, and it seems best to keep it straightforward as per the instructions. The required format is clear: I should provide it as a JSON object like this: {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}. Since the system indicates that the output may need to be parsed by code, I\u2019ll stick to giving just the JSON object with no extra commentary. So, I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}."
