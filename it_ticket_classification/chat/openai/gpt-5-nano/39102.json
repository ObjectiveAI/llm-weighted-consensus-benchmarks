The ticket mentions servers and is unclear in parts, but it suggests it's related to hardware. The options I have are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Since it revolves around servers, my best guess is to categorize it as \"Hardware.\" I'll prepare the response in the required JSON format for clarity.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nThe instructions tell me to respond using a JSON format, particularly by specifying a category. In this case, I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit since the ticket mentions servers. I briefly considered other categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Purchase,\" but \"servers sent Wednesday\" suggests they\u2019re discussing hardware shipments. Given that context, I'll stick with my choice and format the response as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to meet the requirements precisely.**Delivering category response**\n\nThe instructions clearly say to categorize, and I think \"Hardware\" is the appropriate choice since it relates to servers. I wonder if there's a risk of misinterpretation, though, so asking a clarifying question could be useful. Since the user simply requested a category, it makes sense to focus on providing that. However, I'll keep it straightforward and just deliver the category without overcomplicating things. Simple is often best!"
