The text mentions logging allocation after receiving the item and the importance of receipts. Given that this is focused on purchasing hardware, I\u2019m thinking it fits best under the \"Purchase\" category. However, \"Hardware\" could also work, as it relates specifically to the cable being ordered. I\u2019ll go with \"Purchase\" for clarity!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe item in question is an Apple Lightning cable, and while it\u2019s hardware, the ticket is focused on the purchasing process, including receipts and logging allocations. It feels clearer to categorize it under \"Purchase\" rather than a strict hardware issue. The necessary format for the response requires a JSON-like object, which I'll make as: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. I want to keep it straightforward without any extra text, ensuring I stick with \"Purchase\" due to the context provided!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
