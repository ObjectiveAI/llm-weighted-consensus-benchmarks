The ticket clearly mentions the microphone not working and issues during calls, which leads me to think this relates to hardware. Even though there\u2019s a mention of a replacement headset sent, the primary issue is the microphone and audio input/output problems. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Hardware\" and respond with that in the required format.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI need to ensure the category is one of the specified enumerations. The format calls for a JSON object with a \"category\" key. Based on the user's IT ticket describing the microphone issue, it seems clear this falls under \"Hardware.\" The expected output should match the schema without any additional text, so I\u2019ll format it as `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. I should focus on being succinct, as they likely just want the category. Proposing next steps is nice, but I\u2019ll prioritize getting the format right first.**Finalizing IT Ticket Response**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize this IT ticket, and while I think adding a brief note could be helpful, the instructions specify just the category. I\u2019ll stick to a minimal approach to stay in line with their request. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and prepare my output as `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. I need to ensure there\u2019s no extra punctuation or commentary in the response. Alright, let's finalize this!"
