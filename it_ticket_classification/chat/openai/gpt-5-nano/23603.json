However, it also relates to \"Hardware\" due to the mention of the cable. This is a bit of a dilemma on which category to choose!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe text mentions a \"new purchase po,\" \"purchased cable,\" and requests to \"log installation\" and manage receipts. The main focus here leans toward a purchase order, justifying categorization under \"Purchase.\" \n\nI'll need to format my response as a JSON-like object, specifically including the \"category\" property. The required format indicates that my output should strictly follow this JSON structure. So, my final answer will be:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}  \n\nLet's go with that!"
