Since it's clearly an HR-related issue, \"HR Support\" seems most appropriate, although \"Administrative rights\" might also fit if the problem is due to permission issues.**Categorizing IT ticket for HR issue**\n\nThe ticket describes an \"Oracle error\" when trying to approve annual leave, hinting that it might be a software issue within the HR system. My main options for categorizing this are \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights,\" as it seems related to system permissions. However, the specific message isn\u2019t clear on permissions, so I\u2019ll classify it as \"HR Support.\" I need to format this as a JSON object following the required schema.
