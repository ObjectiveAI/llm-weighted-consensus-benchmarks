The user mentioned \"access to location,\" which likely pertains to physical location access or possibly scheduling times. It makes sense to categorize it as \"Access\" since it's all about obtaining permission. Therefore, I'll respond with the JSON format strictly by providing only the necessary category information: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I won\u2019t include any extra explanations since that's not asked for.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI want to keep my response minimal, so I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019m just double-checking if I should also consider \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" since the content mentions \"approval needed.\u201d However, the main theme is clearly access to location, which confirms that \"Access\" is indeed the right choice. So, I\u2019m feeling good about finalizing this category!"
