The user's message seems quite garbled, but there's mention of a project not being configured correctly, tasks, and the approval process. It could potentially relate to \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or maybe \"Access\" concerning tasks. Given all these components, I\u2019ll need to carefully consider which category fits best while ensuring clarity for whoever handles this ticket.**Deciding on the IT ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s mention of \"submit for approval\" and \"appropriate tasks available\" suggests this might relate to project management issues. While I\u2019m considering the categories, it seems clear this isn't about hardware, HR, or general access. However, \"Access\" could refer to permissions for booking tasks. But the mention of \"table submit for approval\" leans toward workflow issues, which could fit \"Administrative rights.\" Yet, since it\u2019s a misconfigured project, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit. I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Internal Project\" in the required JSON format.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
