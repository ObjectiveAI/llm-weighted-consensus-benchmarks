It seems to involve \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" The ticket mentions elements like \"leaver mailbox,\" \"roaming profile,\" and \"AD rights,\" indicating this is about the offboarding process. It involves revoking access and collecting belongings, so the best category would likely be Access since the key focus is on the leaver's access rights and related items.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering the category for this IT ticket about a \"leaver form\" and tasks related to an employee's offboarding. While \"Administrative rights\" might apply, the focus on \"AD rights\" and \"leaver mailbox\" suggests it's IT-centric. \"Access\" seems the most fitting category since it relates directly to revoking access rights. I'll create a JSON object with \"category\": \"Access\" as the required format, and I might include a brief justification for clarity."
