It seems like there\u2019s an issue with accessing a report after clicking on it \u2014 it keeps redirecting even after entering the same details again. The mention of \"Bogota\" suggests it\u2019s about accessing a specific report location. Considering the context, I think the \"Access\" category fits best since the user is unable to access the report they need.**Finalizing category response**\n\nI was considering whether to categorize the ticket as \"Administrative rights\" since it might involve permission issues, but that\u2019s more for requests for admin elevation. Ultimately, \"Access\" seems like the right fit because it's about being unable to access the report location. Now, I need to format my response as a JSON object. The prompt specifies only to output the category, so I'll stick to that requirement and provide: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Deciding on category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about whether \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could be suitable categories, but given the context of the user not being able to access the report location in Bogota, it really leans toward \"Access.\" So, I\u2019m confident that \"Access\" is the best choice here. Now I just need to finalize my response and make sure I convey that clearly. Let\u2019s go ahead and respond with that decision!"
