The ticket mentions terms like \"new job title,\" \"administration officer,\" and \"change.\" This suggests it's HR-related, specifically about a job title change and starting date. It could also relate to \"Access\" for a new login or \"Administrative rights\" if rights are needed due to the new title. I'll focus on selecting the most fitting category from the given options.**Categorizing Job Title Request**\n\nIt seems this ticket is a request to change a job title, possibly related to a \"start date.\" Looking at the available categories\u2014Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights\u2014the best fit for this is \"HR Support\" since it\u2019s an HR-related update about a job title. Although \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant, it doesn't seem to request rights directly. I'll return the category as a JSON object labeled \"HR Support.\"{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
