It seems like the best fit is the \"Hardware\" category, as it specifically mentions \"monitor.\" There's a chance that \"Purchase\" could also apply if they\u2019re requesting to acquire a monitor, but \"Purchase\" is more about procurement. So, categorizing this ticket as \"Hardware\" feels most appropriate since it's fundamentally about the monitor itself.**Determining the right category**\n\nThe user indicates they need a monitor, which could be seen as a hardware request rather than a straightforward purchase. In typical IT ticket systems, \"Hardware\" refers to issues or replacements, while \"Purchase\" refers to ordering new items. The user's request about receiving a monitor for multitasking might suggest procurement, leaning toward \"Purchase.\" However, since they didn\u2019t specifically mention \"purchase,\" I think categorizing it as \"Hardware\" fits better as it's about the functional need for a monitor.**Selecting the category**\n\nGiven the options like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Storage,\" and others, the simplest choice is \"Hardware\" since the request is about a monitor. I\u2019ll define the response as a JSON object, where the category property must specifically state \"Hardware.\" So the final response will just be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I need to ensure that I don\u2019t include any additional text, sticking strictly to the format required by the instructions."
