The user mentions they can't upload files, which indicates it's a software issue. They say it's urgent and impacts functionality, particularly for moving contracts. I'll choose the best category from options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and more. Given the context, it sounds like this falls under a Miscellaneous or Access category because it involves file upload issues. I'll prepare the JSON output accordingly!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nFor this IT ticket, I'm considering various categories like Storage, Internal Project, Access, and Miscellaneous. The issue is specifically about enabling file uploads, which is more about system functionality. It's definitely not hardware, HR, or purchase-related. \"Storage\" could relate to file access issues, though it seems more likely tied to Access if they can't upload due to permissions. Given the urgency and context, I think the best fit might be the Access category or maybe Miscellaneous based on functionality.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the IT ticket and wondering if it fits best as \"Internal Project\" since it concerns a feature in an internal system for signing contracts. The \"Access\" category could apply if it were purely about permissions, but the user mentions freezing, which suggests it's more of a technical bug. \"Miscellaneous\" is an option if nothing else fits, but \"Internal Project\" seems like the strongest candidate given the context of the issue. So, I think I'll go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm contemplating how to categorize this IT ticket. It mentions issues with uploading files and functionality, which suggests it's a bug. While I considered \"Access\" due to upload functionality, \"Internal Project\" seems more fitting because it relates to internal systems. The prompt specifies the format we need for output, so I plan to use the JSON structure provided. Therefore, I'll go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nThat feels right for this situation!"
