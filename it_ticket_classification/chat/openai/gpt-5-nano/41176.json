The ticket mentions issues with Oracle time task details for annual leave.

It\u2019s clear they need help with this issue, and the importance is marked as high.**Categorizing IT ticket issue**\n\nThis ticket pertains to the Oracle timekeeping system, where the user is experiencing missing annual leave task details and having trouble submitting their request for the week. While I considered \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project,\" it seems best categorized under \"HR Support\" since it relates to leave and payroll. Although \"Miscellaneous\" could fit, the context is more specific to HR. So, I'll categorize it as HR Support and respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
