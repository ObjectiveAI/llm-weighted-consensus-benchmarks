This points toward either \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" Given the focus on the Apple keyboard and its procurement, I will categorize this ticket as \"Purchase.\"**Choosing ticket category**\n\nThis IT ticket is primarily about a purchase order for an Apple keyboard, which includes a request for installation. The relevant categories are \"Purchase\" and \"Hardware,\" but I need to choose one. Since it's fundamentally about procurement \u2014 the purchase order \u2014 I'll categorize it as \"Purchase.\" The installation aspect is secondary, and typically, helpdesk tickets prioritize the procurement element. So I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object with the category as \"Purchase.\"**Outputting category JSON**\n\nThe instructions are clear: I need to format my output properly, especially since the JSON category is required. I\u2019ll make sure the string matches the enum exactly, ensuring \"Purchase\" has a capital \"P.\" There's no need for extra text or explanation, just the category. I\u2019ll simply respond with the necessary JSON format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} and ensure I adhere strictly to the requirements. This should keep everything clear and precise!"
