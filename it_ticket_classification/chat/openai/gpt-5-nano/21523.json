The text mentions \"new mouse and headphones\" along with possible issues. This seems to suggest hardware concerns, particularly with peripherals and ports, so I think the best category would probably be \"Hardware.\" However, there\u2019s also a chance it relates to ordering new devices, which could fit under \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll lean towards \"Hardware\" since that's the main focus here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI see the mention of \"February,\" which likely indicates a time reference, while \"ports\" and \"hi issues\" suggest potential USB port issues. The phrase \"probably mouse headphones work\" is a bit ambiguous but still points towards hardware concerns. Therefore, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Hardware.\" It makes sense to provide just the JSON object with the category value, so I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Keeping it simple seems best!"
