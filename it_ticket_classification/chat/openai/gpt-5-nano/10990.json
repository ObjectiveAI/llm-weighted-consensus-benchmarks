The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It\u2019s important to accurately map the string to the right category to ensure proper handling of the ticket. I\u2019m focused on making this process as effective as possible so that the user gets the right support quickly!**Analyzing project request**\n\nI\u2019m going through this content, and it\u2019s a bit messy. It mentions \u201cnew project code,\u201d \u201cplease create code per attached file,\u201d and \u201cchange file protected\u201d among other things like \u201cArizona\u201d and \u201cDenmark.\u201d I\u2019m considering if this fits into categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" The references to an attached file and creating code suggest it\u2019s most likely related to an Internal Project since it talks about developing a solution. Let's figure out the best category based on these clues!**Categorizing as Internal Project**\n\nI'm categorizing this ticket as \"Internal Project.\" It mentions coding, project codes, an attached file, and tracking solutions. While it could hint at \"Administrative rights,\" there\u2019s no clear request for access or login details, making \"Internal Project\" a better fit. I need to format the output as a JSON object, so I\u2019ll respond with {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I want to ensure everything is precise, following the requirement for allowed values exactly.**Responding with JSON format**\n\nI need to make sure my response is just the JSON object without any extra text. The key should be \"category,\" and the value will be \"Internal Project.\" Keeping it straightforward is important so that I meet the exact format requirements. I\u2019ll respond now with only the necessary JSON output to ensure clarity and correctness. This way, I can help the user efficiently without any added confusion! Here goes."
