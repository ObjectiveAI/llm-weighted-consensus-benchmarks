It looks like they\u2019re asking to be informed about the outage. I\u2019m considering categories, and \u201cAccess\u201d might fit, but I'm also wondering if \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d could work. It\u2019s tricky!**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a request about outage notifications for the server room. This could fit under \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d since it\u2019s a general IT ticket, but it might also consider \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, since it's more about the outage itself and not about specific hardware issues or permissions, \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d seems to be the best option.\n\nNow, I need to format my response as a JSON object with the selected category. It should include the proper schema!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
