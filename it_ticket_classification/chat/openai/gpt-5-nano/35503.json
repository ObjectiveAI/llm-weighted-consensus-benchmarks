The user describes a problem with the absence report not showing submitted days for leave. This seems HR-related, so \u201cHR Support\u201d feels like the right category. However, there might be a consideration about permissions to approve, which could lead me to \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d Ultimately, \u201cHR Support\u201d appears to fit better, focusing on leave request approvals.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm focusing on the specific issue regarding the annual leave request approval. It could potentially fit under \"Access\" to the absence system, but since the user is looking for help to find and assign a request, I think \"HR Support\" is a more suitable category. It\u2019s definitely a software issue and not related to hardware or storage. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and format the response in JSON as required.**Formatting JSON for category**\n\nI need to output a JSON object with the \"category\" field. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I want to make sure it\u2019s valid JSON without any extra text, so it\u2019s clear for the system. The category must be accurately represented, and I\u2019ll ensure proper formatting with quotes around the strings. Alright, I feel ready to do that!"
