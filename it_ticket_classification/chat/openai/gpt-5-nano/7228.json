The ticket mentions issues with editing team members, permissions for deletion, and access rights. I'll follow the provided JSON schema for output. The key topics point to user access and permissions, indicating that it fits best under either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since both categories seem relevant, I think I'll go with the \"Access\" category for clarity. So, I should output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI see that the ticket includes phrases like \"unable to edit team members\" and references to permissions, which point toward issues with access rights. The mention of \"delete members\" suggests permissions have been granted, but it\u2019s a bit messy. Given that it primarily concerns permissions, I think the best category is \"Access.\" However, if we consider admin privileges specifically, \"Administrative rights\" could fit too. Since it's safer to go with broader terminology, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
