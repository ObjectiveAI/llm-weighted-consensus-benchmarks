I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" So, the output should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That seems appropriate given the context!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m assessing whether to categorize the ticket as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It seems more about physical facility access, so \"Access\" is the right choice. The response format requires a specific JSON object, so I should produce: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. There's no need for extra commentary here. The keywords align with the required enum, confirming it's appropriate. The main phrase is \"obtaining access to facility,\" so I\u2019ll stick with that for clarity!"
