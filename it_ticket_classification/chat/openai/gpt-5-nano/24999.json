I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" since it\u2019s referencing a project code along with visibility concerns. However, there are signs it could fit other categories too.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best way to categorize the IT ticket. The user mentions \"assign visibility,\" which signals permissions, suggesting \"Access\" as a fit. There\u2019s also reference to \"working cluster,\" hinting at a computing context. While \"Internal Project\" could apply due to \"project code,\" my focus is on finding a single category. Given the request revolves around visibility permissions, \"Access\" seems to be the most appropriate choice. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON-like object with the \"category\" field specified.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nI need to follow the instruction to respond with a format that can be easily parsed by code or displayed in an app without special formatting. Since the user wants a category for the IT ticket, I\u2019ll create a JSON-like object. Based on my assessment, the best choice is \"Access.\" I want to keep it minimal and ensure there\u2019s no extra commentary. So, the final response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's go with that!"
