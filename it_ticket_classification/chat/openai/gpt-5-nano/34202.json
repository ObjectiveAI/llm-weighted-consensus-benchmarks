Given the context, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project,\" as there's no hardware involved, and it\u2019s not strictly about access.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering that access would be relevant if it were a login or rights problem, but this ticket focuses on an editing error. It might relate to \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d if the user needs permission to delete or modify data. However, since the ticket indicates an error message during deletion, it seems more like a software issue. I\u2019ll lean towards categorizing it as \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d since that best fits a generic software issue. I'll output the JSON as: {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
