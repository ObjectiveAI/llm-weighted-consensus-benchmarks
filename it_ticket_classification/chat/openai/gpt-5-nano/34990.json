It seems the user is discussing a new purchase order (PO) that isn't found in the system. They mention wanting to log a ticket and asking for the allocation after receiving the item. It's definitely not very straightforward, but it appears to fit best under \"Purchase.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s message mentions needing to access the receipts section and includes hints about a purchase order (PO) related to \"deep cool,\" which seems to refer to a vendor. They want to log a ticket for allocation after receiving the item. Overall, the message is about a purchase order issue, likely indicating a system problem with retrieving it. So, I think categorizing it as \"Purchase\" is best. Next, I should respond with a JSON object specifying this category.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
