The user's ticket is quite jumbled, mentioning changes to the supplier contract approval process multiple times. It seems to involve reviewing contracts from different perspectives and possibly referencing roles and authority for approvals. I\u2019ll need to determine the main focus of the ticket to assign it the correct category, likely falling under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m assessing a ticket about changes to the supplier contract approval process, focusing on approval workflows and algorithms for allocating approvers. I see that the content primarily relates to procurement, so it might fit into categories like \"Purchase,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" However, since it's heavily about supplier contracts, the best fit appears to be \"Purchase.\" There\u2019s also a mention of creating approver groups, which leans toward administrative rights. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase\" and respond accordingly with the JSON format.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
