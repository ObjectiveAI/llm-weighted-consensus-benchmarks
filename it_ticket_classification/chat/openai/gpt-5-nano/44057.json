They're using an application and state that after clicking \"add folder\" and trying to save, nothing happens, and the only option is to cancel. This could point to a file system or access issue.**Investigating folder creation issues**\n\nAnother coworker is experiencing the same folder creation issue, which raises the need for an investigation. This could relate to the storage system. We have a few categories to consider: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights.\" This doesn't seem to be a hardware problem or HR issue. Access could hint at permission issues since they\u2019re unable to create folders, suggesting it might be an \"Access\" or \"Storage\" problem. Given both coworkers are affected, it seems more like a system-wide issue with shared storage or permissions.**Categorizing ticket issues**\n\nTo route the ticket to the appropriate team, I think \"Storage\" is fitting for file storage issues. However, \"Access\" relates to permission problems, such as the inability to create a folder. The user mentions an \"add folder\" button and \"frankfurt\" as the folder name, indicating they may be trying to create a directory within an application. While I\u2019d lean toward categorizing this as \"Storage,\" I also see \"Administrative rights\" as relevant for permission issues, since it connects to access rights.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nThe user didn\u2019t specifically request administrative rights; they just want to investigate why they can\u2019t create a folder. For ticket routing, I\u2019d focus on \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are involved. Since the problem occurs on multiple PCs, it might relate to server settings or storage issues. Considering the provided instructions, I need to respond with a JSON object categorizing the ticket. I think \"Storage\" is the best choice here, as the issue is about folder creation, not hardware-related.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nThe user mentions they can\u2019t create a folder, which could indicate a UI bug in the storage system. This situation might fit under either \"Storage\" or \"Access.\" Since they're not explicitly getting a \"permission denied\" error but rather experiencing a bug, the application may need investigation. While there\u2019s no \"Software\" category, I think \"Storage\" is the best fit here. Based on this, I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format containing only the category:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
