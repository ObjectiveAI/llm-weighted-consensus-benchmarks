The details point to either \"Storage\" since the recordings seem to be missing from the \"videos\" directory, or \"Access\" because they're unable to find them. There's also a hint that it could involve \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are needed. Given the urgency expressed about recording availability, \"Storage\" seems to fit best, but there are multiple possibilities!**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nIn this IT helpdesk scenario, I\u2019m looking at a user's message that mentions needing to locate a recording, particularly given phrases like \"recording sent Wednesday\" and \"recordings directory under videos.\" Since they stated they are \"unable to find\" the recording, it seems to indicate a \"Storage\" issue, as they can likely access the system but not the specific file. I'll categorize this as \"Storage\" and prepare to respond with a JSON object using the required format.{\"category\": \"Storage\"}"
