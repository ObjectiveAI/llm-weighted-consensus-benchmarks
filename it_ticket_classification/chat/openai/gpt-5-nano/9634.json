The ticket is a bit messy, referring to a new starter or re-starter form and discussing a completed form as well as mobile phone requests. There are also remarks about ensuring that the supplied items are clean and presentable, as some were poorly allocated and looked scratched or dirty.**Categorizing IT ticket options**\n\nI\u2019m considering categories for the IT ticket. There\u2019s mention of hardware, as it talks about mobile phones and cleaning devices. Access seems relevant since it refers to granting access to folders. Administrative rights could apply with mentions of policies, but I\u2019m unsure. Purchase might fit with discussions of second-hand devices, but this isn't about purchasing. It mostly revolves around onboarding processes, so I need to choose the best category considering all these details.**Selecting the category**\n\nThe ticket references onboarding for a \"new starter\" and includes items like a completed starter form, mobile phone, and access to folders. It's a mix of aspects like hardware readiness and access provisioning, but I think the most fitting category is \"Access\" since the key focus is on granting access to necessary folders and links, which is essential for onboarding. While \"Hardware\" is relevant due to mentions of cleanliness and devices, the central theme is clearly about the access needed for the new starter.**Choosing the final category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether \"Administrative rights\" could fit, especially if there\u2019s a need for admin rights or compliance. However, it seems unlikely since that category is more about privileged access. The ticket mainly focuses on onboarding a new starter, which centers around granting access to folders and links, along with a mention of hardware cleanliness. So, I think \"Access\" is the best fit. I\u2019ll format my answer as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
