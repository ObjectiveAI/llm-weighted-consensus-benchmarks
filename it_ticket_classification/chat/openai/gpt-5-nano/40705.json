The ticket discusses wireless issues after replacing core switches and routers, suggesting a configuration problem with a wireless access point controller. I'm considering categories like \"Access\" for connectivity issues or \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Hardware\" could also apply if it involves the access point. It's definitely related to networking, but there's no specific \"Networking\" category available.**Finalizing category for ticket**\n\nI'm considering the appropriate category for an IT ticket. Categories like \"Access\" or \"Hardware\" could apply, but since this concerns network connectivity and authentication, \"Access\" seems most fitting. The content suggests the issue is related to access control. I'll categorize it as \"Access\" since it deals with network access issues. I need to format my response as a JSON object, so I'll prepare the output like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Including extra justification isn't required, but it could be helpful!**Determining output for ticket category**\n\nI think it\u2019s best to simply output the category in a JSON format. I\u2019ll go with this structure: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. While \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could be options, the ticket focuses on connectivity issues, so \"Access\" is most fitting for network access problems. The mention of core switches and potential hardware issues suggests it might also relate to \"Hardware,\" but \"Access\" feels like a safer choice. So, I\u2019ll finalize the response without any extra text."
