Since the request revolves around the extension cord, my best guess is that it fits under \"Hardware.\" It might also be considered a \"Purchase\" request, but because it's specifically about hardware equipment, \"Hardware\" seems like the most appropriate choice for categorization.**Classifying IT request**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize an IT ticket. The request is for an extension cord, which I believe qualifies as hardware. While \"Purchase\" could work since it\u2019s a request for an item, extension cords are typically categorized as \"Hardware\" in IT tickets, similar to keyboards or monitors. I need to format my output as a strict JSON object, so I'll go with {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to align with the required structure.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI\u2019m double-checking the user's request about the extension cord. While it could fit under \"Miscellaneous,\" it\u2019s more about obtaining hardware. The content indicates they requested an extension cord and noted they've already received one, which shows it's focused on hardware asset management. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" Now, I need to make sure I format my output as just the JSON object with no extra text, so here it is: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
