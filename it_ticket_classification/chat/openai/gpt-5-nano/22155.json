The ticket content is a bit jumbled but seems to focus on creating a new project and resolver groups. \"Resolver groups\" likely relates to ITSM. Given the request involves access and permissions, it probably fits under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" as it involves creating groups and managing access rights.**Clarifying ticket categorization**\n\nI realize that the categories include \"Access\" and \"Internal Project.\" The ticket mentions a \"new project,\" which could fit under \"Internal Project,\" as it seems related to internal IT tasks like creating contact and resolver groups. But this request leans more toward setting up permissions and access management. The repeated mentions of \"snow\" could refer to a username or project name, although it's unclear. Given the focus on creating groups and contacts, categorizing it as \"Access\" seems most appropriate.**Formatting category as JSON**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the ticket as \"Access.\" The system requires a JSON object that specifies the category. The expected format is clear: it needs something like {\"category\": \"Access\"}.\n\nI want to follow the guidelines and ensure the output is exact per the schema provided. So I\u2019ll stick to just the necessary JSON without any extra text. My final response will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
