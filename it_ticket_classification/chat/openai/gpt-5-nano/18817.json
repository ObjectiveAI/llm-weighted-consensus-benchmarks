The user wants an urgent solution involving attaching a second host interface and adjusting port listening. \n\nThe category options are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the content, \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or potentially \"Administrative rights\" could fit, but the urgency leans towards specific technical issues.**Evaluating IT Ticket Category**\n\nThis task revolves around port configuration on a cloud instance and Docker containers on the same host, primarily a networking issue. Among the categories provided, \"Internal Project\" could fit if it's project-specific, while \"Miscellaneous\" might be used for general IT tasks. The message mentions a demo test, suggesting it's for an internal project, but without explicit requests for hardware or access. Ultimately, I believe \"Miscellaneous\" is the safest choice here since it doesn\u2019t strictly align with those categories.**Parsing Cloud Configuration Request**\n\nThe user describes a situation where multiple Docker containers on a cloud instance are running on the same port on the same host. They need a solution to enable them to listen on that same port. The suggested method involves adding a second host interface and connecting each container through different ports. Typically, using separate IP addresses, multiple interfaces, or a reverse proxy would be standard approaches to manage this setup efficiently. It seems they\u2019re searching for the simplest way to achieve this.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket and it seems like it could work as \"Internal Project,\" especially since the user mentioned a \"demo test,\" indicating it's project-specific. Given it's for an IT ticketing system, I\u2019ll stick to that choice, or \"Miscellaneous\" might work too, but \"Internal Project\" feels more precise. \n\nI'll output the category in the required JSON format like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, following the schema guidelines without adding unnecessary details."
