I think the best category could be Storage for deleting data, or maybe Administrative rights if admin privileges are needed. If it\u2019s unclear, Miscellaneous could fit too.**Choosing the right ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s request to \"delete the whole of February entries\" indicates a need for data deletion. In IT ticket categorization, such tasks could fit under \"Storage\" or \"Administrative rights,\" especially if permissions are needed to delete. Since it sounds like deleting stored data, \"Storage\" seems to be the most appropriate. I realize it's important to focus on the nature of the request rather than just permissions, so I think \"Storage\" is the best choice.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
