There\u2019s also an option for \"Internal Project,\" but that seems less likely here.**Classifying IT tickets**\n\nThe text mentions \"hello please fill date,\" suggesting a request to provide a date for something. With the mention of \"new starter bucharest friday pm,\" it seems this could relate to onboarding. \n\nI should consider whether to categorize this ticket as \"Access\" for granting system access or \"Administrative rights\" for permissions. Given the context, it probably fits best under \"Access,\" since it\u2019s about setting up the new starter's account and access to systems.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe text includes \"hello please fill date,\" which indicates a request for something like a date but not directly about accounts. Since the user wants me to categorize the IT ticket, I need to determine the best fitting category. \n\nI'll categorize it as \"Access.\" According to the instructions, I need to format this as a JSON object, which should look like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll ensure it's a valid response with just that property and no extra text. Let's proceed with that output!"
