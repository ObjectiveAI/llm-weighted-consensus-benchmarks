It seems related to changing a grade or privilege, which might fall under Access rights. However, the message is unclear overall. I\u2019ll need to figure out which category best fits despite the confusion in the text.**Parsing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket text that mentions \"modify grade,\" \"extended contractual period,\" and \"modified grade starting December.\" It seems like it could relate to a change in access level or salary grade, possibly indicating Administrative rights. The mention of the contractual period complicates it, so it might also fit under HR Support. I need to sort out which category best matches these details, but it's a bit unclear overall.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIn considering IT ticket categories, I note that \"HR Support\" is for human resources issues, and \"Internal Project\" relates to internal IT projects. \"Administrative rights\" involve admin privileges, while \"Access\" covers permissions to systems. The phrase \"modify grade\" likely refers to user permission levels, and the mention of an \"extended contractual period\" might relate to account changes. This ticket seems best suited for either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" focusing on modifications rather than hardware or storage. It\u2019s tricky to decide which fits better!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"modify grade,\" \"starting December,\" and \"extended contractual period,\" which seems to suggest someone might need to change a grade for access reasons. It could relate to HR Support due to the contractual aspect, but since it mentions \"technician\" and \"analyst ext hub,\" it leans toward IT. I think the best fit is \"Access,\" as \u201cmodify grade\u201d suggests a change in access level. However, \"Administrative rights\" also applies if it's about admin privileges. Ultimately, I\u2019ll categorize it under \"Administrative rights\" since it focuses on modifying access levels.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
