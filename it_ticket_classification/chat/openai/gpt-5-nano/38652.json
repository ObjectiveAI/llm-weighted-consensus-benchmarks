Given the context, I believe \"Access\" is the most appropriate category for this ticket, as it directly relates to access to resources affected by the proxy settings.**Outputting IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nI need to create a minimal answer for the IT ticket categorization, which is \"Access.\" The prompt specifically asks for the category only, so I should format my response as JSON. Following the required format, I'll respond with: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. It\u2019s good to confirm no extra text is included, just the specified JSON object.
