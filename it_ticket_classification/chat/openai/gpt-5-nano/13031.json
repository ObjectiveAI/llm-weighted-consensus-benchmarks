The content is quite confusing, but it looks like it's about access changes for the Oracle system related to terminated employees. Given the keywords, categories like Access or Administrative rights seem most fitting. \"Leavers\" hints at offboarding, and \"respect logging\" may refer to adhering to logging policies. I\u2019ll choose Access for classification.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s message suggests they plan to implement Oracle changes on Friday. The mention of \"confirmed leavers\" indicates this may involve offboarding changes. I think the best category here is \"Access,\" as it relates to user access changes. Although \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if modifications were requested, the text focuses more on logging and changes associated with leavers. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" for the classification and respond in JSON format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
