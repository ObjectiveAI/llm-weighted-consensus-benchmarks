The most fitting category here is \"Purchase.\" I need to create a JSON output with the category property set accordingly. The allowed categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Although I briefly consider if \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" could apply due to the mention of installation, the primary focus is on Purchase. Therefore, my response will simply be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
