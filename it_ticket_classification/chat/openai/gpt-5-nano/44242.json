They\u2019re asking someone to check it out, which indicates it's likely a hardware problem. So, I'll categorize this ticket as \u201cHardware\u201d and prepare a JSON category field for the response.**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nThe prompt shows the category schema I need to follow: it requires a JSON object with a category field. Since I categorized the IT ticket as \"Hardware,\" I'll create the required JSON structure with that category. I think I should keep my explanation minimal since the task is straightforward. The final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I need to ensure this JSON is properly formatted before I proceed!"
