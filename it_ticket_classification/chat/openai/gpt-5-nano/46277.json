This ticket mentions an issue with \"public holiday leave not available.\" It seems to indicate a bug in the HR/Scheduling system for managing leave. The best fit appears to be \"HR Support,\" as it directly relates to holiday leave. I'll justify this since it involves the public holiday leave display issue.**Formatting output in JSON**\n\nI need to prepare an output in JSON format with the category field. The system expects a JSON object based on the defined schema, which specifies that the category must be one of the enumerated values. I\u2019ll format it simply as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I realize that typically no extra commentary is needed; we just provide the category value as required. So, I\u2019ll focus on crafting the final JSON without including any additional notes."
