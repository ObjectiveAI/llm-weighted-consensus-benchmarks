The ticket text is quite noisy, mentioning \"new project code,\" \"new template,\" and \"setup form.\" It seems focused on creating a new project. Therefore, it most likely fits under the \"Internal Project\" category. Other categories like Administrative rights, Access, Storage, Purchase, or HR Support don\u2019t seem to apply here.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nIt looks like \"Internal Project\" is the best fit for this ticket, especially since it mentions terms like \"new project code\" and \"new template.\" If I were unsure, \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option, but it seems clear that this is about internal project setup. I'll format my response as a JSON-like object, ensuring it strictly follows the required format. Therefore, I\u2019ll output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
