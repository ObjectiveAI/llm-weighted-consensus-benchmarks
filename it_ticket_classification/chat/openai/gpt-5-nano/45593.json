The user mentioned issues with Oracle not being able to save forecasts and performance problems, which are common questions. The available categories don\u2019t include \"Software\" or \"Application,\" which complicates things a bit. The closest match seems to be \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or possibly \"Access\" if it\u2019s related to access issues. I\u2019ll choose the best fitting category based on this information.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking into performance issues with saving forecasts in Oracle. The allowed categories don\u2019t have \"Software\" or \"Application,\" so I might classify this as \"Miscellaneous\" since it doesn't fit neatly elsewhere. There\u2019s also a chance to select \"Access\" if it's a permission issue, though it doesn\u2019t seem related to credentials. Given it's likely a general IT problem, \"Miscellaneous\" feels like a safe default, but I\u2019m considering \"Internal Project\" if it's an internal tool.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category type. The prompt indicates that \"Category\" is an object containing a string \"category\" from the allowed values. So, I should output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.\n\nWhile I could include a brief justification, the user just wants the category itself. However, it might be good to stick with the required format, so I\u2019ll keep it focused: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} while ensuring the string matches perfectly."
