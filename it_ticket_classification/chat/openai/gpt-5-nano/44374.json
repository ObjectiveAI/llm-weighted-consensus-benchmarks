It mentions \"unable view members architecture discipline\" and issues with displaying content. This suggests it's primarily an access issue related to viewing members in the architecture discipline, so it seems appropriate to categorize it under \"Access.\" However, if it's related to an ongoing project, it could also fit under \"Internal Project.\" I think \"Access\" makes the most sense here!**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe issue at hand is access to view members, so \"Access\" seems like the best fit. I need to format my answer as a JSON object with \"category\": \"Access\" since the prompt specifies a schema for categorization. While \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant, the focus on accessibility makes \"Access\" more general and appropriate. I'll go ahead and respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That should work perfectly!**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nThe enum allows for \"Administrative rights\" separately, which might seem more fitting since the ticket is about access rights to view group members. However, the user\u2019s request is a bit unclear. The text, \"unable view members architecture discipline,\" suggests the problem is primarily about access. To keep it straightforward and safe, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format my response as a clean JSON object without any extra text: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
