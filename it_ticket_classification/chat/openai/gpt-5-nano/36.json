I need to find the right category from options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the ticket's focus on a purchase order and receipts, it seems most relevant to the Purchase category. I\u2019ll structure my response in a JSON-like format with the category field for clarity.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing elements from the user\u2019s text, which includes phrases like \"new purchase,\" \"PO,\" and details about receipts. It points clearly to the Purchase category, which matches perfectly with their mention of purchasing items and orders. The instruction indicates I should provide a category in JSON format, so I'll output it as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} to ensure it's valid. Responding directly with just the category object makes sense, so that's what I\u2019ll do now!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
