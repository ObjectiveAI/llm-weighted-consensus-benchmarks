Considering the categories I have, it seems fitting to pick \"HR Support\" or perhaps \"Access\" as the appropriate category.**Identifying IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the user's text with terms like \"new starter request,\" \"starter form,\" and \"change starter date format.\" It hints at an onboarding process. \"Access\" seems plausible since a new starter would need account access, and \"profile summary\" aligns with this too. \"HR Support\" is another potential category since it directly pertains to the new starter request. Based on the options I have, I'll likely categorize this as \"HR Support,\" given its relevance.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's ticket contains mentions of \"new starter request,\" \"starter form,\" and \"changes,\" hinting at an onboarding process. However, I need to categorize this IT ticket. Typically, a \"New Starter\" ticket relates to IT provisioning, which usually falls under \"Access\" or possibly \"Administrative rights.\" Given that this request seems focused on access provisioning, I believe \"Access\" is the most fitting category. \"HR Support\" doesn't apply here, as it's primarily about IT needs.**Returning JSON format**\n\nI need to respond with the category \"Access\" in a specific JSON format. The prompt specifies that I should return a JSON object with a \"category\" field that includes the allowed values. So, I\u2019ll output the exact string \"Access\" as required. It's important to ensure that I\u2019m only providing the JSON object without any extra explanation or content. I\u2019ll finalize it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This needs to be presented as the only content."
