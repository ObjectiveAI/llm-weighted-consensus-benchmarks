Since it deals with processes and administrative tasks, it seems to fit best under \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I'll go with those categories for the ticket.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out how to categorize this ticket. It isn\u2019t about hardware or storage, and \"Internal Project\" doesn\u2019t fit either.
