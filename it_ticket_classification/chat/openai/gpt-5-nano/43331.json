The categories available include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The ticket talks about a new laptop showing a 'thread exception not handled' error, suggesting a driver issue. Since this relates to hardware and possibly software, it seems to fit best under Hardware. However, if it's part of an IT project, it could also fit under Internal Project.**Finalizing the IT ticket category**\n\nThe category \"Administrative Rights\", \"Access\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", and \"HR Support\" don't seem to fit. \"Miscellaneous\" could work, but the options of \"Hardware\" and \"Software\" are more specific. Unfortunately, \"Software\" isn't listed. Since it's about a new laptop facing a system exception, \"Hardware\" fits best. I will output the JSON format for the category as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, ensuring it's in lowercase since the enum values are capitalized. Here\u2019s just the JSON."
