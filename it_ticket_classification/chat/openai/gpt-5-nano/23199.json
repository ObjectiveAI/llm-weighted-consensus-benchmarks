The main focus points indicate it's related to purchasing a license and possibly needing administrative rights for installation. I see two potential categories: \"Purchase,\" for the license, or \"Administrative rights,\" for installation help. Since the text refers to a license order, I think \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category for this IT ticket. I'll format it in JSON.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe content mentions a license being required, indicating they need to order one for installation. The available categories include \"Purchase\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since it\u2019s about buying a license, I believe \"Purchase\" is the best fit. The phrase \"order install\" suggests they want to order the license and then install it, which further supports the \"Purchase\" categorization. Therefore, I\u2019ll output a JSON object that specifies the category as \"Purchase.\"**Preparing output**\n\nI need to ensure that I'm providing the exact JSON format required, which is: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I should avoid adding any extra text or comments, as the instruction specifies that I need to deliver solely this JSON object. It's clear what the user expects, so I'll stick to the format and provide just what they need. Now, let\u2019s go ahead and deliver that JSON output!"
