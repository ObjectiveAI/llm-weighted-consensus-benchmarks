The user's request about the ticket is a bit jumbled but seems to focus on needing a local machine for a shared Oracle server. They mention that the installed machine consumes a lot of resources, reference compatibility, and the best solution for developers' requirements. It seems I'll ultimately classify this ticket as related to hardware or resource management.**Determining IT Request Category**\n\nIt looks like the request falls under categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" or \"Internal Project.\" The user wants me to pick one category. The ticket discusses needing a local machine for a shared Oracle server, focusing on resources, compatibility, and solutions for developers' requirements. Since it's about procuring a machine, \"Purchase\" seems the most precise. However, \"Hardware\" could work too. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like object categorizing it under \"Purchase.\"**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI see the instruction specifies outputting a JSON structure for the category. The prompt outlines that I need to provide a JSON object where the \"category\" key matches one of the specified enumerated strings. Given that the request revolves around obtaining a machine, I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll keep the response strictly to the JSON format, so my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. That should do it!**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the request that discusses needing a local machine for a shared Oracle server, specifically mentioning deadlines and requirements. While \"Internal Project\" could fit, the content heavily leans toward procurement based on phrases like \"least machine must be excluded due to speed reasons\" and \"amount possibility to obtain machine.\" Therefore, \"Purchase\" seems to be the most appropriate category. I'll prepare the output accordingly. Let's finalize that!"
