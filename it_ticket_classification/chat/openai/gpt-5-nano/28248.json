The mention of \"holiday requests\" and \"approvals\" makes me lean towards \"HR Support,\" but it also relates to IT permissions for approval workflows. The key seems to be in changing the PM for approvals of holiday requests. So, the best category might be \"Access,\" since it's about who can approve those requests.**Choosing the right category**\n\n\"Administrative rights\" implies specific system permissions, but since leave request approvals are more of an administrative process, I think \"Access\" makes sense as the category. I need to format this response as a JSON object that the system expects, which includes a category field. The structure should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll stay focused and provide just that without any extra commentary. So, I\u2019ll produce: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Double-checking\u2014everything seems correct!"
