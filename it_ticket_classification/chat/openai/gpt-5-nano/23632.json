It includes phrases like \"room refresh,\" \"meeting rooms,\" \"move cables under floor,\" and \"TV wall fixed.\" It seems to relate to renovations and managing cables, which makes me think it fits under \"Internal Project.\" However, I'm also considering if it connects with \"Hardware,\" but that doesn\u2019t seem quite right. \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t appear to apply either. Internal Project feels like the best fit!**Parsing IT Ticket**\n\nLet's break this down: The user mentions a \"room refresh\" planned for Tuesday afternoon, suggesting some renovations. They also refer to moving cables under the floor and fixing a TV wall, which leans towards an IT installation or an internal project. While \"Hardware\" could apply due to cables and TVs, \"Internal Project\" seems like a better fit since it addresses the project aspect. Given the categories available, I'll categorize this as \"Internal Project\" and prepare a concise structured response!**Outputting Category in JSON**\n\nI need to stick to the expected JSON format for the response. The relevant categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The user\u2019s IT ticket fits best under \"Internal Project,\" given it addresses a project regarding room renovations and cable management. \n\nI'll make sure the output is concise and clear, like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI won't add any extra text since the instructions emphasize a minimal response."
