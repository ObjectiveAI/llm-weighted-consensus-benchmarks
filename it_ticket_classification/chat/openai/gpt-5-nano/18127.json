It seems to be about onboarding a new starter, with mentions of vacation requests, access provisioning, and a starter form. There are also references to keys, environments, and Visual Studio licenses. Given these details, it would likely fall under the \"Access\" category, since it involves granting access to systems and managing the preparation for the new employee's onboarding.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm reviewing multiple aspects in this IT ticket regarding a new starter, including requests for access provisioning, a Visual Studio license, and mentions of environments. It seems that the best category would be \"Access,\" since it involves provisioning accounts and managing permissions. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit, there's no direct mention of admin rights. The focus on technical items and licenses suggests \"Access\" is the most appropriate choice for this ticket.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
