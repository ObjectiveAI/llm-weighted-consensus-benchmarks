The options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The best match seems to be either Storage or Administrative rights for this ticket.**Classifying folder request**\n\nI\u2019m trying to determine the category of an IT ticket about adding a folder. It seems to be about the storage structure in a file system, likely making it a \"Storage\" category. The phrase \"add December PM folder\" implies a request to create this folder, possibly referring to project management.\n\nThe ticket doesn't clearly request access permissions, so \"Storage\" makes the most sense. If necessary, I could consider \"Miscellaneous\" as a fallback, but I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Storage\" and format my output as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Formatting the response**\n\nI see that the valid channels indicate I should respond with a structured JSON object. The category must be one of the specified strings: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights.\n\nThe task here is to categorize the IT ticket, and based on my analysis, \"Storage\" is the appropriate choice. So, I\u2019ll finalize my output as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} \u2014 no extra text, just the JSON!"
