I don't think it fits Hardware or Storage. It could potentially fit as Miscellaneous or Internal Project since it\u2019s about IT change management workflow, but it isn't strictly a project. The choices are somewhat limited for this context.**Choosing Category for IT Ticket**\n\nI think the best fit for this IT ticket might be either \"Administrative rights,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Internal Project.\" The ticket discusses changes in the approval process and automatic activations, so \"Administrative rights\" could seem relevant. However, it doesn't really focus on user permissions.\n\n\"Miscellaneous\" is a safe option but a bit generic. \"Internal Project\" could work if it's related to an internal change workflow, but it often refers to specific tasks. Ultimately, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI believe \"Internal Project\" fits best for this ticket since it's all about an internal change management workflow involving features like auto-moves and draft reinitialization. However, the mention of changes being stuck and manual processes raises a question about whether \"Administrative rights\" is more fitting. \n\nDespite that, I\u2019m sticking with \"Internal Project\" as the category. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object formatted correctly: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It's essential to ensure the output is minimal and adheres to the required format."
