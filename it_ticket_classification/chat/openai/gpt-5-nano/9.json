The defined categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Based on the content of the ticket, I should identify the most suitable category. I'll structure my output as a JSON object with the corresponding category key and its value. This way, I can ensure clarity and alignment with the provided options!**Outputting category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the IT ticket as \u201cHR Support.\u201d It seems to be the most fitting option based on the content provided. Now, I\u2019ll format this decision as a JSON object with the key \"category\" and the value \"HR Support.\" This format should make it clear and easy for anyone to understand.
