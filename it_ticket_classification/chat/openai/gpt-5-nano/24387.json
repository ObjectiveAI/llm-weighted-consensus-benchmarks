This could fall under several categories like \"Administrative Rights,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Given the mention of \"nomination\" and details about the nominee, \"HR Support\" seems the most fitting since it relates to human resources and awards. Let's clarify that further!**Categorizing an IT Ticket**\n\nI need to determine the best category for this IT ticket, which mentions adding a button for approving a nomination. This could indicate a request for a software change, potentially making it fall under \"Internal Project.\" The ticket includes phrases like \"please add button\" and relates to the zone award nomination process. While the content leans towards HR, the main action is about implementing a system change. Thus, \"Internal Project\" seems like the most appropriate category.**Finalizing Category Output**\n\nI'm considering the relevant categories for the IT ticket. \"Administrative Rights\" doesn\u2019t apply since it\u2019s not about access privileges. \"HR Support\" might relate to the nomination process, but it\u2019s not asking for HR assistance; it's more about a nomination workflow. I think \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback, but ultimately, it feels like the best fit is \"Internal Project\" since it involves adding a feature within the system. I\u2019ll finalize the output in the required JSON format. \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
