Given the ticket mentions an urgent need for a replacement laptop due to a broken screen, the appropriate category here is \"Hardware\". While \"Purchase\" might also seem fitting, it's primarily a hardware issue. So, I\u2019ll structure my response as a JSON object with the category field set as \"Hardware\".**Formatting the Category Response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object for the category, specifically structured like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I should stick to including only the category field as specified. It\u2019s clear that the issue revolves around a broken laptop screen needing urgent replacement, so the category is definitely \"Hardware\". I\u2019ll summarize everything succinctly and proceed with my finalized answer in JSON format."
