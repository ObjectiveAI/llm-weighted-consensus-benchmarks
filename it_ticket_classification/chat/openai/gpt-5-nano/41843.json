The issues mentioned include a network problem and access to resources and software. It seems focused on \"Access,\" discussing peers unable to access shares and specific software like Perforce. Since the categories are single, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" I might respond with a brief note summarizing that the user has moved to Belgrade and is facing issues with resource access and software setup.**Generating JSON output**\n\nI need to provide a category in a JSON-like format for an IT ticket, following specific instructions. The allowed categories are clearly listed, and I should structure my output as a JSON object with the property \"category.\" Since I've determined the category is \"Access,\" I'll keep it concise, without any extra content. The final answer will be a clean JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That's straightforward, and it follows the guidelines perfectly!"
