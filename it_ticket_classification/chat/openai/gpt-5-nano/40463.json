The ticket discusses a request to remove a proposal due to issues with the approval flow. It seems like the user is asking for immediate assistance from IT. This could fit under \"Administrative rights\" if it's about deletion permissions, or maybe \"Access\" if it relates to access rights. \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" might also apply!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m examining the IT ticket regarding the need for adjusting permissions or deleting data. The mention of \"delete proposal submitted\" hints at a deletion request, while \"we cannot assign her proper flow\" and \"we cannot change approval flow\" suggest issues with workflow configuration. The best category seems to be \"Administrative rights\" since it involves permissions for deletion or workflow modification. Alternatively, it could fall under \"Internal Project\" or \"Access,\" but it fits well in \"Administrative rights\" due to its focus on permissions. \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback option too.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI need to finalize the best category for the IT ticket. It looks like \"Administrative rights\" fits well, given the request involves workflow changes and deletion. I\u2019ll need to present my response in the specified JSON format as instructed. The required output is a JSON object with the field \"category\" set to \"Administrative rights.\" While I could provide an explanation, the instruction focuses on the JSON object. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} \n\nNow I'll double-check to ensure everything matches perfectly!"
