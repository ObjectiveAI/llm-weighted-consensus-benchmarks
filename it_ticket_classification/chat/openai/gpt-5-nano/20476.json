For categorization, the options are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context, it seems like \"Hardware\" could fit for hardware allocation, while \"HR Support\" might work for onboarding issues. \"Access\" could be relevant if it involves user access. I'm weighing those options carefully!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the user's message about a new starter that mentions hardware allocation, outdated forms, and the need for an updated starter form. It seems clear that the topic revolves around updating processes for onboarding. The \"Hardware\" category appears most fitting due to the multiple mentions of \"hardware allocation.\" While \"Access\" could relate to user accounts, the emphasis on hardware indicates it's primarily focused on that. I'm deciding on the best category for accuracy!**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nI\u2019ve got a good grasp on this. While \"HR Support\" might relate to onboarding, I want to stick with an IT category. The user specifically needs a category for hardware allocation, which makes \"Hardware\" the best choice. They expect a JSON object with the correct category key. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to use the exact key here, and this fits perfectly! Let's keep it clear and straightforward."
