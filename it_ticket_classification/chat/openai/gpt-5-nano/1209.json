It seems to mention things like \"device alert notification\" and \"floor printer,\" so there's a lot to consider here. The key themes in the text are related to hardware functionality and issues like \"paper feeding part\" and \"input tray detected.\" It sounds most fitting to assign this ticket to the \"Hardware\" category, as it revolves around printer issues and device alerts.**Categorizing printer issue**\n\nIt looks like the ticket is about a printer problem, possibly on the 4th floor, given the references to \"th floor.\" There's a lot of mention of printer functions, like the \"paper feeding part\" and \"input tray detected,\" which strongly indicate this is a hardware issue. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON-like object, ensuring to include exactly \"Hardware\" in the category field. The output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
