The ticket text mentions Oracle issues and problems with expense reports that are older than a few months, along with attachments. It likely relates to Oracle E-Business Suite or Expense reports. I\u2019m not quite sure whether to label it as Internal Project or Storage, but it doesn't fit neatly into either.**Deciding on IT category**\n\nI'm weighing the options for categorizing this IT ticket. It could be classified as \"Access\" if the user is having trouble accessing older expense reports or attachments. If there's uncertainty, \"Miscellaneous\" may serve as a fallback. The mention of \"Oracle issues\" implies it relates to software, likely involving the Oracle Expense Reports system, which could also touch on data retention or permissions. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" depending on which best fits the situation.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
