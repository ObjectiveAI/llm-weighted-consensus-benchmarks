It looks like they want access to view and edit certain items. I\u2019m interpreting this as needing administrative rights, so it seems fitting to classify this ticket under the \"Access\" category. It specifically relates to their request for full edit access, which aligns with the access and administrative rights options available.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned \"folders view,\" which hints at view permissions, and \"importance high\" signals urgency. Since I need to categorize this IT ticket, I should follow the system's instructions to provide a JSON-like format. Given the request for \"full edit access\" to folders, it's clear they're asking for access permissions, possibly needing elevated rights. I'll decide on the category, leaning towards \"Administrative rights\" as it reflects the elevated permissions they seek.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIn many ticket systems, \"Administrative rights\" refer to elevated privileges, which seems relevant here since the user wants edit access to a folder or project, possibly called \"new Wednesday PM.\" This could fit under several categories, but they specifically asked to categorize it. Given the request is primarily about permissions, I will classify it under \"Access.\" I\u2019ll make sure to respond with the JSON format required: {\"category\": \"Access\"}.{\"category\": \"Access\"}"
