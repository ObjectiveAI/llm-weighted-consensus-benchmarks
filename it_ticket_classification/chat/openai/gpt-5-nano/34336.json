This seems to indicate a technical software issue related to CI/CD. It looks like the appropriate category would be \"Internal Project,\" since it relates to software development processes within their project.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm narrowing down the category for the IT ticket and deciding it\u2019s definitely not hardware, storage, access, administration rights, or purchase. It looks like \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since this issue is project-specific related to the sonar job. While \"Miscellaneous\" could also be an option, the clarity of \"Internal Project\" makes it the better choice. Therefore, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object indicating the category as \u201cInternal Project.\u201d That should cover it!**Finalizing JSON Output**\n\nI've decided that \"Internal Project\" is indeed the best category for the IT ticket. Now, I just need to respond with a clean JSON object as specified in the prompt. The required format includes a category field, so I\u2019ll create it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nThere won't be any extra text added; it\u2019s important to keep it precise and formatted correctly. Let\u2019s go ahead and proceed with that!"
