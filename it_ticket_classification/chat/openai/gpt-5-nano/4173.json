They mentioned something about the monitor having ports, which makes me think it\u2019s related to hardware. The category options provided are clear. So, I'll choose \"Hardware\" or possibly \"Purchase\" as it relates to needing a monitor. I\u2019ll create a JSON-like object containing the selected category, ensuring it adheres to the schema specified in the prompt.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nIn categorizing IT tickets, requests for hardware can fit into either \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase\" categories when it comes to a monitor. The user stated they \"need a monitor for laptop,\" which sounds like a hardware request. Since it mentions needing to acquire a monitor, it could also be considered a \"Purchase.\" The text suggests it's about getting hardware, and there's also a mention of ports, focusing on compatibility. I need to decide between these two categories.**Deciding on Category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to go with \"Hardware\" as the category for this IT ticket. I need to output a JSON object with the category field set to \"Hardware.\" The instructions are clear on responding with this format, so it should be straightforward. It\u2019ll look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I want to make sure it's valid JSON, which it is. Now, I'll deliver that without any extra commentary."
