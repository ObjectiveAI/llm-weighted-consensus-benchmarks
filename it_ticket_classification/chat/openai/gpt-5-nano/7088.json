They seem to be asking for help to change alert settings from multiple frequencies to just one. Additionally, they\u2019re struggling to find how to download an app on their mobile phone and are asking for further assistance. So, I'll categorize this under \"Access\" since it involves changing software settings and downloading an app. It's important to get this right!**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI'm trying to decide how to categorize this IT support ticket. It doesn't seem to fit under hardware, so I'm considering \"Miscellaneous\" since it's a catch-all. \"Access\" might work if they're asking for access rights for the app download, but it seems more related to alerts. I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit. I need to format my response as a JSON object too, so it'll look like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Maybe I should add a brief note as well!**Finalizing output format**\n\nIt looks like the instruction is clear: I only need to return the category in a JSON format. The output guidelines specify that it should just be that object. So, I'll make sure to deliver exactly what's required without any extra details. I'll format it correctly and then submit just the JSON object representing the category. It's important to stick to the instructions, so I'll keep it straightforward!"
