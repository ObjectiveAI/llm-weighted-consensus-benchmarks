In IT ticket taxonomy, the \u201cStorage\u201d category might be appropriate since it relates to storage hardware and tape libraries. The ticket mentions notifications and weekly tape change requests. While \u201cAccess\u201d could fit due to the location access request included, I think \u201cStorage\u201d is more fitting given the use of terms like \u201ctape\u201d and \u201cstorage.\u201d Ultimately, it seems the user is asking for help with notification routing in ServiceNow.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nI see that I need to categorize an IT ticket and produce a JSON object. The instructions specify that the category should come from an allowed set, which includes options like \u201cHardware,\u201d \u201cHR Support,\u201d and \u201cStorage.\u201d Knowing that \u201cStorage\u201d fits, I\u2019ll confirm this is a valid category. The final output should strictly be the JSON format, without any additional text. So, I\u2019ll produce: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} for the response."
