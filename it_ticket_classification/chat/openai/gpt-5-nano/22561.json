The mention of \"cable,\" \"additional cable order,\" and \"connect monitor\" suggests it's related to hardware, and possibly a purchase request. The best fit seems to be either the Hardware or Purchase category, but it could also relate to an Internal Project. Since they're asking for more cables, it makes sense to categorize it under Purchase, as it's a request to order more hardware.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe category specified in this case includes \"Purchase.\" Since the user is looking for a category and not taking an action, I need to respond with a JSON-like structure. The available options include various categories, but given the ticket's focus on \"additional cable order to connect monitor,\" it clearly implies a purchase request. Although \"Hardware\" could fit because it involves cables, \"Purchase\" is the best choice due to the explicit mention of ordering. Therefore, I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Providing JSON response**\n\nThe user\u2019s instruction is clear: they want me to categorize the IT ticket and respond with the category in a JSON format. Since I need to keep it simple, I\u2019ll ensure my output is just the JSON object without any extra text. I\u2019ll follow the established guidelines and provide the necessary category based on the previous context. So, I'll focus on delivering exactly that."
