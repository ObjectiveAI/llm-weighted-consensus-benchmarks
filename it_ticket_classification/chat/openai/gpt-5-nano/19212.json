I believe the most fitting category for this ticket is \"Purchase,\" since that's the main focus of the content.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI need to determine whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware,\" since it involves physical items like adapters and an external rack caddy. The ticket also focuses on logging installation and receipts, which leans toward procurement. After considering both options, I think \"Purchase\" is the best fit.
