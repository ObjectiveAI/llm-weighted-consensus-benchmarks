I\u2019m trying to decide between \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It could also relate to access if they need permissions in ServiceNow to make changes.**Deciding on a Category**\n\nI need to choose a category for the ticket. The content mentions \"cab amendments,\" \"service now,\" and updating documentation. It looks like the user wants to make changes related to the Change Advisory Board, potentially classifying this as an \"Internal Project.\" However, with phrases like \"add cab infrastructure,\" it suggests modifications to the infrastructure. It could also fall under \"Administrative rights\" if they need permissions in ServiceNow to carry out these changes. I'm still a bit uncertain.**Choosing a Category**\n\nI have a list of categories to choose from, including \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. \"Access\" could apply if they need permissions, but \"Administrative rights\" is more about specific access. \"Internal Project\" looks like the best fit since the ticket involves updating CAB documentation and processes in ServiceNow. The phrases \"update documentation\" and \"process documentation\" suggest it's part of a project. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and prepare to return this in the required JSON format."
