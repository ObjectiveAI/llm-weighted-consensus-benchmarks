Since it concerns HR processes rather than hardware, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit, but I\u2019ll also consider Access if it's specifically about accessing the leave system.**Clarifying IT ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing IT ticket categories, which include \"Access\" for access rights and \"Administrative rights\" for system admin privileges. The user\u2019s ticket talks about annual leave requests not reaching the line manager anymore, indicating a potential permissions issue or system bug. Given the lack of context, I think I should categorize this as \"Access,\" since it relates to the leave approval system, but I\u2019ll also consider the HR aspect since it's tied to workflow in HR. The ticket grammar is a bit unclear, which adds to the confusion.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe key issue here is that leave requests aren't reaching the line manager. This seems to relate to access or administrative rights since it's about the ability to approve these requests. I think \"Access\" fits best as it pertains to permissions. Although \"HR Support\" could apply due to the HR process involved, \"Access\" seems more technical in this context. Following the format instructions for the ticket, I'll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
