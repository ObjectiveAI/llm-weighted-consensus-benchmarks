It appears to be about approaching a website's storage limit and concerns regarding how much storage the site is using. This likely relates to SharePoint site collection storage usage. Given the categories available, \"Storage\" seems to be the most relevant one. Alright, categorizing this ticket under \"Storage\" makes the most sense. Let's proceed with that!**Finalizing category in JSON**\n\nThe task focuses on approaching storage limits and viewing site usage, which clearly falls under the \"Storage\" category. I considered \"Access,\" but this is primarily about storage management. Although \"Administrative rights\" might be relevant due to the administrator site mention, the core issue is storage. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Storage.\" I need to respond with a minimal JSON object: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} since that\u2019s what the instructions specify. Let\u2019s finalize it!"
