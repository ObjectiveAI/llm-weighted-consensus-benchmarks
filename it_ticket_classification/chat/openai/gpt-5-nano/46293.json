The user mentioned a \"Windows activation issue\" for a new PC build. This seems like it could be related to \"Access\" since it involves software licensing. However, \"Software\" isn't an option in the categories provided. I could also consider \"Administrative rights\" since activation might involve permissions. I'll decide it's best categorized under \"Access\" for now.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out the best category for the IT ticket. There's no dedicated \"Software\" category, but the issue relates to activation for Windows, which seems to point towards \"Access\" due to licensing. While \"Hardware\" might fit since it\u2019s about a PC build, this is primarily a software problem. \"Administrative rights\" doesn't seem relevant since activation doesn't necessarily need admin rights. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" for this ticket and format it as a JSON object.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
