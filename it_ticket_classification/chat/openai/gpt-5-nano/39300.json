The categories provided are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nSince it concerns a dashboard issue, it might best fit under \"Internal Project\" as it relates to project-specific functionality. It could also be seen as \"Miscellaneous,\" but I think \"Internal Project\" feels more precise here.  So, I'll go with that one.**Categorizing dashboard issue**\n\nThis ticket is about the \"MS dashboard,\" likely related to a Microsoft system. It mentions some persistent display issues regarding complaints numbers. From my understanding, it's a clear case of a reporting bug related to the dashboard rather than hardware or other categories provided. It seems like \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since it pertains to an internal tool, specifically ServiceNow. \n\nSo I'll output the category as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Delivering category object**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket, and it needs to be in a specific format as a JSON object. The category field is called \"category,\" and I\u2019m choosing \"Internal Project\" as the best fit based on the context.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll output the category exactly as required: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. If needed, I could consider alternatives, but this looks right. Let\u2019s go ahead and deliver that!"
