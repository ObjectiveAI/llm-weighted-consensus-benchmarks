It seems related to grade changes, an Oracle system reference, job title changes, and tracking assistance. This likely falls under internal HR or IT support. The available categories include \"HR Support,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" Given the content, it looks like this ticket is mainly about admin HR tasks focusing on grading and job titles.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI think \"HR Support\" is the best category for this IT ticket. There's a mention of \"Administrative rights,\" which could also work if they need access to change job titles. The reference to \"Oracle\" might indicate they mean an ERP system for grade changes. Their main request appears to be for assistance with logging and tracking related to grades and job titles. So, \"HR Support\" seems most appropriate. I'll format the output as JSON accordingly.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether \"Access\" might work since it's related to Oracle access. However, the ticket text is rather jumbled. The best category seems to be \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll format my response as the required JSON object without any extra commentary. Since the prompt specifically says \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" it looks like they want to see just the category output. So I\u2019ll simply respond with the JSON: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
