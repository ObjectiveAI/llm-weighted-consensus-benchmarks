Given that context, \"Access\" feels like the right category. \n\nHowever, parsing the full message is tricky. \"as available Friday PM, ref card\" is somewhat unclear, and it seems the user may have mixed languages or typed in haste.**Determining the IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user\u2019s message, \"as available Friday PM, ref card, si se la,\" suggests they might be blending languages. However, for categorizing, \"Access\" seems to be the best fit, especially if it's about an access card for scheduling. It could also potentially relate to \"Administrative rights,\" but I think \"Access\" is more relevant.\n\nI\u2019ll output a JSON object with the category \"Access\" in the required format, keeping explanations minimal since the user just wants classification. Here it is: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
