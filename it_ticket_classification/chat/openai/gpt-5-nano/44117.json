The options on the list are things like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and more. Given that they're requesting a temporary machine due to a hardware issue, the main category here is Hardware. I considered a few other categories, but Hardware seems to be the most appropriate choice.**Outputting category format**\n\nI need to make sure I categorize the IT ticket correctly and follow the required JSON-like format. The user's ticket indicates a broken Windows system in Belgrade and a laptop that can't boot, along with a request for a temporary machine. The category here is definitely Hardware. While we could propose sub-issues, the user specifically asked for a concise categorization. So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That keeps it clear and straightforward!"
