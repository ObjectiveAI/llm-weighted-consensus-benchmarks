I\u2019ll select \"Internal Project\" for categorization.**Categorizing the content**\n\nI need to be cautious about categorizing the content provided: \"project code tuesday october pm code hello guys please code invoice let changed additional information cheers.\" This looks like a mix of phrases, mentioning \"invoice,\" \"code,\" and \"change additional information.\" However, it doesn't explicitly request hardware or access.\n\nGiven that it includes \"project code,\u201d \u201cInternal Project\" feels like the best fit.
