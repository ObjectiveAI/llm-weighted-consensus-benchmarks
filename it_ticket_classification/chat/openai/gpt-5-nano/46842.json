They also talk about \"creative renewal license,\" which relates to license management or procurement. However, the primary concern is that storage issue, meaning I need to categorize this IT ticket accordingly. \n\nThe best match here is \"Storage.\" So, I need to format my response in the required structure: {\"category\": \"Storage\"}. I'll ensure everything is capitalized correctly and matches the provided enum values."
