I'll have to take a close look at the details of the ticket to make the best choice. Let's go through this!**Parsing user input**\n\nI need to parse a jumbled ticket that includes several mentions about needing \"more RAM.\" It seems like multiple phrases are concatenated, and the request points toward a hardware upgrade. Given that, my best guess is to categorize this as \"Hardware.\" This ticket seems to include requests for assistance and follows with various reminders and notes, so it\u2019s essential to extract the key details and clarify the request to address it properly. Let's see what more I can find!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI see mentions of \"installation,\" \"requisition,\" and \"needs placed,\" which might indicate a purchase request. However, the main part of the ticket is that \"more RAM is needed,\" suggesting it's really about a hardware upgrade. While \"Purchase\" could work given the requisition aspects, the focus on installation leans towards categorizing it as \"Hardware.\" In ticket systems, upgrades usually fall under that category, so I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Hardware\" and prepare a JSON object with that designation.**Formatting the output**\n\nI need to output the information in the specified format, which is a category object with a category string. So, I\u2019m going to produce this:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}  \n\nI won't add any extra analysis or details in the final answer since the instruction is clear. The desired output is just this JSON object. Alright, let's finalize it and deliver!"
