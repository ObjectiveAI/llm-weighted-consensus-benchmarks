It mentions terms like \"new purchase,\" \"PO,\" \"mouse wired hub,\" \"mandatory receipts,\" and \"order received.\" This might relate to a hardware purchase or something administrative. \n\nBased on the context provided, it looks like it should fall under the \"Purchase\" category since it discusses purchase orders and receipts. \n\nI\u2019ll make sure to map the content accurately to help streamline the ticket process.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket seems to revolve around purchasing hardware, specifically a purchase order for a mouse and a wired USB hub. It also touches on administrative details regarding receipts, indicating it\u2019s primarily about procurement. \n\nThe best fitting category for this ticket appears to be \"Purchase\" since the main focus is on the order itself. I\u2019ll structure the response as a JSON object clearly indicating the chosen category. So, the final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}**Formatting Response**\n\nI see that I need to provide the response in a specific format as a JSON object that includes a \"category\" property. The chosen category is \"Purchase.\"\n\nIt looks like I'm also contemplating whether to include a brief reasoning, but the instruction specifies to respond with just the category. So, I\u2019ll stick to that and format the final answer as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
