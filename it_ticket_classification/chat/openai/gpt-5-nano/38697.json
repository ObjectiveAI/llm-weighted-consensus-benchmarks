The keywords like \"start procedure for buying card\" suggest that it might relate to purchasing. I see potential categories like \"Purchase\" or even \"Hardware\" since it could refer to a hardware card. However, \"Purchase\" seems the most fitting. I\u2019ll make sure to format this information into a JSON object with the appropriate category field.**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nI see that the user request includes \"start procedure for buying card,\" which looks like a purchasing request. It makes sense to categorize it as \"Purchase.\" Other options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Storage\" don\u2019t seem to fit. So, I\u2019ll respond with the formatted JSON object as required. It will be straightforward since we only need the category without extra explanation. \n\nHere's the JSON format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
