There are several categories available like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Access.\" Since the ticket discusses access rights, mailbox, and roaming profiles, I think \"Access\" is the best fit. I'll go with that option. The instructions mention I should respond with a JSON object, so I\u2019ll format it like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That should align with the requirements!**Formatting IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe prompt is asking me to categorize an IT ticket, and I see the schema for the required JSON output. I need to make sure I stick to the format and avoid adding any extra text. The category that fits here is \"Access,\" so I\u2019ll keep it simple and structured. My final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll ensure the quotes are correct and just provide that clean response!"
