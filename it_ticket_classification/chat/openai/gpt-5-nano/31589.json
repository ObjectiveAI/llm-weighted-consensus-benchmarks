The user wants me to extract the category from a message that starts with \"Categorize this IT Ticket:\" followed by a block of text. I'll review the content to determine the best fitting category and then output it in JSON format as {\"category\":\"string\"}.**Categorizing IT Ticket Content**\n\nI have a ticket mentioning \"monitor issues\" and an \"Apple keyboard\" that's experiencing problems. The text is quite jumbled but it includes terms like brightness, refresh rate, and potential replacements. Since the issues are with hardware devices\u2014specifically the monitor and keyboard\u2014I believe the appropriate category is Hardware. While there\u2019s a mention of corporate structure, it doesn't fit into other categories like Administrative rights or Internal Project. The category I\u2019ll assign is Hardware.**Finalizing JSON Output**\n\nI\u2019ve determined that the best category for this ticket is Hardware since it's about issues with devices and suggests replacements. I need to respond with the exact JSON structure as required. So, I\u2019m going to provide: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} and keep it strictly to that format. The prompt specifically states to output just the JSON category object, so I won\u2019t add any extra text. I'll make sure the punctuation is correct and proceed with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
