They mentioned terms like \"annual leave remaining days,\" \"balance,\" and \"awaiting approval,\" so it seems related to HR. I'll probably classify it as \"HR Support\" since that fits best with the context of leave and HR systems. The required output format is a JSON object, which should look like: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. Let\u2019s go with that!**Delivering JSON Response**\n\nThe prompt specifies that I should respond with just the category. The required format is a JSON object, which shows that I need to include a \"category\" field with one of the specified strings. Based on the context, my output will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I need to make sure there\u2019s no extra text included. Alright, I\u2019m all set to deliver that!"
