They\u2019re asking for a new design and specifically want to hide the \"announcements\" and \"conversations\" sections. The main concern is that these sections take up too much space on the main pages and are not effectively displaying related material. This seems to be a request focused on UI/UX design changes to make the site more user-friendly and visible.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm seeing a request regarding design changes where the user is asking if it's possible to hide two sections in the interface for better visibility. I need to categorize this IT ticket from a provided list: hardware, HR support, access, miscellaneous, storage, purchase, internal project, and administrative rights. This content is primarily about software/web interface design, so it isn\u2019t hardware or access-related. \"Internal Project\" seems fitting, or perhaps \"Miscellaneous\" depending on how it fits within the categories.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nThis request is about a design change for UI elements on an internal website, so \"Internal Project\" seems like the best category since it pertains to modifying internal systems. \"Administrative rights\" is more focused on permissions rather than design. I\u2019m considering whether to classify it as \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Internal Project\" is more precise given the context. I should craft a response that includes a JSON object with the category as \"Internal Project,\" along with a brief explanation.**Formatting the JSON response**\n\nI need to respond in a JSON-like object format as specified by the system. The schema requires a structure where \"category\" is a string matching one of the provided enumerated types. Since this request clearly fits under \"Internal Project,\" I'll craft the response accordingly. No extra text is needed; I should just provide the object. So, my final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I'll ensure it's properly encoded and clear."
