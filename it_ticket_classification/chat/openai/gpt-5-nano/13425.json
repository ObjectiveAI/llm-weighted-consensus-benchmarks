However, given it's about filling out a form for a new starter, \u201cHR Support\u201d seems the most appropriate choice.**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m confirming that since this IT ticket is about onboarding, the best category to choose is \u201cHR Support.\u201d The user asked me to categorize it, and I need to respond with the correct JSON format. It should include the correct structure with the category value of \"HR Support.\" The schema specifies that the object will have properties including category, so I\u2019ll format it as: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}}. This way, I\u2019m meeting the requirements!**Delivering Output Format**\n\nI see that the final output needs to be {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} based on the request. However, the schema outlines that it should include a broader JSON object structure. Even though it\u2019s common in these tasks to just provide a category value, it\u2019s better to stick to the full format as specified in the schema. So, I'll deliver just the necessary JSON object to ensure I meet the instructions without adding any extra content."
