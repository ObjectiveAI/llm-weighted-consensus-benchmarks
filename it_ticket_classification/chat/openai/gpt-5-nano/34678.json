They mention archiving, reducing mailbox size, deleting items, and the deleted items folder. This clearly relates to a storage issue, so I think the best fit is the \"Storage\" category from our list, which includes Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Purchase, and others. I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object for this category.**Formatting IT ticket category**\n\nI need to create a JSON object that categorizes the IT ticket as \"Storage.\" The instructions mention a specific format, including \"type\" and \"properties.\" It seems the required final output should adhere strictly to the schema rather than just providing the category. So, I will output a JSON object that captures the category correctly within the defined structure. It should look like this: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Storage\"]}}}}. This way, it meets all requirements!**Outputting the category**\n\nI need to provide a clean output for the IT ticket, which requires the category \"Storage.\" The format is straightforward, so I should just output: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I want to avoid any extra commentary or surrounding text since the instructions are clear. It's all about keeping it succinct and adhering to the specified format. So, I'll go ahead and provide that exact JSON object without any additional details."
