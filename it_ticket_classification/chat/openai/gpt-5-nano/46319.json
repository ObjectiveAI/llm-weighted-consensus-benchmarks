Despite the muddled wording, it suggests that access control or permissions are involved. Therefore, this ticket clearly falls under the \"Access\" category, but I'm wondering if there could be others relevant.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI'm considering if this IT ticket could fit into other categories like \"Administrative rights\" for permissions or \"Internal Project\" for a design lead. However, it seems most accurate to categorize it under \"Access,\" since that's the main issue presented. The output should follow a specific format, so I\u2019ll present it as a JSON object. Therefore, I\u2019ll output the final format as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No additional text should be included!"
