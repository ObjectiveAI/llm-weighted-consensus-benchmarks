This seems to relate to onboarding tasks, which makes me think it could be \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Access\" if it involves granting access rights. I\u2019ll go for \"HR Support\" since that fits best with the context of onboarding and forms. \n\nI should prepare a JSON object with the category set correctly.**Determining the right category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to decide which category fits best for this IT ticket. The options include \"HR Support,\" which typically covers HR-related tasks, and \"Access,\" which is more about granting system access.\n\nSince this ticket is about a \"new starter\" form and mentions onboarding, it seems we could lean towards \"HR Support.\" However, it also involves assistance with access setup. Given the details about the starter form joining in September, \"Access\" might be more appropriate. \n\nUltimately, I should go with \"Access\" as the chosen category.**Finalizing the category output**\n\nThe prompt clearly states to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" so I need to output a JSON object with the category field. I\u2019m settling on the category \"Access\" since the details mention a \"new starter\" and contractor, which suggests onboarding.\n\nI could consider asking clarifying questions, but since the user requested a categorization, I think it makes sense to simply respond with the category. I\u2019ll format it correctly in JSON style:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThis way, I'm ensuring that the response meets the required schema."
