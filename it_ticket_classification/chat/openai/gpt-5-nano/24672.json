It mentions an annual service recovery test and a reverse proxy service, so it seems related to IT service continuity or disaster recovery testing. I\u2019m debating between categorizing it as \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Given the context, it might lean more towards \"Internal Project,\" but it's important to be sure. Let\u2019s make a clear choice for accurate classification!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories available and trying to decide how to classify the ticket. It mentions a disaster recovery test, which feels like it fits under \"Internal Project\" since it involves restoring the reverse proxy service and includes project tasks. While it could touch on \"Administrative rights\" regarding permissions, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the main focus. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and respond with a JSON category object!**Providing the JSON response**\n\nI see that the system's schema requires a JSON object with a category field. I\u2019ve decided to categorize the ticket as \"Internal Project,\" so I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. No need for extra text or details; let\u2019s keep it simple and straightforward! I'm ready to deliver this response now."
