They're talking about \"new starter hardware allocation,\" so this clearly relates to hardware. They also mention a \"starter form\" and its high importance. The phrase about the attached form signals supplementary info. Considering all this, \"Hardware\" seems to be the most appropriate category, while \"Purchase\" could apply if they were buying new hardware. Thus, I'll go with \"Hardware\" as the final answer in JSON format.**Responding with JSON**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object according to the specifications. The instruction indicates that I should categorize the IT ticket, so I believe I only need to provide the category field in the output. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a requirement for any extra text. So, my final output will be simply: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.  This should align perfectly with what is needed!"
