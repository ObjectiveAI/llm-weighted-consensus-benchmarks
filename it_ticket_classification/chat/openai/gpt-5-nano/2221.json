Given the context, it looks most appropriate to classify this ticket as \"Miscellaneous.\" I think I'll output this as a JSON object, like {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm looking at the categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The user's message seems related to IT support, specifically about a service restart and Teams, so it doesn't fit \"Hardware.\" \n\nIt could potentially relate to \"Administrative rights\" if a restart is needed.
