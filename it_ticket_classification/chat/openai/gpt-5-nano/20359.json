I\u2019m thinking this might fit into the \"Access\" category since it relates to removing staff and managing access to the forecast in Oracle. Alternatively, it could also be about \"Internal Project\" due to its focus on project staff and forecasts.**Categorizing access management**\n\nI see that the categories include \"Internal Project\" and \"Access.\" The user's text about \"removing staff from project staff review forecast oracle\" suggests they might be discussing removing staff\u2019s access to project data.
