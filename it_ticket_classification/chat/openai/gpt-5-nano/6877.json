We need to decide on a classification category. It references \"password reset expiry days\" and has a privacy policy feel, which seems important. I think \"Access\" fits best for password issues, while \"Administrative rights\" might apply if it's about privileges. Overall, it seems most appropriate to categorize this ticket as \"Access\" concerning password reset and access issues.**Categorizing access issues**\n\nIt seems like this is an access issue that requires a password reset, so I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Access.\" While I could consider \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access\" feels more appropriate. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object containing the category information. The required format is straightforward, so I'll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I think clarifying questions might not be necessary here since the user clearly asked for a category. I\u2019ll just keep it simple with that response."
