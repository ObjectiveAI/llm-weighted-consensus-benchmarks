I\u2019ll choose from categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. The ticket discusses tasks related to importing templates, which might suggest \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d or \u201cInternal Project.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ll format my final answer as a JSON object, selecting the most fitting category. It seems like \"Internal Project\" could be the best choice!**Evaluating IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"import templates\" and \"recruiting Germany,\" which suggests it could relate to HR Support, especially since the templates might be used for recruiting. \u201cInternal Project\u201d is another possibility, but it\u2019s less clear. The repeated phrases about importing templates imply it\u2019s likely an IT-related task, but there could also be considerations around \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d if they need permission. Overall, I think \u201cHR Support\u201d may be the best fit for this ticket.**Deciding the IT ticket category**\n\nThe user's request involves importing \"templates\" to a computer, likely for recruiting purposes. This leans towards categorizing the ticket under \"HR Support,\" which fits HR-related tasks. While \"Internal Project\" could also apply if it were about project templates, there's no clear indication of a project here. \"Miscellaneous\" is too broad. \n\nGiven that the ticket focuses on HR and recruiting, I\u2019ll classify it as \"HR Support\" and format the output correctly in JSON. So, my final output will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Providing the category format**\n\nI\u2019ve listed the categories clearly: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The category \"HR Support\" has a space between \"HR\" and \"Support,\" which is correct. Since I need to categorize the IT ticket simply and efficiently, I\u2019ll focus on that and provide just the JSON object without any extra commentary. My output will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
