The text discusses a server, a workstation, and mentions terms like rogue access and decommissioning. \n\nGiven the categories to choose from\u2014like Hardware, Access, and Miscellaneous\u2014I think this ticket fits best under the \"Access\" category, as it focuses on security concerns and potential access issues with the workstation in the server room. I\u2019ll go with that classification!**Classifying Ticket Category**\n\nI'm deciding how to categorize an IT ticket. It mentions \"rogue access,\" \"decommission workstation,\" and \"move physical workstation\" which hints at a security risk and asset management issue. \n\nI think \"Access\" fits best because it involves unauthorized access concerns. However, \"Hardware\" could apply since it talks about a workstation too. In the end, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and present the result in JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to avoid leaking any internal details, as the text indicates it's \"confidential.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
