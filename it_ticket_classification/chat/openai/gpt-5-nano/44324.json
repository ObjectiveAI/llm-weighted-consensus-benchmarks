Phrases like \"pending approval\" and \"approvers list empty\" stand out, suggesting it's related to a ServiceNow interface. \n\nConsidering the options\u2014Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights\u2014I think the best fit might be **Miscellaneous** since it deals with a specific issue within a service interface rather than hardware or a standard category.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket, and it seems related to a ServiceNow (SNOW) change request workflow, focusing on change view and approval routing. I initially consider categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\nSince the issue involves an empty approver list and sending something for approval, it's more of a workflow issue rather than needing user access. Given the context of implementing a change, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the most fitting category here.**Exploring ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering the category options for this IT ticket, especially since it's about ServiceNow change request approvals. While \"Access\" could apply\u2014given it concerns who can approve\u2014I also need to think about \"Administrative rights,\" possibly needed for granting any permissions. \n\nHowever, since the ticket mentions sending something for approval and notes an empty approver list, it feels more like a workflow issue. \"Miscellaneous\" could work for generic IT concerns, but I should probably go with \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll present the final categorization as a JSON object as instructed.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nThe instructions indicate that I need to create a JSON object to specify the category of the IT ticket. The format seems to require a simple structure: {\"category\":\"[chosen_category]\"}. The options include things like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and others. Given that the user\u2019s content revolves around a ServiceNow change view and approval requests, I\u2019m leaning toward classifying it as \"Internal Project\" based on the context. However, \"Miscellaneous\" could also work if it's more generic. So, I'll prepare my response accordingly.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m determining that the ticket is related to an internal project involving a change view and the approval process. Phrases like \"button pending approval\" and \"approvers list empty\" suggest it could be a bug. It's clear this isn't about hardware or HR, and while \"Administrative rights\" might be relevant, the focus is on workflow rather than access rights. Classifying it as \"Internal Project\" makes the most sense, given its ties to ServiceNow. I'll respond with the JSON:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
