It mentions being \"unable to files\" and \"job description templates,\" suggesting there might be an issue with accessing or uploading files. The recurring keywords like \"files,\" \"templates,\" and \"shared\" stand out, indicating trouble with either viewing or filing a new PM's job description templates. I need to clarify whether it's related to viewing or filing those documents.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering that \"new PM\" likely refers to \"new project manager\" who has shared job description templates. The user is asking to categorize this IT ticket into one of several categories such as Hardware, HR Support, or Access. Since the message includes terms like \"files,\" \"templates,\" \"shared,\" and \"view,\" it seems related to access issues. The \"Access\" category seems like the best fit since it involves difficulty in accessing shared files.**Interpreting access issue**\n\nI think the user is facing an \"unable to view files\" issue with a shared folder containing job description templates from the new PM. This definitely indicates an access problem related to permissions. So the category I should assign is \"Access.\" I'll format the response as a JSON object, ensuring it matches the required structure. It should simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI need to make sure it\u2019s exactly that, no extra text!"
