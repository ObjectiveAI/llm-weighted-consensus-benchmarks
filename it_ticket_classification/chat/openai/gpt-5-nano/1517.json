Phrases like \"please advise\" and \"needs shared sources\" suggest this is about gaining access. Therefore, \"Access\" seems to be the best fit for this ticket, especially since it involves login credentials.**Outputting JSON Category**\n\nI want to include mentions of \"external client\" and \"shared sources,\" confirming that this ticket is indeed about an \"External client password reset,\" which falls under \"Access.\" The task is to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category. The required format is clear: it should just include the line for \"category\" as a string. So, I\u2019ll provide only the JSON object with \"Access\" as the category, ensuring there's no extra text. Here it is:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
