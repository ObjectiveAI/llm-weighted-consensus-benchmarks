In the text, the user talks about issues related to a \"PO,\" which I think refers to \"purchase order.\" Given the references to problems and urgent receipts, it definitely seems to be related to a Purchase. So, the appropriate category here is \"Purchase.\"**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object categorizing the IT ticket. The system outlines that the response format should include a \"category\" field. With the allowed values being various categories, \"Purchase\" is indeed valid. As per the prompt's instructions, I will format my output as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It's crucial to stick to the required format without extra text. So, I\u2019ll provide just that JSON response without any added explanations. Let's go ahead and do that!"
