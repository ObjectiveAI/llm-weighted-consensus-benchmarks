The user provided a string about onboarding a new starter, mentioning a request that seems to relate to a starter form and processing her account. The phrase \"AD\" likely refers to Active Directory, which suggests they're requesting the creation of her account before her starting date. They\u2019re indicating that the client can't access necessary systems until her account is set up. I'll make sure to address that need.**Determining ticket categories**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket. The user indicates they want to process an account for a new starter, as they can't access client resources until the Active Directory account is created. Phrases like \"process her ad least prior her date\" also point to urgency before her start date. Considering the allowed categories, this ticket is best categorized as \"Access\" since it's about setting up account access. \"Administrative rights\" could work but might be too specific for the situation.**Submitting category in JSON**\n\nI'll categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" The instructions specify that I need to respond with a JSON object containing the category. The valid format requires me to ensure I'm using a recognized string from the allowed list. While I initially considered \"HR Support\" because of the onboarding aspect, it fits better under \"Access\" since it\u2019s specifically about account setup and Active Directory. So, I will output just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
