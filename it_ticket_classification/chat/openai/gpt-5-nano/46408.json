The ticket discusses submitting timecards and mentions issues about approvals and errors related to a timecard system. I\u2019m contemplating whether to label it as \"Internal Project,\" which seems related but could also fall under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights\" if it\u2019s tied to permissions issues. It\u2019s tricky since it concerns a timecard system, but I\u2019ll figure it out!**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket doesn\u2019t seem to fit \"Access\" since it isn\u2019t about login credentials. It describes a troubleshooting issue with the Oracle timecard application, specifically concerning calendar view errors and timecard submissions. Unfortunately, the categories available don\u2019t include \u201cIT Support\u201d or \u201cSoftware.\u201d The best options are likely \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I think categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" would be the safest option since it's a general IT ticket. I'll format the output as a JSON with the category field.**Deciding on category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking we should respond with JSON like: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. However, \"Internal Project\" might also fit well since the ticket discusses Oracle and timecard submissions related to an HR/payroll project. This ticket is prompting action to submit cards for approval, indicating an IT issue. There's also an \"HR Support\" category, which could relate to HR processes, but it feels more like an IT support issue for HR systems. I\u2019ll need to choose the best fitting category!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
