The ticket describes an authentication issue where the user is automatically logged off after logging in, and they mention console output and a server restart.\n\nIt seems the best fit for this issue would be the \"Access\" category since it seems related to authentication. Alternatively, \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it involves permissions, but it doesn't seem to. \"Hardware\" might make sense too if it's server-related.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nThe issue revolves around authentication, and the available categories don\u2019t include \"Incident management,\" \"Security,\" or \"Network.\" So, \"Access\" feels like the right fit here. \n\nI\u2019ll craft the response pretty simply: I need to state the category along with a brief justification, explaining that this is an authentication/access issue on the server, where the login session drops, and it's only console accessible post-restart. Therefore, I\u2019ll definitely categorize it as \"Access.\" The output should be in the specified JSON format: {\"category\": \"Access\"}.{\"category\": \"Access\"}"
