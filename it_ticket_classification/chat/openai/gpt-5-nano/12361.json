The categories I can use include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. I think it fits best under \"Administrative rights,\" as it appears the user is asking for access related to a new starter. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the appropriate category. It\u2019s important to get this right!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the IT ticket, and it mentions \u201cmissed information,\u201d \u201cnew starter,\u201d and \u201cplease fill date.\u201d This could indicate it relates to onboarding, so I\u2019m considering the \"Access\" category since it might involve granting access. However, it also hints at \"HR Support\" because it deals with new employee details. Nothing fits perfectly, but I think I\u2019ll lean towards \"Administrative rights\" because it might involve granting access. I need to choose the best category!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
