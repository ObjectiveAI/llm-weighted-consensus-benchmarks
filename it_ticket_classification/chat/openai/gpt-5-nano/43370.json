There's mention of a \"big issue\" and things being \"solved,\" which makes me think it could fit under \"Miscellaneous\" since it's not explicitly about hardware, HR, access, or any specific category.\n\nI'll create a JSON object with the relevant category selected from the options given, focusing on making it clear and accurate. My choice will be \"Miscellaneous.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nOkay, I'm analyzing the user's message and thinking about the categories. It doesn't specifically mention hardware or access issues, but it does seem like general feedback. Since there isn't a clear-cut issue, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Miscellaneous,\" which can cover general support feedback. \n\nThe mention of a \"big issue with contact\" might suggest an access issue, but without more details, I feel \"Miscellaneous\" is the safest choice for this ticket.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering if this ticket could fit under \"Internal Project\" since it mentions contacting support, but that category typically relates to specific tasks. The content doesn't point to hardware or software issues, nor access problems. Instead, it seems more like general feedback. \n\nSo, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll prepare the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}, delivering just that since the instructions specify to keep it straightforward."
