The text refers to \"purchase order requisition,\" \"supplier,\" \"cost center,\" and others, which makes me think it fits best under the \"Purchase\" category given the recurring mentions of orders and requisitions. Each detail about suppliers and orders aligns closely with purchasing transactions. This should help in efficiently sorting the ticket into the correct category!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIt looks like I need to categorize an IT ticket related to the purchase order requisition process. The best fit seems to be the \"Purchase\" category. I should respond according to the specified format for clarity. The output will be a JSON-like structure that clearly states this category. So, I'll keep it simple and provide just the JSON object with the correct category label. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ll format the response:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
