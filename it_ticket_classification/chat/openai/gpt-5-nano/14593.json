The text includes phrases like \"unable to submit\" and questions about logging annual leave, which makes me think it relates to HR processes. So, it could fit either the \"Access\" category or \"HR Support.\" But since the mention of annual leave directly connects to HR, I'll go ahead and categorize it under \"HR Support.\" That's clear, and it seems like the best fit for this ticket!**Classifying user inquiry**\n\nThe user message seems to indicate they\u2019re having trouble submitting a leave request. They mention \"unable to submit\" and ask how to log annual leave, which aligns with HR processes. While it could be an \"Access\" issue if they can't access the system, it feels more related to HR support since they\u2019re specifically asking about submitting leave. The phrase about logging suggests they need guidance on the HR process for submitting requests, making \"HR Support\" the best category here.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm exploring the IT ticket categories available: \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I think \"HR Support\" fits best since the user's inquiry is about logging their annual leave. It could be \"Access\" if they were unable to log in, but their message doesn\u2019t clearly indicate any access denial\u2014just the need for guidance on submitting leave. I\u2019ll categorize this as \"HR Support\" and respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} to meet the required format!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
