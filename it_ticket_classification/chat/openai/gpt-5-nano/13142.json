It mentions logging allocation, considering mandatory receipts, and receiving an item. The categories available include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and \"Purchase.\" Given the ticket's focus on purchase orders and allocations, the \"Purchase\" category seems most fitting. I should return a JSON object with that category accordingly.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to output a JSON object with the category labeled \"Purchase\" based on the content of the IT ticket. Although there was some consideration for \"Administrative\" or \"Internal Project,\" the ticket repeatedly mentions \"purchase,\" indicating it's centered around a purchase order, receipts, and allocation. So, I should stick with \"Purchase\" and respond strictly in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I'll make sure there\u2019s no extra text. Let's finalize that!"
