                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the provided categories like \u201cHardware,\u201d \u201cAccess,\u201d and \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d The ticket mentions \u201cmeeting rooms extensions\u201d and locations like \u201cBogota\u201d and \u201cAndes,\u201d making it seem related to booking or managing meeting room extensions. \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d doesn\u2019t seem relevant, and while \u201cAccess\u201d could refer to meeting room access, the context leans more toward \u201cHardware\u201d regarding phone system extensions. This ticket might fit best under \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d due to its specifics.**Classifying Meeting Room Ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s request about adding \u201cBogota meeting rooms extensions\u201d seems quite ambiguous. As a ticket classifier, I need to find the best category. It might relate to accessing meeting room systems, suggesting \"Access,\" or it could be considered \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d if it\u2019s unclear. Choices like \u201cHardware\u201d might apply if it\u2019s about phone extensions. Given the focus on meeting rooms and scheduling for Wednesday, I feel \"Access\" is the best fit for this ticket.**Evaluating Ticket Context**\n\nAccess usually relates to login or system usage, including meeting rooms. The ticket specifies \u201cadd Bogota meeting rooms extensions to Wednesday,\u201d suggesting it\u2019s about scheduling rather than hardware access. While there\u2019s no clear category for \u201cFacilities\u201d or \u201cMaintenance,\u201d \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could apply for changing access lists. I feel \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d might serve as a catch-all. However, considering the mention of \u201cextensions\u201d in different locations, it could fall under \u201cPurchase\u201d if there are new phone extensions needed, though it\u2019s not explicitly stated.**Determining Final Category**\n\nI need to provide the final category in JSON format as instructed. Initially, I thought to use {\"category\":\"Access\"}, but \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d might suit better since the request isn\u2019t clearly about access. The user mentioned \u201cadd Bogota meeting rooms extensions,\u201d which could relate to access, but it feels more vague. In IT ticket taxonomy, \u201cAccess\u201d usually covers user accounts and permissions, whereas \u201cextensions\u201d seems linked to phone systems. Since phone extensions aren\u2019t about hardware troubleshooting, perhaps \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is indeed the most appropriate choice here.**Choosing Category for Ticket**\n\nI see potential for this request to fall under \"Internal Project,\" especially since it involves configuring meeting room extensions across locations. The mention of \"engineer\" suggests it's a legitimate internal ticket for setting this up. \u201cTo Wednesday\u201d implies a scheduling aspect, making it feel like a project. While \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d was a consideration, it seems fitting to go with \u201cInternal Project\u201d since it aligns with the goal of setting up extensions. So, I\u2019ll respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
