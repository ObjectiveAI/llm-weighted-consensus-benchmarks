It seems like it's more related to HR or payroll, particularly timecards and absence reconciliation. So, it's not about hardware but could align with HR Support.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nFor this ticket, I need to categorize it, possibly under \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Access.\" The content discusses communication regarding the unavailability of the Oracle Fusion application, timecards, and approval status, which ties back to timecard management. \n\n\"Access\" doesn't fit since it's not about login issues. \"Internal Project\" makes sense if it relates to internal communication tasks, but it could also go under \"Miscellaneous\" based on the specific context. It's a tough choice!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket is about notifying users regarding Oracle Fusion's unavailability over the weekend, which aligns well with \"Communication/Change Management.\" So, the best fit seems to be the \"Internal Project\" category. \n\nNow, I need to provide the classification in JSON format, focusing only on the \"category\" key without any extra content. The output should simply be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That's straightforward and follows the prompt accurately!"
