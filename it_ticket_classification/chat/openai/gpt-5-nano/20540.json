It seems like they need access to document leads on a Tuesday in February. The phrases like \"document leads\" and \"he creating\" hint that it's about needing access rights. I\u2019m thinking the most appropriate categories would be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" though it\u2019s not completely clear. I want to make sure I pick the right one!**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning toward categorizing the ticket as \"Access\" since it\u2019s about getting access on a specific date in February. The phrase \"document leads\" suggests a need for access to those documents, which fits well under the \"Access\" category. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it were about permissions, it feels more general here. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"} since this matches the expected output format!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
