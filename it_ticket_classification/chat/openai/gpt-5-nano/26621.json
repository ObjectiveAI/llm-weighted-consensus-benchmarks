The text is a bit chaotic, but it seems to be about adding a new team member to Git and managing access rights. I should decide between two categories: \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the ticket specifically discusses giving rights to manage members and concerns user access management, I think \"Access\" might be the most appropriate category. It covers the core issue of managing permissions.**Deciding on access category**\n\nI'm processing a ticket about access control, focusing on whether to categorize it as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket talks about giving rights to manage members and adding a new team member to Git. Since \"Access\" is a broader category that includes general permissions, it might fit better. However, because the phrase \"give rights over manage members by ourselves\" suggests admin privileges, I'm considering \"Administrative rights\" as well. It's a bit tricky, but the emphasis seems to be on access to the Git system.**Choosing the correct category**\n\nThe phrase \"manage members\" clearly suggests that admin rights are involved. While \"Access\" could cover general permissions, the specific request about granting rights to manage members implies the need for \"Administrative rights.\" This aligns well with tasks requiring privilege escalation within the Git system. The user's request is to add a new team member and allow them to manage members themselves. Overall, categorizing this ticket as \"Administrative rights\" seems like the most accurate choice.**Formatting the category response**\n\nI see that the ticket requires categorization, and while \"Access\" could apply, the mention of managing members clearly indicates admin rights are necessary. I need to respond using a JSON format, as instructed. The category should be specified exactly as \"Administrative rights.\" The prompt is straightforward: it asks to categorize the IT ticket. So, my response will be minimal, consisting solely of the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. Let's finalize that!"
