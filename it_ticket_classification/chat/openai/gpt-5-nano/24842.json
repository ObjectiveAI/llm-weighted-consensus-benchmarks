It mentions phrases like \"new starter,\" \"re-starter form complete,\" and \"administration officer,\" indicating it's related to onboarding. \n\nIt seems to involve issues with forms and possibly involves HR support or Access. \n\nI must choose the category that best matches all these elements, focusing on onboarding forms specifically. The top contenders appear to be HR Support and Access, but I\u2019m leaning toward HR Support.**Selecting HR Support category**\n\nI'm deciding on a category for an IT ticket, and \"HR Support\" seems like a strong fit. The ticket talks about form completion for a new starter and the onboarding process, which aligns perfectly with this category. \n\nI initially thought about \"Administrative rights\" because there might be access issues, but the text is more focused on forms rather than access specifically. \n\nSo, \"HR Support\" fits the best! Now I\u2019ll format that in a JSON object as instructed: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
