This involves steps that appear to be IT-related, focusing on the inability to submit reports despite various attempts. Given the details, it's most appropriate to classify this under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access\" because it pertains to an error in a system not functioning correctly. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON with the designated category.**Determining category for IT issue**\n\nI need to find the right category for this IT ticket. It\u2019s not hardware, storage, purchase, or internal projects. Given that the user mentioned an Oracle error related to submitting an expense report, it could fit into \"Miscellaneous,\" especially since there's no clear indicator of admin rights or access issues. However, if there were permissions involved, \"Administrative rights\" might be more fitting. Ultimately, \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the best option for this general IT problem.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
