They mentioned, \u201ccannot submit with only workdays\u2026\u201d. So, I\u2019ll look through the categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, etc., to determine which category fits best. It seems to revolve around submitting an order due to entry totals, possibly tied to workdays and some errors displayed. I\u2019ll need to clarify if it\u2019s about the order form. It\u2019s a bit confusing!**Analyzing ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering options for categorizing this IT ticket, looking for clues. It might fit into \"Access\" if it's about form submissions requiring a login. The text mentions an \"application\" error and implies a business rule might be at play, suggesting possible \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nWith mentions of \"order,\" \"workdays,\" and \"mobile,\" I could also lean toward \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Purchase.\" The phrase \u201ccannot submit with only workdays Friday\u201d seems to hint at a scheduling constraint for submission. I need to sift through this carefully!**Clarifying ticket details**\n\nIt looks like there might be some repeated emphasis on \"workdays.\" I\u2019m interpreting \"hi leaving filled entries\" possibly as \"leaving fields filled.\" The phrase \"application rd\" could mean the application is not functioning properly, though that's still a bit unclear. The error seems to indicate a validation issue, hinting that each entry must meet a minimum requirement.\n\nGiven the context of a software/application submission error, I think it might best fit in the \"Miscellaneous\" category since there's no specific \"Software\" category available. I need to make a choice here!**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m narrowing down the best category for this ticket and pulling toward \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Purchase.\" The mention of order submission and minimum totals relates closely to purchasing. The \"cannot submit\" statement highlights an issue with a purchase form error, indicating it should lean toward \"Purchase.\" \n\nSince there's no \"Software\" option and it seems to involve an internal application, I'll categorize it as \"Purchase.\" Now, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object reflecting that category. Let's do this!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
