The defined categories include options like \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it's more about the software malfunction, I think the most fitting category would be \"Miscellaneous.\" The user seems to want to know what could be causing this annoying behavior of having to restart Excel constantly. It\u2019s clear I need to properly categorize this issue to address it effectively.**Finalizing the category for the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking this is a software issue, and since the allowed categories don\u2019t include \"Software\" or \"Excel,\" \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the best choice. \"Internal Project\" is more suited for specific internal tasks, and \"Administrative rights\" focuses on permissions, which aren\u2019t relevant here. I need to respond with a valid JSON object to fit the required format. So I\u2019ll create that as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Keeping it clear and straightforward is essential!**Deciding on the category for the ticket**\n\nThe system indicates that bullet lists are allowed, but I want to keep it minimal. I\u2019m thinking of categorizing the ticket as \"Access\" since it involves potential access rights related to Excel issues. However, I believe \"Miscellaneous\" is a safer choice overall. So, I will stick with the \"Miscellaneous\" category. I'll ensure to respond with exactly the JSON format required, keeping it clean and direct. No extra content needed!"
