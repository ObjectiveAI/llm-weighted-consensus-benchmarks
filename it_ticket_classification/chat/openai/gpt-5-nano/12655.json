The user wants to add someone to a \"security practice.\" So, it seems like they\u2019re requesting group membership or access to a security-related project. They mentioned \"pm member,\" which could relate to project management or scheduling. Since this involves granting access, I'll categorize it under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s request to \"add user to security practice\" indicates they want to grant access to a group or resource rather than admin rights. This fits under the category of Access. I need to return this in JSON format that follows the schema provided. So, the response will be a simple JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to keep it clean and to the point, with no extra commentary needed."
