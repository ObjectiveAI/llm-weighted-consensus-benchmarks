I have a list of categories to choose from, including Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nLooking at the ticket, it seems to be related to project management and possibly suggests it fits under \"Internal Project.\" However, the content is unclear, so it could also apply to Access or Miscellaneous. I\u2019ll output a JSON object with the chosen category.**Categorizing IT Ticket Content**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"testing pm\" multiple times, along with \"please add testing pm coaches\" and \"discipline lead.\" This may relate to roles in People Management, pointing toward HR. However, since it\u2019s an IT ticket, the suitable categories seem to be Access, Administrative rights, or Internal Project. The user might be requesting access to add \"pm coaches,\" indicating it leans toward \"Access.\" But, \"Administrative rights\" could apply too, given the permissions context. Overall, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
