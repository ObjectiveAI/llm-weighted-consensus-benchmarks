The schema includes categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket content requests adding a new member to a project. This could fit into either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it's about changing membership and permissions, it seems \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit. I\u2019ll go with that to classify the ticket correctly!**Classifying access requests**\n\nThe ticket implies granting access or adding a user to a project. I initially thought of classifying it under \"Access\" since it's about permissions. However, \"Administrative rights\" also fits because it includes membership and privileged access. I believe \"Access\" is a more general term, so I\u2019ll go with that. The required JSON format is {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This aligns with the schema, which specifies a top-level object with a string property for the category. The user\u2019s request might need clarification due to its ambiguity.**Determining category for project access**\n\nThe user requested to \"add a new member to project friday july pm,\" which has some extra noise in the message. I need to classify it as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given that the request is about adding a member, \"Access\" seems more appropriate. While the mention of \"project friday july pm\" could suggest an internal project, the core request is about access rights. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, keeping it minimal and to the point."
