The user's request suggests there's a trigger ID issue with forms submitted, emphasizing a bug in the survey system. I think categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" is appropriate since it doesn't relate to hardware but rather a customer care system problem.**Determining ticket categorization**\n\nI think it could be categorized as \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s part of a project, but honestly, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to fit best. To respond, I need to provide a JSON object with the correct category. The prompt specifies a schema that includes \"category\" with specific options, so I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. \n\nEven though we could add justification, it sounds like the user mainly wants the JSON. So I\u2019ll keep it simple and ensure capitalization is correct, then return just that JSON object."
