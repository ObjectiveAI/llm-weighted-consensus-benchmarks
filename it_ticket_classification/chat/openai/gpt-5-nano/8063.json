The user\u2019s message is a bit messy, but it seems to be a request for a new purchase order for a mini DisplayPort adapter, possibly for a mouse. They mention the importance of the mandatory receipts section. Ultimately, I have to decide how to categorize this ticket appropriately.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nThis IT ticket is about purchasing a mini DisplayPort adapter, which makes me consider whether to categorize it under \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" The request clearly relates to a new purchase order, including mentions of receipts and receiving items. I think the most fitting category is \"Purchase.\" I need to output a JSON object for this. The format is straightforward, so I\u2019ll present it as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} to fit the required specifications.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nThe task requires me to output a JSON object with a \"category\" field. The options are clear, and since the ticket is about a new purchase order for a mini DisplayPort adapter, the appropriate choice is \"Purchase.\" Although the prompt suggests we only need to provide the category, I\u2019ll stick with the required format for clarity. So, I'll respond simply with {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} and avoid any extra text to keep it straightforward."
