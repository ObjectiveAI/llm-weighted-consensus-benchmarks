The ticket briefly mentions onboarding and filling out a starter form, which makes me think it's related to HR processes. So, I'll consider categories like \"HR Support\" for onboarding forms. Other options like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project\" don't seem relevant. Ultimately, \"HR Support\" is likely the best fit for this situation!**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the IT ticket as \"HR Support\" since it relates to onboarding and filling out forms. Since the system requires a JSON object, I should respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. The guidelines specify a format for the \"category,\" so I'll keep it simple and just provide that JSON without any extra commentary. I did wonder if \"Administrative rights\" might be relevant if forms need access, but it seems \"HR Support\" fits best.**Deciding on response category**\n\nThe user's request is about filling out a starter form for new interns, which clearly falls under HR onboarding. While there\u2019s a possibility it could pertain to administrative rights, there's no mention of account access. So, I believe \"HR Support\" is indeed the appropriate category for this ticket. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format required, focusing solely on providing that without any additional commentary: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
