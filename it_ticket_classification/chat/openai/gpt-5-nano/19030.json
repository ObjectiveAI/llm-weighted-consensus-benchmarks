Now, which category fits better? \"Administrative rights\" seems more precise since it deals with changing admin rights, while \"Access\" is broader. The ticket involves ownership on a specific team. I feel \"Administrative rights\" is the best choice here. I\u2019ll propose a JSON object that specifies the category as \"Administrative rights.\"**Deciding on IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe prompt is asking me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to respond with a JSON-like format. The policy states I should use a category field with enumerated values. I\u2019m considering options like {\"category\":\"Access\"} or {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I believe \"Administrative rights\" is more precise since the request involves changing ownership and adding members due to someone leaving. The text isn\u2019t well punctuated, but I interpret its intent clearly.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
