They want to add \"vised pm\" to the menu, mark yellow costs, and manage codes in an accessible way. This aligns with features expected in a project management system. \"Internal Project\" seems like the most fitting category. While \"Miscellaneous\" is an option, I believe it\u2019s better to be specific. I'll structure the final answer in JSON format for clarity.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nI see that the prompt requires me to output a JSON object with a specific category field. It seems clear that the expected format is {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. While I've noted the structure of the properties in the previous instructions, it\u2019s important to follow the direct request to respond with just the category. \n\nI think keeping it simple is best here, so I\u2019ll just deliver the JSON without additional text or justification. Let\u2019s proceed with that clear output!"
