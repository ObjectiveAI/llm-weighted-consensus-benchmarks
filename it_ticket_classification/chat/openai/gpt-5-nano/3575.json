They mention \"temporary laptop allocation,\" which suggests it relates to hardware. The urgency and secure nature of the request further emphasize this. While it could also fit under \"Purchase,\" it seems more aligned with hardware provisioning. I think I'll go with \"Hardware\" for the category. So, I'll respond with a JSON object that shows: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI\u2019m focused on categorizing an IT ticket based on the provided prompt. The system specifies that my response needs to be formatted as JSON with a \"category\" key. The allowed categories include options like \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support.\" Since I\u2019ve determined the appropriate category is \"Hardware,\" I need to ensure my output matches the specific schema required. \n\nSo I'll provide the clean JSON output as follows: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Let's keep it straightforward and precise!"
