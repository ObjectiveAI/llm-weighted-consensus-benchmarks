It mentions \"closure codes\" and seems focused on \"tm neon\" as a system name, which might relate to software. I'm thinking it could fall under \"Administrative rights\" since it's discussing application close codes, but it also feels a bit like it could be \"Miscellaneous.\" I want to ensure I'm categorizing it correctly, perhaps focusing on software/application support.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI need to categorize this ticket, and there isn\u2019t a specific \"Software\" or \"IT Support\" category. It feels like it could fit under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" There\u2019s also \"Access,\" but that\u2019s usually about user access. Since the ticket discusses closure codes for the TM Neon application and suggests a software configuration change, I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous.\" It\u2019s not clearly hardware, and the user isn\u2019t specifically asking about permissions, so I think \"Miscellaneous\" makes the most sense.**Categorizing ticket content**\n\nThe ticket refers to \"application closure codes\" and a request to \"add default application closure codes.\" I'm wavering between \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" Generally, requests to modify software configurations might lean toward \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but the user isn\u2019t explicitly asking for admin permissions. Given the ambiguity, I think the safest bet is to categorize it as \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll format my response in JSON, like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
