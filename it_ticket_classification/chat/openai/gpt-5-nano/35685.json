It might fit into \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but it seems more related to \"Hardware\" because it involves audiovisual equipment in a meeting room. There\u2019s also the possibility of \"Access\" if they need access to a conferencing system, but \"Hardware\" feels right given the user is asking for configuration assistance. \n\nI\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any extra explanations."
