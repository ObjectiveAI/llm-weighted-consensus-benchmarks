The text mentions keeping path parameters and configuring redirects, so it doesn\u2019t seem to fit under hardware or HR support. While it touches on access, it might fit best under \"Miscellaneous.\" However, since it could involve internal configuration changes, \"Internal Project\" might also be appropriate. Each category needs careful consideration to ensure accuracy.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user's request seems to involve configuring a redirect rule that preserves path and query parameters, which definitely falls under a technical IT task. As I analyze the categories, \"Miscellaneous\" looks like a fit, but \"Internal Project\" feels more suited since it likely ties into an internal change. \"Access\" is about control rather than the URL itself, so I'll lean toward \"Internal Project\" given it's a request for redirect rules. I want to ensure I categorize accurately!**Outputting category JSON**\n\nThe user's phrase hints that they need a rule for implementing a redirect that preserves path and query parameters, which is more of a web or application infrastructure task. This leads me to classify it as an \"Internal Project\" rather than \"Administrative rights,\" since it doesn't relate to privileges. Now, I need to format the response correctly as a JSON object. I\u2019ll make sure to output it cleanly without any extra text. Here goes:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
