The options are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The issue involves a \"room finder\" displaying no information, which seems like a software issue. I wonder if it also relates to the calendar updates. I think the best fit might be \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Internal Project\" could work too. I'll format my response in JSON.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT ticket about the \"room finder\" tool. It might fall under \"Access\" if permissions are needed or \"Administrative Rights\" if the user lacks admin privileges. However, based on the description, the core issue seems to be a software feature not working properly. I think \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best choice, but \"Internal Project\" could also be relevant if it's an ongoing project. I'll go with \"Miscellaneous\" as a safe option.**Outputting IT category**\n\nThe task is to categorize the IT ticket into one of the specified categories. I think choosing \"Miscellaneous\" is a safe, generic option. I need to ensure that my output is in the correct format, which is a JSON object with a \"category\" key. So it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. It seems the user only wants the JSON object in response, so I\u2019ll focus on delivering that directly."
