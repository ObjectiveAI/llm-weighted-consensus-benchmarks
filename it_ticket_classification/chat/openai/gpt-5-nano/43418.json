The ticket mentions a selenium grid machine that was used for testing and accessing a hub. While it seems mainly about hardware\u2014with the focus on the machine\u2014I wonder if it could also be linked to access issues with the hub. However, given the primary concern is the machine, I'll categorize it as Hardware.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to select the most appropriate category for this ticket describing a \"machine issue\" with a selenium grid machine used for testing. It seems the problem might relate to hardware or the system itself. Since the main concern is about the machine, I'll go with \"Hardware.\" The user wants the output in a JSON format, so I\u2019ll respond simply with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} and ensure there\u2019s no extra commentary."
