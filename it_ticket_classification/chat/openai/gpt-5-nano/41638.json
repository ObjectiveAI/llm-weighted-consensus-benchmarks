The user mentions issues with notifications, fields, and urgent fixes. This makes me think it\u2019s likely HR-related since it involves leave codes and the payroll system. I see categories like \"HR Support\" and \"Access,\" but it fits best under \"HR Support\" given the context of annual leave and Oracle HRMS.**Analyzing IT ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s message concerns annual leave codes in Oracle, indicating they\u2019re seeking a resolution. It certainly fits within the HR context. However, given that it also mentions access to fields and the urgency regarding fixed issues, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this as \"HR Support.\" The mention of links and notifications suggests it\u2019s not primarily about access or administrative rights. So, it seems clear: \"HR Support\" is the best fit for this ticket.**Defining ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s message clearly mentions \"Oracle\" and talks about annual leave codes, which points to HR-related issues. I\u2019m recognizing that \u201cAccess\u201d typically relates to system rights, but this ticket is rooted in HR processes tied to an HRIS. Therefore, categorizing it as \"HR Support\" makes sense. \n\nI\u2019ll format my response as a JSON-like object, specifically: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}, since the focus is on HR processes, not on administrative rights or permissions. That\u2019s what the instructions require.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
