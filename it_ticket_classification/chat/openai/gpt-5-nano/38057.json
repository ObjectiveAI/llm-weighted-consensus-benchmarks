I\u2019ll focus on identifying these areas to determine the most appropriate category for the ticket.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing this IT ticket content, which seems to focus on a storage issue\u2014specifically insufficient space on a partition for a Windows upgrade. The user mentions backing up current folder drives and other documents, indicating it\u2019s a storage problem. While it could also relate to hardware, the clear emphasis on \u201cinsufficient space\u201d makes \u201cStorage\u201d the best category here.
