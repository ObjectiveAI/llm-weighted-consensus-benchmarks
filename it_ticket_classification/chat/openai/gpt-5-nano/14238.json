So, which one should I choose?**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's request mentions a \"re starter form contractor\" and an \"attached completed form,\" asking for help with the completion and noting a start date. While I considered options like \"Administrative rights\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" the best fit seems to be \"HR Support\" because it relates directly to onboarding a new contractor.
