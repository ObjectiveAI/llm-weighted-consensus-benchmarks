After restarting, it started working fine, indicating it\u2019s likely a hardware issue. However, it could also hint at a software or UI problem. Since the available categories don\u2019t include Software or Network, I\u2019ll have to choose between Hardware, Administrative rights, or Access. It seems that Hardware is the most fitting option.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe message mentions a ticket about a desktop PC where the screen was grayed out but worked fine after a restart. This suggests it\u2019s a hardware issue. The appropriate category here seems to be \"Hardware.\" I could consider \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but they don\u2019t fit as well, so I\u2019ll settle on \"Hardware.\" I need to format this as a JSON object: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}` because that aligns with the required format, and the system expects this structure. Let's go ahead and produce that!**Finalizing response format**\n\nI need to respond according to the instruction, which defines the category type expected in an object. The schema indeed suggests the structure, but my actual response should simply be the value: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. So, I'll make sure to stick to that and avoid any extra text. The final response needs to be precise and formatted correctly. I\u2019ll finalize it as: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}` without any fuss!"
