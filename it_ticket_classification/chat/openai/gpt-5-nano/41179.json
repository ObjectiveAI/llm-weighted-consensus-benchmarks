The text is quite jumbled, mentioning an error while trying to submit something. The available categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since it relates to submission issues, it might fit under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, if it pertains to an application issue, \"Internal Project\" might also be relevant. So, I need to choose carefully here!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe repeated mention of \"error when trying to submit\" indicates that the ticket is likely referring to a submission issue, possibly related to a form on a website. While I could consider categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" since it doesn't fit other categories like hardware or purchase, \"Access\" might be relevant if the error involves submission permissions. However, since the user hasn't mentioned access denial, I'll lean towards classifying it as \"Miscellaneous,\" while considering \"Internal Project\" if it relates to internal systems. I'll choose one category!**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI'm deciding to categorize the ticket as \"Miscellaneous\" because it's a general error related to form submission and doesn't specify any hardware or access issues. I could suggest the user provide more details like steps to reproduce the error or a timestamp, but since the instructions state to focus solely on categorization, I'll keep it simple. I\u2019ll output the category as a JSON object in the required format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Just sticking to what was asked!"
