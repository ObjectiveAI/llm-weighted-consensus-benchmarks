The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. \n\nConsidering the ticket mentions a purchase order, supplier, and installation log, it sounds like it fits best in the Purchase category. So, I'll prepare the output as a JSON object with \"Purchase\" as the category.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI see that the repeated phrases like \"purchase order requisition implemented,\" along with mentions of supplier, assignee, and installation, point towards it being about purchasing hardware, specifically a monitor. Even though it raised the possibility of being categorized as \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative Rights,\" I think \"Purchase\" is the best fit because of its focus on requisitions and attachments. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} without any additional text for clarity."
