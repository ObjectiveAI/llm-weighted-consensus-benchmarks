They mention a \"new machine\" and a request to \"add machine,\" which seems to fall under hardware provisioning, likely indicating the \"Hardware\" category. There\u2019s also mention of \"resources\" and \"senior developer,\" which points toward potential access rights or administrative requests, but it\u2019s not clear. Still, since \"new machine\" aligns best with hardware, I'll categorize it as Hardware.**Responding with JSON Category**\n\nI need to respond to categorize the IT ticket in a structured format, likely JSON. The user requires the category set to \"Hardware.\" From the context given, it's clear that this aligns with hardware provisioning due to the mention of a \"new machine.\" I\u2019ll format the answer as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I want to ensure there\u2019s no extra text since the focus is on providing a clear and concise response. Let\u2019s finalize and deliver that!"
