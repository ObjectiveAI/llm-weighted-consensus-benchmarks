The options available include categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the content of the string, I need to determine which category is the most suitable for their request. I\u2019ll carefully evaluate the terms and select the most appropriate category that fits the ticket. Let\u2019s see what fits best!**Parsing IT ticket content**\n\nI'm looking at the content provided: it revolves around an \"annual service recovery test\" and various keywords like \"restore,\" \"location,\" and \"template.\" This suggests it's related to a recovery test, potentially falling under documentation or procedures. \n\nEvaluating the categories, \"Internal Project\" seems fitting since it directly discusses testing procedures. While \"Administrative rights,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Storage\" could apply too, this content primarily focuses on internal processes, making \"Internal Project\" the most appropriate choice.**Categorizing IT ticket as JSON**\n\nI believe the best category for this ticket is \"Internal Project,\" since it's focused on testing restore processes, templates, and forms. Although \"Miscellaneous\" might be an option if it doesn\u2019t quite fit, \"Internal Project\" seems the most appropriate. \n\nNow, I need to respond with a JSON object. The format provided requires a \"category\" field containing a string from the specified enum. So, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and write: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
