However, since there's a lot of detail on folder permissions, I'm still confirming which category fits best.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nI'm considering that \"Administrator rights\" might be relevant since the note about the \"owner having the highest type permissions\" hints at that. However, the ticket primarily focuses on access control for folders. So, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" \n\nThe user requested a categorization for the IT ticket, and I need to output a JSON format. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to make sure it\u2019s valid JSON and follows the specified format correctly without any extra commentary."
