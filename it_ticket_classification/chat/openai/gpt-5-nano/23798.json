I\u2019ll represent this in a JSON-like object format for clarity, ensuring I capture the essential aspects of the user's request accurately.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket relates to IT tasks, specifically changing account statuses for interns becoming employees and closing accounts at the end of their internships. It could fit either the \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" categories, but since it's primarily about account changes and access rights, \"Access\" feels like the most suitable choice.
