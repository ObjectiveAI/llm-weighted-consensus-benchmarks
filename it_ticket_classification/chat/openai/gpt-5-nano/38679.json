I\u2019ll choose the \u201cAccess\u201d category for this ticket and prepare to output JSON that reflects this decision.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user provided a jumbled message indicating they\u2019re having urgent issues with their Active Directory (AD) login. Their password isn\u2019t working after a reset, and they can't access their account. While \"Administrative rights\" could be a possibility, this is mainly about access issues.
