It looks like the mention of AD accounts relates to access control and account management. The category \"Access\" seems to fit best here. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object, specifying the category field with \"Access.\" I should ensure there aren't any better fitting categories before I finalize it.**Finalizing the category response**\n\nThe ticket is about AD accounts, focusing on disabling or deleting accounts when clients leave, which falls under access management. While I briefly considered \"Administrative rights,\" it\u2019s clear now that \"Access\" is the correct choice. The instruction specifies responding with just the category in JSON format, so I\u2019ll stick to that. I'll ensure the formatting is accurate and simply output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra commentary needed; I'll keep it straightforward."
