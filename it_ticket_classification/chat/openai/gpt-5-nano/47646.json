It mentions a MacBook Pro charger that stopped working today, suggesting they received a pro charger on Monday. They also mention trying another charger and that a colleague had a similar issue last week but managed to recover. It seems clear that the main concern is about the malfunctioning charger, so I should put this into the appropriate category for better tracking.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories for the IT ticket: hardware, HR support, access, miscellaneous, storage, purchase, internal project, and administrative rights. Since this ticket is about a charger, it fits best under \"Hardware.\" While it could also be related to \"Purchase\" if they needed a new charger, the user mentions that the charger stopped working and they tried another one. So, I'll confidently categorize it as \"Hardware\" and respond with the JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Providing JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I just need to respond with minimal JSON. Based on the ticket details, it seems the appropriate category is \"Hardware,\" as it mentions a \"pro charger\" and the MacBook Pro that stopped working. Even though there could be situations for \"Power Delivery,\" I feel confident categorizing it as \"Hardware.\" So, here\u2019s my final response: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
