So, it seems it fits best under \"HR Support.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm dealing with a ticket about missing hours, reports, maternity leave, and the need to update personal records. It seems like it wouldn't fit hardware, storage, or purchase categories. Since this relates to HR processes\u2014like timely submissions and cascading updates due to maternity leave\u2014I believe the best category is \"HR Support.\" The user expects a JSON response, so I\u2019ll format it as requested, ensuring \"HR Support\" is clearly indicated in the category object.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
