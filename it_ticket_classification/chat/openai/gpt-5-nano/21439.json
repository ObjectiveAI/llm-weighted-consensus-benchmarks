Among the predefined categories, \"Internal Project\" seems the most appropriate since it revolves around changing the project manager. \"Administrative rights\" or \"HR Support\" might also fit, but \"Internal Project\" is my best guess here.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve got an IT ticket with the string: \"change project manager Tuesday February change hi change please working pm allocated code developer.\" This sounds like a request to change a project manager in a project management system, possibly involving a developer. I need to pick a category from the list provided: \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best since it relates to changing the project manager within a project. \"Administrative rights\" could work too, depending on whether admin access is involved.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket could relate to \"HR Support\" if it's about personnel changes, but given it's an IT ticket focused on project management, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" I need to provide a straightforward answer in the requested JSON format, without any extra explanation. The format will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. So, I'll stick to just that output. Let\u2019s ensure it\u2019s clear and free of additional commentary."
