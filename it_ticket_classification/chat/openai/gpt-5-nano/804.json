It makes sense to categorize it under \"HR Support\" since it relates to employee status and reporting. I'll go ahead with that choice!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI see the user provided details that mention \"annual leave,\" \"maternity,\" and related reporting, which indicate HR involvement. The potential categories include \"HR Support,\" which seems likely, but there's some ambiguity as it touches on IT concerns too. It could potentially fit under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" However, given the emphasis on employee leave and statuses, \"HR Support\" is definitely the best fit. I'll structure the response in the required JSON format to communicate that clearly!**Generating JSON output**\n\nThe system requires a JSON object with a specific field for the category. It looks like we need to adhere to the format and ensure the field name is exactly \"category\" with the value being one of the enumerated options. After confirming that \"HR Support\" is the right choice, I\u2019ll produce the output as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. The instructions indicate that I only need to provide this without additional justification, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do!"
