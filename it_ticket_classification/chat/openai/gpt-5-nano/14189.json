The references to \"new purchase,\" \"purchased router,\" and \"please log allocation\" suggest it should be categorized as a Purchase ticket. Other categories, like Hardware or Internal Project, also come to mind, but the focus appears to be on requesting new purchases and logging allocations. Overall, it seems best suited for the Purchase category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe content includes terms like \"new purchase\" and \"PO,\" indicating it's related to a Purchase Order. Since the user asked to categorize this IT ticket, I'll format my response as a JSON object. The schema requires a field called \"category\" with specific values. Based on the context, I\u2019ll assign \"Purchase\" to this field. \n\nThe final output will be a simple JSON object like so: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I don\u2019t think I need any additional explanations since the user requested a straightforward categorization.**Deciding on the category**\n\nI need to keep the response concise and stick to just the JSON output. I considered whether to classify it as \"Hardware\" since it mentions routers and switches, but the terms \"new purchase,\" \"PO,\" \"license,\" and \"allocation\" are definitely more aligned with \"Purchase.\" In IT ticket triage, requesting new equipment typically falls under the \"Purchase\" category. So, I\u2019ll finalize it as \"Purchase\" for clarity and accuracy."
