The provided string suggests it's about onboarding a new starter in Oracle, Bogot\u00e1. Keywords like \"complete form\" and \"senior developer joining\" hint at HR or Access provisioning. \n\nThe allowed categories are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since this is about onboarding, I think \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" could fit best. I'll narrow down to that for classification.**Classifying onboarding tickets**\n\nThe ticket includes keywords like \"new starter,\" \"completed form,\" and \"senior developer joining,\" indicating it's likely about onboarding and possibly access provisioning. The mention of \u201coracle bogota\u201d could relate to a department or system involved. Since the user wants me to categorize the ticket, I think \"Access\" fits best for providing system access to the new starter. While \"HR Support\" could also work for onboarding, \"Access\" seems more standard in this context for new hires.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe mention of \"new starter\" suggests this ticket is about onboarding a new employee, specifically a senior developer. I think categorizing it as \"Access\" makes sense because it involves creating accounts and granting permissions. Although there's also a category for \"Administrative rights,\" the ticket doesn\u2019t specifically ask for admin access. The reference to \"completed form\" hints it might relate to HR tasks. Given that, I\u2019ll stick with \"Access\" for this categorization and respond accordingly in JSON format.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nThe Output Formats section specifies that I need to return a JSON object with a \"category\" field. I plan to respond with something like {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to remember not to add any extra text\u2014just the JSON object. I should ensure this category is one of the allowed values, and since \"Access\" is included in the enumerated list, I\u2019m all set. So yes, my final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
