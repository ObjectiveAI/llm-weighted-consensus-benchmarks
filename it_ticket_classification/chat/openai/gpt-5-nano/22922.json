I'm considering terms like \"changing list\" and \"removed added,\" which might indicate updates to a contact or distribution list, potentially due on a Friday. I\u2019m curious about the specifics of what changes the user is looking for!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to determine the right category for this IT ticket about changing a distribution list. The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. A request to modify a distribution list could fit under \"Access\" or possibly \"Administrative rights\" since it might involve permissions. However, \"Miscellaneous\" could also work if it's more of a general request. Ultimately, it seems \"Access\" is the most fitting category here!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
