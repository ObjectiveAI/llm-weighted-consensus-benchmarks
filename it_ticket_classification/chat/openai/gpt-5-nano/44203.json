The categories don't quite fit, as it isn't about hardware, HR, access, storage, purchase, internal projects, or administrative rights. \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the best option for issues that don\u2019t fall clearly into other categories. If it's about process improvement, I could consider \"Internal Project,\" but I think \"Miscellaneous\" makes the most sense here.
