This seems to fall under an \"Internal Project,\" as it\u2019s related to dashboard development. However, since there are mentions of HR data, it could also be viewed as \"Miscellaneous\" or even relate to \"Administrative rights,\" particularly if it involves access issues. Overall, I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project.\"**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering whether to classify the ticket as \"HR Support\" because it involves candidates and grades. However, the main task seems to be creating a new graph and table for the \"obi\" dashboard related to withdrawn candidates, making it a development task. Since it's about modifying the dashboard, I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project.\" The user\u2019s request indicates this is a project-related task, so I\u2019ll go with that and finalize with a JSON-like category block: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Formatting Ticket Classification**\n\nI see the prompt instructs me to categorize the IT ticket with a specific JSON format. The schema outlines that I should include a \"category\" field with values limited to certain options. Based on my analysis, I will classify it as \"Internal Project.\" \n\nI realize I need to keep the response strictly to the JSON object without any extra commentary. So I'll format it correctly like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} and ensure that's all that shows up in my response."
