The available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The request seems to lean toward either \"Purchase\" for procuring them or \"Hardware\" as a general inquiry. Given that the user is asking to \"provide two monitors\" and mentions testing behavior, it seems most fitting to classify this ticket under \"Purchase.\" Although, \"Hardware\" could also be relevant.**Categorizing IT Ticket as JSON**\n\nI\u2019m tasked with categorizing an IT ticket and returning a JSON-like object that specifies a category. The provided schema requires me to select from defined options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. After analyzing the ticket's content, which requests two monitors, I think \"Purchase\" is fitting as it indicates a procurement request, though \"Hardware\" could also apply. However, I'll stick with \"Purchase\" for clarity, so I\u2019ll return: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
