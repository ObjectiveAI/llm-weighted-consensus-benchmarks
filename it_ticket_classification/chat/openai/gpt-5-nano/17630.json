The repeated mention of access cards and deprovisioning suggests it's primarily about Access or Administrative rights. While HR Support could also be relevant, the focus seems to point more toward Access because it deals with managing access cards. Given this context, I think Access is the most suitable category for this ticket.**Finalizing the JSON output**\n\nThe user needs me to categorize, and I've decided on \"Access\" as the appropriate category based on the IT ticket. I need to ensure the output is in the correct JSON format, specifically as `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. The instruction indicates I should follow the schema, so it\u2019s important to frame it accurately. I\u2019m confident that this matches the requirements, so I\u2019ll proceed with this output: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. That feels right!**Verifying ticket content**\n\nI'm double-checking the details from the ticket, which mentions a \"bulk leaver form for interns\" related to access cards. This clearly involves the deactivation of access cards for interns, confirming it falls under the Access category. Given this context, I feel confident in moving forward with my response. It clearly supports the decision to categorize this ticket as Access! So, let's go ahead and finalize my answer."
