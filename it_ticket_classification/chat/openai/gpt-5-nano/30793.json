The user asked for help categorizing the ticket, which involves Oracle and new project codes. The content includes requests for code creation and a mention of a functional design. Based on that, it seems to fit under \u201cInternal Project\u201d since it's related to a new project and codes. I'll prepare the JSON output accordingly!**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI'm weighing various categories for this IT ticket like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The mention of \"Oracle new project codes\" hints it's about creating codes for a new project, along with a \"functional design\" and a \"setup form.\" Since this leans towards an internal project, \"Internal Project\" seems fitting. It also touches on setup but isn't strictly about access rights, so I'll finalize the JSON output as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}**Formatting response in JSON**\n\nI need to respond with the correct JSON format based on the user's request to categorize the IT ticket. The format I'm working with is clear: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Although \"Oracle new project codes\" could be considered for \"Miscellaneous,\" it really aligns better with \"Internal Project\" since it relates to a specific project setup. So, I\u2019ll stick with that and provide the output without any extra text:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
