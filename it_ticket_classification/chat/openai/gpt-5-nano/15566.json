The input appears to be a corrupted log related to mobile phone requests and roaming issues. It seems to involve device management and activation. Given that it primarily focuses on mobile phones as physical devices, I think categorizing it under \"Hardware\" makes the most sense. While \"Administrative rights\" mentions permissions, that's not quite the fit here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m preparing to categorize this IT ticket. It might fit into \"Internal Project,\" but the content primarily focuses on provisioning hardware, especially mobile phones. The details mention things like \"device arrival,\" \"two devices free carrier number,\" and \"roaming.\" Considering this, the best category is \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the correct property: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.
