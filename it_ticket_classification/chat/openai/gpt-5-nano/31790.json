The ticket text is a bit jumbled, mentioning creating two sites for clients and attached templates. Based on the content, it seems to fit best in either \"Internal Project\" or \"Access.\" Since the user asked for a categorization, I need to select the most appropriate category.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe text is focused on creating two client sites, mentioning templates and details attached, which suggests it's part of a project. It seems like it could fit under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since there are no mentions of hardware, storage, purchases, or access rights, \"Internal Project\" looks like the best choice. I\u2019ll prepare a response with the necessary formatted category object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. The output needs to be easily parsed, so I\u2019ll keep it straightforward.**Formatting Category Response**\n\nThe format for my response should be a JSON object with a \"category\" field. I think we need to focus on delivering just the essential part: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. Since the instruction specifies to categorize the IT ticket, this response fits perfectly. I\u2019ll make sure not to add any extra text and that the quotation marks are correct. So, I\u2019m ready to provide the clean output that's needed!"
