The user\u2019s message is quite jumbled but suggests the computer stopped working and displayed an error. It seems like a hardware issue, so I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as \"Hardware\". However, there\u2019s ambiguity about whether it could be a software error too. It's tricky!**Categorizing IT issue**\n\nThe ticket indicates a problem with the phrase \"stopped working,\" which suggests it could be a hardware or software error. However, it feels like a hardware issue since it's about a non-functioning computer. The mention of \"error normal works fine\" could imply a temporary problem, yet I think it fits best under \"Hardware.\" Although \"Miscellaneous\" is an option for vague issues, the clarity points toward hardware. I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format for the category: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
