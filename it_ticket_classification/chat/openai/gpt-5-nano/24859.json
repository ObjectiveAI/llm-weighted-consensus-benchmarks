The message mentions \"connection to network\" and has terms like \"cable\" and \"patch,\" which hints at hardware or network connection issues. However, the available categories don\u2019t include \"Networking.\" I\u2019ll categorize this under \"Hardware.\" The output should be a JSON object with \"category\" as the key and \"Hardware\" as the chosen value. I\u2019ll make sure it follows the required schema.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI need to decide on a category for the IT ticket. It seems the closest matches are \"Hardware\" or \"Access,\" but based on the message, \"Hardware\" feels right since it talks about network and patch cables. The mention of \"engineer\" might hint at IT support but isn't relevant to the categories. Since the message's grammar is a bit jumbled, I should keep my response concise. I'll finalize it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Let\u2019s go with that!"
