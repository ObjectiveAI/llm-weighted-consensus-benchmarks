The user mentions issues related to scanning rules and disk access that slow down builds. It seems to revolve around enabling a scanning exclusion rule in an antivirus or IDE. Given the context and options, I suspect it best fits in the \"Internal Project\" category, considering it affects their development process. I'll ensure it's categorized correctly for efficient handling!**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt looks like this ticket is about disk I/O performance impacted by antivirus scanning, with mentions of \"thousands of files\" and wanting to \"add back rule\" for folder exclusions. I\u2019m debating whether to categorize it under \"Storage\" since it involves disk performance or \"Administrative Rights\" if rule modification is required. It might also fit as \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" depending on its context within projects. Still, \"Storage\" seems the best choice for this issue!**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket. \"Administrative rights\" might fit if they need to change security policies, but that's not the primary focus. \"Access\" could work for permission issues, but the main concern is performance affected by scanning and excluding folders. While \"Internal Project\" is more for development tasks, \"Miscellaneous\" feels too vague. Given everything, I believe \"Storage\" is the best fit. I need to ensure the response is in JSON format as expected!{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
