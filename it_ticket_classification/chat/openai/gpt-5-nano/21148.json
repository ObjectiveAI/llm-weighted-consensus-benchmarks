It\u2019s a bit terse, but it seems clear they want access to some planning system or documents. I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it under \"Access,\" since they\u2019re requesting information directly related to it. However, if permissions are necessary, \"Administrative rights\" could also fit. Both categories seem relevant, but \"Access\" feels like the primary choice here.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nThe IT ticket indicates the user \"wants to access planning\" and \"wants planning information.\" It seems to fit best in the \"Access\" category since it's primarily about accessing information. I could also think about \"Internal Project,\" but there's no specific project mentioned, just a reference to a planning time on \"Friday in February PM.\" The output needs to be a JSON-like structure, which I\u2019ll format correctly as {\"category\":\"Access\"}, ensuring the capitalization matches. I\u2019m confident \"Access\" is the right choice here!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
