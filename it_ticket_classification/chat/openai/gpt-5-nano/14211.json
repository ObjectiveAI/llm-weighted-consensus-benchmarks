The message is kind of garbled, and it might relate to closing queries or tickets. I\u2019m considering options from the categories provided, but it's unclear. It could potentially fit into \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d but I'm not entirely sure since the message isn\u2019t straightforward. I need to clarify what they mean by \"query close\u201d and \u201cold closed deleted.\u201d**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, and I'm considering options like \"Storage\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The content mentions \"queries,\" \"closed,\" and \"deleted,\" which raises questions. It might touch on storage since it's about deleted items, but it also refers to daily receipt of old closed items. I could lean toward \"Internal Project,\" but it\u2019s vague. The phrase \"these old closed deleted\" could signify issues with data retention or IT processes, suggesting maybe \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" as well.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nGiven the ambiguity of the ticket, I think it\u2019s best to choose \"Miscellaneous\" as a default. However, \"Internal Project\" could fit if it's about an internal ticket. The user\u2019s message seems to mention \"queries\" that are closing, which might indicate they're receiving queries daily. They could be looking to close and delete old ones. Since old closed items may take up storage, \"Storage\" could apply too. Ultimately, I'll stick with \"Miscellaneous\" and output the JSON object with that category."
