It seems to involve multiple aspects like access and administrative rights. Given the context, it fits best into the \"Internal Project\" category. However, I might also consider \"Access\" if it specifically pertains to permissions, but the project focus feels stronger.**Deciding Ticket Category**\n\nI'm trying to determine the best category for this IT ticket. The phrase \"set up a redirect\" can refer to a network or URL redirect, while \"rolling out\" suggests a project context. Though \"Access\" could apply if it pertains to user access, I think \"Internal Project\" is the strongest fit since it relates to an updated app rollout. \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a fallback option, but \"Internal Project\" definitely aligns with ongoing project deliverables better.**Determining the Category Format**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket properly, and it doesn't fit into hardware, storage, purchase, HR, access, or administrative rights. So, \"Internal Project\" is the best fit, while \"Miscellaneous\" is a possibility too. \"Set up a redirect\" isn\u2019t related to access, but \"rolling out\" suggests a deployment within an internal project. The output should follow the format of a JSON object, looking like this: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. I want to make sure I'm meeting the requirements!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
