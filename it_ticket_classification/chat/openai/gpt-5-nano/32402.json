However, the emphasis on \"new starter hardware allocation\" indicates the primary focus is on hardware, especially with the high importance noted. While \"Access\" is a consideration, it seems best to categorize this ticket primarily under \"Hardware,\" since providing hardware for a new starter is the main point.**Deciding category format**\n\nI think I should categorize the ticket as \"Hardware\" since it\u2019s specifically about hardware allocation. Although there's an \"Access\" category, this ticket focuses on providing hardware for a new starter. The instructions say to pick a single category. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON format, ensuring it follows the required structure. I'll keep it concise and only include the necessary information: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This way, I\u2019m sticking to the guidelines and presenting a clear answer!"
