Given this focus on personnel and HR processes, I think it fits best under the \"HR Support\" category based on the details presented in the request.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the IT ticket, which focuses on HR processes like time reporting and updating personnel records. Given the mention of reports, time submissions, and maternity leave, \"HR Support\" seems to be the most suitable category. While \"Administrative rights\" might fit, it doesn\u2019t perfectly align with the context. Since the user might expect a structured response, I should format it as a JSON object, something like: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I could also add a brief note if needed!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
