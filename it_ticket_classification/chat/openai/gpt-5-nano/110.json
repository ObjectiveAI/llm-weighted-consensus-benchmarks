They're asking to \"change job titles\" and mention \"engineer\" repeatedly. I think this is likely related to HR, so it could fit into either \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since the content doesn't indicate hardware, access, or purchases, it seems safest to categorize it as \"HR Support.\" I'll follow the provided schema for a clear response!**Categorizing HR changes**\n\nThis is clearly about HR changes to job titles. The category \"HR Support\" is listed in the allowed options, so that\u2019s what I should go with. The user\u2019s ticket mentions changing job titles multiple times, which confirms it\u2019s an HR function. I need to respond with a properly formatted JSON object, specifically: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It\u2019s essential to follow the instructions clearly without adding any extra commentary!**Delivering category object**\n\nI'm focusing on providing just the category object as requested. The user wants a straightforward response without any extra details. So, I'll prepare to deliver that cleanly and clearly. This means I'll format the response precisely as a JSON object, adhering to the instructions. I might be tempted to add commentary, but I\u2019ll resist and stick to giving only the necessary information. Let's move forward with that!"
