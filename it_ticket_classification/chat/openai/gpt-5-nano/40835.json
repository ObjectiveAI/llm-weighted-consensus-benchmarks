It seems to be related to timekeeping and possibly an access card, but I'm unsure where to put it. I'll have to go with \"HR Support\" for now, considering the context.**Determining the category**\n\nI\u2019m considering which category to assign to the ticket, weighing options like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project.\" \"HR Support\" seems the best fit since it\u2019s related to time cards, leave, and employee status. The user mentions a \"time card error,\" \"maternity leave,\" and \"annual leave,\" which strengthens the HR connection. So, I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support\" for the category. The response should be a JSON object, formatted as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Focusing on the output**\n\nI need to keep things straightforward and avoid any extra text in my response. The key is to output just the category without additional analysis. Based on the available categories, I'll confirm that the answer will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nThis way, it\u2019s clear and formatted correctly in JSON. I\u2019ll make sure not to include anything else!"
