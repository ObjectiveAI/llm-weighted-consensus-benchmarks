It doesn't seem to relate to hardware at all. I\u2019m realizing this ticket might belong to \"HR Support,\" but it\u2019s quite messy!**Identifying HR ticket category**\n\nI see mentions of \"direct reports,\" \"line manager,\" \"leave,\" \"maternity,\" and the need to submit weekly attendance for approval. This information is definitely HR-related and focuses on processes like attendance and managing leave. The categories available include \"HR Support\" along with others like \"Administrative rights.\" Given all these clues, it seems clear that the right category is \"HR Support.\" So, I\u2019ll prepare the JSON output accordingly: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
