The allowed categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. This content doesn't really fit those other categories, so I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since it relates to the survey process within the organization. It seems to align best with internal initiatives.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on the content about a survey, feedback, deadlines, and winner selection. It's not about technical support but rather survey management. I believe \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since it relates to an IT process.
