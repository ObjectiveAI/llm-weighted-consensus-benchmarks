I\u2019ve considered options like \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d and \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d but \u201cPurchase\u201d seems to fit best. This content raises security flags with terms like \u201cblacklist\u201d and \u201cdeposit,\u201d which could hint at phishing or money laundering. I\u2019ve decided to categorize it as \u201cPurchase\u201d for IT ticketing. I'll format the output in JSON since we need to follow the specified schema. So, it\u2019ll be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
