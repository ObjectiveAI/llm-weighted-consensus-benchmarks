I have to extract the category from what the user submitted, but it sounds a bit chaotic. The goal is to output it in a JSON format, indicating the selected category. I\u2019ll carefully review the user content to properly classify it!**Analyzing access issues**\n\nThis seems to revolve around connecting to internal links and navigating the approval process discussed last Thursday. There's a mention of trouble with accessing links, and the request involves escalating the issue to fix this connection problem. It looks like there are also issues with submitting approvals, as they don\u2019t seem to save properly. Overall, I need to address the user's concerns regarding access to links and the approval process!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis IT ticket seems to be about Access permissions, likely related to Administrative rights. It focuses on approval processes and accessing internal links via a remote link. I think the best category here is \"Access.\" So, I should respond with a JSON object like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI need to stick to the instructions and make sure the formatting is correct. It's just that category JSON object that I need to provide, nothing extra!"
