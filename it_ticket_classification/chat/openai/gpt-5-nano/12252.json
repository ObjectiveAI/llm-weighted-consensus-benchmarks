I wonder if \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" could apply too, but it\u2019s mainly about provisioning user access. I'll go ahead and classify this ticket as \"Access.\" Maybe suggesting some subpoints could be useful as well!**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize this IT ticket, and it seems I need to provide a JSON object with a \"category\" field. Based on the provided schema, I'll confirm the category as \"Access\" since it fits best. I\u2019ll ensure the response is in proper JSON format, like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. There's a thought that \"External mail users\" could fit under \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Access\" feels more appropriate overall. I\u2019ll stick to that and respond!"
