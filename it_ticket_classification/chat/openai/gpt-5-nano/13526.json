It mentions things like \"new purchase po,\" \"license,\" and \"software license,\" which points towards procurement. Terms like \"log allocation\" and \"mandatory receipts\" also stand out. So, I'm thinking the most fitting category would be \"Purchase,\" as it focuses on software licenses and ordering. I need to ensure I classify this correctly based on the provided categories.**Submitting IT ticket category**\n\nI've decided that the most appropriate category for this IT ticket is \"Purchase,\" since it's related to purchasing and licenses. Administrative rights and Internal Project don\u2019t fit here. The system requires a JSON format response that specifies the category field. The format I need looks like: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll ensure that the formatting is correct and stick to the requirement without adding extra commentary. Finally, I'll submit the JSON object as requested."
