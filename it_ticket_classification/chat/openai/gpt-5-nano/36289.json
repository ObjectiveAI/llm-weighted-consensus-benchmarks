I need to clarify what aspect they're struggling with.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's question about \"design lead\" might refer to a department or role. Since they're mentioning difficulties like \"cannot enter,\" it seems fitting to categorize this as \"Access.\" I'll respond in the requested format, which is likely a JSON object containing the category key. Following the instructions, the output should be:  \n{\"category\":\"Access\"}  \nI just need to ensure the case matches the expected values in the system, which include \"Access\" among others.**Returning category in JSON**\n\nThe user's text is a bit unclear, but I don't need to ask for clarification unless something is truly ambiguous. Since the task is simply to categorize the ticket, I\u2019ll focus on delivering the required output. I should ensure it\u2019s only the JSON object without any extra text. The format will be:  \n{\"category\":\"Access\"}  \nI just need to make sure it\u2019s valid JSON. Alright, let\u2019s deliver that!"
