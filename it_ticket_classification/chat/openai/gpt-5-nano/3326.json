The ticket mentions a request for a laptop replacement due to its age and heavy weight affecting performance. This user\u2019s needs clearly align with the Hardware category. It looks like they want a newer, lighter laptop, ready for their return after the holiday in December.**Categorizing Hardware Request**\n\nI need to handle a hardware replacement request about replacing a laptop with a newer, lighter model while maintaining the same screen size. There is also mention of workstation replacement, which is unclear but still relevant. It seems this is fundamentally about a hardware upgrade. I should categorize this under Hardware, and since the system expects a JSON format, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. No need for additional explanation, just deliver the category in that format."
