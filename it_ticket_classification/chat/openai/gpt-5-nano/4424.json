The allowed categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nSince it hints at updating blacklists, it could relate to security, but that's not an option. I\u2019m thinking the best fit might be \"Miscellaneous,\" since the details are quite vague. \"Access\" seems possible, but I\u2019m not convinced.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe blacklist update might relate to email filtering or network access control. Although it could suggest \"Administrative rights,\" it doesn\u2019t fit perfectly. If the content is ambiguous, I think \"Miscellaneous\" works best as a default. There are also categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Storage,\" but \"attached items received\" suggests that it's not a hardware issue. \n\nI'll propose categorizing this as \"Miscellaneous\" and respond with the expected JSON format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
