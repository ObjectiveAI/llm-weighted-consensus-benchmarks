It could fall under \"HR Support\" since it's related to new starter forms, but it might also fit \"Access\" if it involves granting access. There's no explicit category for \"Onboarding,\" which makes it tricky, so I'll consider the nuances carefully.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the phrases in the ticket, like \"new starter form\" and \"completed form,\" which suggest it\u2019s about assisting a new joiner. The logical category option seems to be \"HR Support,\" since that's associated with onboarding. However, considering the available IT ticket categories, \"Access\" may apply because it relates to user accounts. \"Administrative rights\" wouldn't fit here, as it's for permissions. Ultimately, \"HR Support\" feels like the best choice for categorizing this ticket appropriately.**Formatting category response**\n\nThe prompt requires me to provide a category in a specific JSON format. I see the enumeration allows for options like \"HR Support\" and \"Access.\" The user's request about a \"new starter form\" indicates that it\u2019s related to HR, so \"HR Support\" is the best fit. I just need to ensure I respond with the right structure. So, I\u2019ll format it as: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}, keeping it clear and concise, just as specified."
