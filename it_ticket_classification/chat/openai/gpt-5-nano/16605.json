The ticket talks about Nexus Repository Manager and mentions aspects like releases, migration, and assistance with moving instances. Given this, it seems to point toward an internal project, especially with the signature from an \u201cext design lead.\u201d While \"Internal Project\" feels right, I wonder if \"Administrative rights\" might apply since there are migration requests mentioned. There's a lot to consider here!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe request mentions \"migrate,\" \"submit via requests,\" and \"resources scarce,\" which suggests it could be a plea for assistance with migration. While \"administrative rights\" and access could be potential considerations, the ticket primarily focuses on migrating the Nexus Repository Manager and moving instances. Given that it isn\u2019t about hardware, HR, storage, or purchases, I think \"Internal Project\" fits best. I\u2019ll format it as a JSON object: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}` for clarity!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
