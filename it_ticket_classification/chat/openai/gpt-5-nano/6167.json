It mentions things like \"oracle po flow\" and \"head requisition conf split,\" which might indicate it's related to purchasing or a Purchase Order flow. The best category to assign seems to be \"Purchase,\" but if it's still unclear, I might also consider \"Miscellaneous.\" Let\u2019s analyze what fits best!**Analyzing user feedback message**\n\nOkay, I\u2019m parsing the user\u2019s message that includes repetitive phrases like \"feedback oracle po flow\" and \"head requisition conf.\" It seems related to Purchase Order flow, which suggests it\u2019s about procurement. The request to \"please log\" hints at access issues, while \"split screen\" could point to a hardware issue, perhaps with a monitor. I need to choose between categories like \"Purchase,\" \"Access,\" or \"Hardware\" to find the best fit. Let\u2019s figure this out!**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt looks like the ticket probably deals with \"Oracle PO flow,\" which relates to the purchasing process. I think the \"Purchase\" category would fit best since it concerns PO flow. Alternatively, if it's about modifying this process, it could be \"Internal Project.\" However, following typical IT service desk categories, \"Purchase\" seems ideal. I need to format the response as a JSON object, specifically: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I'll ensure this aligns with the required output format.**Preparing final output**\n\nThe instructions say I need to present the final answer in a specific \"category\" format with just a single field. So, I\u2019ll prepare to output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I considered adding a brief note, but the user simply requested the category without extra text. To keep it straightforward, I\u2019ll just return: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. This way, there\u2019s no confusion, and everything aligns with what\u2019s needed!"
