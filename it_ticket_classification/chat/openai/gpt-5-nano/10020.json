The text suggests it concerns permissions or configurations in the system. I\u2019m considering options like \"Administrative rights\" due to its connection to ownership and rights. \"Access\" could also fit, but it seems less appropriate. It doesn't seem like an \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" situation, so I think \"Administrative rights\" is the best category for this ticket.**Choosing the right category**\n\nThe phrase \"owner field mandatory\" indicates it's about permissions related to assignments, which confuses me a bit. It sounds like this ticket concerns enforcing a business rule, making the assignee owner field mandatory for a system change. Among the provided categories, \"Administrative rights\" fits best since it involves permission and role changes. \"Access\" seems less relevant, as it doesn\u2019t talk about granting user access. Therefore, I\u2019ll select \"Administrative rights\" and prepare a JSON response to reflect that choice.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
