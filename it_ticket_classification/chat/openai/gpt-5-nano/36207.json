The ticket mentions challenges adding a customer and being unable to find them in the system, which affects reports. It might fit into either \"Access\" because it involves not being able to access customer data, or \"Miscellaneous\" since it doesn't neatly fall into specific categories. Given the context of adding and finding a customer, \"Miscellaneous\" might work best.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on the user's message. The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Administrative Rights, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Miscellaneous. The user mentions they are unable to find a customer, which suggests this could be an \"Access\" issue since it relates to system or data access. Although it might fit \"Internal Project,\" it\u2019s not explicitly stated. Therefore, I\u2019ll classify it as \"Access\" and prepare the JSON output accordingly. \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
