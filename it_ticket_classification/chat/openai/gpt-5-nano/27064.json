The message discusses a new starter, interns becoming employees, and changes to account credentials, which all point toward access issues. While HR Support could also be relevant due to mentions of new starters and job offers, it mainly involves IT actions related to user provisioning and access to mailboxes. Therefore, the most fitting category seems to be \"Access.\"**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the category options, and \"Access\" seems to fit best based on the keywords like \"new starter,\" \"interns accepted job offer,\" and \"change accounts credentials.\" \"HR Support\" could apply, but it mainly deals with access provisioning tasks. \"Administrative rights\" doesn't seem relevant since the text focuses on account credentials rather than admin rights. According to the instructions, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It looks like I just need to provide the category like that.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
