The text points toward corrections related to timesheets, particularly for Friday PM. It also mentions someone being out on free days, which seems HR-related. So, the most fitting category here is HR Support, as it's clearly tied to payroll and timesheet issues.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI'm considering that administrative rights could be relevant if editing timesheets were involved. However, the user mentions \"enter empty days\" and \"he currently out his free days,\" which leans more toward HR-related issues. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as HR Support. The response needs to follow a JSON structure, specifically saying: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll ensure it's formatted correctly, with no extra commentary. Let's go with that!"
