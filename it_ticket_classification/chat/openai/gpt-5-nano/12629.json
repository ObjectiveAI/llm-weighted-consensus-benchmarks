The user's message seems to involve maintenance works, change requests, downtime, and invitations. It's tricky because it doesn't clearly fit into any specific category. I\u2019m thinking it could go under \u201cInternal Project\u201d or possibly \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d as it doesn't concern hardware, storage, or administrative privileges directly. I'll have to make a careful choice!**Categorizing IT tickets further**\n\nI\u2019m still wrestling with how to categorize this IT ticket. It could go under \"Administrative rights\" if it's about granting access during maintenance. I see that the message discusses maintenance works, change requests, and downtime, pointing towards either \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The mention of \"raising CR\" definitely signals a change request, but it's a bit chaotic! I think I'll lean toward categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" since it relates mainly to scheduled maintenance works and change requests.**Generating category JSON**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" After parsing keywords like \"notification maintenance,\" \"change request,\" \"downtime,\" and \"planned works,\" it's clear this is about an IT maintenance activity but not requesting access or hardware. It seems like \"Internal Project\" fits best since it reflects the nature of the work. I\u2019ll return the category in the required JSON-like format to keep it clean and straightforward. Here\u2019s how it\u2019ll look:  \n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
