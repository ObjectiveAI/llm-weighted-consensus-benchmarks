The text mentions \"network cable,\" \"connection,\" and \"access to specific resources,\" which suggests it's related to hardware and network issues. Given this context, it seems most appropriate to categorize the ticket under \"Hardware.\" It looks like this ticket is all about ensuring the right hardware is set up and that access is secured, aligning well with the \"Hardware\" category.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"check cable need for connection\" and \"you need access specific resources.\" The focus is clearly on the network cable, so I'll categorize it under \"Hardware.\" The instructions indicate I should respond with a JSON object containing a \"category\" field. So my output will be {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Although the guidance primarily says to provide the category, I feel it might be helpful to add a brief justification, but I'll stick to the requirement of just delivering the category object.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
