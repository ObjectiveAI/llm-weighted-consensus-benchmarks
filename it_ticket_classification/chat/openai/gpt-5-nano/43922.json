It mentions problems with keys being tampered, which suggests a hardware issue. While I wonder if \"Access\" might fit if it's about keyboard functionality, the primary concern seems to be hardware, so I'll go with that category. Although I considered \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" they don't apply here. Overall, it looks like \"Hardware\" is the right choice!**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond to categorize an IT ticket. The response should be a JSON object with the format given in the prompt. It specifies a \"category\" schema, so I\u2019ll provide it as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It's essential to keep it in the required format without any added explanations or commentary. The user didn't ask for anything but the category, so I\u2019ll make sure my output is precise. Alright, so my final answer will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
