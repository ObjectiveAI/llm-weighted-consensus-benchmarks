It seems most fitting to label it as \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Access,\" especially if it relates to sending access. I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous\" for the JSON output.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the best category for this IT ticket. I considered \u201cInternal Project,\u201d which doesn\u2019t seem likely, and \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d which isn't relevant either. \"Miscellaneous\" seems to fit best. There isn't a specific \"Network/Email\" category available, so I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous.\" The instructions say to respond with just the category in JSON format. So, I\u2019ll output the final category object as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} without any extra text."
