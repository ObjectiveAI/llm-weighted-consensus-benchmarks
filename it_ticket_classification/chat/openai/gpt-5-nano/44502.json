The ticket mentions \"Maven not found,\" which suggests it's likely related to software in a CI/CD or build environment. It also references a \"demo server\" and \"views view job console.\" So, I need to decide which category fits best, possibly leaning toward Internal Project or Miscellaneous.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket considering various options: \"Internal Project\" seems fitting since it likely addresses an internal issue related to Maven in a demo server. \"Miscellaneous\" is too broad, while \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" don\u2019t apply. Given that I need to provide a JSON format, I'll output {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, as that's the most relevant category from the defined list. Let's ensure it matches the required schema!**Choosing the Correct JSON Category**\n\nI'm considering whether \"Miscellaneous\" might fit better, but since the ticket specifies \"Maven not found,\" I find \"Internal Project\" to be more suitable. It doesn't relate to hardware, so I'll go with \"Internal Project.\" Now, I just need to ensure that the final output is in valid JSON format without any extra text. I\u2019ll prepare to output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Yes, that seems perfect!"
