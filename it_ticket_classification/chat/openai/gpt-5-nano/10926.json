The system allows for categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given that they're asking about onboarding documents and a Confluence space, categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access\" could fit. It looks like the best choice might be \"Internal Project.\"**Determining category for access**\n\nThis request is about accessing a software tool, Confluence, and centers on creating a new space. While \"Access\" seems fitting, the user hasn\u2019t explicitly asked for access rights. It sounds more like an IT provisioning request connected to the \"docs fill details\" for an internship, which might imply a need for \"Administrative rights.\" However, \"Internal Project\" stands out as the best fit since it's an internal IT project. I want to choose the category that suits it best.**Parsing user request**\n\nI\u2019m looking to parse the user's request about creating a new Confluence space. It sounds like they want to set up a space named \"Wednesday\" or related to an internship program, possibly with documentation filled out by a senior consultant. This seems to fit under the category of an \"Internal Project.\" \n\nI need to respond with a JSON-like object that specifies the category, aligning with the given schema. So, my output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
