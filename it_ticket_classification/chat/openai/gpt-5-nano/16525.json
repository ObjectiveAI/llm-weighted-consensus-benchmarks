It involves access to HR folders, permissions for viewing items within a shared drive, and background check permissions. There are terms like \"shared drive,\" \"view contents,\" and \"owner folder,\" which hint that it's more about access control. Since the request is for permission to access HR folders, I think it fits best under \"Access\" rather than \"Administrative rights\" or \"Storage.\"**Categorizing User Request**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to categorize this request. It involves modifying permissions or ownership, and while \"Administrative rights\" suggests admin privileges, the user is mainly asking to view items in a shared drive. They mention not being able to view certain folders, and it looks like the focus is on granting access to HR background checks. So, it seems best to label this request as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll respond in the required JSON format for the system.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
