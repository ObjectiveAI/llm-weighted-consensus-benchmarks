I'll go with \"Access.\"**Deciding ticket category**\n\nThe user\u2019s mention of \"access\" and \"view libraries\" clearly points to access rights regarding file libraries. The potential categories could be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it specifically asks for access for \"people managers,\" it really aligns more with the \"Access\" category. I want to craft a concise JSON response that simply includes the category \"Access,\" following the prompt\u2019s required format. I\u2019ll ensure it meets the JSON schema and is clearly presented.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nOkay, the schema defines a category object type, and it clearly specifies that it expects a JSON formatted object. So, I need to output: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. That's straightforward! I'll ensure that it's formatted exactly right, without any extra text. Keeping it clean is essential to meet the requirements. This approach should be effective, allowing the user to understand the category clearly. Let's go ahead with this precise output!"
