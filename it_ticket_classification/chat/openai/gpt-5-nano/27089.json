The message is brief but indicates they want to activate tracking. Considering the options, it could fall under \"Internal Project\" since it's project-related. However, it might also fit into \"Access\" if it requires permission to track time. The best choice here seems to be \"Internal Project\" since that aligns most closely with their request.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe phrase \"activate tracking\" suggests they might need permission to enable a feature, which could connect to \"Administrative rights.\" However, since they're mentioning \"time tracking for project,\" it aligns more with \"Internal Project\" in typical IT service management. Given the options, \"Internal Project\" stands out as the best fit. I think I should respond in the required JSON format with the category specified as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nThis should meet their expectations!**Delivering IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe allowed values for the ticket categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the context, I've decided to go with \"Internal Project.\" Now, I\u2019ll respond with a neat JSON-like object reflecting this choice:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nThat's it\u2014no extra text needed! Let's get this delivered."
