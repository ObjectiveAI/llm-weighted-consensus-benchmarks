The user mentioned an issue related to a license, probably for IntelliJ IDEA. The message discusses a \"license issue\" and additional licenses for increased demand. This sounds like it fits well under the \"Purchase\" category since it's about licensing, but it could also be linked to \"Access\" due to software accessibility considerations.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI need to classify the IT ticket properly. The user mentioned a \"license issue,\" which suggests it\u2019s primarily related to purchasing licenses for software, so \"Purchase\" seems to be the best fit. While there's a mention of \"Access,\" this isn\u2019t about user rights; it\u2019s specifically about licensing, emphasizing procurement. I\u2019ve reviewed the categories and determined that \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d and \"Internal Project\" aren't applicable here. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON format specifying the \"Purchase\" category.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nThe instruction is to categorize the IT ticket using a specific JSON schema provided. I need to produce a JSON object that identifies the appropriate category. Since we've determined \"Purchase\" is the fitting category, I'll format it properly, ensuring it matches the required structure. The expected output is straightforward: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I want to keep it simple as instructed, avoiding any excessive formatting but sticking to this clean JSON format. That's all I need to provide!"
