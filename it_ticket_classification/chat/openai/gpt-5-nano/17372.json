The ticket mentions \"oracle time sheet,\" \"Wednesday PM,\" and requests help with understanding logged time and approved levels. It seems related to HR, as it discusses timesheet and permissions. \n\nI\u2019m considering categories like \"HR Support\" for general assistance, \"Administrative rights\" for approval, or \"Access\" for permissions. The mention of \"approved level\" leans me towards \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Let's go with that.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI'm looking at the categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket focuses on timekeeping, specifically an Oracle timesheet and approvals, which makes it HR-related. \"Administrative rights\" relates to user privileges, while \"Access\" is more about system entry. Given it connects to HR and payroll, it seems best to categorize it as \"HR Support.\" The final output will be in JSON format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
