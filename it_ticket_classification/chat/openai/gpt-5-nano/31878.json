The user's message mentions a \"new starter\" and refers to an \"administrator\" and \"AD,\" likely meaning Active Directory. It seems like they\u2019re requesting help with onboarding, which suggests a ticket about user account creation or access. The relevant categories include \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" I'll map this ticket to the most fitting category based on its content related to onboarding and account access.**Categorizing as Access**\n\nI think \"Access\" is the right category for this ticket because it's related to a new employee and mentions creating a user account, likely involving Active Directory (AD). The format I need to follow is a JSON-like object that looks like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and make sure there are no extra spaces or commentary. The final output should be exactly: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'm ready to provide that!"
