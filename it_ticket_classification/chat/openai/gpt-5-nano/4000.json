The potential categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. After parsing, it seems the best fit is the \"Purchase\" category, since it revolves around procurement and logging the allocation after receiving the item. I'll format this information into a JSON object for the output.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether this IT ticket could be categorized as \"Hardware\" since it mentions a solid state drive, but it mainly focuses on the purchase order process and logging allocations. Given the details about receipts and allocations, \"Purchase\" seems to be the best fit. While \"Storage\" is relevant to the solid drive, the request is more about purchasing than troubleshooting. I need to output this in the correct JSON format for the category.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
