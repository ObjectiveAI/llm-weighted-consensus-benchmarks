They want to include a device under a user name link, add the allocation, and are requesting mandatory receipts for the order. Overall, it sounds like this falls under the \"Purchase\" category pretty clearly!**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nThe user is referencing a \"mandatory receipts section\" related to an order, which gives a clue about the nature of the request. It seems to revolve around a purchase order or procurement for hardware devices, specifically mentioning a \"device\" and \"allocation.\" \n\nGiven these details, I believe the ticket should be categorized as \"Purchase\" because it strongly indicates procurement. I'll provide a justification that includes the focus on mandatory processes. So, my response will be in the format of a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Finalizing Ticket Response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category for the IT ticket. The instruction confirms that it should be just the category, and the options provided include various types like \"Purchase\" and \"Hardware.\" Since this ticket pertains to procurement, I\u2019ll choose \"Purchase.\" \n\nMy response will be formatted as follows: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I think that should work perfectly! Let's deliver this response now."
