The user mentions issues with viewing and refreshing reports, suggesting it may relate to a software module or migration process. Since it doesn\u2019t directly reference access or permissions, I\u2019m leaning towards classes like \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Hardware.\" However, the focus on viewing and report issues might suggest it's more closely related to internal software functions. I\u2019ll finalize the category after considering these details.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket hints at issues with refreshing reports and mentions \"starting when trying to refresh,\" which could suggest it's related to storage, although that seems less likely. I\u2019ve got to look at the categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the phrases used, I think \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best since it involves software issues linked to a recent migration, indicating a potential bug in an ongoing project.**Finalizing the JSON Response**\n\nI\u2019m ready to categorize the ticket as \"Internal Project.\" I need to format the response correctly as a JSON object. Following the schema, it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I shouldn't add any extra text\u2014just the JSON object itself. The instructions are clear about outputting the category, so I\u2019m making sure everything is appropriately formatted before delivering it. I\u2019ll provide the final response as specified!"
