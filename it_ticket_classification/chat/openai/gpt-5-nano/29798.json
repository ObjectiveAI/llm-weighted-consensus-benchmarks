Given the context, \"HR Support\" could be the best choice since it revolves around employee leavers.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe ticket includes terms like \"leaver panic,\" \"hardware retrieval,\" and \"leaver form,\" which suggest it's related to resignations and accessing user accounts (Active Directory). It leans towards the \"Access\" category since it's primarily about deprovisioning access for departing employees rather than hardware retrieval. \n\nI'll respond with a JSON object that categorizes it as \"Access.\" The format requires that I make sure it aligns with their specified structure. Here we go! \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Finalizing the category format**\n\nThe instruction asks me to categorize the IT ticket clearly, which means I need to output a category value within a specific JSON schema. According to the provided format, I\u2019ve confirmed that the correct response is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI\u2019ve also reflected on the context, noting keywords like \"leaver forms\" and \"ad accounts,\" which reinforce that \"Access\" is indeed the right choice. The user has asked for straightforward categorization, so I\u2019ll stick to the required JSON format without any additional commentary."
