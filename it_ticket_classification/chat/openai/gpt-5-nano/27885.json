It does feel quite messy, and the repetition makes it hard to sift through. I\u2019ll look for the main points in this report and figure out how best to structure or simplify it for clarity. Let's work on making it understandable!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe category options I have are hardware, HR support, access, miscellaneous, storage, purchase, internal project, and administrative rights. The user\u2019s IT ticket discusses a backup storage monthly disk report, focusing on disks, counts, and bad sectors. Given that, the most relevant category would be \"Storage\" or possibly \"Hardware.\" However, since \"Storage\" fits best, I need to respond with the correct format. Here\u2019s how it should look: {\"category\": \"Storage\"}, but it needs to follow the specified JSON-like structure for the system.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
