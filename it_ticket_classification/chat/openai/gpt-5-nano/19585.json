This suggests it's related to onboarding. The categories provided include HR Support and Access. Given that \"new starter\" hints at employee onboarding, \"HR Support\" seems appropriate. There's also something about filling out forms, which supports that conclusion. While \"Access\" could be relevant for account setup, it seems clearer to go with \"HR Support\" for this ticket.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI understand that sometimes onboarding involves \"Access\" for login credentials, but since my role is just to categorize, I'll focus on the content. The message mentions \"new starter,\" suggesting this is related to HR matters, specifically onboarding. While \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant, it isn\u2019t explicitly mentioned. Therefore, categorizing this ticket as \"HR Support\" feels most appropriate. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} to align with the required structure.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
