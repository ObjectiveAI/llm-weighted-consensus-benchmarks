The user message I\u2019m interpreting mentions issues around timesheet submission where they\u2019ve submitted a sheet but received confusion about its status. It seems they're frustrated since their submission has either vanished or been duplicated. This indicates it\u2019s related to HR Support, specifically concerning timesheet submission issues. It\u2019s important to clarify and address this problem effectively.**Interpreting timesheet issue**\n\nThe user\u2019s message about their timesheet submission is quite garbled, but I think they're saying they submitted a sheet around Monday morning but received unclear feedback. It looks like the submission got lost, leading to confusion and possibly requiring them to enter their timesheet multiple times. This definitely sounds like a problem with the timesheet system. I should categorize this issue under \"HR Support,\" as it relates to payroll and human resources.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThis IT ticket is definitely about timesheet submission, so \"HR Support\" seems like the right category because it relates directly to payroll issues. While \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" may apply if there are permission problems, it feels like \"HR Support\" is the best fit here. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object that simply states this category: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Keeping it concise is important, as the instructions specify to provide just the category.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
