The term \"Internal Project\" is fitting since the ticket discusses a scoring system issue within IT. The wording seems more relevant than \"Miscellaneous,\" which feels too vague. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" because it pertains to an internal scoring system for surveys. I should prepare the response in JSON format as instructed, including a brief justification for clarity.**Formatting Category Output**\n\nI\u2019m considering the required output format for the category object, which specifies a \"category\" field in JSON. The instruction clearly outlines the structure, so I need to ensure it fits the schema provided. The category value must come from the allowed list. I\u2019ll make sure to create a straightforward JSON object without any extra text or commentary, just like I should. So, the output will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let's go with that!"
