The ticket mentions things like \"photo display nap client success story,\" \"thumbnail image,\" and \"clearing cache,\" which suggests it's about a web development issue. I\u2019m leaning toward \"Internal Project\" since it concerns a web part and display features. \"Miscellaneous\" could also fit but might be too vague. I plan to produce JSON with the category as \"Internal Project\" later.**Reviewing ticket content**\n\nI should double-check the content of this ticket. It mentions a \u201cphoto display nap client success story,\u201d and the need to check if a thumbnail image is added. The user asks for help due to an ongoing display issue, despite clearing the cache weeks ago. It seems like the request is focused on fixing a display or thumbnail problem in a web part connected to this \"nap client success story.\" I should clarify \"nap\" as it might refer to something specific.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket concerns a content management system dealing with photo and thumbnail errors, so it's definitely an internal project. I\u2019ll categorize it as \u201cInternal Project.\u201d The instructions require a JSON-like output, which means I need to produce a properly formatted JSON object. Since the user only asked for the category without a need for explanation, I\u2019ll keep it concise. I\u2019ll finalize it as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
