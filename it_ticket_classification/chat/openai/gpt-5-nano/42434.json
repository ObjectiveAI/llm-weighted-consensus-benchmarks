The options I have are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. I need to read through the ticket and determine which category it fits best. It's essential to ensure accurate categorization for effective handling of the request. Let's move forward with this!**Examining IT ticket content**\n\nI need to examine the messy content of the IT ticket provided. It mentions issues with receiving inquiries and suggests raising an incident. There are indications of space issues and a server status problem. The message also refers to an undeliverable case and requests a deeper investigation after a restart. Overall, it seems to contain several urgent concerns related to server capacity and inquiry handling. I need to categorize this accurately for effective resolution!**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like the issue centers around storage space, with mentions of a full server poll and undeliverable inquiries. I need to categorize this, and \"Storage\" seems like the best fit due to these space concerns. While \"Infrastructure/Hardware\" or \"Internal Project\" could apply, \"Storage\" aligns closely with the specific issues presented. \n\nI\u2019ll need to respond in JSON format as well. The correct format will be: \n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I'll ensure this is structured properly!**Crafting JSON response**\n\nThe instructions indicate I need to format the response according to a specific schema, which appears to specify how the category should be outputted. I should aim to provide a clean JSON object indicating the category, which in this case is \"Storage.\" \n\nSince the grader will check this, I want to ensure I stick strictly to the format without adding extra text. So the response should simply be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. Let\u2019s keep it straightforward and clear!"
