The user provided a detailed text about an issue involving script modifications for map locations in Glasgow and other cities. It mentions high impact and the need for further investigation, as well as a backlog of prior issues. Overall, the ticket appears to relate to internal projects or access rights for location management.**Classifying IT Ticket Issues**\n\nI'm working on categorizing an IT ticket related to a bug in a script that deals with map locations and names. It seems to involve issues with multiple location fields, but it doesn't clearly fall under hardware, HR, or storage categories. \"Internal Project\" looks like the best fit since it relates to a software issue and mentions backlogs and escalations. However, \"Miscellaneous\" might be an option if it doesn't match neatly. The user specifically asked to categorize the ticket, so I'll go with \"Internal Project.\"**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond using a JSON object according to the specified format. The relevant category for this ticket is \"Internal Project,\" since that's the best fit for the issue at hand. I'll create a simple JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. The user just wants the category, so I won't include extra text. It\u2019s important to ensure my response matches the required schema without any confusion. Let\u2019s get that ready!**Verifying Category Format**\n\nI just realized that the category needs to match the exact case as specified in the enum. The phrase should be \"Internal Project\" with an uppercase \"P.\" I\u2019ll ensure my response reflects that correctly. So, I will return the JSON object exactly as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It\u2019s important to be precise in these details, so let\u2019s go ahead and finalize that!"
