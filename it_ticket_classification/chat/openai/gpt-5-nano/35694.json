However, I do consider that \"Access\" might also fit, but \"HR Support\" feels more direct and appropriate.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize this IT ticket, and I\u2019ve decided on the category \"HR Support.\" That seems most appropriate. Now, I'll respond with the simple JSON object:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nIt's clear and straightforward, which fits well with the task at hand. There's no need for additional explanation or details since the instruction is just to provide the category. Let\u2019s proceed with this response!"
