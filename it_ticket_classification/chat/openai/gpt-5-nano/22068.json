The focus is definitely on \"installation,\" likely for hardware. Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t a \"Maintenance\" category, so \"Hardware\" seems the best fit. \u201cInternal Project\u201d could apply if it\u2019s about scheduling, but since the user wants to categorize the ticket, I think going with \"Hardware\" is the safest option while keeping it simple!**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nIt looks like the user wants to set up an installation for Friday, possibly involving replacement and assigning it to a queue for an engineer. This suggests a project that could fit under \"Internal Project.\" However, since they\u2019re categorizing rather than proposing actions, I think \"Hardware\" fits best, especially since installation suggests it concerns physical equipment. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object as required: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} in the specified format. This should work perfectly!**Finalizing the output format**\n\nThe problem says to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" and I see there\u2019s a JSON schema snippet, indicating I need to respond with a JSON object containing \"category\": \"<chosen category>\". The required format is clear with a heading of \"## category\" followed by a JSON object that includes a property \"category\" aligned with the allowed categories. I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" since installation involves hardware. My response will simply be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I'll keep it straightforward!"
