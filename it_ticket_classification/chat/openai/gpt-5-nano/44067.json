They mentioned network issues and that the computers are down, but the ticket's details are a bit garbled. Since there\u2019s no specific category for \"Network\" or \"IT Support,\" I'm considering \"Miscellaneous\" as a possible fit since it encompasses a broad range of issues. I might also think about whether \"Hardware\" could apply since it does involve connection problems. Ultimately, it\u2019s tricky to decide with the provided categories.**Deciding category for IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants the engineer to investigate, and I\u2019m trying to pick the best category. It seems like \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit since it's a general IT issue. \"Hardware\" might work too since computers are involved, but it\u2019s specifically about a network issue, which doesn't align directly with hardware failure. So, I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll format the response in a JSON-like structure to meet the requirement.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
