It sounds like it mostly relates to hardware, as they're mentioning RAM, physical installation, and other related terms. \n\nGiven the categories I have, I think \"Hardware\" seems to fit best, even though it also mentions disk memory, which could suggest \"Storage.\" Ultimately, I would lean toward categorizing it as \"Hardware.\"**Finalizing category output**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize this IT ticket as \"Hardware.\" While \"Storage\" could apply if it referenced disk drives, RAM is specifically considered memory, not storage. Plus, the ticket mentions \"RAM and installation,\" indicating hardware procurement and installation. \n\nFollowing the given format, I\u2019ll output the category in a JSON-like object as requested: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This seems to be the best match! So, I\u2019ll stick with the category for clarity.**Providing the category object**\n\nI realized that the \"type\":\"object\" wrapper is meant for API validation, but for typical tasks, we usually just need the category string. Since the instruction states to \"Output a category object\" along with the schema, I should follow that strictly and provide the complete JSON object. \n\nSo, I'm set to output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Keeping it concise and straightforward is the plan, and I\u2019ll make sure not to add any extra text."
