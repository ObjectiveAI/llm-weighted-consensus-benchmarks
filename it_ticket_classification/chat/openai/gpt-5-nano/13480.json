It doesn't really fit into hardware, storage, or purchase categories. The focus on new members suggests it's mainly about provisioning accounts.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIn the IT ticket taxonomy, the \"Access\" category seems the most fitting. Here\u2019s my reasoning: the \"Administrative rights\" category is more focused on specific permissions, but if the user is asking to \"add colleagues,\" they likely want to include them in a group or distribution list, which is an access request. Since the phrase doesn\u2019t specify a rights level, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" as a general category. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That should work!"
