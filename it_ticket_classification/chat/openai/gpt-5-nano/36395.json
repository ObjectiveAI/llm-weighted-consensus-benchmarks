The mention of \"expenditure type client marketing\" strongly indicates a problem related to purchasing. Since the core issue is about adding an expenditure type for a purchase requisition, I'll categorize it as \"Purchase.\" It might also fit \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Purchase\" is the most accurate option. I\u2019ll include a brief justification in my response.**Outputting category structure**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize this IT ticket and format it as a JSON-like object. The allowed category options are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given that the issue involves not being able to add an expenditure type for a purchase requisition, the best category is \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll format my response correctly with a JSON object like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I'll make sure to stick to the requirements.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
