They mention something about \"head back up approvers\" on Tuesday, which might mean reinstating backup approvers. It also hints at some blockages causing delays in their processes, and they want this handled urgently. Given these details, the ticket could fall under categories like Access, Administrative rights, or maybe IT Project Management. The requester signs off as \"programme portfolio officer.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket from the options provided: [Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights]. The message mentions implementing backup approvers to avoid blockages in the approval workflow, which points toward Access or Administrative rights categories. Since it relates to granting rights, \"Administrative rights\" seems most fitting. However, \"Access\" is also a valid option because it deals with approvers and their access rights, focusing on process improvement.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the ticket as \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d It fits best since the user is requesting access rights for backup approvers. I need to respond in the specified JSON-like format, which requires me to give a precise category without additional commentary since that\u2019s what the user requested. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. This keeps everything clean and in line with the user's request!{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
