The relevant categories could be \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or maybe \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It looks like the best fit would be \"Access.\" Let's go with that.**Determining the right ticket category**\n\nThe ticket is about the \"default view unavailable\" in ServiceNow and requests for help with access. I think I should categorize it as \"Access.\" The mention of \"administrative rights\" also relates to user access levels, which ties back to this issue. Although the problem seems linked to the UI or ServiceNow itself, \"Access\" clearly aligns with the user's request for assistance. I'll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That fits the required schema perfectly!**Finalizing the response**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to keep my response simple and direct. I\u2019ll just say: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. No need for extra explanations or details. Sometimes, it\u2019s better to stick to the essentials, and this gets the point across clearly. This way, I can provide exactly what the user needs without any unnecessary fluff. Keeping it concise should be effective! So, I'll finalize it as is."
