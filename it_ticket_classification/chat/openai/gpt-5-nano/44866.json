It's clear that it falls under the Access category since the user directly requests to restore access. Alternatively, Administrative rights might apply if access rights are in question, but given the user\u2019s clear ask, Access is the best fit. I'll format this as a JSON object for the response.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
