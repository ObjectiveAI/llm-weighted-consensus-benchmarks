The ticket mentions rejected inquiries and trouble with card submissions, including reasons for rejection. It seems to focus on submission statuses, which might imply it's related to either payment cards or access cards. So, I'll need to assess whether it fits better under Access or Miscellaneous before finalizing the category.**Assessing Ticket Categories**\n\nThe phrases like \"country,\" \"card status rejected,\" and \"submitted cards statuses explained\" suggest this ticket is asking why card submissions have been rejected and what corrective actions to take. It seems to be related to cards in a system\u2014possibly payment or access cards. The ticket may fit under \"Access\" since it discusses access card statuses, but \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant if approvals are involved. I need to decide the best category from these options.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user has mentioned phrases like \"submitted cards,\" \"card status rejected,\" and \"please action submit cards.\" It's clear they want to know why submissions were rejected and what corrective actions to take. This suggests they\u2019re dealing with an access provisioning tool for employee access badges. Therefore, it seems most fitting under the \"Access\" category. I\u2019ll prepare the required JSON format output with the category string specified. Let's finalize that as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
