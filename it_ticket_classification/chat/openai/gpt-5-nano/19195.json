The best categories seem to be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but since it\u2019s likely about changing user permissions, I think \"Access\" is the broader choice. I\u2019ll respond with JSON that categorizes it as \"Access.\"**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON-like object that includes a category field based on the user's request. The correct format is: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This matches the schema's requirements, which clearly indicates the necessity for a top-level type object. I shouldn\u2019t add extra keys, since the instruction focuses solely on the category. The user expects just the category in this format, so I will keep it simple and direct.**Delivering JSON response**\n\nI need to provide only the required JSON object without any extra commentary. The format should be: {\"category\":\"Access\"} based on the user's request. While \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" could be considered, the phrase \"employee locator permissions\" suggests it's about access rather than specific admin rights. Since the request is somewhat vague and doesn't specify the system, \"Access\" is appropriately general. So, I\u2019ll stick to that and deliver it simply."
