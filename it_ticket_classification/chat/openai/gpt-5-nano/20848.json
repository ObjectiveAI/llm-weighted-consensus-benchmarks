They mention adding users urgently, suggesting it might fall under Access. Although \u201cadministrative rights\u201d is included, it\u2019s not clear if that fits. While HR Support could apply due to the internship mention, it also seems more focused on access for technical evaluators. So, I'll lean toward categorizing this under Access.**Determining category for the request**\n\nThe request is about adding technical evaluators, likely needing permissions. It seems they want to add evaluators to some platform, which makes sense as an IT support task under Access. The \u201candroid coordinator\u201d role also suggests user accounts might be created. While it could relate to an internal project for the internship program, the urgency and wording imply it best fits within the Access category to allow those evaluators into the system.**Creating JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that indicates the category for the IT ticket as per the instructions provided. Based on the request, \u201cAccess\u201d seems like the most accurate choice. The system's guidance suggests I should return this in the proper format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. \n\nI\u2019ll double-check if there are other possible categories; \"Internal Project\" could fit due to the internship mention, but since the primary focus is on adding evaluators, Access is the best option. So I'll stick with my initial impulse and respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
