This relates to access control or security, so the categories I should consider are \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll determine which fits best based on that context.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how blocking addresses usually falls under network security, but since the allowed categories don\u2019t list \"Security\" or \"Network,\" \"Access\" seems like the best fit for managing user or IP address access. It could also be \"Administrative rights\" if admin privileges are needed to change the blacklist, but I\u2019m categorizing, not performing the task. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI need to be clear that this task focuses specifically on providing the category field. Since it has to be in JSON format, I should output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. \n\nNow, I'm hesitating a bit about whether \"Administrative rights\" might fit since the user is asking to block and add addresses, which could imply a need for admin privileges. However, since the task is about changing access restrictions, I'll stick with \"Access\" as the most straightforward choice. So, the final output is {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
