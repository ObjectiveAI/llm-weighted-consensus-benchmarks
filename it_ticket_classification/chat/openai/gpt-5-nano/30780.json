Administrative rights may come into play if they need permission. \"Storage\" doesn\u2019t quite fit either. Okay, let's categorize this thoughtfully!**Categorizing the project ticket**\n\nI\u2019m deciding between \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous\" for a ticket about the advocate program's display in the browser. It makes sense to go with \"Internal Project\" since it relates to an internal program. \n\nI need to provide a response in JSON format, specifically structured with the category field. They want just the category, which will look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Alright, let\u2019s keep it simple and direct with no extra text!"
