I\u2019m considering whether it fits best under \"Administrative rights\" since changing roles typically relates to access rights. \"Internal Project\" could be another option, but the mention of \"pm\" could also refer to policy management. There\u2019s some ambiguity, but I\u2019m leaning toward administrative rights.**Classifying Ticket Categories**\n\nThe term \"approver\" suggests it's related to an approval workflow, which makes \"Administrative rights\" a suitable category since it involves changing roles and permissions. There\u2019s also \"Access,\" which might apply, but \"HR Support\" seems less likely since this is an IT ticket. The mention of \"leave\" could indicate a leave of absence, but I'm focusing on the project manager change for February. So, leaning towards \"Administrative rights\" or possibly \"Access,\" depending on the details around user permissions.**Selecting Category for Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m leaning toward classifying the ticket as either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" Since the user mentioned \"changed roles\" and \"approver,\" it seems to be about access changes, which usually fit in these categories. \"Administrative rights\" specifically addresses permission and role adjustments, making it a strong candidate. Even though \"Access\" is broader, I think I'll categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" for accuracy. In the end, it seems like a solid choice. I'll output a JSON object with this category now.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
