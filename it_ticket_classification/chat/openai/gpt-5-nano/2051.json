The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and a few others, but not Networking or Software. Given all this, I think categorizing it as \"Hardware\" makes the most sense. I'll structure my response as a JSON-like object.**Structuring IT ticket categorization**\n\nI've got a task where I need to categorize an IT ticket based on the user's prompt, which included: \"Categorize this IT Ticket:\" along with a jumbled text. The channel specifies a structured response in JSON format. The categories set include Hardware, HR Support, and others. Since \"connector\" is repeated, it suggests it's a hardware component, so I'll go ahead and categorize it as \"Hardware.\" The response will be a straightforward JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
