Since the content is about ensuring accurate records for weekly hours and preventing bogus entries, I can confidently categorize this under \"HR Support.\" \n\nSo I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object indicating that the category is \"HR Support\" without any extra text, like: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
