The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It looks like I'll have to output the chosen category in JSON format as a string. \n\nNow, I'll parse the ticket, but it seems like it\u2019s a bit messy and not straightforward. I\u2019ll need to find which category fits best.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m noticing some phrases in the ticket: \"new purchase po,\" \"purchase order,\" and \"battery backed write battery pack assembly.\" They suggest a request related to logging a new purchase order for a hardware item, specifically a battery pack assembly. This could imply a category related to Purchasing, especially since \"new purchase\" and \"po\" point strongly to that. The mention of logging installation hints at asset management, but I'd classify this primarily as a Purchase category.**Responding in JSON Format**\n\nI need to make sure that I respond with the correct JSON format for the category. The required format specifies that it should be a category object, so I\u2019ll frame it as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I want to ensure the text is a single JSON object that includes the \"category\" field, as that's what the system expects. While I briefly considered if \"Administrative rights\" could apply, it's clear that only \"Purchase\" fits. Time to deliver!"
