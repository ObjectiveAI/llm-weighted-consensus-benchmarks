The text mentions completing a form for joining, which might relate to onboarding. I\u2019m considering categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it deals with onboarding a new employee, \"HR Support\" seems most fitting. However, it could also involve \"Administrative rights\" if it pertains to account setup.**Classifying IT tickets**\n\nWhen classifying IT tickets, onboarding tasks can involve both HR and IT. Here, \"HR Support\" seems fitting for a new joiner, especially since the user asks for help with completing a form for joining. However, there's a chance it might relate to \"Administrative rights\" if it involves account creation. Since the request is focused on onboarding rather than explicit access, I think the best fit is \"HR Support.\" I should respond with a JSON-like category format.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
