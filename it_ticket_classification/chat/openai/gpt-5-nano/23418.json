I should output a JSON object with the chosen category, since that\u2019s what the user needs to classify the ticket properly.**Analyzing IT ticket category**\n\nI see the user\u2019s message might involve access and urgency related to wireless installations. There's definitely a mention of needing \"access,\" possibly indicating user permissions.\n\nI could categorize this under \"Access,\" especially given the urgency stated. However, the mention of \"two additional wireless\" suggests it could also fall under \"Hardware\" regarding access points, or perhaps \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s more about a broader project. I\u2019ll carefully consider these options and decide on the most appropriate category.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
