The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the context around provisioning equipment for onboarding, \"Hardware\" seems to fit best. Access might apply if it involves granting access, but \"Hardware\" really captures the essence of the ticket.**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt looks like the primary focus is on hardware provisioning since the ticket mentions a \"new starter\" and \"tower\", likely referring to a computer. Although it touches on HR support with \"change her status\" and the relevant form, this is fundamentally an IT ticket. Out of the categories listed, \"Hardware\" is the best fit for this context. I\u2019ll format the response in a JSON-like format, stating: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"} to reflect the focus on provisioning equipment for onboarding.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nThe prompt specifies that I need to categorize the IT ticket using a defined JSON schema, meaning I should only include a JSON object with the \"category\" field. Since the ticket hints at new starter equipment, I'll set the value to \"Hardware.\" There's no need for extra text in the response. I'll finalize my output as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"} \n\nThis fits perfectly with the instructions!"
