The user is experiencing a validation error with their timecard after an old record was deleted. They're trying to re-enter their hours worked since Thursday and are seeing a holiday issue, along with an attached ID image. This seems to relate to HR and payroll systems. It might fall under \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" I'm not entirely sure yet.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories for the IT ticket: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. This issue relates to timecard submission, which likely falls under HR Support or possibly Administrative rights. Since it's a validation error connected to the payroll system, I think \"HR Support\" is the best choice. I\u2019ll categorize it accordingly, so my final output will be a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
