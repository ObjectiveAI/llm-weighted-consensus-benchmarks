They're trying to access Fusion and have indicated it's a high-importance issue. The terms \"connection has timed out\" and \"help please\" clarify that the problem relates to access, so the best category would be \"Access.\" I'll ensure the output is structured correctly as a JSON object with the specified format including the category field.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the given schema, which lays out the format I need to follow. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object listing the category as \u201cAccess\u201d since the ticket is about a connection timeout and access issue to Fusion. I notice the prompt instructs me to categorize the IT ticket, and while the priority is mentioned as high, it doesn\u2019t need to be included in the category. My final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access.\"} Alright, let's deliver that!"
