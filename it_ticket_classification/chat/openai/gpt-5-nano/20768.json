They also mention logging the installation and keeping receipts. This seems closely tied to purchasing and tracking items. So, the best categories to consider are \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware,\" though \"Administrative rights\" might fit too, but it feels less relevant. Overall, I'm leaning towards \"Purchase.\"**Deciding on ticket categories**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket, and while it mentions \"log installation,\" I need to consider the overall context. The ticket includes terms like \"new purchase,\" \"purchase order,\" and \"receipts,\" indicating a focus on procurement. Given that it's about the installation of hardware, it seems the best category to choose is \"Purchase.\" Even though some might argue for \"Hardware\" since it involves physical devices like a keyboard and mouse, the focus on procurement makes \"Purchase\" more fitting.**Finalizing category response**\n\nAlright, since the ticket emphasizes purchase orders and receipts, I\u2019m deciding that \u201cPurchase\u201d is the most fitting category. I need to format my response correctly as a JSON object: it has to match the specific schema provided. The schema includes a category field with the allowed categories, and I\u2019ll ensure the value is spelled exactly as \u201cPurchase.\u201d I'll deliver that properly formatted JSON object without extra commentary. Here\u2019s the output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
