The text mentions \"job title change,\" \"senior engineer,\" and similar phrases. I see possible categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Internal Project,\" depending on the specifics. Given the focus on job title changes and HR data, it seems that \"HR Support\" might be the most suitable category. I'll frame my response in a JSON-like format to outline this clearly.**Finalizing the IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing this ticket as \"HR Support\" since it deals with grade and job title changes in a labor contract. While \"Administrative rights\" is an option, it isn\u2019t relevant here. So, the user\u2019s request is clear: I need to return a JSON object with the category as a string. After confirming that \"HR Support\" matches the enumerated values, I\u2019ll just output this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Let's proceed!"
