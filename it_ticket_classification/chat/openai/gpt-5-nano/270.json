I\u2019m looking through categories like HR Support and Administrative rights. Since it involves onboarding and forms, it seems more aligned with \"HR Support\" rather than \"Administrative rights.\" The other categories, like Access and Hardware, don\u2019t fit this context.**Categorizing IT support ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"new starter\" and \"attached starter forms,\" which points clearly to HR Support since it relates to onboarding documents and contracts. Although \"Administrative\" sounds close, it isn\u2019t the right category; \"Administrative rights\" is, but that\u2019s not applicable here. Therefore, the best fit is \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object formatted properly as {\"category\": \"HR Support\"} because that aligns with what the user asked for in categorizing the IT ticket."
