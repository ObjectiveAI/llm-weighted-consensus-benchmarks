The text mentions extending a proxy production and connections, which hints that it\u2019s related to production setup. \n\nI have these categories to choose from: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the content, it seems like it could fit under \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" I need to pick the most appropriate one.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"production setup today\" and \"connecting cards,\" which makes it challenging to categorize. It could fall under \"Access\" or \"Internal Project.\" The text leads me to think it best fits \"Internal Project,\" as it sounds like a deployment task related to a secure production environment.\n\nHowever, if the user needs permissions, \"Administrative rights\" might also apply. I should respond with my chosen category and reason, potentially outputting a JSON object for clarity.**Crafting JSON response**\n\nThe instruction specifies that I need to produce a JSON object with a category value from a defined schema. The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.\n\nGiven the context of the ticket, I believe \"Internal Project\" is the best fit, as it relates to a deployment task, but \"Access\" might work too due to \"connecting cards.\" \n\nI\u2019ll prepare the JSON as plain text without extra information to meet the expected format. Here\u2019s what I'll output:  \n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
