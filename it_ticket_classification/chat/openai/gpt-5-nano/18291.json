The ticket content suggests they\u2019re looking for justification for purchasing a plug adapter for an upcoming trip. I\u2019m thinking it might fit either \"Purchase\" since they need approval for buying it or \"Hardware\" since it\u2019s about a physical item. Ultimately, I'll lean towards \"Purchase\" as the category to align with their request.**Categorizing IT request**\n\nThe user is asking for justification to purchase a plug adapter for their trip, which means I need to categorize this ticket. It definitely falls under \"Purchase\" since they're looking for approval to buy it. While \"Hardware\" could fit because it refers to a physical item, the emphasis on justification leads me to prioritize \"Purchase.\" I'll prepare the response in the required JSON format without any extra text or whitespace. So, my output will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
