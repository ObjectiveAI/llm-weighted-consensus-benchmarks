The phrase \"cannot perform action without option\" suggests there might be an access or permissions issue. It seems this ticket might relate to HR content, especially with references to job descriptions and graduates. I should categorize it, and since \"HR Support\" is included in the allowed categories, that seems to be the right fit for this request!**Categorizing HR Ticket**\n\nIt seems like I can assign \"HR Support\" to this ticket since it involves job descriptions and graduates. However, since it's an IT ticket, \"HR Support\" seems more appropriate for system changes rather than content modification. The details like \"attached proof,\" \"more clarifications,\" and \"experience lead\" may imply someone\u2019s leading the user experience, or that \u201clead blvd floor\u201d could reference a specific project. Ultimately, I need to choose the best fitting category for this request.**Choosing the Right Ticket Category**\n\nThe user submitted an IT ticket about modifying a structure and adding a button. The phrase \"cannot perform action without option\" suggests it could fit into the \"Access\" category for permission issues, but \"Administrative rights\" is more specific for actions needing admin privileges. Since it's not just about access denial, I wonder if \"Internal Project\" could apply, given it\u2019s about modifying software. However, the ticket's garbled text makes me think that \"Miscellaneous\" might be the safest option.**Defining the Ticket Category**\n\nIt seems the system is looking for a specific format, so I need to respond with a JSON object for the category. I\u2019m thinking \"Internal Project\" fits well since the ticket is about modifying a structure and adding a button, which are typical tasks. While there's HR content about graduates, it seems more relevant to the IT code structure here. The phrase \"cannot perform action without option\" isn't indicating a lack of admin rights, so I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" for the category. Here's the output:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}**Constructing the JSON Response**\n\nI need to provide a proper JSON object for the category based on the user's request to categorize the IT ticket. The schema indicates that I should return an object with a \"category\" field, which should be a string from the predefined options. Since it's about modifying a structure, \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best. So I'll respond in the expected format:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}  \n\nAlthough asking clarifying questions could help, I believe this succinct response captures what the user needs."
