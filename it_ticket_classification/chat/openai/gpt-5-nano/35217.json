There's no \"Software\" category, which complicates things. I\u2019m considering \"Hardware,\" as it involves the PC's performance. However, it could also fall under \"Miscellaneous\" since it might relate to a specific scanning tool or project. I need to decide whether \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" could apply, given the context of the issue.**Deciding on the category**\n\nI\u2019m examining the categories for the IT ticket. \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"HR Support\" don't seem to fit. The best option is \"Hardware,\" as the ticket relates to PC performance issues. While \"Software\" might apply, that category isn\u2019t available. \"Miscellaneous\" could also work if it's a general problem, but I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" being the most appropriate. I\u2019ll format the final answer as a JSON object with the category \"Hardware\".{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
