The user's request about \"meeting room\" seems a bit fragmented, mentioning installation and inventory. It looks as if they're asking for an inventory of meeting rooms and assessment. Since this falls under evaluating the meeting rooms, I think it might fit within the \"Internal Project\" category. I\u2019ll prepare a JSON output with this category for clarity.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think this request can be classified as an \"Internal Project\" because it revolves around inventorying and assessing meeting rooms. The mention of \"install\" is a bit unclear, but it doesn\u2019t seem to focus on actual hardware installation. The main components of the request appear to be about inventory and assessment. Although \"Administrative rights\" and \"Purchase\" don\u2019t fit the context, I\u2019ll finalize the classification as \"Internal Project\" and format it in JSON.**Formatting output as JSON**\n\nI need to follow the specified output format, which is to create a JSON object. It requires the \"category\" field containing one of the enumerated strings. Since I\u2019ve determined the appropriate category is \"Internal Project,\" I\u2019ll structure the response accordingly. The final output should be clean with no extra text, just the JSON object: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nI\u2019ll make sure that the \"category\" field is spelled correctly, as required."
