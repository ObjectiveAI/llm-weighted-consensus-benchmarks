It seems clear that this is related to storage capacity during the upgrade process. Hence, I think the best category is \"Storage.\" It\u2019s not about hardware or administrative rights, just focused on storage. So, I\u2019ll respond with the category \"Storage\" in JSON format.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
