It might fall under \"Access\" if users can't get in, or \"Internal Project\" since it relates to an internal workflow. They mention \"snow flow for cab application,\" which suggests it\u2019s about a feature or process. It could also be \"Administrative rights\" if there are permission issues. But I need to think carefully to pick the best-fitting category!**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user needs help categorizing an IT ticket. I'm thinking of responding with a JSON-like object that includes either \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Based on what's described, \"Internal Project\" fits best since it's about a workflow for an internal application. It sounds like it might be associated with the Change Advisory Board process in ServiceNow. I\u2019ll make sure to format my response properly as a JSON object with the category field clearly set to \"Internal Project.\"{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
