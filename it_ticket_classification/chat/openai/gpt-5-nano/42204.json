The text mentions problems with guest networks, address ranges, and device connectivity. Given the categories: \"Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights,\" I think the best fit is \"Access\" since it deals with network access and guest Wi-Fi. \"Internal Project\" doesn't seem right, and \"Miscellaneous\" could work, but it's less specific.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nIn categorizing this IT ticket regarding network issues, it looks like \"Access\" is the right fit since it deals with network and guest Wi-Fi access. The user asked for a categorization, so I'll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. The message highlights a configuration issue about address ranges and user connectivity problems, supporting the \"Access\" classification. I'll keep my response concise and may include a brief justification for clarity.**Providing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nThe request is clear: I need to categorize an IT ticket and output a JSON object with the appropriate category. Given the schema provided, I'll set the category to \"Access.\" I will format it correctly to ensure it's valid JSON with proper quotes. The final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. While I could include reasoning, the instructions specify to respond solely with the categorization. So I'll keep it straightforward and deliver only the JSON object as instructed."
