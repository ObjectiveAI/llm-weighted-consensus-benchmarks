The category options include \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or even \"Internal Project.\" Given the mention of \"guest passwords,\" it sounds like an access-related issue. So, I\u2019m leaning towards using the \"Access\" category for this ticket. I\u2019ll output a JSON-like object with the category key.**Formatting category output**\n\nI need to format the output for the IT ticket into the required structure: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Considering it mentions \"wireless networks,\" that suggests a need for network access. \"Access\" covers requests for locations or systems, while \"Administrative rights\" is about admin privileges, which aren't explicitly requested here. So \"Access\" seems like the best fit. I need to make sure to use the exact label \"Access\" with a capital A. Adding brief reasoning could also be helpful.**Defining the output format**\n\nThe user asked for categorization, and it seems they expect just the category itself. However, I think it might also be good to provide a brief note sometimes. The instructions specify a JSON-like object for the response, so it needs to have a \"category\" field with one of the specified strings. Therefore, the answer will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019m all set to produce that output!"
