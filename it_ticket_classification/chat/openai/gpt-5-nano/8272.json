Given this context, it could fit into several categories such as \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but it might also relate to \"Access\" or \"Hardware\" due to the technical aspects discussed. I\u2019ll need to decide carefully!**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThis IT ticket seems to focus on conference room hardware, specifically related to video and audio capabilities, making \"Hardware\" a strong category choice. It doesn't fit HR support, storage, or purchasing. While it could relate to \"Internal Project\" if configuring meeting rooms is considered an internal task, the clearer fit remains \"Hardware\" because of the hardware aspect. The mention of meeting room IDs and video conferencing options strengthens this classification as well. So, I'll go with \"Hardware\"!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
