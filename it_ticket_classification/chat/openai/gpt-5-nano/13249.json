I want to be thorough in this process to help the team respond effectively!**Analyzing ticket content**\n\nI need to carefully analyze the ticket content, which is quite lengthy and contains several phrases. It seems to touch on various topics like IT operations, acceptance phase, migration, virtual machines, patches, decommissioning assets, and production/test environments. There are mentions of \"lead annual leave notice\" and \"CR\" for change requests too. I\u2019ll have to sift through all this to summarize key points and ensure all relevant details are identified for effective handling!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm noticing that \"acceptance phase\" is mentioned multiple times. The ticket talks about two virtual machines, historical details, patches, and decommissioning, alongside migration needs. It\u2019s a mix of project management elements, including a setup spreadsheet and change requests. This leads me to think it might fit best under \"Internal Project\" since it's related to the project migration and acceptance phase. While \"Hardware\" could be relevant due to virtual machines, this ticket aligns more with project management, so \"Internal Project\" is the right choice!**Formatting response as JSON**\n\nI need to provide the response as a JSON object with a \"category\" property, which should be a string. The instruction specifically asks to categorize the IT ticket and requires the response to follow this format strictly. I see that the appropriate category here is \"Internal Project,\" so I\u2019ll make sure the capitalization matches exactly as it's given in the enum. I\u2019ll respond with just the JSON object and no extra text. Here we go!"
