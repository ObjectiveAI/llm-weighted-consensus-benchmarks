So, I need to categorize it as \"Miscellaneous.\" The final output should be a JSON object, which means I'll format it to look like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. It seems I need to avoid any extra text since the user asked for a straightforward category response.**Finalizing the Category Output**\n\nTo match the required format, I need to output exactly: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I\u2019ll ensure that the JSON syntax is correct. I should consider whether \"Outlook issues\" fall under \"Storage\" or \"Access,\" but since they are software-related, \"Miscellaneous\" remains the best choice. The user likely expects a single category here, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll provide. Now it\u2019s time to craft the final response accordingly."
