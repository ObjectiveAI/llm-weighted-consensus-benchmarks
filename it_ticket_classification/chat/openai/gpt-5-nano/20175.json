It seems to mention team leaders, project managers, and various details regarding leave codes and allocations, making it more HR-related. The \"HR Support\" category stands out as fitting for this context since it covers leave approvals. The ticket is indeed a bit messy, but overall, it seems HR Support is the best match here.**Categorizing Leave Management**\n\nIt looks like the ticket is related to leave management, so \"HR Support\" fits perfectly. While there\u2019s also \"Administrative rights\" in the categories, the appropriate choice here is definitely HR Support. I need to format my response as JSON according to the required output, specifically: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This matches the specified schema that expects an object with a \"category\" string. So, I will provide that exact JSON output.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
