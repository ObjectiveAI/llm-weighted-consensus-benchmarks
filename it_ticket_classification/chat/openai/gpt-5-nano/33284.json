The list of categories includes Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Since the user mentions a purchase request for monitors and cables, it seems to fit neatly into the \"Purchase\" category. The ticket includes approval details and indicates that modifications are required, confirming my choice. So, I\u2019ll likely categorize this ticket as a Purchase request.**Determining the right category**\n\nI'm sorting through the IT ticket, which mentions hardware like monitors but I see that \"Purchase\" keeps coming up. The focus here is clearly on a purchase order related to IT, so \"Purchase\" stands out as the best category to choose. While it mentions both monitors and replenishment cables, the overall theme indicates a purchase rather than hardware alone. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} since that's what the system expects.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
