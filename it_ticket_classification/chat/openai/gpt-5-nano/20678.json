It seems to relate to onboarding, so I'm considering categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The repeated mention of \"starter form\" indicates it's HR-related. Since we have \"HR Support\" as a specific category, that seems like the best fit unless there are additional access requirements mentioned. I'll go with \"HR Support.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket content is quite messy, filled with repeated AI-generated lines, but the main point is clear: someone needs help with a starter form for a new employee. I'm leaning towards categorizing this as \"HR Support,\" although if it's about access rights, \"Administrative rights\" could be appropriate. Still, \"HR Support\" seems to be the best fit. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} to fit the required format."
