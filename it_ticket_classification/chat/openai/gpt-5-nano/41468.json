It seems clear that this falls under a hardware issue since it's regarding a peripheral. While it could also be seen as a purchase, the main focus is on the hardware replacement. Therefore, my decision is to categorize it as \"Hardware.\" I'll output it as a JSON object to keep it concise and clear. Here's what it'll look like: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.I need to ensure there's no extra formatting in my response. The instruction is to respond with a category field in the object format. Since the ticket is clearly about a hardware issue, I\u2019ll simply output it as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This keeps things straightforward and meets the requirements neatly. Keeping it clean and direct is key! So, I\u2019m set to deliver that answer without any fluff."
