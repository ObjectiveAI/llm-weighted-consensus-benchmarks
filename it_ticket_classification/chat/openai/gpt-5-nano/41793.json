Based on these clues, it looks like it should fall under an internal project. I'll proceed with that categorization!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket doesn't fit categories like hardware, HR support, access, storage, purchase, or internal project. I\u2019m considering \"Miscellaneous\" as it could just be a generic IT issue. However, since it mentions a \"sonar issue,\" it might relate to a CI job failing due to SonarQube, making \"Internal Project\" a possibility too. It seems more aligned with a project pipeline situation, though \"Miscellaneous\" might be the safer choice overall. I\u2019ll choose one accordingly!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe instruction is to categorize this IT ticket, and we need to choose between \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" The user\u2019s message includes disclaimers about confidentiality, but importantly, it mentions a \"failing job\" due to a \"sonar issue,\" which likely refers to SonarQube, a static code analysis tool. This sounds like it's related to a CI job, suggesting it falls under \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll select that category for clarity.**Responding with Category**\n\nIt looks like this ticket should belong to \"Internal Project\" since it relates to a development project pipeline. So, the response needs to be in the correct format. The instruction indicates I should output a JSON-like category object. The schema provided specifies that I only need to include the category field as a string. Therefore, I will respond simply with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. No extra text is needed\u2014just the category object!"
