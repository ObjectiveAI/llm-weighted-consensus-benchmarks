This will help ensure we're addressing the ticket appropriately and efficiently. Let's see what the ticket says and find the right classification!**Analyzing leaver details**\n\nIt looks like I'm dealing with a jumbled message about an employee offboarding process. The text mentions various aspects like the leave date, location, leaver form, roaming profile, Active Directory rights, personal mailbox approvals, and inventory storage. There are also details regarding mobile phone subscriptions and other accounts involved. I'll need to extract the relevant information and clarify everything so I can understand exactly what steps are required in this offboarding process.**Mapping IT ticket categories**\n\nThe ticket I'm reviewing involves several IT-related aspects like access rights, mailbox management, roaming profiles, and Active Directory (AD) rights, all relating to the offboarding process. I need to categorize this into the most fitting option from \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nGiven that this ticket emphasizes access removal and deprovisioning, \"Access\" seems like the best fit. However, if it specifically pertains to administrative privileges, \"Administrative rights\" could also work. Ultimately, I\u2019ll focus on categorizing it as \"Access.\"**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"leaver AD rights\" which suggest that it's about removing Active Directory rights when someone leaves. There's also a mention of \"administrative rights,\" which could indicate we should assign it to that category if it pertains specifically to disabling admin rights. However, considering the broader context of offboarding, which includes access removal and items like mailboxes and roaming profiles, I believe \"Access\" is the best fit. I need to decide based on the overall details provided.**Deciding on category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this ticket as \"Access\" since it's primarily about deprovisioning access rights related to an offboarding process. Although \"Storage\" is mentioned in terms of inventory, it's not the main focus here. The output format specifies that I need to respond with a JSON object like `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. It's essential to ensure the capitalization matches exactly as specified. So I\u2019ll get right to it and deliver that concise response: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`."
