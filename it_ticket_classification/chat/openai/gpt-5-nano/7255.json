The term \"suspicious link\" might necessitate immediate action, possibly categorizing it as \"Administrative rights\" if escalation is needed. I\u2019ll need to respond with a JSON object in the required format. So, I\u2019ll choose \"Miscellaneous\" for my response.**Categorizing suspicious link reports**\n\nThe user is reporting a \"suspicious link,\" and I need to triage it. The category for something like this is typically \"Security,\" but that's not available. \"Miscellaneous\" feels a bit off, but I want to propose a viable category. \"Access\" could work since it relates to potential phishing or access risks, but it isn\u2019t explicitly about that. Since \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t fit either, I'll go with \"Miscellaneous\" and prepare a JSON response in the required format.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
