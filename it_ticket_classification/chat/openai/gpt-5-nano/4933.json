Options include \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights.\" Since this relates to access to a mailing list, \"Access\" feels the most appropriate. While \"Administrative rights\" could be a contender, it pertains more to permissions than simply adding someone to a list. So, \"Access\" is the best fit!**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI\u2019m considering the ticket's content about adding a member to the AM CC mailing list. Although \"Administrative rights\" could fit since it relates to permissions, \"Access\" feels more accurate for this kind of task. Many helpdesks categorize adding someone to a mailing list as an access control issue. Given that, I\u2019m deciding to go with \"Access\". I need to ensure the final output is a JSON object formatted correctly as {\"category\":\"Access\"} to meet the requirements.**Formatting category response**\n\nI see that the instruction requires a specific response format to provide a JSON object. For this ticket, I'll focus on categorizing it as \"Access\" based on the user's request to add a member to the AM CC mailing list. While \"Administrative rights\" seemed relevant, \"Access\" feels like the best fit that covers this task. So, following the guidance, I\u2019ll output it precisely as {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text. That works!"
