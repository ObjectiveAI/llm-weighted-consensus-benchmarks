The ticket details site migration, data transfer, and related tasks, including deadlines and access rights. I'll structure the output as JSON, focusing on categories like Administrative Rights, Access, Internal Project, Storage, and Miscellaneous. It's important to capture all aspects mentioned to ensure accurate categorization and processing.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI think this ticket should be categorized as \"Internal Project\" since it relates to an internal migration project. It involves tasks like uploading files, managing editing rights, and archiving, which fits more with project work than hardware or HR issues. Given the details about the site migration and guidelines, it just makes sense to file it under \"Internal Project.\" I'll create the output in the required JSON format, ensuring the category field is set accordingly.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
