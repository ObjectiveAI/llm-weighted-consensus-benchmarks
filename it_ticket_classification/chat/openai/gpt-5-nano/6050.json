I\u2019ll need to provide a JSON object that corresponds to the required format with \"category\" as a field, using \"HR Support\" as the classification.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI need to return the category value for the IT ticket based on the provided text. It seems appropriate to classify it as \"HR Support.\" I must ensure I format it exactly as required, outputting: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. The schema was provided to outline the acceptable categories, but my focus should be on delivering just the chosen category. Even though there are mentions of \"Oracle\" and forms, the main concern centers on \"maternity leave,\" reinforcing the HR classification.**Delivering the category**\n\nI\u2019ll finalize the output as a single JSON object with the format {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It\u2019s crucial to ensure that this category string exactly matches one of the specified enumerated options. Since \"HR Support\" fits perfectly, I'm ready to deliver it without any extra text.
