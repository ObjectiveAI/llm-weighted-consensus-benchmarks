The ticket discusses onboarding a new starter and changing credentials to permanent status, which suggests it relates to access and permissions. I'm considering the \"Access\" category since it involves login credentials. However, \"Administrative rights\" is also relevant because changing credentials often requires admin rights. I'll decide based on these considerations.**Identifying categories for IT ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"new starter former intern\" suggests this ticket is related to onboarding, but since there isn't a specific \"Onboarding\" category, I\u2019m considering \"HR Support.\" However, they likely need \"Access\" for credentials and access rights, or \"Administrative rights\" if it involves admin permissions. The request to \"change her credentials permanent status\" implies an update to a permanent employee account. Although \"HR Support\" fits the employment side, I would categorize this primarily under \"Access\" due to its focus on credentials. If there\u2019s a need for admin access specifically, that could also point toward \"Administrative rights.\"**Categorizing IT tickets in JSON**\n\nI should include \"HR Support\" in my considerations because it relates to onboarding and hiring status. However, since this ticket involves an IT action, I need to choose strictly one category for categorization. The prompt specifies a schema and says to respond with a JSON object containing the category field. \n\nBased on the specifics, I\u2019ll present it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Still, \"HR Support\" might also fit because it involves changing someone\u2019s status from intern to permanent employee, but the primary action relates to IT credentials.**Finalizing JSON categorization**\n\nI\u2019m weighing whether the IT ticket should fall under \"Administrative rights\" since it involves adjusting account privileges for a status change. However, the request is more about enabling the user as a permanent employee and maintaining credentials, rather than granting admin capabilities. Since \"Access\" typically covers access provisioning and the ticket doesn't specify admin rights, it seems best to categorize this as \"Access.\" \n\nI'll format the final output as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
