It seems to relate to \"pre sales code\" and mentions being \"unable to complete.\" Since it potentially involves code work, the \"Internal Project\" category might be the best fit.**Deciding Ticket Category**\n\nI realize there isn't a \"Development\" category; \"Internal Project\" fits code development tasks. \"Administrative rights\" isn\u2019t an option either, and while \"Access\" might apply if they need access to something, it seems unlikely. Similarly, categories like \"Purchase,\" \"Storage,\" \"Hardware,\" or \"HR Support\" don't fit. Given the user\u2019s request, I should categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it mentions code for Oracle and testing aspects. \n\nI'll respond with the appropriate JSON format for the category.**Providing Category Output**\n\nI need to return just the category based on the prompt showing the category schema. It seems I'm expected to output JSON with the category field value of \"Internal Project.\" The \"category\" object is a JSON schema demanding a string type with allowing enum. \n\nSo my expected output is: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I could consider \"Miscellaneous,\" but since this is about internal code tasks, \"Internal Project\" makes the most sense. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text in my response."
