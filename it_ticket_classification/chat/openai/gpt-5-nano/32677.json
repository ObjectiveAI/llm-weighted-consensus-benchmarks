Though \"Infrastructure\" would fit best, it\u2019s not an option. I think \"Hardware\" or \"Storage\" might be the closest fit, but potentially \"Internal Project\" could work too. I need to choose the most appropriate category for this situation**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI need to output a JSON-like object, specifically including a \"category\" field based on the provided schema. The instructions say to structure it like this: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`.\n\nWhile considering other possible categories, I realize \"Storage\" doesn't quite fit since server issues are the focus here. \"Access\" relates to login issues, which is irrelevant as well. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too generic. So, \"Hardware\" is indeed the right choice for servers. I'll stick to that and finalize my JSON object. Let's get this done!"
