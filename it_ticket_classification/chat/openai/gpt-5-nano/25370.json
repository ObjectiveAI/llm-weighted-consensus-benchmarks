The text refers to items like the Apple Pro Retina, Thunderbolt gigabit adapter, and a mini adapter, as well as discussing installation and receipts. This clearly relates to a purchase order or hardware procurement situation. So, I think the most fitting category would be either \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware,\" focusing on new purchase orders and the items involved.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user is asking to log installation details and mandatory receipts, which indicates it's about hardware procurement and installation. However, since I can only choose one category, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Purchase\" because it relates to a new purchase order and receipts. There\u2019s a lot about \"new purchase po,\" so I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object with the required structure.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI\u2019m making sure to provide the JSON correctly as text, ensuring the \"category\" property is included. With the conclusion that \"Purchase\" is the right category, I\u2019ll format it as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nI just need to double-check that \"Administrative rights\" isn\u2019t applicable in this case and confirm that the focus remains on procurement. Once that\u2019s set, I will finalize and provide the output as required."
