The ticket seems related to \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" as it discusses visibility of a console. It's not perfectly clear, but it suggests enabling visibility or tracking changes.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing this ticket as \"Administrative rights\" since it involves enabling visibility. However, \"Access\" seems to be the best fit for user-level console access. The user's request mentions making changes visible, which adds to the confusion. I could consider \"Miscellaneous\" due to the vagueness, but I need to make a choice. The user, likely in Belgrade, wants visibility in a console, possibly for tracking or logging changes.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering how to classify this ticket. Based on typical help desk categories, \"Access\" seems fitting since it involves visibility of the console. However, \"Administrative rights\" may also be suitable since making changes visible likely requires elevated permissions. I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as it feels more general. The instruction for a JSON-like object format is clear, so I\u2019ll respond simply with {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text.**Delivering the ticket category**\n\nI'm contemplating whether to classify the ticket as \"Administrative rights\" since the user might need privileges to view the console. However, the phrases like \"visible console\" and \"make changes visible\" don't strongly indicate that. Therefore, I\u2019m deciding to go with \"Access\" instead. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format as specified: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Now, it's time to deliver that response!"
