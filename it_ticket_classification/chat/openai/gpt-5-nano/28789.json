The \"Storage\" category includes aspects of data migration. However, this concerns visibility and access rights too. The best fit seems to be \"Access,\" as it addresses permissions and visibility of documentation and who can see what. While \"Internal Project\" could apply since it\u2019s ongoing, I think \"Access\" is more appropriate for this ticket.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe main subject here is migration, and I have a few category options like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the user\u2019s request focuses on visibility and user access, I'll choose \"Access\" as the category. Now, I need to format my final response as a JSON object. The system expects a structured object with the category string, so I'll ensure it looks like: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. This matches the required schema for the ticket."
