The \"Access\" category seems fitting for a possible password change, while \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it's about changing admin access. It's a bit ambiguous, but I'm leaning toward \"Access.\"**Determining ticket categorization**\n\nThe user mentions \"Wednesday PM please,\" indicating some time scheduling. The rest of the message, \"hi please pm change pm thank senior,\" suggests they're asking for a password change. However, \"pm\" could stand for different things like \"private message,\" \"project manager,\" or \"permission.\" In this context, categorizing it as \"Access\" seems best since it's likely a password or access modification for Oracle. \n\nI need to respond with a JSON-like object specifying \"Access\" as the category.**Finalizing the category output**\n\nAlright, I'm set to output the category as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nThe user's request is clear; they want the ticket categorized without any extra text or explanation. The content they provided points toward \"Access,\" so I'm sticking to that. \n\nI\u2019ll make sure to keep it minimal and format it correctly. Let\u2019s present it just like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. There\u2019s no need for anything else!"
