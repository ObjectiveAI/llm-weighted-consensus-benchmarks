The categories I can choose from include \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" and others. Given that the text specifically talks about a \u201cnew purchase\u201d and also refers to a scanner, it seems most fitting to categorize it as \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll prepare the output as a JSON-like object, saying: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. This aligns with the ticket\u2019s content!**Categorizing scanner purchase**\n\nIt seems the user wants to log the purchase of a Brother scanner, focusing on allocation. The ticket is mainly about the purchase process, so I think the best category is \"Purchase,\" although \"Hardware\" could also fit if they intend to log it as an asset. However, considering the specifics like \"new purchase\" and \"log allocation,\" I'm leaning toward \"Purchase\" as the most fitting choice. I\u2019ll stick to the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} with no extra text."
