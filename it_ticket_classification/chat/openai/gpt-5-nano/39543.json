                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m categorizing an IT ticket based on a user-provided string that talks about a problem with a candidate referral. It mentions a referral status issue and seeks guidance on solving it. I\u2019m considering possible categories like Hardware, HR Support, or Access. Since it relates to the HR referral system, it could fit under \u201cHR Support\u201d for assistance or \u201cAccess\u201d due to permission concerns. I\u2019ll weigh these options based on the ticket's focus.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories provided: \u201cHardware,\u201d \u201cHR Support,\u201d \u201cAccess,\u201d and others. This ticket doesn\u2019t seem to fit hardware, storage, or purchase, and it\u2019s not necessarily for an internal project. The issue involves an expired referral status, which connects more to \u201cHR Support\u201d since it relates to candidate referrals. However, it could also apply to \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d depending on the specifics. Since it\u2019s primarily about an HR process, categorizing it as \u201cHR Support\u201d seems most fitting.**Clarifying referral ticket details**\n\nThe user mentioned an issue with a referral where the candidate's status expired, and they're asking for direction on how to fix it. Based on this, I need to categorize the ticket properly rather than solve it. The relevant categories seem to be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" since this could involve permissions to update candidate statuses in the referral system. It might stem from the \u201cSelect Minds\u201d system. This is more about access issues rather than a simple login problem, and I should reflect that in my categorization.**Determining the right category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this issue regarding a referral problem. \u201cHR Support\u201d sounds fitting since it's related to human resources, but the ticket falls under IT since it involves the \"Select Minds\" system. The user is seeking direction to resolve the issue, and it looks like it might be an \u201cAccess\u201d matter, especially if it\u2019s linked to system permissions due to the \"referral status expired\" message. This could point to a technical issue but doesn\u2019t quite fit \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Deciding on category output**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this ticket as \"HR Support\" since it relates to the HR referral process rather than a technical issue. The user needs a JSON output with a category field, so I\u2019ll set it to \"HR Support.\" However, I\u2019m considering \"Access\" due to the mention of the \"referral status expired\" issue. But since the user didn't ask for clarification, I\u2019ll stick with \"HR Support\" as the safest option for an HR workflow. So, I'll finalize it with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
