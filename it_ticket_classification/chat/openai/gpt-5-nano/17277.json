It seems to mention adapters and monitors, which leads me to think it\u2019s related to hardware. I\u2019m considering whether it fits into \"Hardware\" or possibly \"Purchase.\" Since the user seems to ask for providing mini adapters for the monitors, classifying it as \"Hardware\" makes sense. I should prepare a clear and concise response with just the selected category.**Formatting IT Ticket Response**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to respond with a JSON object that fits their schema. The instructions are clear about formatting, so I'll focus on just providing the category as a string. Since I've determined that the most appropriate category is \"Hardware,\" I'll create the JSON object as follows: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It might be better to keep it concise without additional notes, so I\u2019ll stick to that format for delivery."
