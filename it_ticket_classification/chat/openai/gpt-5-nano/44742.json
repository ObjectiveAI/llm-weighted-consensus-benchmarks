It seems the user is having trouble logging on, possibly due to a locked account from failed attempts. So, I should check Active Directory. For categorization, I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate choice since the issue relates to account access. It could be \"Administrative rights,\" but typically, an account lock is linked to \"Access.\" I'm leaning toward that option!**Generating category object**\n\nThe ticket describes a user account being locked due to failed attempts, which clearly indicates an access issue. So, I'm choosing \"Access\" for the category. I need to provide a JSON category object as specified in the prompt. The format is straightforward, with just the \"category\" field. I\u2019ll deliver it in the expected way. Here it goes:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
