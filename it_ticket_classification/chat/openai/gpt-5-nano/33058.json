The user's message is a bit jumbled, but it mentions \"approver holidays human resources absence schedule calendar.\" This suggests it could fit into the \"HR Support\" category since it's related to HR systems or access to calendars. It might also be about administrative rights or an internal project. It seems like they might be requesting to set up approvals related to holidays.**Classifying IT ticket category**\n\nIt looks like the user wants to categorize an IT ticket. Based on the message, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit since it mentions holidays, absence schedules, and human resources. Although \"Access\" might also apply, it doesn\u2019t seem necessary here. The message is a bit unclear\u2014maybe missing punctuation? It could mean something like, \"PM for Tuesday, July. Hi, please PM approver about holidays.\" Overall, I\u2019ll classify it as \"HR Support\" and respond with a JSON category object.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
