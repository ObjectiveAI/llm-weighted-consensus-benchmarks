This issue involves notifications not reaching the line manager, possibly due to a workflow problem in the HR system. Since it\u2019s about leave approvals, I think I should categorize it as \"HR Support.\" If permissions to access the workflow are needed, it could also fit under \"Administrative rights.\" Ultimately, I'll select \"HR Support\" for HR-related processes.**Determining the category for the IT ticket**\n\nI need to find the most fitting category among the options: \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" The user specifically called this an \"IT Ticket.\" While \"HR Support\" usually covers HR queries, this seems more related to a system issue\u2014specifically, notifications not reaching the line manager. I think \"HR Support\" is the best choice since it pertains to annual leave requests and approvals. I should produce the JSON solely with that information: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
