It mentions \"SelectMinds,\" which seems like a recruitment software. The main problem is that it's displaying something incorrect related to the job posting. This definitely sounds like an HR-related issue, so the best fit from the categories would likely be \"HR Support.\" I just want to make sure we're choosing the most accurate category!**Deciding on category**\n\nI'm trying to figure out the best category for this IT ticket. It mentions \"Select Minds,\" which seems to relate to recruitment software for job postings. Since this ticket deals with recruitment processes, I believe \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate option. It doesn't fit other categories like hardware, storage, or purchase, and while access could be a consideration, it\u2019s more about content display issues. My final output should be a JSON object with \"HR Support\" specified as the category.**Finalizing JSON structure**\n\nI need to produce a specific JSON structure for the category schema. It looks like I should format it like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Based on the ticket about \"Select Minds\" and its issue with job postings, \"HR Support\" is indeed the correct category. I'll ensure the output is concise and follows the required format closely, without extra commentary. The final JSON will simply be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That\u2019s exactly what the user needs!"
