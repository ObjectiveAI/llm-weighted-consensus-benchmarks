The ticket indicates an \"electrical outage\" and is about notifying someone about that. \n\nI\u2019m thinking it could fit into \"Miscellaneous,\" as many systems use it for unclear issues. The other categories don't quite fit. \"Access\" sounds related, but it\u2019s really just about informing about the outage. So, I'll go with \"Miscellaneous.\"**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that includes a category field. The requested output format specifies a schema that outlines \"category\" as a string with certain options. \n\nSo, I'll set the category to \"Miscellaneous\" based on the context of the IT ticket. I want to ensure the JSON output is valid, so I'll format it as {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.\n\nI'll avoid any extra text and stick to just the JSON line to follow the guidelines clearly. Double-checking, I still feel \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit\u2014time to deliver!"
