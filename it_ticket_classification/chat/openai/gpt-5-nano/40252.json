However, since it's hardware-related too, I\u2019m debating \"Hardware.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm considering which category fits best for this IT ticket. \"Administrative rights\" seems plausible if access is needed, but it's not a perfect match. \"Miscellaneous\" could work if nothing else fits, while \"Storage\" and \"Purchase\" don't apply. \"Access\" might relate to the server issues, but the ticket doesn\u2019t specify access rights. I think \"Internal Project\" is the best choice since it's clearly about internal IT infrastructure and incident management. I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" in the final response.**Formatting Output for IT Ticket**\n\nI need to make sure I format the output correctly as a JSON-like structure with the category property. The instruction says to provide just the category in this specified format. Since they've asked to categorize the IT ticket, I\u2019ll respond simply with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI want to ensure that my quoting is correct as well, so everything is in line with the requirements. No extra commentary is necessary unless they ask for it."
