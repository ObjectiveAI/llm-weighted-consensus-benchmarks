This ticket is quite noisy but seems to focus on weekly timesheet submissions, approval processes, and the need for manager notification. It might fit into categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" I'll ensure to map it correctly among the allowed categories, which include various options like Access, Miscellaneous, and Storage.**Categorizing HR Ticket**\n\nThis ticket seems to relate to HR support regarding timesheet submissions and the process involved. I think it should be mapped to \"HR Support\" since timesheets are connected to payroll. I need to respond with a JSON object that contains this categorization. The expected format is: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. The user's text indicates issues around missing time and the need for manager notification, confirming it's about HR processes.
