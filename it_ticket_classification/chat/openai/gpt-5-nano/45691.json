From what the user mentioned, it seems to relate to time tracking and checking processes. \n\nIt's pretty likely this is an HR-related issue, but it could also fall under \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll weigh these options to determine the best category, focusing on \"HR Support\" as a strong candidate since it centers on time sheets.**Determining best category**\n\nThis issue revolves around accessing time sheets, which might require certain permissions. If it's about access rights, \"Access\" is definitely a fitting category. However, it could also lean toward \"HR Support\" since it pertains to time sheets, which are often HR-related. \n\nAdditionally, if it's about a feature request within an internal system, \"Internal Project\" might apply. But ultimately, I think \"Access\" is the best fit due to the user's focus on viewing permissions.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned \"missing time sheets view Oracle,\" which suggests the lack of access due to permissions. Their desire for a feature that works for everyone and the mention of \"manually checking each person\" imply they want to include all time sheets. So, it\u2019s clear that this should fall under the \"Access\" category.\n\nI'll format the answer in the required JSON schema, ensuring it meets the guidelines without extra explanations. The final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
