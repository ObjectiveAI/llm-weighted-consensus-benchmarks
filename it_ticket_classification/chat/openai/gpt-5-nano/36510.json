It seems to fall under the \"Hardware\" category, as it pertains to a hardware problem with the phone. The ticket isn't grammatically correct, but it clearly indicates a hardware issue. So, I\u2019ll format my response in JSON to include the category \"Hardware\" as specified in the schema.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to ensure that my response is a valid JSON object, specifically including the required category. The user is looking for categorization, and since the issue relates to a phone problem, I will respond with: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. I'll ensure that the casing is correct and matches the enumerated category exactly as specified. Since I'm instructed to output only the JSON object without any extra text, I'll keep it concise as just that."
