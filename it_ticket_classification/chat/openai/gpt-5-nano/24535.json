It includes phrases like \"add the Tuesday December PM,\" \"add hello writing,\" and \"add AD member.\" It seems related to Git access, adding an Active Directory member, or appointing an approver for a branch. Based on the categories provided, it likely falls under \"Access\" or maybe \"Administrative rights.\" I'll choose the category that best fits these tasks.**Categorizing ticket for access control**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"AD member,\" \"approver branch,\" \"git,\" and \"design lead,\" which all seem related to access control and permissions. I think \"Access\" is the most suitable category, though \"Administrative rights\" could also apply as a subset. The request to \"add AD member\" indicates user access management, while \"approver branch\" relates to repository access control. Since the primary focus is on adding members and approvers, I'll go with \"Access.\" Now, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON output with this category.  \n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
