The complaint speaks to connection failures and access problems. It makes sense to classify this as an \u201cAccess\u201d issue since it directly relates to accessing the license server. Phrases like \u201ccould not access license server\u201d and \u201cremote server connection refused\u201d clearly indicate it\u2019s about connectivity and access. So, \u201cAccess\u201d is indeed the best category for this ticket.**Formatting IT Ticket Response**\n\nI need to create an answer in the right format for an IT ticket categorization. The system wants a JSON object that includes a \"category\" field. The allowed categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and a few others. Since the issue is about license server access, I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to ensure I stick to the instructions and don't add any extra text or details. So, I'll just output that JSON without anything else.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m pondering whether to categorize the ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it involves an internal server license. However, the main issue is still access to that server, so \"Access\" really fits best. It's important to keep the focus on the access aspect rather than the internal project nature. I\u2019m confident that categorizing it as \"Access\" is the right way to go, so I'll just output that."
