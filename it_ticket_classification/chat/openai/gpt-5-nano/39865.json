It appears to be about unable to reset a password, which suggests it's related to access. Given the categories available\u2014Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights\u2014I think this ticket should fit under \"Access\" rather than \"HR Support.\" The mention of contacting an administrator also points towards access issues.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket is about a password reset related to an external directory. I think it should be categorized as \"Access\" because it's focused on password access issues. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit if it involved admin resets, it seems more general here.\n\nThe user wants a JSON response with the category. They specified the format should have a \"category\" object that is a string. So I\u2019ll format it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I just need to keep it straightforward without adding unnecessary structure.**Providing final JSON response**\n\nI need to make sure I respond with just the category as specified in the schema provided earlier. It's clear that I should only output the final JSON object without additional analysis or commentary. So, I\u2019ll format the response as {\"category\":\"Access\"} to stay consistent with previous tasks. Keeping it simple and straightforward is the best approach here, following the user's instructions exactly. Let's go ahead and finalize that!"
