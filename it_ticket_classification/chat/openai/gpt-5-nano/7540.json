Based on the content, it seems they\u2019re asking for something related to access provisioning or user management, which isn't directly listed but falls under \"Access\" or could possibly involve \"Administrative rights\". However, since it\u2019s primarily about adding members, \"Access\" appears to be the most fitting category. If it were more ambiguous, \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option, but I\u2019ll stick with \"Access.\"**Outputting JSON for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the IT ticket as \u201cAccess,\u201d since that fits the request to add team members. Now, I need to format my response as a JSON object. The task specifies that I should include a \u201ccategory\u201d key with an enumerated string as its value. So, I\u2019ll produce: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I shouldn't add any extra commentary, just focus on getting this format correct. I'll go ahead and provide that JSON response."
