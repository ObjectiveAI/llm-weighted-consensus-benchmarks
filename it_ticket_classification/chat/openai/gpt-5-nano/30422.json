I need to figure out how to categorize it into one of the provided categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights.\n\nGiven the mention of \"leaver form\" and \"administration officer,\" it sounds like it could be related to HR Support. However, I need to confirm this as it might also touch on Accessibility issues.**Categorizing HR Ticket**\n\nIt looks like this request is about a \"leaver form,\" which relates to the HR process when an employee leaves. There are issues mentioned with filling it out, including errors and concerns about work location and visibility options.\n\nSince it's clearly tied to HR processes, \"HR Support\" seems like the best category. I also need to provide the output in JSON format, specifically a JSON object that indicates the category. I'll set the category value to \"HR Support\" accordingly.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
