It mentions monitoring, meeting room monitors, and some issues with availability for remote conference calls. Based on the terms like \"monitor\" and \"meeting room,\" this seems to relate to hardware, particularly regarding the monitors in these meeting rooms. I'll classify it under Hardware since that's where the focus appears to be.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking this ticket likely falls under the Hardware category since it specifically mentions \"monitor\" multiple times, particularly regarding meeting room monitors. There's also a chance it could be classified as an Internal Project, but Hardware seems more appropriate here. I should respond with a JSON object, noting the category choice. The format specified allows for something like: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Adding a brief justification could be helpful, but it might not be necessary per the instructions.**Finalizing category response**\n\nThe user provided a schema, so I need to respond strictly with the \"category\" key. Based on the repeated mentions of \"monitor,\" especially regarding monitoring meeting room usage for February, it seems appropriate to categorize this as Hardware. While it could touch on an Internal Project aspect, the focus remains on hardware assets. So my final response will be a JSON object formatted like: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Now, let's produce that response!"
