It includes terms like \"remove from pm messages,\" \"automatically deleted after days,\" and references to an \"organization administrator.\" This suggests it might concern email retention or PM message deletion.  \n\nBased on the provided categories, it seems to best fit under \"Administrative rights\" since it deals with message management and permissions related to communication. This categorization should help address the user's issues effectively!**Choosing the right category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket, and the content is a bit jumbled. It mentions themes like \"messages,\" \"automatically deleted after days,\" and \"organization administrator,\" which gives some clues. I\u2019m considering \"Storage,\" since it deals with message retention, or \"Administrative rights\" if it involves admin privileges for message management.  \n\nHowever, based on the overall focus on message deletion and retention, I think \"Storage\" is the most appropriate category for this ticket.**Determining the right category**\n\nThe ticket mentions terms like \"undeliverable,\" \"pm,\" and \"default locale,\" which suggests issues with private messages or data quality. \n\nWhile retention policies point towards \"Storage,\" there's also the possibility of \"Access\" related to admin rights regarding message retention. The mention of \"organization administrator\" leans towards \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nUltimately, since the main focus is on categorizing and modifying retention policies, I think \"Administrative rights\" makes the most sense to cover the ticket's content effectively.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
