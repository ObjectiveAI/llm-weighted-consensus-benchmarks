So, it seems like \"HR Support\" is the best fit.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket text indicates that the user is inquiring about a vacation request sent on Thursday, March. They seem to be asking why it wasn't received or why approvals for others were granted. This situation falls under HR/Leave management, so \"HR Support\" is the appropriate category.
