The phrase \"disable user leaver\" suggests that they want to restrict access for someone leaving, possibly on Friday afternoon. This points to the category of Access, which seems most fitting. However, there's also \"Administrative rights\" as a possibility. For clarity and efficiency, I think I'll go with Access as the best choice.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe request to \"disable user leaver\" suggests that disabling access rights is necessary, making \"Access\" the appropriate category. I need to format my response as a JSON object with the category specified. While \"Administrative rights\" might seem fitting, it pertains more to admin privileges rather than simply disabling a user. Since this ticket focuses on access management, \"Access\" is indeed the best choice. So I\u2019ll finalize the output as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
