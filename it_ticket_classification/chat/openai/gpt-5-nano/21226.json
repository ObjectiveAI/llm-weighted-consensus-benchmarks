It might be under \"Access\" since it's about enabling a feature for a user, but \"Administrative rights\" seems more appropriate because it often requires admin-level privileges. I should make sure I choose the best category, which usually would be either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" for enabling features in tickets.**Choosing notification categories**\n\nI'm looking at a ticket that mentions enabling notifications in ServiceNow, which seems to relate to configuring system settings. This likely requires \"Administrative rights\" since you need admin access to set up notifications. While \"Access\" could also be relevant, it's more about user permissions, and here it\u2019s focused on enabling notifications. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the category: {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}. Since the system specifies the format, that's what I need to deliver.**Delivering the category**\n\nI\u2019m finalizing the output for the user, who asked to categorize an IT ticket. Since they just want the category, I\u2019m keeping it concise. I\u2019ve confirmed that the right choice is \"Administrative rights,\" so I\u2019ll deliver it in the precise format needed. My final response will be: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. It\u2019s straightforward, and I want to make sure I get this right for the user!"
