The available categories include \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context, I should output a JSON object categorizing this as \"HR Support.\" That captures the essence of the user's needs effectively.**Categorizing HR access request**\n\nThis seems like it falls under HR system access. I'm considering whether to label it as \"HR Support\" since it's about HR processes, but I need to choose the most fitting category. It could be \"Administrative rights\" since the user wants access to templates and needs to accept or decline requests. However, \"HR Support\" seems to align better with the overall context. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and output the JSON object as requested."
