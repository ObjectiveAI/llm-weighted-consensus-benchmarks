The user mentions things like \"new purchase,\" \"allocated,\" and \"receipts,\" which hints it relates to purchasing. The categories I have to choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It looks like this ticket should probably fall under the Purchase category. Let\u2019s map it out accordingly!**Parsing IT ticket message**\n\nLet's break down the user's message: it mentions \"new purchase,\" \"purchase order,\" and something about a \"starter hub,\" which could imply hardware. They also mention logging allocation after receiving the item and the need for mandatory receipts. This could indicate a request related to purchasing. I'm leaning towards categorizing this ticket as \"Purchase,\" since it primarily revolves around a new order. While there are elements of asset management, the focus seems to align best with \"Purchase.\"**Finalizing category response**\n\nI\u2019ve ruled out categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Access.\" So, I'm set on categorizing this ticket as \"Purchase.\" Now, I need to respond in the correct format, which is a JSON-like object with a \"category\" key. Following the instruction, I'll output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nIt\u2019s important that I stay true to the specified format. Although \"Hardware\" could also be a contender due to the mention of a hub, the overall context leans more toward \"Purchase.\"**Determining purchase category**\n\nThe ticket mentions a \"starter type hub,\" which I think refers to a USB hub. However, the main focus is on logging allocation after receiving the item, including mandatory receipts and an order with a video link. The keywords \"new purchase\" and \"po\" (purchase order) really stand out. So, it seems clear that this request fits best in the \"Purchase\" category. I\u2019m confident about that choice!"
