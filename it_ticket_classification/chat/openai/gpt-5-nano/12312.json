The categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The user's request seems to be about changing a template in ServiceNow, referred to as \"Snow.\" They ask for a change regarding the \"projects code\" and \"name assignment.\" This might mean modifying a template or changing the assignment of the person handling the ticket. It's a bit ambiguous, so I'll consider both possibilities.**Categorizing IT ticket requests**\n\nI'm considering the categories available for this IT ticket. \"Administrative rights\" could relate to access for modifying templates, while \"Internal Project\" might fit if it's an internal initiative. The user's request mentions a \"template change\" in ServiceNow and could be about changing both the template and the project code. This seems like development work, so it might fall under \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or even \"Miscellaneous,\" depending on how clear the request is.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user requested a template change in ServiceNow for \"projects code\" and mentioned \"change name assignment.\" This could refer to altering the name field within the template. Since the request is somewhat ambiguous, I need to decide on a suitable category. Given that it relates to a code/template for projects, I believe \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. I'll prepare a JSON-like object that includes this category and, if necessary, a short clarifying response.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to format the response as a JSON-like object with a \"category\" property. The category type specifies an enum with values like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context, I believe the best choice here is \"Internal Project.\" \n\nSo, I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and respond with the simple JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let's make sure to stick to that format!"
