The user provided a message that seems to indicate it's about hardware items. It could fit under the \"Hardware\" category, but since they're requesting to acquire patch cables, \"Purchase\" might also be appropriate. The message clearly shows a request for patch cables, and so the categorization could end up being either \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase,\" depending on how we view it.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the ticket's categorization, which involves patch cables. It could fit as \"Hardware\" if it's about equipment, but since it's clearly a request for obtaining items, \"Purchase\" is probably the right choice. The urgency indicated by phrases like \"asap\" and \"help please\" only emphasizes the request. Given that the term \"patch cable request\" suggests procurement, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase.\" \n\nSo, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
