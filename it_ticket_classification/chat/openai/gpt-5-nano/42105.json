The ticket mentions problems with approval notifications, timecard approvals, and some management settings that seem to have changed\u2014potentially a request to modify those permissions. Given the context, I think I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access,\" since it relates to permissions for approving timecards and notifications.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI'm preparing to create a JSON object, setting the category to \"Access.\" I need to adhere to the required format, ensuring it's a single JSON object with the field named \"category.\" The user is looking for this categorization. \n\nI might consider adding a brief justification, but since the request requires only the JSON output, I'll focus on that. I am weighing if \"Administrative rights\" fits better, but it\u2019s really about accessing the approvals feature, so \"Access\" seems most accurate.**Finalizing JSON category**\n\nThe category \"Access\" seems to be the right choice, as it relates to permissions and access issues. On the other hand, \"Administrative rights\" focus more on admin privileges. Given that the text references \"manager\" a few times in relation to approvals, I want to clarify whether that implies the need for admin rights. However, I still believe \"Access\" is the most suitable classification for this request. So, I\u2019ll finalize a simple JSON output accordingly."
