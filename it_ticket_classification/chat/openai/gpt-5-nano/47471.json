Since the issues relate to software errors, it appears that \"Miscellaneous\" would be the best fit for this generic IT matter. Let's go with that classification!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm trying to figure out the best category for this ticket. It might fit under \"Internal Project\" since it's about a script related to ServiceNow. However, since it's not about hardware, access, or storage, \"Miscellaneous\" seems safer. The content mentioning \"service now feedback script error\" indicates it's about that software. While \"Administrative rights\" could potentially apply if notifications are in play, it's better to go with \"Miscellaneous\" for unclear IT issues unless it's strictly for an internal project environment.**Formulating Category Response**\n\nGiven the limited categories, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the best choice. The instructions indicate that I need to respond with a JSON object that includes just the category. So, I should structure my response as a JSON snippet without any extra text. The required format looks like this: `{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}`. While \"Internal Project\" could also fit, I'll stick with \"Miscellaneous\" for clarity and simplicity. Let's keep it clean and straightforward!"
