In IT terms, this generally falls under \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware\". I think \"Purchase\" is more suitable, considering it's about acquiring something new. Sure, it could refer to a \"laptop backpack,\" but it\u2019s just a backpack supporting the engineer. The context suggests categorizing it as a \"Purchase\". I should respond with a JSON object to reflect the \"category\" field accordingly.**Formatting the response**\n\nThe instruction indicates that I need to respond with a JSON object that includes a category. In this case, I should provide \"Purchase\" as the category. This means the response should look like: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. There shouldn't be any extra commentary since the user asked for categorization of the IT ticket. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and just output that JSON structure to fulfill the request efficiently."
