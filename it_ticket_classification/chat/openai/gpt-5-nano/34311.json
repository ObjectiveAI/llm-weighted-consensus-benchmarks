It might fit under \"Access\" since it concerns server restrictions, but it's really more about email handling. The message \"recipient address rejected\" suggests it's a server-side issue likely due to spam filters or blocks. While \"Internal Project\" could apply if it's for a specific project, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a safer bet as a catch-all. I'll go with that and respond with the JSON format.**Delivering JSON output**\n\nI'm focused on providing the correct response format for the category request. The problem specifies that I should just return a JSON object, so I won\u2019t add any extra text. The prompt indicates the required format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Following the schema they've defined ensures I'm sticking to their guidelines. I'll make sure to deliver exactly that JSON-like object without any flares or distractions."
