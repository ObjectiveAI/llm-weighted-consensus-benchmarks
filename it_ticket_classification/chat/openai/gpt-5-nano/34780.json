It seems related to replacing the current solution with an anti-endpoint client. Based on this, I\u2019ll select the most appropriate category for efficient handling. This will help in directing the ticket to the right team.**Understanding the IT assignment**\n\nI see that the message discusses the automatic installation of a new corporate case related to an IT security rollout, requiring a restart of the computer. There\u2019s mention of high CPU usage and it seems to involve a new antivirus or endpoint client. I'm contemplating whether to categorize this as \"Administrative rights\" or possibly \"Internal Project,\" although it doesn\u2019t seem to fit either perfectly. Clarifying the right category is essential for ensuring proper handling.**Determining ticket categorization**\n\nThis is a rollout of a security agent as part of an internal project. I\u2019m considering \"Miscellaneous\" as a category, but let's examine the options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights, and Miscellaneous. The content suggests that there's a high CPU usage issue due to this rollout. The ticket discusses installation and restart prompts, which point towards IT management and deployment. I think \"Internal Project\" fits best because it reflects the ongoing security rollout, though \"Miscellaneous\" could also work since it doesn\u2019t fit neatly into other categories.**Finalizing the categorization**\n\nI need to clarify that the \"Access\" category isn\u2019t suitable since it pertains to user permissions, which isn\u2019t the issue here. \"Hardware\" would imply a hardware failure, but the ticket focuses on CPU usage linked to a software rollout, not a hardware problem. Therefore, \"Internal Project\" fits best for this IT ticket regarding deployment. I\u2019ll format the response as JSON, ensuring to follow the required structure precisely. My final output will be:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI might consider adding a brief justification, but the categorization is clear!**Preparing the JSON response**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize the issue, and I see that the required format is a JSON object with only the necessary information\u2014no additional text allowed. I'll make sure to stick to the instructions precisely. My final response will focus solely on providing the JSON output with the \"category\" field included. I\u2019m ready to deliver it now! Here\u2019s the concise output as required:\n  \n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
