The user mentions \"mailbox full\" and seems to ask for assistance in receiving emails again. The potential categories for this issue could be \"Storage,\" since it relates to managing mailbox quotas. \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" might also apply, but \"Storage\" feels most appropriate. However, I should keep in mind \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are involved!**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe user\u2019s issue is about a full mailbox, and we need to address whether to clear space or escalate it to an admin for a quota extension. It seems clear that the best category here is \"Storage.\" To comply with instructions, I\u2019ll construct a JSON object with just the category field. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I need to stick to that format without any extra text, just delivering what\u2019s needed!**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nI need to keep the response format simple and clear. Even though the top-level format isn\u2019t strictly specified, previous tasks show that I should respond with something like: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. The system instructions indicate that I should provide just the category specified among the allowed options. So, I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra text or detail\u2014just the straightforward response. Done!"
