It seems like this is about setting up a project called \"interviews.\" Given the context, it most closely aligns with \"Internal Project,\" since it discusses project and template creation. However, it could also relate to \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" due to references about administrators and modifying templates. I'll finalize the categorization based on that reasoning.**Categorizing Ticket for Interviews**\n\nIt looks like the ticket is about organizing interviews, specifically suggesting the creation of a project channel called \"interviews.\" There are mentions of having an administrator lead the project and allowing others to modify templates. This suggests project management tasks, so \"Internal Project\" stands out as the best category. While \"Administrative rights\" could also apply due to the request for admin roles, the main action is creating the project, reinforcing that \"Internal Project\" is the correct choice.**Responding with JSON Category**\n\nThe phrase \"give others modify template\" suggests some access control, but it's still mainly about setting up a project, which falls under internal project management tasks. Therefore, I should categorize this as \"Internal Project.\" \n\nThe required format is a JSON object that specifies this category. I can respond simply with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to provide just that and avoid any extra text. Let's deliver it cleanly!"
