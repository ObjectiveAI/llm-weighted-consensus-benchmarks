The ticket content is messy, but it seems to concern access permissions and repository browsing, mentioning a \"confluence blocker.\" Confluence usually involves access issues related to Atlassian tools, so the best category would likely be \"Access,\" as it's primarily about granting permission to a common user.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket is requesting permission, which clearly relates to access rights. The content indicates that there's a \"confluence blocker\" and a need to browse a repository, suggesting it's about giving access to a common user. Therefore, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" The response should be in the required JSON format, so I'll prepare it like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to make sure I keep it concise and stick to the prompt without adding unnecessary text!"
