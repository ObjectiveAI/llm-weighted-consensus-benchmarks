                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the user\u2019s text, which refers to \"temporary instances for service restore exercise,\" \"location specs,\" and \"cores storage.\" It seems focused on IT infrastructure processes like creating temporary instances, taking snapshots, and storage requirements related to a fresh install. Considering these elements, the most fitting category would likely be \"Storage.\" This aligns with the mention of storage, which is a key concern in the ticket.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering how to classify this IT ticket, and it could potentially fit into various categories like Storage, Internal Project, or Hardware. The mention of \"instances\" suggests virtual machines, and requests for location specs, cores, and snapshots indicate storage-related tasks. \"Internal Project\" might work for ongoing tasks, but I think \"Storage\" is the best match due to the emphasis on snapshots and storage needs. The ticket relates closely to hardware resources and storage management. So, I'll classify it under \"Storage.\"**Deciding on the IT ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket and think \"Storage\" might be the closest category, especially since it mentions \"storage\" and \"snapshots.\" However, the context is about restoring instances, which are essentially virtual machines. \"Hardware\" focuses on physical servers while \"Storage\" pertains to storage resources. Given the emphasis on storage and CPU specs, I think \"Storage\" fits best. Yet, since it involves a service restore exercise, \"Internal Project\" could also apply. Ultimately, I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" due to the nature of the task.**Formatting the JSON output**\n\nI see that there's a \"senior engineer\" mention, but it seems more like a signature. The instructions guide me to create a JSON-like object with a category field, and the schema specifies what needs to be included. I think \"Internal Project\" is the best choice since it relates to a service restore exercise, clearly a project task. I should ensure the output is valid JSON, so I'll structure it as follows:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI'll keep it simple since the user just requested the category without needing further justification."
