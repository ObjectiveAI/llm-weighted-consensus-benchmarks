I\u2019ll ensure to output this in JSON format with a string enumerating the selected category. It's essential to follow the guidelines carefully for accuracy!**Classifying Android ticket**\n\nThe ticket content explains that there are failures with Android jobs and build tools versions. Since this isn't related to hardware, HR, access, storage, purchase, or an internal project, I\u2019m narrowing it down. Based on the information about software build failures, it seems to fall under \"Miscellaneous.\" There's no specific \"Software\" category provided, so I think categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" makes the most sense here!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe categories list doesn't include Software or DevOps, so I\u2019m considering \"Internal Project\" since the ticket discusses Android jobs and builds, which align with a project. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" don\u2019t seem relevant here. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too generic, and given that the ticket focuses on a failing Android build pipeline, categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" makes the most sense. I\u2019ll confirm that by responding with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nI need to return a JSON object with a \"category\" field set to one of the allowed strings. Based on my reasoning, I\u2019ll specify: {\"category\":\"Internal Project.\"} It's clear that I should keep the response straightforward and provide just the answer without any extra text. That\u2019ll make everything clean and efficient!"
