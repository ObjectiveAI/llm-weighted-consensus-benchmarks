The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. The message seems to be a request for help with completing the onboarding form. It likely relates to HR Support or Access, possibly even Administrative rights since it involves a new starter who needs assistance. I need to ensure I categorize it correctly for proper handling!**Evaluating IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nThe user mentions \"new starter\" and \"starter form,\" which likely indicates they're requesting help with HR paperwork rather than IT access. However, since this is an IT ticket, categorizing it under \"Access\" could be appropriate if it relates to provisioning. That said, \"HR Support\" fits best for onboarding forms. The user's request for assistance in completing the form is clearly HR-related, so I think I should categorize this ticket as \"HR Support.\"**Preparing JSON Response for IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m ready to categorize the ticket under \"HR Support.\" It looks like I need to respond with a JSON object based on the provided schema. The properties section specifies that the category should be a string from the given enum. So, my output will be straightforward: I\u2019ll create a JSON object with the category field set to \"HR Support.\" I just want to ensure it aligns perfectly with the expected format! Here\u2019s how it\u2019ll look: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
