The ticket talks about customizing issue types, permissions, and admin rights. It seems related to Jira-like issue tracker customization, so the best categories seem to be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\". Given that it specifically mentions admin rights and permissions, \"Administrative rights\" appears to be the most suitable choice.**Outputting Category in JSON**\n\nThe task is about managing permissions and custom fields, so I'll categorize it as either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" I'm going to output the JSON category as {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}. The instruction is clear about using a single object with the \"category\" key and its allowed values. I should keep it minimal and only provide this JSON object without additional text or justification, as that's what has been requested."
