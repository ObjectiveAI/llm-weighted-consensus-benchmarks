They're discussing an \"ownership change on address update,\" \"temporally adding myself,\" and \"phone number poll setup.\" These elements suggest they might need help with permissions and access rights. The most appropriate categories seem to be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" as it relates to managing ownership or account properties. So, I\u2019ll classify this ticket in the Access category for clarity.**Classifying the ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s message emphasizes access control and ownership transfer, mentioning phrases like \"make owner others\" and \"temporally add myself.\" This leads me to believe that the best category is \"Access,\" since it focuses on permissions and changes in ownership. While \"Administrative rights\" pertains more to system admin privileges, this ticket seems more general. I need to ensure to format my response correctly in JSON as: {\"category\":\"Access\"} following the required structure. So, I'll output just the JSON object.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
