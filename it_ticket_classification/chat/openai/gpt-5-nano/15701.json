It mentions things like \"new project code,\" \"pm form,\" and \"attached form\" along with creating something in Denmark. This could indicate it\u2019s about an \"Internal Project,\" especially since it\u2019s discussing a new project code. However, if it\u2019s about asking for the best settings, it might also fit under \"Administrative rights.\" I'm not entirely sure which category is best!**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking this ticket might fit \"Administrative rights\" because of the permissions related to attaching a form, but it's not clear. I have to choose one category, and the best fit appears to be \"Internal Project\" since it directly references a new project code. I need to produce a JSON response for this category. So, I\u2019ll structure it like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I'll make sure this is the only content in my response!**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that this ticket likely falls under \"Internal Project,\" which seems the safest choice. Although \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option if things were unclear, I want to stick with the best fit. The instructions specify that I need to output just the category object without any added explanations. So, I\u2019ll respond with the simple JSON: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That\u2019s all\u2014no extra text, just delivering what\u2019s needed!"
