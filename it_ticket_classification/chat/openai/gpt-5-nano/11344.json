There are several mentioned categories such as \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and so on. It seems that the user is looking for clarification and possibly new subtypes related to their project. I should consider which of the existing categories the ticket best fits into.**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nI need to determine which category fits best for this ticket that discusses changing project subtypes and introducing a new subtype. It seems connected to project management, and given the information, \"Internal Project\" might be a suitable option. They mentioned terms like \"indirect central\" and \"cost centre,\" which hint at financial mapping. It doesn\u2019t really relate to hardware, storage, or access issues. \"Administrative rights\" could apply if there were permissions involved, but it's not a perfect match. Overall, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best choice!**Outputting Category in JSON**\n\nI see that the user's request involves assigning a new subtype and addressing configuration aspects in the project system. Based on the information, it makes sense to categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project.\" I need to format my response as JSON, ensuring the exact capitalization is correct. The final output will be straightforward:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI won\u2019t add any extra explanations unless the user asks for them, so I\u2019ll stick to this output."
