It mentions details around the leaver form, and various aspects involving roles, access rights, and hardware, among other things. I'll sift through the content to find the most relevant category. From the list provided\u2014 \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights\"\u2014I think \"HR Support\" is the most fitting choice given the context.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI need to classify this ticket into one clear category. The content revolves around a \"leaver form\" for an employee, mentioning various details like leave date, location, mailbox, and IT access changes. It seems to center on deprovisioning related to access rights, which leads me to think about the category. \"Access\" seems to be the best fit since it pertains to user access revocation, including AD rights and mailbox management. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also apply here. Ultimately, \"Access\" feels the most appropriate due to its broader scope.{\"category\":\"Access\"}Access"
