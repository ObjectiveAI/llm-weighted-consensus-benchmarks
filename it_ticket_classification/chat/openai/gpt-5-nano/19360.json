The ticket mentions \"federation status\" and seems to involve access to certain connections between companies, likely related to authentication or SAML federation. Given the list of available categories, it sounds like \u201cAccess\u201d is the most fitting choice. The user seems to be inquiring about access control, so that\u2019s where I\u2019ll place the ticket.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nThe ticket could also fall under \"Internal Project\" if it relates to implementing federation. However, the user seems to be specifically asking for the federation status on Friday afternoon, focusing on how both companies can connect without formal admission. It clearly relates to access control and federation status. So, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" Now, I need to output a JSON object with the category specified as \"Access.\" Here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
