The options I have for categorization include categories like \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d Since it\u2019s about a software tool, I\u2019m inclined to go with \u201cAccess\u201d if it involves login issues, but \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d makes sense due to the ambiguity of the message. I could go either way with the classification!**Clarifying categorization questions**\n\nI think it might be helpful to ask the user some clarifying questions. Since they want to categorize the IT ticket, my best guess is \"Miscellaneous\" due to its non-specific nature. However, if there's an access issue related to Confluence, \"Access\" could be fitting. The phrase \"si la confluence\" suggests they might want to access it, but without more details, \"Miscellaneous\" feels safer. I\u2019ll respond using a JSON format as shown in the guidelines.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, which requires me to respond with a JSON object format. The text mentions \"Confluence,\" but it's unclear if it relates to \"Access\" or another category. While \"Internal Project\" could fit if it's about a specific space, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the safest default choice in this case. I\u2019ll stick to the schema requirements and respond directly with: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} \n\nNo extra commentary is needed!"
