I\u2019m considering \"Access\" because it relates to a portal, but it feels more aligned with \"Internal Project\" since it\u2019s about a disputes portal. The options are somewhat unclear. Ultimately, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" if the mention of portal access is strong enough. But the wording is vague.**Classifying project urgency**\n\nThe user wants to extend a date related to PM, emphasizing the high importance of user experience. I\u2019m considering classifying this as \"Administrative rights\" since it deals with deadlines, but that doesn't fit as well. \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best category since it references a portal, dispute, and urgency. I\u2019ll prepare my response as a JSON object with the category clearly noted. So, it will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} as required."
