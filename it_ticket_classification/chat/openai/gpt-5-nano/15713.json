The text discusses upload size limits and file restrictions, mentioning terms like \"upload size available\" and \"limitations uploading files.\" This suggests the most fitting category is likely Storage since it relates to file storage. Access could be another option, but Administrative rights, Internal Project, Hardware, and Purchase don't apply here.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI'm reviewing whether to categorize the ticket as HR Support, Access, or Internal Project. Access hints at permissions but doesn't quite fit. Given the discussion around uploading files, size limits, and restrictions, it leans towards Storage. I believe \"Storage\" is the right choice since it directly addresses upload size and limitations. I should classify it as Storage and consider mentioning the details about upload limits while also asking for any needed clarification. Finally, I'll format my response as a JSON object with \"category\": \"Storage.\""
