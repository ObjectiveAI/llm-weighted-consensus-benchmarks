The ticket is about removing proposals due to a high priority, with the next approver on holiday until July, which interrupts approvals. It doesn't fit hardware, storage, or purchasing categories. It seems like it could relate to either \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or perhaps \"Miscellaneous,\" depending on how I interpret the internal process involved.**Analyzing IT ticket category**\n\nI see that the categories include \"Administrative rights,\" which usually pertains to permissions, but this ticket is about deleting proposals and doesn\u2019t involve user access. \"Internal Project\" might fit if it relates to project workflows. \"Miscellaneous\" feels like a catch-all option. The user mentions needing to delete proposals and prioritize them due to an approver being on holiday until July. There's no clear mention of a system, so it might lean more towards \"Miscellaneous\" since admin rights are not explicitly required.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ve determined that the best category for this ticket is likely \"Internal Project\" since it\u2019s about managing workflows for proposals, especially with the approver's holiday and looming deadlines. The user is simply asking for a categorization, not a solution, which means I need to present this in a specific JSON-like format. The schema indicates I should output just the category string, so I\u2019ll respond with the appropriate category in that required JSON format.**Determining JSON output**\n\nI need to populate the \"category\" field with appropriate values and decide if it should be \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The ticket's content focuses on deleting proposals and handling approvals, which aligns more closely with \"Internal Project\" since it involves project activity. Given the guidelines, I will stick to the specified structure without extra text. I\u2019m set to respond just with the JSON object: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
