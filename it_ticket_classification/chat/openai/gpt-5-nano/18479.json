It mentions \"new locations\" and \"added Germany,\" but the details are a bit unclear. It could fit under \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Parsing it further, I gather that it likely pertains to a request to add two new locations in Germany, suggesting it relates to an internal project. I'll choose a category that seems to best match this situation!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket and think it may correspond to \"Internal Project\" since it mentions implementing new locations. It could also fit under \"Administrative Rights\" if admin permission is needed to add locations or \"Access\" if there's a request for VPN access. The phrase \"new locations Saturday March PM\" suggests some scheduling details. Given the ambiguity, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Internal Project,\" as it looks like a request to update the system with new locations in Germany.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI think I'll choose \"Internal Project\" because it aligns with a task for adding new locations. However, \"Miscellaneous\" could also work due to some ambiguity in the request. The ticket mentions \"two locations added in Germany,\" indicating it's a request related to updating a system, not hardware, which supports the \"Internal Project\" classification. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object following the specified schema, outputting just the category. Here's what it will look like: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
