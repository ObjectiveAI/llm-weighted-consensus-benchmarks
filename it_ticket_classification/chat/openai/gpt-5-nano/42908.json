The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. I should review the content of the ticket carefully to determine which category fits best. This will help ensure the ticket is directed to the right team for resolution. I'll take my time to assess the details appropriately!**Identifying email bounce issues**\n\nIt looks like the user sent a lengthy text about a bounced email issue related to sprint planning materials. Key phrases like \"delivery failing,\" \"address keeps bouncing back,\" and \"undeliverable\" indicate problems. The message also mentions \"resolver authentication required,\" which suggests potential access restrictions. I need to investigate what went wrong with the address and why it's not working properly. This seems like something I can help resolve by checking the email server diagnostics and settings!**Categorizing email issues**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the email delivery issues the user described. The available categories include Access, Administrative Rights, Internal Project, Storage, Miscellaneous, Purchase, and Hardware. It seems like \"Miscellaneous\" could be the best fit since it's a catch-all. However, I wonder if \"Access\" applies due to the mention of address restrictions. Ultimately, since the user is asking for a category, I should categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" to keep it straightforward for routing.**Formatting category as JSON**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket related to email delivery issues, specifically involving bounced emails and authentication errors. The necessary format is a JSON object that specifies the category. Given the available options, I'll select \"Miscellaneous\" to capture the nature of the problem. It's important to ensure I follow the JSON schema precisely for compatibility. So, I'll provide the response as a valid JSON object, focusing solely on that requirement without additional notes. Here we go:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
