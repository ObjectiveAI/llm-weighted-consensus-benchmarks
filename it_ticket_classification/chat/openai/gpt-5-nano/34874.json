The ticket mentions issues related to Oracle and a submission problem with cards, which is a bit unclear. It seems to involve administrative rights or access issues. According to the category options provided \u2014 like Access, Administrative Rights, and Miscellaneous \u2014 it sounds like this situation most likely fits the \u201cAccess\u201d category. I'll format this response in a JSON object reflecting that choice.**Choosing the best category for IT issues**\n\nThe user mentions a \u201csubmit button displaying\u201d issue. This could indicate a problem with \u201cAccess\u201d since it relates to submission permissions. However, if it\u2019s about needing permission to submit, \u201cAdministrative Rights\u201d might be more fitting. I also need to consider the message about Oracle; it could refer to the Oracle database or E-Business Suite. Given the unclear context, I'm leaning towards \u201cAccess\u201d due to potential login or navigation problems while keeping \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d as a fallback if nothing fits perfectly.**Determining the correct category**\n\nAmong the options, \"Access\" seems to fit best since the user can't perform actions due to the submit button not being displayed. It's about their ability to submit cards, which relates primarily to permissions. However, since they can see the page, it might not strictly fall under access rights. If they're lacking rights, \"Administrative rights\" could apply. Still, it sounds more like a functional issue. Overall, I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate category given the context, but \"Miscellaneous\" is the fallback.**Finalizing the category selection**\n\nThe user\u2019s message about \u201cissues with Oracle\u201d suggests they\u2019ve been out of the office from October to December. The mention of \u201ccards\u201d likely refers to expense cards that need to be submitted in Oracle. Since there\u2019s no specific category for financial submissions, I think \u201cAccess\u201d fits best due to the issue with the submit button. I\u2019ll prepare the response in structured JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, ensuring it complies with the required schema.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
