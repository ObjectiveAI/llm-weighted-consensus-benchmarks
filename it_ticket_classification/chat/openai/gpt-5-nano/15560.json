The keywords include \"project setup,\" \"pm,\" \"code,\" \"forecasting,\" \"test strategy,\" and more. This suggests it's related to project management and client needs. So, I'm looking at the available categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the emphasis on project setup and test strategy along with code attachment, it seems this fits best into the \"Internal Project\" category.**Responding with category in JSON**\n\nIt looks like I should categorize the IT ticket based on the given schema. The message includes phrases like \"assigned pm\" and \"short notice,\" but mainly it's about project setup, which aligns with the \"Internal Project\" category. Since the instruction specifies to respond with a JSON object for the category, I\u2019ll format it appropriately. The correct response is:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}  \n\nI\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra commentary \u2014 just the required category object."
