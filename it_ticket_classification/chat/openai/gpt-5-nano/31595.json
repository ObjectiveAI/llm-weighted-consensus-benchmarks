From what I can gather, it seems related to \"new client setup\" and possibly involves Oracle Project Management. Given the context, I'd categorize it under 'client onboarding' or 'new client setup' since it mentions tasks like creating a client, filling out forms, and needing additional information. I'll sort it properly to make it easier to handle!**Categorizing access issues**\n\nThe IT ticket could fall under \"Access\" because it likely involves granting access rights for the new client setup. It might also fit \"Administrative rights\" if it requests elevated permissions. Given the details like \u201ccreate client by himself,\u201d \u201csetup form,\u201d and \u201cpre-code,\u201d it seems appropriate to categorize it as an \u201cAccess\u201d ticket while considering internal project aspects. I\u2019ll respond with JSON format for the category: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}` to ensure clarity!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
