Given the mention of leaver processes, weekly submissions, and approvals, it seems related to HR procedures. I\u2019m considering whether to classify it under \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights,\" since both could fit. I'll need to be careful to make the right choice, ensuring it aligns with the issues described in the ticket text.**Categorizing IT ticket correctly**\n\nI notice terms like \"marked leaver app\" and \"leaver,\" which suggest it's an HR-related issue since \"leaver\" typically refers to an employee who has left. There\u2019s also a mention of submitting something weekly, which points to HR processes. While I initially considered \"Internal Project\" or \"Access,\" it seems most fitting to categorize this as \"HR Support.\" Since the allowed categories definitely include \"HR Support,\" I\u2019ll confidently categorize the ticket that way, ensuring I follow the required JSON output format.**Finalizing category output**\n\nThe prompt is clear that I need to categorize the IT ticket and provide the output as a JSON object. The \"category\" value should be a string, specifically \"HR Support.\" While I considered options like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" those don't fit well with the context of employee processes and compliance described in the ticket. Since it\u2019s clearly related to HR practices, I'll finalize the JSON object with \"HR Support\" and ensure it follows the specified format.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m ready to respond with the necessary JSON format, specifying the category as \"HR Support.\" I need to ensure that I\u2019m outputting just the JSON object, without any additional text or information. The only property here is the category, so I\u2019ll keep it simple and clear. Okay, let's confirm the output will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}, just as required. I think I\u2019m all set to provide that response!"
