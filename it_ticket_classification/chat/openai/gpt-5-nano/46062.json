The user message seems to be about issues with an annual leave request being stuck, and the manager isn\u2019t receiving anything. This incident could fall under \"HR Support\" since it's related to a HR system, but it could also be regarding \"Access\" to the portal or \"Administrative rights.\" The content suggests it\u2019s more HR-related, so \"HR Support\" feels like the most fitting category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s message mentions a \"portal\" and issues with the manager receiving leave requests, indicating it's a problem within the HR system. I think \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category since it deals with leave requests. \"Access\" could apply if there were login issues, and \"Administrative rights\" seems relevant if the user can\u2019t submit requests. However, given the specific context about the portal, \u201cHR Support\u201d feels like the right choice. Now, I need to format this as a JSON-like object.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
