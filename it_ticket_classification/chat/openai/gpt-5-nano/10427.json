The message includes phrases like \"new starter\" and \"create his credentials,\" which strongly suggest it's related to account access. Given these clues, I should classify this ticket under \"Access,\" as it involves setting up access for someone who\u2019s just accepted a job offer.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to categorize an IT ticket regarding a new starter. While \"HR Support\" could fit due to onboarding, \"Access\" seems more appropriate since it involves user credentials. The request states to create his credentials, which aligns directly with IT tasks. I need to output a JSON object for this category, ensuring it\u2019s correctly formatted with \"Access\" as the category name. So, my final output will be:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
