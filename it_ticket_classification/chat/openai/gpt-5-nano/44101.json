The user's message is a bit messy, mentioning issues about opening documents related to perhaps \"new hi\" or \"new HI.\" They've brought up infrastructure problems, consultants, budgetary concerns, browsers like Chrome and Safari, and a painful downloading process. There\u2019s also a mention of downloading copies through a files section ribbon. I\u2019ll determine the best-fitting category from this jumbled information!**Categorizing Access Issues**\n\nThe user is inquiring about the ability to preview items and mentions needing to open documents to check downloads. They reference an attached document and ask for advice on accessing a site. It looks like they\u2019re struggling with accessing documents and uploading them through different browsers. Given the focus on opening documents and access issues, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \u201cAccess.\u201d That seems to capture the main concerns here!**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI need to output the IT Ticket in the required JSON format, which is straightforward. The instruction is to categorize this ticket, so the final result should be a JSON object with the category specified. I\u2019ll keep my explanation minimal since steps aren\u2019t necessary. \n\nHere it is: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI think that gets it right, and it follows the user's requirements perfectly!"
