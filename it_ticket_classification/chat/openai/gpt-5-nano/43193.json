The user's message mentions an \"Oracle request,\" approver issues, notifications, and details about approvals, which leads me to think this is related to Access. However, since it could also pertain to \"Administrative rights\" due to the context of access control, I have to choose carefully between these two categories before proceeding.**Choosing the right category**\n\nThis ticket is about the approver for an Oracle access request and the notification to the line manager, which falls under access control workflow. It doesn't relate to hardware, storage, or purchasing. While \"Administrative rights\" might relate to elevated permissions, the user's wording doesn't indicate that, focusing instead on the approver and notifications. Since the ticket is primarily about access request approvals in Oracle, \"Access\" fits best. I think it's best to respond with a JSON object for that category type.**Outputting the category**\n\nThe prompt asks me to categorize this IT ticket and provide the output in a JSON format. Since I'm instructed to focus strictly on the category field, I will note it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nI need to ensure that it\u2019s correctly formatted without any extra text. So, I'll double-check the punctuation and structure to confirm that it adheres to the required format. Alright, here goes: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
