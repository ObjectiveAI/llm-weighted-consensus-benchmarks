The user mentions \"monitors,\" which makes me think about the \"Hardware\" category. However, since they say \"please provide monitors,\" it could also fit in \"Purchase\" for new equipment requests. I also consider it could be \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" In typical categorization, \"Hardware\" usually describes existing issues, while \"Purchase\" relates to acquiring new items.**Categorizing the request**\n\nThe user\u2019s request to \"please provide monitors\" suggests they are looking to acquire monitors, which points us to the \"Purchase\" category. Since \"Procurement\" isn\u2019t listed, \"Purchase\" is the best fit. Now, I need to format my response as a JSON object according to the given schema. It looks like I should make sure to have the \"category\" key with the value \"Purchase.\" I'll output it like this: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}."
