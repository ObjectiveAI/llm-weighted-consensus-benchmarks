The references to \"new starter,\" \"information about joiner,\" and \"administrator\" suggest this might be about onboarding a new employee and requesting access to systems. Since \"joiner\" refers to a new hire, it fits under \u201cAccess\u201d for user provisioning. However, the mention of \"new starter\" also implies potential \"HR Support.\" Both categories seem relevant here.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI see that the categories are limited and \"HR Support\" fits HR queries, but this IT ticket about a new starter and access seems to be best categorized as \"Access.\" The user\u2019s message indicates they have an attachment with details about the joiner, which suggests they need accounts and permissions. While \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant, there's no explicit request for those. Thus, I think \"Access\" is the most fitting choice, and I'll format the output accordingly.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
