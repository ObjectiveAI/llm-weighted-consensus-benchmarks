The provided categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and more. The ticket text seems a bit jumbled, mentioning access to an \"open relay pm\" and a \"zone awards application.\" It sounds like the user is requesting access to a system, possibly needing administrative rights. I'm not fully certain about the specifics, but I think it might fit into the Access category.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nThe user mentions \"special configurations\" and \"thanks\" to a developer. I think the best category for this ticket is \"Access,\" since it focuses on permissions. There\u2019s a mention of \"open relay,\" suggesting it involves a relay server for an application. However, since they also talk about \"administrative rights,\" there could be a need for elevated privileges. It seems like they're requesting access for multiple users, likely needing administrative rights for configurations, but I\u2019ll stick with Access as the primary classification.**Preparing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to respond with a JSON object that includes a \"category\" key. The allowed values are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Given the context of the ticket, \"Access\" feels like the most appropriate category. So, I'll output just the JSON object with that value: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to remember not to add extra comments or information beyond this!"
