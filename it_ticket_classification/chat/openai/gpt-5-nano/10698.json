Time to get this organized!**Interpreting IT Ticket**\n\nI see the message mentions various phrases like \"new po,\" \"purchased,\" and \"mandatory receipts section.\" It seems related to a purchase order for a backpack, which is a little clearer. The keywords suggest it involves handling receipts and possibly requesting some information. Among the available categories, \"Purchase\" fits best because of the focus on acquiring an item and the mention of receipts. I'll respond with a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} to categorize it properly.**Confirming JSON Format**\n\nI need to ensure my output matches the specified format for categorizing the IT ticket. The schema requires responding with a JSON object that includes a \"category\" field with one of the allowed values. In this case, I'm settling on {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} based on what the ticket suggests. Even though there's some complexity about the \"type\" wrapper, I think I can stick with the straightforward response. So, I'll follow the instructions carefully and present the final output as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
