It seems to be about changing or adding something related to \"pm,\" which could mean project management or performance management. \"Mobile pm\" might relate to mobile password management? There\u2019s a mention of a holiday and changing existing codes, which makes it tricky. I\u2019m considering categories like Access, Administrative rights, or even Miscellaneous to assign it appropriately. Let's analyze and decide!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis ticket seems focused on changing codes and access rights. With phrases like \"change existing pm code\" and \"mobile code,\" it looks like it falls under Access or Administrative rights. While Administrative rights might imply elevating privileges, this ticket is more about changing codes. So, I think \"Access\" fits best. Now I need to output this in the required format, which is a JSON object detailing the chosen category. I'll respond with that JSON object!**Producing JSON output**\n\nI need to make sure to include the exact string for the chosen category, which is \"Access.\" The template indicates I should provide a JSON object in a specific format. I\u2019ll format it correctly as {\"category\":\"Access\"} because that's what the system expects. It\u2019s important that there's no extra text, so I'll just produce the JSON object clearly and concisely, giving the output they want. Let's stick to the required format!"
