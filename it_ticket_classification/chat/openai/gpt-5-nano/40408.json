Given this context, the best classification seems to be Access, as it relates to remote connectivity. However, it could also fit under Miscellaneous if I'm unsure. But Access feels right!**Responding with JSON object**\n\nI need to respond to a prompt by providing a JSON object. The instructions specify that I should categorize an IT ticket and output the result as a JSON-like format. The allowed values include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Access,\" among others. Since the ticket pertains to a connectivity issue, I\u2019ve settled on \"Access\" as the category. I\u2019ll ensure my response is valid JSON\u2014just the category without any extra text. So, I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
