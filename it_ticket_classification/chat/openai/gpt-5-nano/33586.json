It seems clear that the ticket is primarily about a purchase related to IT, so the \"Purchase\" category seems to fit best. While I considered \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" those don\u2019t match as well since the focus is specifically on procurement and installation.The appropriate category for this request is \"Purchase.\" I should return a JSON object with the category field set to \"Purchase.\" The required format specifies that it should be an object. The correct output, then, is simply:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nI want to make sure I'm following the instructions accurately and not including any extra information. The focus is just on providing that concise JSON object that fits the requirements. Let's keep it straightforward!"
