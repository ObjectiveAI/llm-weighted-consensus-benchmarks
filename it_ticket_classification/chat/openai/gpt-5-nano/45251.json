The ticket's content seems a bit jumbled but refers to a missing timesheet and issues with the submission and approval process. It mentions deadlines for weekly submissions, notifying managers, and training resources. Overall, the issues revolve around time sheet submission, weekly deadlines, and the approval process. I need to classify this ticket accordingly.**Categorizing IT Ticket as HR Support**\n\nAs I'm thinking about categorizing this ticket, it seems to fit best in the \"HR Support\" category based on its content about human resources processes. While I briefly considered other categories like \"Administrative rights,\" it clearly leans towards HR. The user prompted me to categorize the ticket and expected a structured JSON response. So, I\u2019ll output just the necessary JSON format without any extra text. Here\u2019s the response:  \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
