Based on the details, it seems there's a mixture of hardware and software issues. References to \"cables\" and \"screens\" indicate potential hardware problems, while \"hanging during builds\" might suggest software. Since it's a bit unclear, I could categorize it under \"Hardware\" due to the mention of cables and screens.**Determining JSON format**\n\nI think \"Hardware\" is the right category for the IT ticket, so I need to respond with that in the JSON format. \n\nHowever, I realize the required output format is more complex than just a string. It has to be a JSON object that includes a \"category\" property within it, which can contain specific enumerated options like \"Hardware.\" \n\nSo, to clarify, I'll wrap the \"Hardware\" category in the correct schema, ensuring it fits the requirements outlined.**Formatting response**\n\nThe response needs to be in the format of `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. The \"category\" key should be at the top level with the value \"Hardware.\" \n\nThe earlier schema descriptions were just metadata and not meant to be included in the output. \n\nSince the user explicitly asked to categorize the IT ticket, I think it's best to keep things simple and just provide the JSON response without additional notes, following the instructions closely. So, I'll output: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`."
