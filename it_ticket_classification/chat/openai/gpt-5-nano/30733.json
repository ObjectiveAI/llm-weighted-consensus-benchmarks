The user might need access or support for it. The mention of \"Thursday\" is unclear; perhaps they're asking about a schedule. Overall, it could fit into categories like Access, Internal Project, or Miscellaneous.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI think the category for this ticket is likely \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access\" if the user seeks to access the Oracle Expenses app. The confusing phrase \"hi give please please also means thanks\" isn't very helpful. It seems \"Oracle Expenses app\" refers to a software application, and if they\u2019re asking about scheduling something on Thursday, it further adds ambiguity. Since they don't clearly state access issues, I\u2019ll lean towards categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" to keep it safe.**Finalizing category assignment**\n\nIt seems like we could ask a clarifying question, but since the task is to categorize the IT ticket, I need to stick to a single category. The user's message is a bit vague, especially with \"hi give please please also means thanks.\" However, the phrase \"oracle expenses app\" suggests they might be looking for access to the Oracle Expenses App, possibly for something on Thursday. Based on this ambiguity, I'll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" and respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} \n\nIt\u2019s important to ensure the format is correct!"
