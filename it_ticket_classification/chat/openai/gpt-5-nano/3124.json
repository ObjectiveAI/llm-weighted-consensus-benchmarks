It\u2019s important to make the right choice so that the team can address it effectively and quickly.**Interpreting IT ticket details**\n\nThe user shared a block of text about an IT ticket related to \"oracle report enhancement.\" It seems to cover enhancements for reports, such as adding filters and parameters, running reports, and working with Excel. I need to make sure I understand all the specifics mentioned, like the request for additional parameters and the need to copy the report format. It's crucial to dig into this so I can assist with any necessary actions or communicate effectively with the team.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt looks like this task is related to software development or database reporting. I need to categorize the ticket, and the best fit seems to be \"Internal Project,\" given that it's about enhancing Oracle reports through parameters and filters. Other categories like \"Miscellaneous\" could also be relevant, but \"Internal Project\" appears to be the most appropriate for development tasks. So I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object with the category set as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
