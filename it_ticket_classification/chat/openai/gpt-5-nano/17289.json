The user provided a request related to project setup and forms, mentioning \"attach completed setup form\" and \"thursday pm setup.\" \n\nIt seems like it could fit several categories like \"Internal Project\", \"Access\", or potentially \"Administrative rights\", but I need to confirm the best fit based on the content.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis ticket is clearly about setting up a project and involves obtaining a project manager name/code, attaching a setup form, and referencing links to forms and policies. It seems like an administrative task related to an internal project, which makes \"Internal Project\" a strong contender for the category. However, \"Access\" could also fit since the mention of \"assign\" typically implies giving permission. Ultimately, I'll need to categorize it appropriately in a JSON format.**Deciding on category**\n\nThe best category for this ticket appears to be \"Internal Project\" since it revolves around the project setup. I suspect \"PAS\" in \"pas project setup\" might refer to \"Project Administration System.\" Although \"Access\" could also fit because of mentions like \"attach completed setup form\" and \"please assign,\" the specifics lean more toward internal project management rather than direct access rights. So, I'll format the final answer as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
