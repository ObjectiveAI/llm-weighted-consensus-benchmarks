The urgency and mention of reports imply they're seeking access rights possibly related to onboarding or permissions. From the allowed categories, the most fitting seems to be \"Access,\" since it revolves around granting access and necessary rights. I'll ensure to format my output as a JSON for clarity.**Determining the category**\n\nIt seems like the \"Access\" category is the right fit for this IT ticket, as it primarily revolves around access permissions rather than specific administrative rights. The mention of \"expected rights by default\" makes me think it leans more towards general access. While \"Administrative rights\" could be applicable, the user is looking for a straightforward categorization, not a resolution. So, I'll format my response to be in the JSON structure, specifying: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That keeps things clear and aligned with the requirements.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
