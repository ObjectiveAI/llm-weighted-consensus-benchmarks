The text mentions an administrator and seems focused on pricing issues. I\u2019m considering several categories: \"Purchase\" seems most fitting because it relates to cost and budget. However, it could also touch on \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Ultimately, I'll focus on \"Purchase\" since it aligns best with the context of expense discussion.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text, which touches on costs related to a daily data plan. While there are many potential categories like \"Administrative rights,\" it seems clear that \"Purchase\" is the best fit since it revolves around cost and deals. The mention of an administrator suggests a request for assistance but ultimately doesn't change the categorization focus. So, I'll categorize it as \"Purchase\" and format my response neatly as a JSON-like object: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}.**Confirming the category format**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize the IT ticket, and the response should be in JSON format. Based on the content, I'll classify it as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. While \"Administrative rights\" might be a consideration\u2014since the ticket mentions an administrator\u2014the core focus is clearly on cost. So, \"Purchase\" is definitely the best fit. I'll keep my response straightforward and minimal, just presenting the required JSON object."
