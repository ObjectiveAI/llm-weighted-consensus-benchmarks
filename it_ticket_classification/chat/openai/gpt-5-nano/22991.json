The user\u2019s ticket mentions Tableau views, updates, and scripts, with a note about confidential information. However, it seems the available categories don\u2019t specifically include \"Applications\" or \"Software.\" Given the context of the message, I think \"Internal Project\" fits best based on the focus on updates and reports.**Categorizing Tableau Update Request**\n\nThe content focuses on updating Tableau views and scripts, which falls under Software/Application. However, my category options are limited. \"Internal Project\" seems like a strong fit due to its focus on updating dashboards and scripts. There\u2019s also a confidentiality notice, suggesting it\u2019s a sensitive matter. I briefly considered \"Access\" if it\u2019s related to Tableau permissions, but the core of the request is about updates. I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" since it aligns best with the nature of the ticket.**Crafting JSON Category Response**\n\nIt sounds like this could be a development task and definitely fits as an internal project. I need to respond with a JSON-like format specifying the category. The instructions indicate I should produce a simple JSON object with the category field filled in as \"Internal Project.\" \n\nSo, I\u2019ll format it correctly without any extra text. The response will look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} to match the schema exactly and fulfill the user's request!"
