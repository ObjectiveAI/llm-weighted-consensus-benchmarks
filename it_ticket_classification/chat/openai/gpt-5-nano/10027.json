So it seems like it falls under \"Access\" since it\u2019s about granting access rights. Although \"Administrative rights\" could fit too, it seems like the focus is more on regular access rather than administrative privileges. So I'm leaning towards \"Access\" for categorization.**Classifying access request**\n\nI see the phrase \"Oracle access rights,\" suggesting a request for access, likely for a junior or starter rather than administrative privileges. The user didn\u2019t specify admin rights, only \"access rights,\" so \"Access\" seems to be the right category. I need to format my response as a JSON object with the category field. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'm confirming \"Access\" is an allowed value. So, let\u2019s finalize it with just the required JSON output.**Determining access rights category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the phrase \"oracle access rights,\" which suggests it's asking for access to Oracle, not necessarily for admin privileges. So, categorizing it as \"Access\" seems the safest option. I want to answer succinctly and clearly, so I'll stick to that. Keeping it simple helps ensure I communicate effectively. Now I just need to produce my response in the required format!"
