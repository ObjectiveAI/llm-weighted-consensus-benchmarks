I want to make sure I choose the most appropriate one based on the ticket's context. It's important to get it right to streamline the process. OK, let's consider details in the ticket that might help guide me toward the right category!**Interpreting license request**\n\nIt seems I have a user request related to procuring Adder licenses for series wireless controllers or access points. The message includes various details about existing licenses and what additional licenses they might need. There's an emphasis on combining licenses and ensuring proper installation, which is crucial. I want to make sure I capture all the essential elements from this request to assist effectively. It\u2019s all about getting the right licenses for their needs!**Categorizing license procurement**\n\nThe request is about procuring licenses, particularly adder licenses for access points, and it involves combining numbers. I\u2019m debating whether to categorize this under Purchase or Access. The mention of \"raise ticket\" for purchasing suggests that \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category. Since it's about licenses rather than hardware setups, I\u2019ll choose that. I need to respond with a JSON object formatted to specify the category clearly. So, I'll go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"} \n\nLet\u2019s get that delivered!"
