It seems likely to be hardware-related, so \"Hardware\" makes the most sense. Although it could potentially fit under \"Purchase\" if they were asking to buy something, the request isn't explicit about that. \"Miscellaneous\" could apply if it\u2019s too vague, but I think \"Hardware\" is clearly the best choice here. I'll go with that!**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket with a JSON object as stated in the instructions. The category schema specifies options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others, so I'll choose \"Hardware\" for this ticket. Since it emphasizes hardware components like cables and adapters, it fits perfectly. I consider adding a note, but the format strictly says to output just the JSON. So the final response will be exactly: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. That's clear and concise!"
