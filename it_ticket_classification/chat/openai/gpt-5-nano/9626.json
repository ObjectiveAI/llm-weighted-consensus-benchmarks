It seems the ticket relates to administrative tasks in ServiceNow, making \"Administrative rights\" a strong candidate since it's about assignment groups and templates. However, I also considered \"Internal Project\" if it pertains to a specific project. \"Miscellaneous\" is always there as a fallback. Ultimately, I think \"Administrative rights\" best fits. I\u2019ll format the output in the required JSON-like structure.{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
