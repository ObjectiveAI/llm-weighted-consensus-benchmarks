However, terms like \"automation robotics\" and \"gift card campaign\" imply business operations instead of IT. While \"Purchase\" fits procurement aspects, \"Internal Project\" may serve better for broader context. I need to choose the category based on what's most fitting given the content.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user is asking to categorize a ticket about changing contracts effective from July. While it's not entirely clear if they want to take further action, they only explicitly requested categorization. I believe \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since it covers various tasks like designs and development. \"HR Support\" seems inappropriate since it\u2019s focused on annual leave and not relevant here. \"Miscellaneous\" could work, but precision is needed, so I'll go with \"Internal Project\" and format it neatly in JSON.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
