The main point here is that there\u2019s a significant cable issue preventing access, and I should ask for further investigation into it.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this issue. It\u2019s about access to resources and cables, which fits well within the \"Access\" category. According to the provided category schema, I need to respond with a JSON object. The format specifies I should only include the category without any extra commentary. So, I\u2019ll output the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.
