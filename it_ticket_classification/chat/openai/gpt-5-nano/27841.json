I'm thinking this could fall under HR Support, Access, or Administrative rights since it involves scheduling and possibly filling out documentation for a new starter. Overall, it seems related to handling onboarding processes efficiently.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe phrase \"please fill enclosed\" suggests there's a form that needs to be completed, likely related to onboarding a new starter. I'm considering categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given that it involves Oracle access, I think \"Access\" might be the best fit, as it's about system access on a specific date. However, the mention of filling a form for onboarding could also lead me toward \"Administrative rights.\" It\u2019s tricky! I want to choose the most appropriate option.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI think \"Access\" is the best category since it relates to provisioning access to Oracle for the new starter. \"HR Support\" is relevant for onboarding but lacks specific HR content. \"Administrative rights\" focuses on admin rights, which doesn\u2019t quite fit here either. \n\nThe system requires a JSON object to categorize the ticket. I need to respond with {\"category\":\"Access\"} while considering if the user expects a simpler, human-friendly answer. Outputting as required!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
