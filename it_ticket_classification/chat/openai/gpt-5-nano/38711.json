The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, and a few others. It seems this issue relates to a keyboard, which fits under Hardware. However, I\u2019m also considering if it could be seen as a software or access issue, but those aren\u2019t explicitly listed. Ultimately, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as Hardware and format it as a JSON object.**Categorizing keyboard issue**\n\nI need to classify the IT ticket about the mixed-up keyboard symbols issue. It seems like it falls under \"Hardware\" since it relates to the keyboard itself, specifically the layout. While \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option as well, \"Hardware\" is more precise in this case. The user confirmed the issue is resolved, so I just need to output the JSON object with the category set to \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll ensure it aligns with the required format.**Outputting JSON format**\n\nI need to make sure the output is formatted correctly in JSON. The required structure is simple: it needs to be an object with a \"category\" key that holds the value \"Hardware.\" I'll confirm that I\u2019m using double quotes as necessary. Alright, no extra commentary is needed here. I\u2019ll just deliver the final output succinctly as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
