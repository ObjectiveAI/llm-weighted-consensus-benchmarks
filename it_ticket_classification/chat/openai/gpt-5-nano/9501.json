They\u2019re asking for help with the form and mentioning \u201cid image cd.\u201d It might involve access removal for those leaving. Given that \"leaver form\" usually refers to revoking access, this ticket likely fits into the \"Access\" category, or possibly \"HR Support\" as well.**Categorizing a ticket**\n\nThe content discusses interns leaving and filling out a bulk leaver form, which makes it sound like it's related to HR. However, in the IT ticket taxonomy, the bulk leaver form would actually be classified under \"Access\" because it involves disabling accounts and removing system access. The user is asking for categorization. I need to output a JSON object indicating this category, specifically: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to include just that without any extra text.**Choosing category for IT ticket**\n\nThe user is looking to categorize a ticket related to leaving interns and bulk leaver forms. While it could fit under \"HR Support,\" from an IT perspective, a \"leaver form\" specifically pertains to managing IT access during the offboarding process. Therefore, the \"Access\" category is more suitable for this ticket. Since the goal is to categorize the task correctly, I'll go with {\"category\":\"Access\"} as the best option and deliver that."
