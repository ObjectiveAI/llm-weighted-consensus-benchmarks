They mention things like \"new purchase\" and \"purchase order,\" pointing toward purchasing hardware. The reference to \"retina display flash storage\" suggests they might be getting a new device. With installation logging and receipts discussed, it seems clear this ticket primarily relates to a Purchase. So I'll settle on that category, as it best captures the essence of purchasing new equipment.**Deciding category for IT ticket**\n\nI'm looking at this IT ticket, and I see references to hardware like \"display\" and \"storage.\" The mention of \"new purchase\" and \"PO\" indicates a focus on procurement, making \"Purchase\" the best category. While \"Storage\" could fit due to the \"flash storage\" mention, the overarching theme is about purchasing new items. I need to format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. This aligns perfectly with the requirements, so I'll go ahead with that.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket, which mentions \"new purchase\" and \"PO,\" indicating it's likely a purchase order for hardware. The reference to \"retina display\" suggests a monitor, but the text is still a bit unclear. To be safe, I will go with the \"Purchase\" category. My response will be straightforward and formatted in JSON as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Keeping it concise makes sense here!"
