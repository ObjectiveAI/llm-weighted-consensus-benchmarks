There\u2019s a long text that includes references to access requests and collaboration tools. The task is to map it to one of the provided categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. Given the mentions of access and tools for collaboration, it seems like \u201cAccess\u201d could be the most appropriate category to select here.**Categorizing access request**\n\nIt seems like this request is primarily about accessing a library, which brings up the phrases \"access request,\" \"library,\" and \"site.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could fit because it involves managing roles and settings, the focus here is clearly on access. Given that, categorizing it as \"Access\" makes the most sense. Since the user specifically asked for the category of their IT ticket, I'll respond with a JSON-like object that indicates: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nI\u2019ll make sure to follow the required format precisely!"
