I\u2019m considering whether to classify it as \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" Since \"request\" points towards a purchase, I'd lean towards categorizing it as \"Purchase.\" Typically, procurement of hardware items would fall under \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware,\" but this request leans more toward \"Purchase.\"**Identifying ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the user's message about \"surge protectors request\" and the mention of \"tuesday.\" It\u2019s unclear, but it might hint at a scheduling issue or an incident where someone took the surge protector sockets. However, I think the best category here is \"Purchase,\" since it seems to focus on acquiring surge protectors. If I need to provide a JSON format for categorization, it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} and match the required schema format.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
