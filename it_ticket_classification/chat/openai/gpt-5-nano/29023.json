The main request seems to involve connecting a PC to a network. I think it could fit into either \"Access\" for network access or \"Hardware\" for the PC itself\u2014but since it's specifically about getting network access, I'd lean more towards \"Access.\" I'll finalize the categorization based on that understanding.**Analyzing Ticket Details**\n\nI\u2019m noting some phrases from the user's ticket like \"friday pm,\" \"calculator,\" and \"si share la folder.\" I think \"share la folder\" might be a mix-up for \"share the folder\" in French. The main focus seems to be on connecting a PC to the network. Based on this, I believe \"Access\" is the right category since it deals with network connectivity. However, \"Storage\" could work too because of the shared folder. Since the user is looking for categorization, \"Access\" feels most fitting.**Finalizing Category Response**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket, and it seems like I should return a JSON format with the category, likely \"Access.\" The system specifies a structure for the response, which means I need to follow that precisely. While I see the connection to \"Hardware\" because of the PC aspect, the emphasis on connecting it to the network suggests \"Access\" is more appropriate. Although, I could ask for clarification if needed, but for now, I'll stick with the clear choice of \"Access.\"**Providing Category Only**\n\nThe user specifically asked for a category, so I need to stick to the structure provided. I'll respond with just the category in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. While the mention of \"share la folder\" could also link to \"Storage\" or \"Access,\" I think \"Access\" is still the best fit for the network context. I'll keep it straightforward and avoid adding any extra text or justification."
