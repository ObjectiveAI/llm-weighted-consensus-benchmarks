The sentence mentions various Apple products, specifically a MacBook and a borrowed keyboard that needs to be returned. It references installation and an order number, but some parts aren\u2019t clear, like \u201chis justification.\u201d Given this info, I think it fits best under the \"Hardware\" category due to the focus on devices and peripherals. I'll finalize my decision on this.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nIt looks like this ticket is focused on hardware asset management, specifically about returning a borrowed keyboard and logging an installation. The phrase \u201capple mb sn\u201d indicates a serial number for a MacBook. I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as \"Hardware\" since it involves devices. Other options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Purchase\" don't fit either. I'll go ahead and respond with a JSON object indicating \"Hardware\" as the category.**Formatting Category Response**\n\nI need to ensure I format my response correctly for the category field. The task is about categorizing the IT ticket, and I see the schema indicates that the output should be a JSON object. Based on the content about the borrowed keyboard and MacBook, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" So, my final output will simply be:  \n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}  \nI want to keep it straightforward and avoid extra explanation."
