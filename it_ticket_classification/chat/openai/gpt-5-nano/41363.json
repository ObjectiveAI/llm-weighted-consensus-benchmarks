It mentions issues logging in with an invalid leave code, which makes me think it could fit under \"Access\" because of the authentication issue. However, since it relates to logging leave, it could also belong to \"HR Support.\" There's a chance it's related to a bug in the internal \"leave management system,\" so that might be another angle to consider.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize an IT ticket that deals with an invalid leave code during login. It seems related to an access issue, since it\u2019s about logging into the leave system. I think the best fit is the \"Access\" category. According to the system instructions, I need to format the response as a JSON object with the category field. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s the correct output!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
