The repeated mention of \"confluence\" suggests this is important to them. Since they are requesting access, I think the appropriate category is Access. There\u2019s a chance it could relate to Administrative rights, but Access seems most fitting.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how some organizations categorize requests as \"Administrative rights\" if it involves permissions. Yet, in this case, since the user explicitly says they need \"access to confluence,\" it\u2019s more of an access request rather than needing admin rights. I don\u2019t want to confuse it with another category. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object since that seems to be appropriate: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`."
