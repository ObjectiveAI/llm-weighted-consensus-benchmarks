Since it seems like a request related to inventory replenishment for backpacks, it could fit under either Purchase or Hardware. However, given the focus on replenishment, Purchase seems like the best fit!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket provided by the user, and the options are fairly limited. It seems to be about replenishment orders, so \"Purchase\" fits best, especially since it mentions POs. However, there's also a possibility it refers to hardware inventory management, which could lead to categorizing it as \"Hardware.\" I'm settling on \"Purchase\" due to the importance of replenishment. I\u2019ll format this as JSON: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} to ensure clarity!"
