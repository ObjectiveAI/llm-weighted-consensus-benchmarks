The user mentions a new purchase order for docking stations and requests to log the installation, noting the importance of mandatory receipts. This gives me a clear indication that it's about a new hardware purchase. Considering all these details, the most fitting category for this ticket seems to be \"Purchase\" since it focuses on the procurement process. \"Hardware\" might fit too, but \"Purchase\" stands out.**Classifying IT tickets**\n\nThe ticket asks to log installation, which could relate to deploying hardware, but the main focus is a purchase request and logging receipts. Given that it says \"new purchase po,\" I think \"Purchase\" is the best category. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase\" in a JSON format, as specified. Since the instructions mention lowercase, I\u2019ll return {\"category\":\"purchase\"}. This way, I\u2019m following the required format while keeping it straightforward for the user.**Finalizing the response**\n\nI need to ensure that I stick to the format provided and use the correct capitalization for the category, which is \"Purchase.\" So, my output will be a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I should avoid adding any extra explanations unless the user specifically asks for them. Keeping it simple and direct will make it easier for the user to understand, so I'm ready to send that response!"
