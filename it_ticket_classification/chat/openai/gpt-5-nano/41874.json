They're having issues with their ServiceNow account being locked and can\u2019t log in, despite trying multiple times. From the provided categories, \"Access\" seems to be the best fit since the issue revolves around account access. While it could also relate to \"Administrative rights\" if it involves permissions, the primary focus is on accessing the account. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Access.\"**Delivering JSON format**\n\nI need to respond in JSON format for the IT ticket categorization task. The prompt specifies a category schema, and it\u2019s clear we should output a JSON object that includes the selected category. Based on the user's issue with their account, \"Access\" is the appropriate choice. The instruction indicates that our response should strictly follow the schema, so I'll ensure there are no extra characters. The output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Sounds good!"
