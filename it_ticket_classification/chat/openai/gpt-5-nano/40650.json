The user mentioned \"requisitioning bus,\" possibly meaning \"requisitioning business.\" This focuses on financial aspects, not hardware or access issues, so \"Purchase\" seems right. I need to respond with the correct JSON format for this, just like the instruction specifies. I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} since no extra text is needed per the prompt.**Responding with JSON format**\n\nI'm considering the best way to respond since I need to follow the platform's requirements. The instruction clearly states to categorize the IT Ticket, so I\u2019ll focus on providing only the JSON object with the category field. It needs to be correct, so my output will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I think this keeps everything simple and clear, which is what the user needs! Let's proceed with just that."
