The available categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket mentions wrong costs registered and requests changes, which makes me think it fits under \"Purchase\" since it involves costs and orders. The reference to \"okapi issue\" adds some confusion, but overall, I believe \"Purchase\" is the most appropriate category here.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether the category might be \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Purchase\" seems to fit better since the user wants changes made to costs and ensure the order has an accurate report. The ticket references an issue with costs registered incorrectly, so categorizing it as \"Purchase\" makes sense. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the category value \"Purchase,\" ensuring it matches the required structure perfectly. Here\u2019s the final output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
