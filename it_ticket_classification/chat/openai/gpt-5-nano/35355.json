However, the term \"Administrative rights\" might also fit since preventing reboots often requires admin privileges. The user\u2019s request to \"prevent reboot during working hours\" suggests it connects to policy management typical in Windows updates. So, if this ticket is about managing reboots, \"Administrative rights\" seems most appropriate, while \"Miscellaneous\" could work as a fallback if the request remains unclear.**Structuring the IT ticket**\n\nThe user requested to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" so I need to respond with a structured JSON tag. I\u2019ll format it to reflect the category field from the allowed set. Based on the user's context regarding preventing reboots, I\u2019ll use a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. This makes sense because preventing reboots during working hours relates to needing admin rights for configuring automatic updates. The user's mention of \"hybrid mode\" hardware adds context, emphasizing the need for careful handling during customer calls.**Finalizing the category output**\n\nThis request relates to modifying update policies or scheduling reboots, which is an administrative setting rather than a hardware issue. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Administrative rights.\" My final response will just be a JSON object with the appropriate category. Following the system's instruction, I'll format it as a JSON-like object for clarity. Here\u2019s the final output:\n\n```json\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n```"
