Given there's a specific category for \"Administrative rights,\" and the context clearly indicates it's about rights to a space, I think the best category is \"Administrative rights.\"**Choosing ticket categories**\n\nI need to classify this ticket as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The term \"admin access\" suggests elevated privileges, and the request is about granting access to a Confluence space. While some might argue that \"Administrative rights\" is more specific, I actually think \"Access\" fits better. It's not really about a project, so \"Internal Project\" seems off. Ultimately, I should respond with a JSON object indicating the chosen category. I'll go with \"Administrative rights\" since it's more precise for this context.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
