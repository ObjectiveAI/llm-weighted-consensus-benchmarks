The user input seems quite jumbled \u2013 I see repeated mentions of \"task added,\" and the word \"oracle,\" which might refer to the Oracle database. \n\nIt's likely about scheduling a task, so I might lean towards Internal Project, Miscellaneous, or Access, depending on its context related to Oracle.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI need to decide on a category for this IT ticket. It doesn't mention anything about login or hardware, and \"Administrative rights\" seems unrelated because it's not present. \"Internal Project\" could fit if it's about a task within a project, but it lacks clarity. So, I think \"Miscellaneous\" would work as a catch-all given its vagueness. I'll provide the output in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} without any extra commentary, as instructed.**Outputting the category**\n\nI need to respond with the JSON object for the category. Since we\u2019ve categorized it as Miscellaneous, I'll keep it simple and straightforward. The response will be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. That\u2019s all I need to include since the instructions are clear about just providing the category in this format. No extra wording or explanation is necessary."
