Key phrases like \"search for valid address\" and \"urgent because developer\" might suggest connection issues. It seems like the best fit could be \"Access\" if it relates to network connectivity, or possibly \"Hardware.\"**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI need to choose the closest category for this IT ticket: \"Hardware\" if it's a machine failure or \"Access\" if it's about connection issues. The ticket mentions the urgency related to connecting for a few hours, and phrases like \"valid address\" and \"renew when drops\" hint at potential network connectivity problems, maybe even involving VPNs. Although \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it requires admin help, \"Access\" feels more fitting. I think I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access\" since it focuses on connectivity issues.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe prompt asks for me to categorize an IT ticket and provide the output as a JSON object. The schema indicates I need to include a \"category\" field with specific options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Since I've decided that \"Access\" fits best for this ticket, I'll keep it simple. I\u2019ll make sure the response is structured correctly and just output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
