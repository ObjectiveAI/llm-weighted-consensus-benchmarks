I\u2019ll construct a JSON object with this category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket based on the user's description of their issue with the mail server. Since they mention that the server works well but they can't access their email, it seems like an access problem. The closest category available is \"Access.\" Therefore, I\u2019ll create a JSON object with the category set to \"Access\" and ensure that it strictly follows the required format, with no extra text.
