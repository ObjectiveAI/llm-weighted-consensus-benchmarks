They also mention a \"receipts section\" and \"mirroring image video,\" which suggests they may want to attach receipts. It feels like \"Purchase\" would be the best category since it's connected to logging purchases and receipts. I think I should format my response as a JSON object. So, I'll output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}**Clarifying the output format**\n\nThe system message outlines a schema for the category, which leads me to believe I need to return an object with a \"category\" field as a string. The instruction hints that I might just need to provide the label in a simple format like {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Even though the schema enumerates allowed values, the prompt clearly instructs to categorize the IT ticket. So, I will output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
