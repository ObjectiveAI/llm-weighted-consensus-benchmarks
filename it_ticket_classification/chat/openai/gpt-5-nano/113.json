The categories to choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. Since the ticket is all about decommissioning and updating relevant documentation, it sounds like it fits best into the Hardware category. I also considered \"Internal Project,\" but Hardware seems more appropriate due to the asset management focus in the ticket details. So, I\u2019ll go with Hardware!**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket, which mentions \"video component decommissioning\" and involves updating documentation and logging equipment. It's clear this aligns best with the Hardware category. While Asset Management could fit, the options are limited, so Hardware it is! I also considered \"Internal Project\" as a subcategory, but focusing on Hardware is simpler. I'll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, adhering to the instructions. Let's ensure everything is clear and precise!"
