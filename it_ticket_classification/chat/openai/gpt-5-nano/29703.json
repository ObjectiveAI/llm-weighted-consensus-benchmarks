The user mentions creating a \"new project code,\" which seems to relate to the \"Internal Project\" category. However, it could also involve \"Access\" if it\u2019s about granting permission. So, I'll need to decide which category fits best. It\u2019s tricky with the unclear grammar, but I'll go for \"Internal Project\" since it seems most relevant to their request.**Finalizing category response**\n\nIt looks like the user text includes \"officer ext blvd,\" which might be a signature, making it rather ambiguous. Still, the best choice seems to be \"Internal Project\" since it\u2019s about creating a new project code. I\u2019ll categorize it that way. Now, I need to prepare a JSON object that matches the required format with the correct schema that includes \u201cInternal Project.\u201d I\u2019ll make sure the output aligns with the expected category structure.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
