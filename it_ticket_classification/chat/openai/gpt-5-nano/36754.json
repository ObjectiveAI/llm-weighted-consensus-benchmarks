The user wants a JSON object with a category key. \n\nFrom the details, this ticket seems related to a missing approval button for timecards, which could be about access or administrative rights. I think categorizing it as \"Access\" fits because it relates to functionality for approval, or possibly \"Miscellaneous\" if it\u2019s broader. I'll finalize one of these options.**Assessing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI'm examining an IT ticket that mentions a \"missing approval button\" and issues with timecard submission. It seems related to a workflow process change. If the user lacks permission to approve timecards, it might fit \"Administrative rights.\" However, it feels more like a bug or feature issue concerning the missing button. \n\nGiven the context, I think \"Access\" is the best fit since it pertains to permissions and approvals. It's not hardware, storage, or HR-related, so I need to finalize this choice.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI believe \"Access\" is the most fitting category for this ticket, as it relates to user permissions and access to features. While \"Administrative rights\" also pertains to permissions, this specific issue revolves around a missing approval button for timecards, likely due to permission or configuration settings. The user's request for confirmation about the approval button further suggests access issues. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Access\" and provide the necessary JSON object.\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
