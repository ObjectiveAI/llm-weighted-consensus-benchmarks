The user referenced \"sonar apache\" and redirecting requests. It seems like an IT task concerning server configuration and logs. Since it doesn\u2019t relate to Administrative rights or Purchasing, it might fit into \"Administrative rights.\" However, it\u2019s not about user access. I think \"Internal Project\" could also apply, but \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a reasonable option since there's no category for \"Configuration.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating the IT ticket categories, which are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. This ticket seems more aligned with \"Internal Project\" or perhaps \"Miscellaneous.\" The user mentioned needing to log reconfiguration for Apache on SP Sonar to redirect requests, suggesting that it\u2019s about server configuration rather than hardware or access rights. Since it doesn\u2019t quite fit any specific category, maybe \"Miscellaneous\" works best here. I'll choose one category and provide it in JSON format.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
