The closest categories I see are \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" The ticket emphasizes a purchase order for a monitor, so calling it \"Purchase\" makes the most sense. However, since it involves hardware too, I might consider \"Hardware,\" but \"Purchase\" seems like the best fit here.**Choosing category for IT ticket**\n\nThe keywords in the ticket, like \"new purchase po\" and \"purchased monitor,\" clearly indicate it's about procurement and asset allocation. In ITSM classification, there's a specific \"Purchase\" category for this kind of task. I\u2019ve decided on \"Purchase\" as the best fit. According to the required format, I need to respond with a JSON object, which looks like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I just need to make sure I have the quotes right, and then I'm all set!"
