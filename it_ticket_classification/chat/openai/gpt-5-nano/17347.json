The category options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket talks about hosting requests, authentication, and forms, along with debugging steps. It might fit into \"Access\" if it\u2019s regarding authentication, or perhaps \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since there's no specific category for \"Hosting,\" it complicates the categorization a bit.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user seems to want help with hosting, mobile access, authentication via forms, and debugging features related to user connections. The most fitting category seems to be \"Access,\" since it involves user authentication and access control. \"Administrative rights\" could apply if admin access is needed, but the ticket\u2019s focus suggests \"Access\" fits best. While it could also be \"Internal Project\" due to its project-like nature, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" for clarity and proper routing.**Structuring the response**\n\nI need to provide a concise answer for the category, which will be \"Access.\" The ticket mentions hosting, form-based authentication, and user access, so it fits under Access nicely. I'll format my response as a JSON object since that's specified. It looks like I shouldn\u2019t add any extra text beyond the required format. Therefore, I\u2019ll just output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThis way, I\u2019m keeping it clean and exactly what\u2019s needed!"
