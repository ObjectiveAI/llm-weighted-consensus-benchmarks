The request is about a replacement screen or phone, making it a hardware issue. So, the category is clearly \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll need to respond with the required JSON format including that category value.**Responding with category JSON**\n\nI\u2019m looking to respond with the category in the schema format. The schema requests an object structure, but I think I can simplify this. The instruction is to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" and the provided schema seems like guidance for the response. \n\nIt's fine to return just the category as a minimal object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} since it aligns with the expected enum values. I\u2019ll stick with that concise answer without any extra text."
