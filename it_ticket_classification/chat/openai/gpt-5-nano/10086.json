The mention of \"application licence software\" and \"ending date\" suggests it's about deactivating something. It could fit under \"Internal Project\" since it deals with closing inactive projects. Alternatively, if it relates to permissions for ending licenses, it might go under \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d It's about choosing the best category for their request.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding how to categorize a request about closing inactive projects. Given the user's focus, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit, as it deals specifically with project closure. The mention of \"application licence software\" could imply \"Administrative rights,\" but the context points to projects. The user appears to reference specific fields like project names, codes, and dates. Thus, I'll categorize this request as \"Internal Project\" and prepare to respond in the required JSON format.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to create a response in JSON format that specifies a category based on the user's request. The specification indicates that it should be a simple object with a \"category\" field containing one of the designated strings. Since I've determined that \"Internal Project\" is the correct category, I\u2019ll format my response as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} without any extra commentary. It's important to keep it straightforward, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do!"
