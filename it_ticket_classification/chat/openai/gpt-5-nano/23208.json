They reference a senior infrastructure engineer, which makes me think they might need administrative rights for the installation. The best fit here appears to be \"Administrative rights\" due to the nature of software installation, rather than \"Accessory,\" \"Hardware,\" or \"Purchase,\" since there's no mention of buying the software.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket content mentions \"inputs,\" which might refer to credentials or installation steps. It looks like I need to categorize the IT ticket according to the provided formats, specifically using a JSON object. Based on the context, \"Administrative rights\" seems like the most suitable category. I\u2019ll ensure the JSON is correctly formatted and output just the necessary content, which will look like this: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. No extra text is needed, just the JSON."
