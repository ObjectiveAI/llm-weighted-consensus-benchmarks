It seems likely to fall under \"Hardware,\" since it's about a work computer issue. While \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" could be potential fits, they aren't explicitly mentioned. I think \"Hardware\" is the best choice, and I should respond with a structured category object.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nThe prompt indicates that I need to respond with a JSON schema that includes a category string. The user has asked to categorize an IT ticket, so I should output something like: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I need to make sure I strictly follow the category list provided. Since \"Hardware\" is one of the available options, I\u2019ll confirm that my response will just be this JSON object without any extra text. Let's proceed with that!"
