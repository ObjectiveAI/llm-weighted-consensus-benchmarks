It seems they are asking for help with their keyboard, possibly requiring someone to visit. Given the focus on the keyboard, this seems to fit best in the \"Hardware\" category. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object indicating this choice.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that categorizes the ticket request based on the user\u2019s unclear message regarding a keyboard. The allowed categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and more. Given that the request references a keyboard and a potential service visit, the most fitting category is \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll format my response as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, while making sure it adheres to the specified JSON format mentioned in instructions for consistency.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nThe developer wants the ticket categorized, and I need to respond simply with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I want to ensure there's no extra text in my response and that it remains valid JSON. Since that's the requirement, I'll deliver it as is, making sure it meets the specified format. Alright, let's go ahead and finalize the response!"
