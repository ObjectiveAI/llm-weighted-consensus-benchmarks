They\u2019ve shared details about an \"oracle time sheet report,\" mentioning elements like \"maternity leave\" and various statuses of users. My task is to determine which of the available categories fits best: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative Rights. I'll parse these details carefully to figure out the most appropriate category for this ticket.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket seems to lean towards HR-related issues, focusing on time sheets, maternity leave, and user statuses. Given mentions like \"oracle time sheet report\" and \"inactive users,\" it could fall under \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" I\u2019m considering whether it\u2019s an administrative task related to managing user access or adjusting statuses due to leave. Since \"HR Support\" is one of the categories from the provided list, it looks like the best fit. I\u2019ll create a JSON object to categorize it.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
