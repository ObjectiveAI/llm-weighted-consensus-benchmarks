They want it sorted into categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. The content discusses rolling out wallpapers, screen resolutions, and updates related to workstations as part of policy changes. It seems like this ticket should fit under \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Administrative rights,\" given the focus on IT policies and procedures related to wallpaper and workstations. I'm aiming to get it right!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket appears to relate to an \"Internal Project\" for rolling out wallpaper images across workstations. It could fit other categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Hardware,\" but \"Internal Project\" seems most appropriate since it involves policy and workstations. The user provided a clear schema for the response, indicating I should return a JSON object. So, I'll keep it concise and deliver: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let's make sure this is clear as requested, with no extra explanation!"
