The ticket mentions missing overtime, deadlines, and payroll processing. Since there's no category for Payroll, the closest fit might be HR Support, as it relates to payroll issues. There are aspects regarding approvals and submitting codes, which makes it seem like internal HR or payroll help is necessary here.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
