Although \"Access\" is broader, \"Administrative rights\" offers a clearer representation of the user's needs.**Categorizing Request**\n\nI see a lot of keywords in the content, like \"rights,\" \"transactions,\" and \"approvals,\" which point toward \"Oracle reports rights.\" Although \"facilities id image\" could suggest \"Internal Project\" or perhaps \"HR Support,\" it doesn't quite fit HR. Given that the core request revolves around access rights for Oracle reports, it seems most accurate to categorize this as \"Administrative rights.\" I need to output a JSON object reflecting that choice, like {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
