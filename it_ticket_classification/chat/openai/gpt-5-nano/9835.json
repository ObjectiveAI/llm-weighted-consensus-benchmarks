The ticket mentions \u201caccess request\u201d and issues with logging in. It\u2019s a bit messy, but it seems to fit best under \u201cAccess,\u201d since that\u2019s a clear request for access related to potential internship problems. I could also consider \u201cHR Support\u201d since it involves an internship, but the main focus here seems to be on access issues.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nThe user's IT ticket mentions an \"access request\" and a \"problem logging in,\" which signals a need for help with access. Given that typical support categories include \"Access,\" I decide this ticket belongs there. Since the task is to categorize the ticket for routing, I\u2019ll need to format my response as a JSON object reflecting this category. The instruction specifies using the schema provided, so I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s essential to ensure the formatting is correct!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
