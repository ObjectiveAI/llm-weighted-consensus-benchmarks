However, since it mentions access, \"Access\" could work too. Ultimately, the content is ambiguous, so categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a safe bet.**Classifying IT tickets**\n\nWhen dealing with unclear IT tickets, it's typical to label them as \"Miscellaneous.\" Analyzing the phrase \"old notifications still use resolved report\" suggests they might want to stop old notifications from utilizing this report. The message seems cluttered with placeholders, possibly indicating a template or auto-fill issue. Since it's more about reports than hardware, I think \"Miscellaneous\" fits best. I'll respond in the required format: {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}. We don't need extra text here."
