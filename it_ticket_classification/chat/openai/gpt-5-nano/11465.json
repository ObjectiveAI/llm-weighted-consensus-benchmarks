The categories available include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. It looks like the mention of adding terminals suggests it\u2019s hardware-related, which makes \"Hardware\" the likely choice. There's also a mention of addresses, but it seems more about provisioning rather than administrative rights. So, I'll go with \"Hardware\" and format my response as a JSON object for clarity.**Preparing response format**\n\nIt looks like I need to provide a straightforward categorized response. The instruction specifies that I should format it as a JSON object. Since \"Hardware\" is the appropriate category, I'll keep it simple and just output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nThere's no need for extra text. The guidance clearly states to respond in that specific format, so I'll just deliver it as is. Let's go ahead and finalize that!"
