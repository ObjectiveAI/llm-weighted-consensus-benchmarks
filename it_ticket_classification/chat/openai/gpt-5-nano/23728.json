The ticket seems focused on onboarding new starters and interns, mentioning aspects like licenses, access, and account creation. Keywords like \"starter forms,\" \"full-time employees,\" and \"access provisioning\" indicate this. Given that it\u2019s primarily about user accounts and access, I think the best category is \"Access.\" That fits perfectly with the ticket\u2019s content!**Generating JSON response**\n\nI need to create a JSON response with the category field set to \"Access,\" following the specified format. The instruction asks for the response to be a JSON object. So, I'll format it as: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. It\u2019s essential to restrict the response to just the JSON content, as the user specifically asked to categorize the IT ticket. Let\u2019s keep it simple and straightforward, providing only what\u2019s necessary and aligning with the user's request."
