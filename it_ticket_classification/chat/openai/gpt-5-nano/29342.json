The mention of resources suggests some attachments. So, \"Access\" seems like the best category, but \"Internal Project\" could work too if it's specifically about an internal project.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe message is a bit vague, but \"project access\" clearly suggests the \"Access\" category. I could use \"Internal Project\" if it's referring to a specific internal project, but that could complicate ticket triage. The phrase \"resources per attached\" isn\u2019t especially relevant to categorization, and \"joining speed\" might imply onboarding, but it\u2019s not crucial. To keep things simple, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON format as specified: `{\"category\": \"Access\"}`. This matches the required format precisely."
