I\u2019m considering whether to classify it as \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous\" since the provided categories don't quite fit the email context. It\u2019s definitely a challenge since there\u2019s no specific \"Email\" category listed. I\u2019ll choose the best fit based on the information.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this IT ticket as \"Access\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\" The user's mention of issues with a shared mailbox suggests it's about access rights. They note that their personal mailbox is working fine but they need to use the shared one daily, asking for assistance. \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant too, but since the user doesn't appear to be an admin, I'll go with \"Access.\" I need to respond with a JSON object indicating the category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
