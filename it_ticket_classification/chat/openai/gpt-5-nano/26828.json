So, this might fall under \"HR Support\" since it seems HR-related. However, it could also potentially involve \"Access\" if they\u2019re asking for access based on that new title. I need to pick the best fitting category!**Classifying IT ticket requests**\n\nThe phrase \"new job title oracle head senior thank\" suggests the user is likely asking to create or update a job title within the Oracle HR system. I wonder if this should fall under \"HR Support,\" as it relates to HR job title changes. However, it could also connect to \"Access\" if they need permission linked to that title. Despite the confusion, categorizing it as \"HR Support\" seems most appropriate. I\u2019ll consider formatting it as a JSON object for clarity!**Formatting JSON output**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to format the output as a JSON object specifying the category. It should look like this: `{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}`. So, I\u2019ll return just the essential category field, which will be: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`. I\u2019ll stick to providing just the JSON object without any extra explanation and deliver it directly!"
