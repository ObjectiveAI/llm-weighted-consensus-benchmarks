Since the user asks for a category name in a particular JSON format, I\u2019ll need to respond with a JSON object that states the category. It looks like this should be straightforward: `{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}`. Let\u2019s keep it simple!**Finalizing JSON Response**\n\nThe user expects a JSON format with the category included. I'll provide the response as `{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}` since that's the most suitable option. I've double-checked the formatting to ensure everything is correct without any extra commentary. I did consider if \"Access\" would fit due to the mention of updates, but ultimately, it doesn\u2019t apply here. So, it\u2019s clear: the best choice is \"Miscellaneous.\" Let\u2019s get this response out!"
