Since \"Administrative rights\" specifically relates to granting permissions, I'll go ahead and categorize it that way. Now, it's essential to format my response as a JSON object. So, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} to keep everything structured.**Finalizing category response**\n\nI need to keep this straightforward since the user asked specifically for a category. The request is for full permissions\u2014clearly aligning with \"Administrative rights\" rather than just \"Access.\" I must return the response in plain JSON format without any extra commentary, just direct information. So my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} to ensure clarity and adherence to the user's instructions."
