It sounds like they can't select a task, which might indicate a permissions issue. Given the categories\u2014like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights\"\u2014the ticket likely falls under \"HR Support.\" It's important to pinpoint the correct category for effective resolution, so I'll choose \"HR Support\" for this ticket.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm deciding how to categorize an IT ticket about the user being unable to submit annual leave in Oracle. Since they can't select a task, it might relate to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" due to permissions issues. However, because this is specifically about HR leave submission, \"HR Support\" seems like the most fitting category. I'll make sure to format my response correctly in JSON, as required, outputting {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It's all about getting it right!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
