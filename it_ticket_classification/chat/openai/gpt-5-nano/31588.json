The ticket content is a long, stream-of-consciousness description covering several topics, including Oracle, purchase orders (POs), and receipts. It mainly focuses on the procurement process, POs, and how to create purchase requests, mentioning a Thursday update in July. I need to pinpoint the best category for this.**Categorizing IT ticket content**\n\nI need to categorize this ticket, which discusses various topics such as updating materials, mind maps on processes, and mobile app instructions. It covers procurement systems, purchase requisitions, purchase orders, and receipts. There are also discussions about expenditure categories, classifications, and issues users are having with accessing reports. Key points include Android app updates, managing updated functionalities, and legacy balances. I need to pinpoint the most relevant category for this ticket.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to classify this ticket as \"Purchase\" since it focuses on purchase orders and requisitions. The content mentions a purchase requisition file video, ways to manage orders, expenditure categories, and even some issues related to access and reports. While it may also fit under \"Internal Project\" if it's about implementing a procure-to-pay system, it seems that \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
