However, it seems more focused on processes like service recovery, location tests, templates, and work instructions. \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t apply here, and \"Miscellaneous\" is a fallback. \n\nIn IT service management, disaster recovery fits best under \"Storage\" for backup and restore data. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and categorize it as \"Storage.\" I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Determining JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that has the property \"category.\" I\u2019m considering if \"Internal Project\" could be suitable since the ticket is about an annual service recovery test plan, including templates and instructions. However, since this directly relates to disaster recovery and involves backups, \"Storage\" seems more fitting. The mention of \"restore tests\" and \"server\" aligns closely with data storage needs. So, the best choice is still \"Storage.\" I'll respond succinctly with just the JSON: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
