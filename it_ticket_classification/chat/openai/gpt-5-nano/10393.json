The user's request seems to be about an issue with viewing a results chart, mentioning things like \"progress chart\" and \"graph properly displayed.\" \n\nThis is a bit unclear, but it likely falls under \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access\" since it's not a hardware issue. I think it might be about software visualization problems.**Categorizing an IT ticket**\n\nThe user is experiencing issues with viewing a results chart and has mentioned wanting a progress chart displayed correctly. It seems to relate to a JIRA or story board setup. I need to categorize this ticket using the provided categories. \n\n\"Internal Project\" could work since it's about project charts, but that category usually applies to internal IT projects. Alternatively, \"Miscellaneous\" might fit better as a catch-all option, especially since there's no clear permission issue or suitable category for display problems.**Finalizing the category**\n\nI think the best category for this ticket is \"Internal Project\" since it pertains to a project management chart and relates to Agile terms like \"story\" and \"tasks.\" The user's issue seems linked to a specific project context.\n\nSo, I'll craft the final response in the required JSON format, creating the category object as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It\u2019s important to keep it concise, and I\u2019m ready to deliver this!"
