Although there's a chance it could fall under \"Administrative rights\" if access is needed, or \"Internal Project\" if it's for a specific project, \"HR Support\" appears to be the best choice overall. I'll respond with a JSON format for the selected category.**Formatting the output**\n\nThe user is asking to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to provide the output in a specific JSON format. The required structure mentions an object with a \"category\" field. Since \"HR Support\" is the appropriate category, I need to respond with that value. So, I\u2019ll produce the JSON object exactly as required: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nIt's straightforward, and I\u2019ll keep it simple without any extra text to avoid confusion."
