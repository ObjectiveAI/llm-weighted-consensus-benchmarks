However, since \u201ccodes\u201d could also hint at access codes, I\u2019m considering \"Administrative rights\" or even \"Access.\" Though, there's no clear request for system access. I\u2019ll finalize on \"Internal Project\" as the best fit!**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the IT ticket to find the best category. It talks about a \"new project code\" and creating codes referring to attached files. While \"Access\" seems fitting if they're requesting access codes, the request isn\u2019t explicitly stated. The wording leads me to believe \"Internal Project\" is most appropriate, especially since it\u2019s tied to the project code. The reference to \u201cper attached files\u201d suggests specifics that fall under internal projects, so that\u2019s likely my choice.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}**Finalizing the category choice**\n\nI\u2019m double-checking the ticket string: \"new project code pas friday codes hi please create two codes per attached files thank blvd.\" \n\nThere\u2019s a possibility it could fit \"Administrative rights\" if they're asking for codes to access something, but since it mentions \"new project code,\" I think \"Internal Project\" is the stronger choice. \n\nWith that in mind, it seems clear now that I should go ahead and finalize this categorization!"
