The ticket content is lengthy but mentions phrases like \"purchase order requisition,\" \"supplier,\" and \"cost center,\" suggesting it relates to Purchasing or Procurement. Given the details, the \"Purchase\" category seems to be the most appropriate fit for this ticket based on the context provided. Let's go with that!**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI think the ticket could potentially be categorized as \"Internal Project,\" but it appears to be more focused on creating or logging a \"purchase order requisition.\" The presence of terms like \"document purchase order,\" \"log installation,\" and \"task number\" all point towards it being related to Purchasing. Given this, I'll classify it under \"Purchase.\" \n\nI'll need to output it as a JSON object in the specified format, ensuring everything adheres to the schema correctly. The output will look like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Outputting JSON Category**\n\nThe user wants to categorize something, and I see the format should be a JSON object that specifies the category. The schema indicates that it has a property called \"category,\" so I need to make sure I follow that properly. \n\nWhat I need to provide is simply {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. This will meet the requirements without any additional commentary. Alright, let's deliver that cleanly!"
