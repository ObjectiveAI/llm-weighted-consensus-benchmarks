Given the context, it seems to fit best into the \"Hardware\" category as it relates to a hardware replacement. There\u2019s a possibility it could be categorized as \"Purchase\" if costs are involved, but it primarily concerns hardware. I should provide a response that follows a JSON-like format for the categorization.**Finalizing the IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the schema provided, which indicates I should output a JSON-like object for the category. Given that the user\u2019s description repeatedly mentions \"mobile phone replacement\" and does not reference access or admin rights, it confirms that it should be categorized as \"Hardware.\" The format is clear: I just need to provide the category. So my final response will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any extra text."
