The user provided a long description regarding issues with an expense app, including password resets, app errors, and server performance issues. Given that the ticket revolves around login problems, app reinstallation, and access issues, I think the best category here would be \u201cAccess.\u201d It captures the core issues the user is facing effectively.**Selecting IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m assessing the best category for the IT ticket, and \u201cAccess\u201d seems the most relevant due to its focus on password and login issues. While \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d might apply, the core of the ticket revolves around problems logging incidents and submitting through the expense app. If I have to choose just one category, \u201cAccess\u201d fits best because it encompasses the access rights and login credential problems reported. So, I'll finalize the answer in the required JSON format with {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
