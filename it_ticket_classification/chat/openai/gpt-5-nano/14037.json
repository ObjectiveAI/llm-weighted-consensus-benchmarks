The text seems to indicate a request for access for new hires, mentioning scheduling for Wednesday and an engineer on Tuesday. I\u2019m torn between two categories: \"Access\" seems most appropriate since it's about new people's access, but \"Administrative rights\" might work if they're requesting specific permissions. The mention of \"level type identical\" could also suggest they need certain permission levels.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nBased on the details in the ticket, it seems like \"level type identical\" might indicate they want the same access level as others. I should categorize this as \"Access\" instead of \"Administrative rights.\" Since the user requested to categorize the IT ticket, I'll provide a JSON object with the \"category\" set to \"Access.\" \n\nThe correct output should be: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}` because this matches the required schema without needing additional restrictions. I'll make sure to respond with this JSON format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
