If none of the categories fit, \"Miscellaneous\" is also an option.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m exploring the best category for the IT ticket. \"Purchase\" and \"HR Support\" definitely don\u2019t fit. \"Internal Project\" could work if this is part of an internal initiative. The user asked for categorization, so maybe it\u2019s \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Access\" if there's a request to clone the VM. The text mentions \"clone azure machine\" repeatedly, and \"design lead ext\" might refer to an external task for a design lead. Ultimately, \"Internal Project\" seems like the most relevant choice.**Crafting JSON Response**\n\nI\u2019m considering the IT ticket again. \"Access\" might be relevant if the user needs permissions to clone the Azure machine, but the text only mentions cloning. Between \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" I think \"Internal Project\" is the better choice since it relates directly to an Azure VM cloning task tied to a project. \n\nI\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format, so the output will be: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}` without any extra text. Let's keep it clean and straightforward!"
