The mention of \"mandatory receipts\" suggests they're focusing on procurement processes. Based on the categories available, the content points clearly to \"Purchase\" as the appropriate category since it specifically refers to a new hardware item. It's interesting how some requests can be a bit unclear yet still point out a specific category!**Clarifying IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering categorizing the ticket as related to hardware since it's about a new purchase order for a mouse. However, the best fit seems to be \"Purchase\" because it focuses on procurement. The request specifically asks for a JSON output only, so I need to ensure I format it properly without any extra text. I will stick to the required structure for the category. The final output should look like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
