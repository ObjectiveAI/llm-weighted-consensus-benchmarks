It sounds like it\u2019s related to memory (RAM) shortages, so this likely falls under \"Hardware.\" \n\nI\u2019ll create a JSON object with the appropriate category. The instruction specifies using the categories provided, and it seems \"Hardware\" is the best fit because it directly addresses the memory issue.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI think the primary category for this IT ticket should be \"Hardware,\" even though some might suggest \"Storage\" since it mentions memory issues. However, RAM relates to hardware, while storage typically addresses disk space. The ticket talks about actions like purging and archiving, but fundamentally, it\u2019s a hardware issue.\n\nI\u2019ll produce a JSON object with the category as \"Hardware\" since that\u2019s what fits best. The final output will be clean and straightforward. \n\nHere\u2019s the JSON:  \n```json\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n```**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI need to respond with just the JSON object for the category without any extra commentary. The instructions mention that the output should avoid code blocks because it may be parsed by apps that can't handle special formatting. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll present the JSON in plain text, ensuring it\u2019s clear and straightforward. The final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
