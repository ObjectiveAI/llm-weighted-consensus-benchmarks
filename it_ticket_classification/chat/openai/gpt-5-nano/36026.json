The JSON schema indicates that the category must be one of several options, including \"Access\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Since this appears to be about a connection issue, it likely falls under \"Access.\" However, it could also be viewed as \"Miscellaneous\" due to the specific nature of the warning. I think \"Access\" is the best fit.**Finalizing the IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The mention of \"server certificate verification\" indicates a potential issue with SSL certificates that prevents access to the server, which aligns with the \"Access\" category. The sign-off mentioning \"Senior engineer\" isn't part of the category, so I\u2019ll focus just on categorizing. I'll produce the required JSON object with just the category. So that will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
