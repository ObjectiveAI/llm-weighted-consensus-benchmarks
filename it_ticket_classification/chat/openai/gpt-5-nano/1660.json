It seems like the \"Access\" category is the best fit for disabling accounts, although \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project\" might also apply. I'll output this in JSON format, selecting the most appropriate category.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m debating whether to classify this ticket under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could involve granting or removing admin privileges, the content seems focused on disabling access for accounts. It leans towards \"Access,\" especially since it mentions ensuring the accounts are disabled. There\u2019s also a possibility for \"HR Support\" because of offboarding, but \"Access\" remains the best fit. I'll output the response in the correct JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, paying attention to proper casing."
