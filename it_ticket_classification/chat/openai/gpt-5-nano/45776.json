The ticket mentions \"agile board cameras,\" and it seems to indicate issues with these hardware devices. It talks about being unable to use the cameras and requests higher priority for this issue. Given that it revolves around hardware issues with cameras, I'd categorize it as \"Hardware.\"I considered that this ticket could potentially fall under \"Access\" if it referred to accessing a camera feed. However, it\u2019s more about the hardware devices themselves failing. So, I\u2019ll stick with categorizing it as \"Hardware.\" I need to ensure the output is in the proper JSON format, specifically: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Just that single line is required for the response, and I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s exact. So, let\u2019s go ahead with that!"
