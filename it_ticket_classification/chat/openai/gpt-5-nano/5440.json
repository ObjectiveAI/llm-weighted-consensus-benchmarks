It contains information about mailbox management, roaming profile, Active Directory rights, inventory, and work location details. This ticket likely ties to IT operations for processing a leaver, focusing on tasks like managing accounts, subscriptions, and other necessary offboarding procedures.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI see that I need to categorize the ticket based on the provided schema, which includes options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. The user's reference to a \"leaver form\" strongly suggests it's related to HR offboarding. With numerous elements like mailbox management and access rights deprovisioning, the best fit for the category seems to be either \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" I\u2019ll choose one to output in JSON format with the appropriate key.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
