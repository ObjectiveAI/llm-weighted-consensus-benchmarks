The keywords point to access issues, such as \"unblock user,\" \"unlock,\" and mentions of connecting via SOAP web service. It definitely relates to user account access, making \"Access\" the most suitable category. I ruled out others like \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous\" since they don't fit. So, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access.\"**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the request about \"unblocking user on the network,\" which clearly fits into the \"Access\" category. The instructions specify I need to respond with a JSON object, so I'll format it correctly. The required structure is clear: I need to provide a category property within an object. Since \"Access\" is appropriate, I'll prepare the response as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThere's no need for extra words, just the JSON object for it to be parsed correctly.**Confirming category choice**\n\nI'm double-checking that \"Access\" is the right category, as the ticket references \"unblock user on net,\" unlocking, and admin rights. Given these points, it definitely fits. I'll finalize my response with just the necessary JSON format without any extra words. So my clear and concise answer will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThat's my final output."
