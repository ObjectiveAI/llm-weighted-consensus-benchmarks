So, I'll go with \"HR Support\" as the category.**Categorizing ticket as HR Support**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether this ticket might fit under \"Access\" since it talks about informing the line manager and approvals, but it's mostly HR-related. The content includes mentions of \"Oracle HR support incident\" and \"absence request,\" leading me to lean towards \"HR Support.\" \n\nI need to format my response as a JSON object for the category. Following the prompt, I\u2019ll ensure to provide just the JSON without any extra text. So, I\u2019ll output:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
