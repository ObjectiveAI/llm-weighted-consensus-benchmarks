The mention of \"new starter\" suggests it\u2019s about onboarding and possibly Active Directory rights allocation. So, I'm guessing it pertains to new starter AD rights.**Categorizing IT Ticket Access**\n\nI see that the user wants to categorize an IT ticket mentioning \u201cnew starter,\u201d which suggests onboarding, and \u201cAD,\u201d indicating Active Directory with specific allocated rights. This seems to fit under \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d possibly even \u201cInternal Project.\u201d The best match appears to be \u201cAccess,\u201d given it revolves around user permissions. If there\u2019s a more specific category for \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d I could select that. Since the user has highlighted access provisioning, I think categorizing it as \u201cAccess\u201d is appropriate.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI've determined that the ticket doesn't fit into hardware, storage, HR, purchase, internal project, or miscellaneous categories. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" It relates to onboarding and rights allocation in Active Directory. I should format this as a JSON object since the system expects it in that structure, like: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. Including a brief justification within the context will help clarify the choice. I'll ensure my response aligns with the required format for categorizing the IT ticket.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
