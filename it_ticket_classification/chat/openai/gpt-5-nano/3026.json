The content seems to involve issues related to employee contract end dates, offboarding, and access rights. It feels like a mix for \"HR Support\" since it deals with contract matters, and \"Administrative rights\" might also apply for access-related tasks. Given the mention of offboarding, I think \u201cHR Support\u201d could be the best fit.**Selecting Category for IT Ticket**\n\nThe best category for this ticket seems to be \"HR Support.\" I confirmed that \"HR Support\" is indeed one of the valid options available. Since this category relates to contract end dates and offboarding, I'm going to select it. I\u2019ll prepare the response in the required JSON format as instructed, which will look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It\u2019s clear that I only need to respond with this category object, so I'll keep it straightforward."
