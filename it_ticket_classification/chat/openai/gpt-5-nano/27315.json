The ticket seems to refer to a borrowed cable, which makes me think it fits into the \"Hardware\" category due to the mention of \"cable.\" However, there's a possibility it could also be categorized as \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll decide based on these interpretations.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the options for categorizing the IT ticket: we have categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and more. Since this ticket is about a borrowed cable, \"Hardware\" seems like the most logical option because it specifically mentions a cable. Although I considered \"Purchase\" due to the idea of borrowing with a request to buy, there's no actual purchase request present. I'll go ahead and confirm the category as \"Hardware\" and respond with the required JSON: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
