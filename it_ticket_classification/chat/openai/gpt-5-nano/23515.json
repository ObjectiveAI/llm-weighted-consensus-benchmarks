It involves \"Administrative rights\" if admin access is needed for implementation. The request to \"block split tunneling between wired and wireless\" hints at a policy change, likely under Active Directory policy, which suggests adjustments to group policy. I might go with \"Internal Project\" given it's an initiative or \"Miscellaneous\" if that fits better. The main request seems to focus on implementing a network policy change on Wednesday.**Evaluating categories for network policy request**\n\nThis ticket isn't about hardware. It mentions HR Support, but that's not relevant here. Access seems appropriate since blocking split tunneling relates to network access and security policy for VPN behavior. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too generic, while \"Storage\" and \"Purchase\" don\u2019t quite fit either. There's a mention of third-party software but the main focus is on blocking split tunneling. It may involve \"Administrative rights\" for policy implementation, but it's more about adjusting the policy across Active Directory than granting user permissions.**Classifying the IT security change**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT security change. \"Administrative rights\" might fit since it involves policy enforcement and admin changes. But honestly, the categories feel a bit too broad. I think \"Internal Project\" would be more suitable because it\u2019s a project focused on implementing the split tunneling block according to a schedule. However, \u201cAccess\u201d also applies since the ticket centers on access control changes. It's not about granting admin rights but about performing an essential change.**Assigning the appropriate category**\n\nThe \"Internal Project\" category works best for this ticket since it's about a security project to block split tunneling, involving Active Directory policy and third-party software control. I need to categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and present it in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. \n\nThe instructions specify that only a single JSON object is needed. So, I'm sticking to that without any additional explanation unless specifically asked. Let's confirm the output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} \n\nReady to deliver!"
