The content mentions helping complete the starter form and states they joined in October. This sounds like it falls under HR Support since it's related to a new starter's onboarding process. I think I\u2019ll output the category as a JSON object, indicating \"HR Support\" as the appropriate classification.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this ticket, which relates to onboarding a new starter. It could fall under \"HR Support\" for onboarding, or possibly \"Access\" if access rights are involved. The text mentions completing an attached starter form, likely indicating it's primarily an HR issue. While access might be needed later, the emphasis here is on form completion. So, I think \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate choice for this ticket.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the ticket as \"HR Support.\" Now, I just need to respond with a JSON object that accurately reflects that choice. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I want to make sure the formatting is correct and aligns with the instructions, so I'll keep it simple without any extra text. Okay, let's deliver this response!"
