The user has mentioned issues involving an administrator not being able to find a user and the request for help with adding users. \n\nThis sounds like it relates to access and administrative rights. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this as either \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d It seems to center around managing accounts for a build process, likely related to CI/CD in Git.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe user mentioned that the administrator can't find a user and needs help adding users. This indicates it's about provisioning or adding users to a service account, likely within a CI system. \n\nI'm considering two categories: \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it involves adding users, it leans more toward access provisioning. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it involved granting privileges, I think \"Access\" is the better fit for this ticket. \n\nTherefore, I would categorize it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
