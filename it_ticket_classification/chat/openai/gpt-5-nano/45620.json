The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I should carefully map the details of the ticket to one of these categories to ensure proper handling. By choosing the most relevant category, I can help streamline the process and make sure the ticket is resolved effectively.**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nThe ticket concerns password expiration issues related to Active Directory test users. It mentions needing to check if their passwords have expired and requests assistance in resetting those passwords. The user raises ongoing authentication problems and indicates that the issue persists, which could affect team operations. It's essential to address this promptly to avoid disrupting their work. I'll ensure to focus my response on these key points to help resolve the situation effectively.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m identifying this as an access issue related to authentication problems caused by password expiry in Active Directory. The most appropriate category here seems to be \"Access.\" Although \"Internal Project\" could apply since it involves test users, \"Access\" fits better. I should present my response in the required JSON format. The response will be simply: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra notes, as the guidelines specify a clean output. Let's proceed with that."
