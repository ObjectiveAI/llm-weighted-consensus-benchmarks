This ticket discusses decommissioning, visual inspections, and connected devices. I initially thought about \"Access\" since it involves network access, but the focus seems more on a project to decommission systems, which might align better with \"Internal Project.\" There's a mention of hardware, but the main theme revolves around the planned decommissioning of those networks. So, \"Internal Project\" fits best!**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket. \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best since it discusses the planned decommissioning of old wireless networks. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if the user seeks permission, it\u2019s not clear. \"Access\" might work if it pertains to managing device access, but again, it's not explicit. \"Hardware\" relates to physical devices, but since the user highlights a project, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" I'll format my response as a JSON object as required.**Finalizing the IT ticket categorization**\n\nI need to respond to the user's request to categorize the IT ticket by providing a JSON object with just the category. The best fit here seems to be \"Internal Project\" due to the planned decommissioning mentioned. While \"Hardware\" might be a contender, it's more about the project aspect. To keep it clear and concise, I\u2019ll ensure the response only includes the required format, without any unnecessary content. So, I'll output: `{\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}`."
