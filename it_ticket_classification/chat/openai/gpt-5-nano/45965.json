This might indicate a problem related to an email address or a shipping address, potentially involving an order of tickets. The mention of \"last one was sent yesterday\" could point to a recent email or shipment related to this issue. I need to categorize this appropriately, but it doesn't seem to fit under administrative rights, storage, purchase, access, or hardware categories.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering that \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best here since the text mentions \"senior analyst architecture\" and references an \"order\" with an \"address issue.\" This suggests it's about an internal IT system issue. While there\u2019s no explicit category named \"Internal Project\", I think it's still the most suitable one based on the context. Alternatively, I could play it safe and go with \"Miscellaneous\" if the content feels messy, but I\u2019d prefer \"Internal Project.\" Now, I need to create a JSON object with the chosen category.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
