It seems clear they want to increase this limit. \n\nFrom the list of categories, I think \"Storage\" makes the most sense since it's about attachment size. However, \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" could also be options, but it\u2019s best to go with \"Storage.\" This helps keep things organized and clear!**Determining the right category**\n\nI'm analyzing how to categorize an IT ticket related to configuration changes. It might fit into \"Administrative rights\" since it involves constraints or admin settings, but that's more about permissions. \n\nOn the other hand, \"Storage\" seems suitable, as it covers attachment storage limits. This particular ticket deals with adjusting a system limitation for attachments, so \"Storage\" feels most appropriate. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Storage\" and respond with that in a structured JSON format, as the instructions specify!**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to return a JSON object with the category set to \"Storage.\" The final response should look like this: `{\"category\":\"Storage\"}`. \n\nThe instruction specifically asks for a \"category\" field, so I'll stick closely to that format. Since the user asked to categorize the IT ticket, I\u2019ll keep it simple and straightforward. I\u2019ll just ensure there are no extraneous spaces and deliver the response as required!"
