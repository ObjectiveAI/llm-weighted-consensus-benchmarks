However, it could also relate to \"Administrative rights\" or even \"Internal Project\" if tied to a specific project.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket seems focused on license procurement and installation for software. The content suggests that the user has installed something on a machine and purchased a license. The best fit for this ticket is the \"Purchase\" category due to its emphasis on licensing. It could also relate to \"Administrative rights,\" but it seems more centered on the purchase itself.
