The provided text mentions creating a new list and adding members, which suggests it could be related to an internal project. \n\nI\u2019ll create a JSON object that follows the required format and include \"Internal Project\" as the category since it\u2019s about creating a list and managing members. Let\u2019s keep it clear and structured!**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize the IT ticket, and I'm considering \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Purchase.\" \n\nThe ticket mentions creating a new list, which seems indicative of a project-related task. There's also a scheduling detail and references to adding members and an order. Since it mainly revolves around creating a list and managing members, \"Internal Project\" feels right. \"Access\" could apply, but it\u2019s not explicitly asking for access rights, so I\u2019ll stick with \"Internal Project.\"**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm reviewing the options for categorizing the IT ticket, and it seems most fitting to choose \"Internal Project.\" The user is creating a new list and adding members, which suggests collaboration. \n\nAlthough \"Administrative rights\" relates to permissions for adding members, there's no explicit request for access rights. I'll go with \"Internal Project\" since it aligns best with the task of creating and managing a list. I'll structure my output as a valid JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
