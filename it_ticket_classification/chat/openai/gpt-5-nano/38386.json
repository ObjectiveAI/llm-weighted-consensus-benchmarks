I need to categorize this ticket from the list: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. Since it mentions access issues, Access seems like the best fit. Let's go with that category for clarity and ensure proper handling!**Categorizing Access Issues**\n\nThe ticket describes an access issue with an error code indicating a forbidden server response and mentions issues accessing a leaver form. So, it really seems like this is an access problem. While I could consider \"Administrative rights\" because it involves permissions, it sounds more focused on general access rather than admin privileges. Given the context, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and prepare to respond with the appropriate JSON category field!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
