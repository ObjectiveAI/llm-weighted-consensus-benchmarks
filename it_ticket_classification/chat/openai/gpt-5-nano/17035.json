It mentions wanting access to both libraries, likely related to either the Access or Administrative rights categories. Key phrases like \u201cwants to access,\u201d \u201cgranted,\u201d and \u201cuser accept decline\u201d stand out, pointing to an access request. Considering all this, I think the best fit for this ticket category would be \u201cAccess,\u201d but \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could also be relevant if it involves credentials.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe phrase \"granted both libraries prod\" seems to indicate access to production libraries, which often relates to the \u201cAccess\u201d category or \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d Since the user wants to access something, the implication is about access permissions. In ticket categorization, \u201cAccess\u201d usually pertains to general requests for resource access, while \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d is for elevated permissions. Given that the user didn't specify elevated rights, I think \u201cAccess\u201d is the most appropriate choice. I'll respond with the category in the required JSON format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
