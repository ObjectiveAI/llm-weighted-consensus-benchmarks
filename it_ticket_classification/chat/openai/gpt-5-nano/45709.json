The details mention terms like \"leaver,\" which likely refers to someone leaving, and \"ad admin,\" suggesting it's about Active Directory administration. The ticket also seems to touch on receiving notifications related to this process. Based on the context, it looks like the most fitting category would be \"Access,\" as it pertains to permissions in Active Directory.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket, and I'm sifting through the details. \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant, but \"AD admin\" doesn't explicitly imply that. The term \"leaver\" indicates someone leaving, and there are references to inbound AD notifications, which seem to concern user access changes. Given all this, \"Access\" fits best since it relates to Active Directory and the potential for offboarding tasks. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" and prepare a JSON object for the response.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nThe user's request focuses on creating a specific JSON object based on a given schema. The category we\u2019ve identified is \"Access,\" and I need to ensure I follow the exact formatting required. It should be straightforward: I'll respond with the JSON object formatted as {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any additional commentary. I want to make sure that I get it just right. So, I\u2019ll finalize and deliver that!"
