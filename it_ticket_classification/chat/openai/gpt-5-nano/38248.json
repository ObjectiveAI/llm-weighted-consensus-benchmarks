From the options provided, this seems to relate to internal project issues. So, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON response. The format specifies I should create an object with a \"category\" key, and the chosen category will be \"Internal Project.\" Alright, I\u2019ll respond with `{\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}`.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think this ticket is related to access issues since the user is having trouble adding a team member to a project. It could technically fall under \"Access,\" as it deals with project access management. The error during member selection points to permission problems. While \"Internal Project\" and \"Administrative rights\" might be possibilities, I see that \u201cAccess\u201d really fits best here since it focuses on permission issues. So, I'll categorize the ticket as \"Access.\"**Finalizing category response**\n\nI'm considering the \"Internal Project\" category, but the ticket is really about adding a member to a project, which focuses more on user access. So, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Access.\" The ticket mention from \"manager en\" doesn't change my conclusion. I just need to provide a JSON object with the category. It should be straightforward, like: `{\"category\": \"Access\"}`. No extra explanations are necessary unless requested, so I'll deliver that cleanly."
