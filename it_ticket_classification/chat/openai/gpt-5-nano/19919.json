The user\u2019s message is a bit jumbled but mentions a \"new board project,\" governance, and action items, which suggests it relates to board governance or an internal project. Given the context, \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best for classifying this ticket. I'm also considering \"Administrative rights,\" but I think \"Internal Project\" is the most appropriate choice here.**Finalizing category decision**\n\nIt seems this ticket is primarily about governance action items, and not so much about access rights or HR. \"Miscellaneous\" would just be a catch-all. Given the references to a \"new board project\" and \"governance action items,\" I think categorizing it as an \"Internal Project\" makes the most sense. I should respond with a JSON-like format for the category: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nSince the instructions suggest to focus on the category without any extra text.**Confirming category assignment**\n\nI'm considering whether \"governance board governance action items\" could relate to \"Administrative rights,\" but that seems unlikely. The user is mentioning a \"third board platform governance\" and action items, which could indeed fit under \"Internal Project.\" So, I'll go with that category. \n\nI need to ensure the JSON format is correct since it should be a simple text object. I'll output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nThat\u2019s all I need to provide!"
