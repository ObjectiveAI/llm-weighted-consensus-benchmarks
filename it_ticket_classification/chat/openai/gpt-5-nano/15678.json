The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the content relates to admin accounts and access control, \"Administrative rights\" seems suitable. However, \"Access\" also fits because it pertains to enforcing policy for these accounts. I need to decide which category is more precise here.**Choosing the Correct Category**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket related to accounts with passwords that never expire. This suggests a connection to privileged accounts, which fits well under \"Administrative rights.\" However, \"Access\" could apply too, especially when dealing with user permissions. Since the text talks about \"internal audit admin accounts\" and mentions applying a password policy, I think \"Administrative rights\" is the best choice. The format should be: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I need to double-check the capitalization!**Finalizing JSON Output**\n\nThe category needs to be spelled \"Administrative rights\" with the space included. For the output, I\u2019ll format it simply as: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I need to keep it minimal and ensure I don\u2019t add extra commentary. The response will be purely in JSON format, just as requested. Let's make sure it\u2019s clear and concise!"
