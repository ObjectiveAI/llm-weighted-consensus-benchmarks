Given the mention of administrative rights, the most fitting categories appear to be either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \"Internal Project\" doesn't seem relevant here. There might be some overlap with \"Miscellaneous\" as well.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think the best fit for this IT ticket is either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" \"Access\" could refer to permissions for booking, but since the main focus is changing the owner and overseeing admin rights, \"Administrative rights\" seems more precise. The user asked for categorization, and I need to return a JSON object with the category value. The format should be something like {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} based on the schema provided. It requires a specific structure, so I'll ensure that the output is correct.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
