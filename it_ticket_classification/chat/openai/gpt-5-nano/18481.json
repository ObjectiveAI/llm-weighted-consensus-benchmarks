This way, the ticket can be processed efficiently. I want to ensure I'm getting it right!**Sorting through ticket chaos**\n\nI'm reviewing this ticket, and it\u2019s filled with a lot of disorganized, repetitive information about a new project and a request for separate tickets. It mentions various technical details, updates, and forms while also expressing the need for assistance. With all this chaos, I realize it\u2019s crucial to categorize the ticket correctly to address the issues. I want to ensure I'm capturing everything necessary to streamline the process and avoid delays!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing this ticket, and it relates to things like \"new project code,\" \"setup form configuration,\" and various assigned record numbers. At first, I thought it might fall under \"Administrative rights,\" but that doesn't quite fit. \"Internal Project\" seems more accurate since it pertains to a new project and associated forms. I've considered other categories, but none align better than \"Internal Project.\" So, I\u2019m feeling confident that this is the right category for this ticket!**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that includes a \"category\" field. The instructions specify that the format should be JSON-like, which clarifies that I'm required to categorize this IT ticket based on the predefined options. The allowed values include things like \"Hardware\" and \"Internal Project.\" After confirming that I should quote everything correctly, I'll finalize my response as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nIt's important not to add any extra text, so I'll just output this directly!"
