The issue seems to be with a laptop not recognizing the external monitor. They also want to assign the ticket for further assistance. I think the best category for this is \"Hardware\" since the problem is related to the hardware itself, specifically the monitor. While \"Internal Project\" could fit, \"Hardware\" is more straightforward given the nature of the issue.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to ensure that my response is in the correct JSON format, specifically with a \"category\" field. Based on what the user is asking, I should only provide the necessary information, which is {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. There's no need for any additional text since the request was clear. I'll confirm that the field is spelled correctly and that \"Hardware\" is the appropriate category. So, I'll just output the JSON itself."
