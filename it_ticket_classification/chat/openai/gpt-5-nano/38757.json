They're mentioning that the cable isn't working and asking for a replacement, which sounds like a hardware issue. It could fit in the \"Hardware\" category since it relates to peripherals. However, if they specifically want a replacement, it may also fit in \"Purchase.\" So I\u2019ll consider categorizing it as either \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI see that in IT service management, \"Hardware\" relates to hardware issues like peripherals and cables, while \"Purchase\" is meant for procurement requests. Since the user is asking for a replacement instead of purchasing advice, I think \"Hardware\" is the way to go. I'll respond with a JSON-like object that categorizes the ticket accordingly. \n\nThe output will be a JSON object with the category set to \"Hardware,\" keeping it straightforward as per the instructions.**Outputting category JSON**\n\nThe user has asked to categorize the IT ticket, so I'll respond with the required category. I'll make sure to follow the schema precisely, creating a JSON object that includes the category as \"Hardware.\" \n\nThe output will look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Even though I considered adding a brief message, the instruction emphasizes returning just the category, so I'll stick to what's needed and output only the JSON object."
