The user described a messy ticket related to password expiry notifications and the process for changing passwords. It mentions instances like \"disable device credentials\" and \"administrative rights\". It seems to focus on managing expiring passwords and security, so I lean towards classifying it under Access or possibly Internal Project since it's about user credentials.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI'm pondering whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" It seems to focus on expiring password notifications and changing passwords, which ties to access control. The ticket mentions disabling device credentials, connected devices, and modifications related to logins. Given that it's mainly about managing user credentials, categorizing it as \"Access\" makes the most sense. Next, I\u2019ll create a response in JSON format, representing the chosen category: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Confirming category for IT ticket**\n\nThe instructions say to respond with just the category object in JSON format. I feel confident that \"Access\" is the right choice since the ticket deals with expiring passwords, changing credentials, and account management. It clearly relates to access control. So, I\u2019ll deliver the response without any extra commentary, ensuring it\u2019s just the JSON object. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
