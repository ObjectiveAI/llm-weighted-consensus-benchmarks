The user mentions problems with purchase orders and possibly needing access granted. Based on the details, I consider \"Access\" for the permission issue or \"HR Support\" since it involves submitting time sheets, which relate to human resources. I need to select the most fitting category for this ticket.**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the IT ticket categories, and \"HR Support\" seems fitting because it involves HR-related systems. However, \"Access\" is also a strong contender due to mentions of permission issues and needing line manager access. The ticket discusses Oracle Time Sheet problems, including entry errors and purchase order downloads. \n\nSince the main focus revolves around permissions, \"Access\" might be the most appropriate category after all. I\u2019ll respond with the category in the required JSON format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
