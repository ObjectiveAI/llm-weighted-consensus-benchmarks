The text discusses setting up notification rules for ticket owners, which makes me think it relates to \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" but it doesn\u2019t seem about access credentials. It could fit \"Internal Project\" since it deals with coordination. However, given the focus on notifications and ownership, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best category here. The options feel a bit limited.**Categorizing an IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket content seems garbled, discussing setting up notifications related to ticket owners. This sounds like a configuration task rather than a hardware or storage issue. It could fall under \"Miscellaneous,\" but I think \"Internal Project\" fits best since it involves project and ticket ownership. \"Administrative rights\" would be inappropriate, and \"Access\" doesn't apply here since it\u2019s not about credentials. So, I'll provide the answer in a JSON-like format:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
