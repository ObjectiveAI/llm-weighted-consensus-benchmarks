I\u2019m thinking it could fit into either the \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights\" categories.**Evaluating IT ticket categorization**\n\nI need to think through how to categorize this IT ticket. The request seems to relate to adding new fields to an information screen, specifically mentioning \"edited by\" and \"date years date.\" This sounds like a software enhancement rather than anything hardware-related. The category options include \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project,\" depending on whether it's for a specific development. Since it doesn\u2019t fit other categories like HR, Access, or Storage, I lean towards \"Miscellaneous\" for a general request.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI need to select a category for this IT ticket. I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" since it seems like a general software feature request. Though, if it's intended for a specific product, then \"Internal Project\" could work better. The user's phrase about the \"information screen\" is somewhat unclear. I should still respond with \"Miscellaneous,\" providing a brief explanation and perhaps suggesting clarifying questions to better understand the request. I want to keep the response concise while still helping!**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI see that the structure requires a specific JSON format for the category response. The schema indicates we should use a category object, so I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}. Since the instructions focus on providing just the category, I won't add extra commentary. Just to be safe, I'll ensure it follows the right format without additional explanations. Keeping it straightforward is key here, so I'll go ahead and finalize that as my output."
