It looks like \"HR Support\" is a suitable category since it involves an employee's offboarding, and \"Access\" might be relevant too, especially for removing system access when someone leaves. The request seems to be about an Oracle access addition for reporting on tasks, so it\u2019s linked to HR offboarding.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m wondering if \u201cadd Oracle for leaver\u201d refers to granting Oracle access to someone who is leaving. In HR terms, a \u201cleaver\u201d means an employee exiting the company. Therefore, \u201cHR Support\u201d could fit well. However, since there\u2019s an \"Access\" category, it\u2019s tricky deciding which is more appropriate. The ticket suggests generating an entries report for the leaver, so I think it leans towards \"HR Support,\" but \u201cAccess\u201d might also be suitable. My final choice will be:  \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating the ticket, which mentions \u201cadd Oracle for leaver Thursday PM.\u201d It seems like this involves enabling Oracle access for an employee who is leaving. There\u2019s an \"Administrative rights\" category, which could refer to granting admin access, but since the user mentions \"leaver\" and requests an entries report, it leans toward \u201cHR Support.\u201d Although there\u2019s also mention of internal projects, my best call for this ticket would be:  \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI\u2019m concluding that the best category for this ticket is \"HR Support\" rather than \"Access.\" This is mainly because the focus is on a leaver, which relates to HR processes. The mention of reports and entries likely refers to payroll or time entries that HR typically manages. I\u2019ll format my final answer as a JSON object:  \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}  \n\nI\u2019ll ensure it follows the proper format as instructed!"
