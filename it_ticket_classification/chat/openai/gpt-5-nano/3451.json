The mention of \"design lead ext\" could mean \"design lead external,\" but that\u2019s uncertain. If the details don\u2019t clarify, I think asking for clarification would help. Based on the content, I\u2019d categorize it as \"Hardware\" or possibly \"Internal Project,\" leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the safer option.**Responding with category**\n\nThe ticket seems to relate to hardware or virtualization issues, referring to components like hosts, CPU, OS, and hypervisor. I should categorize it as \"Hardware.\" If the user prefers \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" I can suggest those options. It makes sense to ask for clarification if needed, but I want to keep it concise. The response format should be a JSON object with the category field. So, I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Simple and straightforward!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
