While \"Administrative Rights\" could apply if installation requires admin permissions, I think \"Purchase\" is the most accurate category here.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI see the text \"order install his please assist\" is ambiguous, but for IT ticket routing, I believe \"Purchase\" fits best for license procurement. Since we have a structure for the category as a JSON object, I\u2019ll respond with just that.\n\nI\u2019ll create a single JSON object formatted properly: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Let\u2019s keep it concise and straightforward without any extra commentary, just delivering the needed information as requested."
