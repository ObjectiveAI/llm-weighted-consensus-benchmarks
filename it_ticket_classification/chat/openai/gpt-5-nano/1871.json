The text includes phrases like \"allow access only for\" and mentions \"remote.\" This seems to indicate it\u2019s about access control. I think the most fitting categories could be either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it might relate to privileged access. I\u2019ll choose the one that aligns best with the request.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm looking at the categories available, which include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the ticket seems to be about access, I'll lean towards categorizing it as \"Access.\" The text is a bit unclear, especially phrases like \"allow access only for.\" There's also \"remote\" and \"lead,\" which could mean \"remote and lead.\" I need to output a JSON object with the correct category, and \"Access\" definitely feels like the right fit here.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
