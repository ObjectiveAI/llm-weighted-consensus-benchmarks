It seems to mention \"edit rights\" and issues with \"updating forecasts,\" which highlights problems with permissions. Given the context, I think the most fitting category would be \"Access\" since the user is asking for help with updating rights and mentions screen captures related to these issues. This is all about getting the right access, so that makes sense!**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at this ticket about permissions or access rights, probably in an application like Excel or a forecasting tool. The \"Access\" category seems the right choice since it's focused on updating rights and permissions. It could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" if it concerns granting admin-level access. However, since it\u2019s more about general access, I think \"Access\" is safer to use. So, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON response indicating the category as \"Access.\"{\"category\": \"Access\"}"
