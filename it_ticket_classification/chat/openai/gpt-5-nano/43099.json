The categories available include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the ticket involves duplicate notifications, it seems to be a software issue. The most fitting categories might be \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project,\" as there's no specific category for Software or Notifications. I should choose the best fit here!**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nFor this IT ticket regarding notifications, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous.\" If it relates to an in-house project, \u201cInternal Project\u201d could work, especially since the user mentioned needing to open a ticket for \u201csn\u201d\u2014possibly meaning serial or service number. The issue of duplicate notifications seems tied to software rather than hardware or any other category specified. Ultimately, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to fit best, so I\u2019ll prepare to format this in the required output structure!**Preparing Category Response**\n\nI need to make sure I respond correctly with a category object as per the instructions. The valid response format requires me to give only the category field, specifying \"Miscellaneous\" based on my previous reasoning about the IT ticket. Double-checking the formatting, I see that it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and respond with exactly that, without any additional text. Let\u2019s make this clear and concise!"
