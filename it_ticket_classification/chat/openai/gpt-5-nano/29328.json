Since it\u2019s about granting access for a project, the most fitting category seems to be Access. It could also be considered Administrative Rights if it specifically pertains to access rights.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI'm looking at the ticket that mentions \"project access request\" and \"please add him.\" It seems to clearly relate to granting access. Since \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" are separate categories, and the details fit \"Access\" better, I'll go with that. The expected output needs to be in JSON format, so I'll prepare it as {\"category\": \"Access\"}. I need to keep it all neat and just provide that JSON object without any extra text."
