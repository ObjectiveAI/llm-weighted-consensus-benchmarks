Given the context of granting roles and permissions, \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could fit best. Since it's about upgrading permissions, categorizing it as \"Administrative rights\" seems more precise. Now, I'll make sure to output the category in the required JSON format.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
