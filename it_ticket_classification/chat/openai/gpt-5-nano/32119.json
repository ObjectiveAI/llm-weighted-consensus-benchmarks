I need to respond in a structured format, something like a JSON object with a category field. So I'll go with: \"category\": \"HR Support.\" That should work!**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize the IT ticket and has specified that it should be classified as \"HR Support.\" I need to make sure to return just the exact JSON format they've requested. \n\nEven though there was some confusion about the structure, it\u2019s clear that I should simply output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.
