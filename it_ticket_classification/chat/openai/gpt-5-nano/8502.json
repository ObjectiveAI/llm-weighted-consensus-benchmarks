It\u2019s essential to assign the correct category string so that it can be processed appropriately. Let\u2019s make sure I carefully consider which category best fits the issue reported, as the right classification can make a difference in how quickly it gets resolved!**Analyzing user ticket**\n\nThe user input is a lengthy IT ticket focusing on cleaning and updating attributes, class categories, and codes. They mention issues with duplicating parameters and constraints that prevent overwriting class categories. It seems they're seeking help to ensure their database is accurately classified for effective analysis and reporting. They also request progress updates and guidance for those involved. This ticket clearly indicates high importance, so I need to address these concerns as best as I can.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket does mention several terms like \"extended permissions\" and \"status,\" but it seems more focused on data cleanup and classification rather than administrative rights. Given that it's centered on a restructuring process for improving database classifications, I think the most fitting category would be \"Internal Project.\" That clearly aligns with the nature of the task at hand. If there's any doubt, \"Miscellaneous\" could also work, but \"Internal Project\" feels like the right choice. I should format my response in a JSON-like structure.**Formatting category as JSON**\n\nThe prompt specifies that I need to format the category as a JSON object. I should create one with the category field listing a value from the provided options. So, I\u2019ll structure it like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I need to make sure it\u2019s properly formatted as JSON without any additional formatting that isn\u2019t specified. Let\u2019s keep it simple and stick to the required structure for clarity!"
