This seems to indicate a bug in the reporting module related to project management. I think the best fit for categorizing this issue is \"Internal Project,\" as it pertains to internal tools managing project workloads. I also need to provide the output in JSON format with the appropriate category field as specified in the instructions.**Formulating JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object specifying the category. The best match for the user's issue seems to be \"Internal Project,\" since it relates to project reports. While \"Miscellaneous\" is more general, it doesn't fit as well. The instructions clearly indicate that I should output just the category. After confirming the schema, I'll provide the concise JSON response: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I feel confident that this aligns with what the user needs!"
