The details include a resignation, request to disable an account, and prepare a leaver letter. This touches on disabling a user account, which is clearly an access-related task, leading me to think \"Access\" is the best fit. However, since it also involves resignation and HR aspects, it could also fall under \"HR Support.\" I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access,\" though!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm focused on categorizing an IT ticket that revolves around disabling an account and preparing a leaver letter. While it clearly requires access-related action, I also see HR aspects involved. The most fitting category seems to be \"Access,\" especially considering the emphasis on disabling the account today. Although \"HR Support\" is relevant, this ticket is fundamentally about IT actions. So, I\u2019ll output the required JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No extra text needed!**Confirming ticket classification**\n\nI\u2019m double-checking the content of the IT ticket, which mentions \"disable today,\" \"leaver letter,\" and \"resignation.\" It\u2019s clear that the most suitable category here is \"Access,\" as that aligns directly with the task of disabling an account. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and respond accordingly, focusing on ensuring that I accurately categorize it within the provided framework. It's always good to confirm before finalizing my answer!"
