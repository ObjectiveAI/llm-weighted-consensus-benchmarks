They wrote something a bit garbled about needing access to an Oracle report, mentioning \"updated reports\" and a \"report cancelled.\" Based on the provided categories, \"Access\" seems like the most logical choice since they're asking for access to a system. \"Administrative rights\" could also fit because it pertains to permissions. However, I think \"Access\" is the best option here, given the focus on accessing the report.**Determining ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering the category for an IT ticket that mentions \"access to an Oracle report\" and updating reports. While \"Administrative rights\" makes sense if it's about privileges, \"Access\" seems more fitting since the user is requesting access. There's also \"Miscellaneous,\" but with the instruction to categorize, I'll likely go with \"Access.\" The format expected is a JSON object, so I\u2019ll provide that, and I could also ask if they need further details. Here\u2019s the JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
