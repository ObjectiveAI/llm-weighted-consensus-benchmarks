The word \"info\" could suggest a request for information, while \"hi guys\" feels like a friendly greeting. \"Caddy\" might be a username, and \u201cbest regards engineer\u201d could indicate it\u2019s from an engineer. Since there's no clear issue or request for help, I think the best categories could be \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\"**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nThe content of the ticket is quite vague. In these cases, if there's no clear issue, I typically categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" However, the message doesn't indicate it's a project, so I lean towards \"Miscellaneous.\" The term \"caddy\" might suggest something like \"Caddy server,\" but there isn\u2019t enough context to confirm that. I think I should respond with a JSON object stating:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}\n\nThat's the required format with just the category.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
