It seems most aligned with the \"Access\" category, as it focuses on managing rights for employees leaving or transferring. However, it might also fit \"Administrative rights\" if admin privileges are specifically discussed.**Clarifying Ticket Categorization**\n\nThe text discusses various actions related to access management, specifically mentioning \"disable starting rights\" and revoking resources. It talks about a leaver process for revoking access, which makes me think the ticket isn't solely about admin rights. Given the categories provided\u2014like Hardware, HR Support, Access, etc.\u2014it seems best suited for \"Access\" since it deals with provisioning and de-provisioning user accounts. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply, it's more general access management being discussed here.**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON-like object for the IT ticket categorization. The instructions specify to categorize this ticket and provide a schema for it: \n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}\n\nSince the proper category appears to be \"Access,\" I\u2019ll output just that without any additional justification. It\u2019s important to match capitalization exactly. So, my response will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
