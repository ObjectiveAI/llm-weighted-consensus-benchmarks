There's also the \"Access\" category separate from \"Administrative rights.\" If someone is routed to the wrong approver, it might require correcting user access or workflow in the expense reporting system. The user's concern seems to be about data in the expense report rather than access credentials, but it could still relate to \"Administrative rights.\"**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nThe user didn\u2019t mention needing to reset a password or access rights, but the issue with \"the wrong person being asked to approve\" points to an approval workflow problem. I'm thinking it should fall under \"Administrative rights,\" although \"Miscellaneous\" could work as a catch-all. Since they asked for categorization, I want to go with \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll prepare the final output following the required JSON format, which is: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. Let's provide that!"
