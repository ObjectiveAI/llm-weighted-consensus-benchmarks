They mention that modified issues still show a \"strike through,\" suggesting a problem persists in the tracking system. The user also refers to having logged this same issue a week or two ago. It seems they're facing obstacles with changes to tickets while managing progress in the system. I think this falls under the \"Internal Project\" category for it.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThis issue seems tied to an internal software project involving issue tracking. I think the best fit for the category would be \"Internal Project,\" as the user discusses modifying issues and mentions previous entries about the problem. They also refer to using shared resources for tracking progress, but I\u2019m not quite sure what \"br software tester\" refers to\u2014maybe it\u2019s about a software tester in Brazil. \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights\" don't seem to apply here since the focus is on ticket modifications, not hardware.**Determining the category response**\n\nI\u2019m thinking this ticket best fits the \"Internal Project\" category because it relates to an internal project management tool and modifications to issues and sprints. To respond appropriately, I need to provide a JSON object with the category field set as \"Internal Project.\" \n\nIt looks like the correct format for the output is simply: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, sticking to this structure as outlined in the prompt. This ensures I'm following the required schema properly!**Finalizing the JSON output**\n\nI need to produce the final category value in the specified JSON format. It looks like the answer should simply be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. The format isn't typical since it has a \"category\" wrapper, but that seems to be what's required. I\u2019ll stick to providing just that object, without any extra commentary. It's essential to ensure that I accurately use \"Internal Project\" with the correct spacing as specified in the enumeration. So, that's the final response!"
