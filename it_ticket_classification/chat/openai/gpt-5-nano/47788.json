The system has specific categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket provided mentions issues with Outlook meetings, following up, and conflicts with meeting availability. Given the context, it seems to fall under \"Miscellaneous\" since it relates to a technical meeting issue rather than a specific hardware or administration request. Let's output the JSON with \"category\" set to \"Miscellaneous.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket relates to issues with Outlook meetings, calendars, and meeting overlaps. So, I'm trying to determine the best category: \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d seems to fit as a general IT issue. \u201cAccess\u201d could suggest account permissions, but that doesn\u2019t apply here. \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d is also not correct for scheduling rights. Since the other categories like \u201cHardware\u201d and \u201cHR Support\u201d don't fit either, I'll go with \"Miscellaneous.\" The output will be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
