So, I should create a JSON object with the category set to \"Storage\" in the required format. I need to ensure I\u2019m following the schema correctly for the response.**Generating JSON response**\n\nI see that the instruction requires me to respond with a JSON object that includes a \"category\" property and its value should be one of the allowed strings. So, that means I can simply create: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. However, I need to ensure that the response structure is correct, with the proper schema in mind. No extra text or formatting should be included. I think \"Storage\" is the best choice, regardless of the urgency mentioned. I'll produce that now."
