The text mentions planned work and seems to relate to infrastructure, but it doesn't clearly fit into any specific category like hardware, HR support, or access. However, it leans towards an internal project given the context of planned work and the attached notes. So, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" since that feels like the best fit.**Parsing content for categorization**\n\nI need to analyze the message which discusses planned work related to a Change Advisory Board (CAB) and a change request (CR). The mention of \"OneCom portal\" suggests it's about infrastructure, specifically not hardware, access, or storage. Given that it's a change notification for planned work, the best category seems to be \"Internal Project.\" It fits well since it highlights upcoming changes without crossing into administrative rights or miscellaneous areas. So, I'll go with \"Internal Project.\"{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
