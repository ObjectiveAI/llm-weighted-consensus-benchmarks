They mentioned \"new purchase\" and talked about \"purchase order,\" installations, and receipts. It appears to focus on procurement and installation processes. Given all those details, it looks like the best fit for this ticket would be the \"Purchase\" category since it covers purchasing and related administrative requests. I'm wondering if \"Administrative rights\" might also apply, but \"Purchase\" feels like the primary choice.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI think this ticket is about hardware purchase based on the user\u2019s message mentioning \"new purchase\" and a purchase order. They asked me to categorize it instead of resolving the issue. Given the content, it seems to focus mainly on purchasing, even though \"log each location installation\" could suggest an \"Internal Project\" if there were deployments involved. However, since purchasing is the primary theme, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll format it as the required JSON object:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}**Formatting response**\n\nI see that the category format requires it to be an object with properties. For this case, it means I need to structure the response as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I should stick closely to this format, following the prompt precisely. So, I\u2019m ready to reply with that format. It\u2019s straightforward, and I want to make sure I present it correctly. Let\u2019s go ahead and respond accordingly."
