In the IT ticket taxonomy, I see a distinction between access rights and administrative rights. This message seems to focus on granting access to a specific folder, possibly falling under \"Access.\" However, if they're looking for elevated privileges, it might also fit \"Administrative rights.\" I need to decide on the most appropriate category based on their specific request.**Categorizing IT Tickets**\n\nThe user's message includes terms like \"urgent\" and \"writing rights myself,\" which suggests they need write access to a folder. This seems to indicate a permissions issue rather than administrative rights. I think categorizing this as \"Access\" makes the most sense. I need to format my response as a JSON object to align with the required schema, which includes a specific \"category\" field. The output will look like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, ensuring it meets the specified guidelines.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
