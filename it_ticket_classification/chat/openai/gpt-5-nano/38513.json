It looks like it might be about a double booking or something with the submit button being unclickable. \n\nGiven the options available, I should categorize it under \"Miscellaneous\" since it doesn\u2019t strictly fit into the other defined categories.**Categorizing software issues**\n\nI'm dealing with a software issue here, not hardware or storage, and my main options seem to be \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access.\" However, it doesn't look like it's about access since there's no mention of a login problem. As the ticket highlights a UI issue with the \"cannot submit button,\" it seems to fit better under \"Miscellaneous.\" There's also a mention of double booking that might signify a feature bug. Therefore, I'll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" since it's the most appropriate option given the descriptions.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
