It could fall under several predefined categories: \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" and possibly \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given that it discusses an issue with selecting code in a project management context, it seems to align best with \"Internal Project,\" as this sounds like it's about project management functionality integrated with Oracle.**Classifying the issue**\n\nThe user asked me to check an Oracle project code issue. The categories available include \"Internal Project,\" which seems the right fit since it\u2019s related to internal project management. While \"Miscellaneous\" could apply for unrelated issues, I want to choose the most precise category. Based on the instructions, I need to provide the response as a JSON object. So, I\u2019ll format it correctly: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That's the best way to clarify the categorization.**Finalizing the output**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to approach this IT ticket categorization. If anything seems ambiguous, I could ask clarifying questions. However, the main instruction is to provide a clear classification for the ticket. So, I\u2019ll focus on that and make sure to keep it straightforward. I want to output the category directly without adding any extra text. Let's get this done!"
