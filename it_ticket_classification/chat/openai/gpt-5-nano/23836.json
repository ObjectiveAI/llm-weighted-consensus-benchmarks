It\u2019s definitely not HR Support or Access, so I\u2019ll focus on those two categories as the most relevant.**Classifying the request**\n\nIt looks like the user is a software developer asking for a laptop backpack, which means I need to categorize their request. \"Purchase\" seems to be the best fit since it's about acquiring an item. I found the mention of \"friday december pm,\" but that might just be when they want the backpack. I'll definitely go with the \"Purchase\" category for this IT ticket. I\u2019ll provide the JSON-like object as requested, formatted correctly for the system. Here we go: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
