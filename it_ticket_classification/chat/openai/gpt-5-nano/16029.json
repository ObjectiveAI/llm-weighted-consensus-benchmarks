They mention \u201csocket\u201d and \u201cmoved bureau,\u201d which could suggest a hardware issue related to a network or power socket, especially since they also mention receiving a \u201cfree socket.\u201d This makes me think it\u2019s likely a hardware request. I need to decide which category best fits this scenario. So, I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it under \"Hardware.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket Again**\n\nI'm looking closely at the phrase \u201csoftware developer\u201d in the signature and the message \u201cplease advised moved bureau received free socket.\u201d It likely should read as \"Please advise, moved bureau; received free socket.\" However, I still need to decide on the category. Since \"socket\" suggests hardware, I\u2019m leaning toward the \"Hardware\" category. It\u2019s unlikely to involve \"Administrative rights,\" and the other categories like \"Access\" or \"Storage\" don\u2019t fit. So, I\u2019ll confidently categorize this ticket as \"Hardware.\"**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond using the required JSON format specified in the prompt. The structure I\u2019m using is {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} as the user is likely dealing with hardware based on the mention of \"socket.\" The phrase \"moved bureau\" could suggest an office relocation, potentially making it fall under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" but since \"socket\" is more explicitly mentioned, I\u2019m confident that \"Hardware\" is the best fit. So, I\u2019ll finalize the output as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any extra text."
