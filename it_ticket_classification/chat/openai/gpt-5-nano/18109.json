There isn't much clarity, but it may involve some access rights or a request to create something on behalf of the Chief Digital Officer.**Categorizing User Access Rights**\n\nThis appears to be an IT ticket related to user access rights, likely fitting into either the \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" category. Since \"Administrative rights\" refers to specific privilege elevation, it seems pertinent. The content hints at enabling access for the Chief Digital Officer, which might suggest granting admin rights. However, without clear direction, if it\u2019s not about admin rights, then \u201cAccess\u201d would be the more general category. The message itself is a bit unclear.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe phrase \"own manage\" might refer to \"Owner and manager\" accounts. I think it's prudent to classify this ticket as \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d since it seems related to managing digital access roles. The user has specifically asked for a category in a JSON-like format, so I\u2019ll ensure to follow the schema provided: \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nI'll keep the output straightforward, sticking strictly to the required JSON format without any additional commentary."
