It could fall under \"Storage\" for old files and moving materials, or maybe \"Teams Deadline\" if it's time-sensitive. However, the focus seems to be on providing advice for migration, including access rights and folder locations. This points more towards \"Access\" or specifically \"Administrative Rights.\" Since rights adjustments are central to the request, \"Administrative Rights\" feels like the best choice. It's a detailed distinction!**Choosing a category for rights adjustment**\n\nLooking at the request, the phrase \"adjust rights\" is clearly about rights management, so \"Administrative Rights\" feels like the best fit for the category. The response needs to be in a JSON-like structure as outlined in the requirements. So, I\u2019ll structure it as {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I need to make sure I follow the specified format exactly as they instructed, so I\u2019ll confidently deliver that response without any extra commentary. Here it goes!"
