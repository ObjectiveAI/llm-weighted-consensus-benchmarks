The categories available include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and a few others. It seems the user is asking about access to calendars or filtering them. Since they mention \"absence calendar,\" I think \"HR Support\" is relevant, but they don't specify HR directly. \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could work, but \"HR Support\" seems most fitting.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nThe user's request includes terms like \"absence calendar,\" \"employees,\" and \"codes,\" indicating it's probably about an HR absence calendar. They asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to format the output as a JSON object. While \"Administrative rights\" might apply due to their mention of removing calendars and filtering, the focus clearly leans towards HR. Therefore, \"HR Support\" seems to be the best category, with \"Miscellaneous\" as a fallback. I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
