The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nI should determine which category fits best. After considering the context provided, it seems to blend needs for backup and potentially internal support. Therefore, I need to format my response as a JSON object containing the selected category.I'm parsing the ticket that mentions \"additional capacity Thursday PM,\" indicating a request for more capacity. There are hints they want backup, which relates to storage. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Storage,\" \"Hardware,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Purchase.\" The repeated mention of \"backup\" strongly suggests it's about data protection and storage. This makes \"Storage\" the most fitting category. The sign-off about the managing director likely indicates the request's origin, but the focus is on allocating additional storage capacity.I\u2019ve decided to categorize the ticket as \"Storage\" based on the context provided. Now, I need to format my response as a JSON object, which will look like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. The instructions clearly state that I should respond with this simple JSON payload for clarity. Given that the platform expects this format, I just need to ensure I provide it succinctly, sticking to the required structure in my response."
