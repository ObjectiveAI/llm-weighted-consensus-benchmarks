It mentions \"Idea Ultimate license\" and \"community version,\" which suggests it involves a software license request. The user being a \"senior automation tester\" further supports this idea. I see how it fits into the allowed categories. Given these details, I think this would best map to the \"Purchase\" category since it concerns a license acquisition for the JetBrains IDE.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m contemplating whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Internal Project\" or \"Purchase.\" The text emphasizes licenses for development tools, mentioning \"Idea Ultimate,\" which leans towards being a purchase request. Generally, license requests fit best under the \"Purchase\" category. Plus, I need to format the response as a JSON object according to the required structure. So, I'll succinctly respond with: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}, ensuring everything aligns as specified!**Finalizing the response**\n\nI've decided to go with \"Purchase\" as the category. The instructions are clear that I need to provide this in a JSON format. Since bullet lists are mentioned as acceptable in the prompt, it\u2019s nice to note, but I\u2019ll stick to the required category structure. So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. That should meet the user's needs perfectly! Now, it's time to deliver this response."
