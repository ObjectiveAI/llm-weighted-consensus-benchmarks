It seems to involve problems with the \"Refer a friend\" feature and uploading friend details. I think it fits best into a category related to \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI'm working to categorize this IT ticket, and it's definitely not hardware, storage, or purchase-related. It could be \"Access,\" as it mentions employees needing to provide details for a referral system. \"Internal Project\" might also fit since it's about an internal referral system. There's an \"HR Support\" category that could apply too. The ticket revolves around issues with the referral system requiring employee details. I believe \"Internal Project,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Access\" are the best options here.**Analyzing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket properly based on the options available. \"HR Support\" seems more about HR assistance than IT issues. The request specifies it\u2019s for tech support related to a referral system, which rules out hardware, storage, purchase, or administrative rights. If it\u2019s an internal project, \"Internal Project\" fits. But if it\u2019s about login or permissions, then \"Access\" might be right. Given the mention of needing something from employees, it leans towards an access/permissions issue, likely connected to the \"Select Minds\" platform.**Categorizing user request**\n\nThe user needs help with a referral issue involving the \"Select Minds\" system, where it continuously asks for employee information. This raises the question of which category to choose: \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Access.\" The options don\u2019t include IT Support or Software, which feels limiting. \"Internal Project\" might fit if the referral system is considered a project, and \"HR Support\" could apply since it relates to HR processes. However, since this is an IT ticket, I need to carefully consider the best option.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI'm reviewing the categories available: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \"Access\" could fit since the message mentions an employee needing to provide something, but it doesn\u2019t explicitly indicate a login issue. \"Internal Project\" is relevant for internal software, while \"HR Support\" relates directly to the referral system, which is an HR function. \n\nI think \"HR Support\" is the best choice here. Based on the provided JSON format, the final response will be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
