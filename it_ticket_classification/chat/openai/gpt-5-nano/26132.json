Although \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they\u2019re asking about permissions, \"Internal Project\" really feels like the right choice here.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user's request includes phrases like \"update PM\" and \"project manager update,\" suggesting they need a status update related to a project. Given the categories available, \"Internal Project\" fits best since it pertains to project tasks. There\u2019s a mention of \"working code,\" but the categories are quite generic. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object, specifically {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, adhering to the formatting guidelines without adding any extra text.**Confirming Category**\n\nThe ticket includes phrases like \"project manager update,\" \"PM,\" and \"working code,\" which suggest it relates to an internal project. While \"Miscellaneous\" could be a possibility, the mention of updating the project manager makes \"Internal Project\" the better fit. I\u2019m confident in my choice! I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Now, it's time to deliver that response!"
