Now, I'll output this as a JSON object with the selected category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm looking at how to categorize this IT ticket related to virtualization, backups, and storage. The available categories include \"Storage,\" which fits best given that the content discusses backup failures and virtual machines. While \"Hardware\" could apply due to the local virtual server, the focus is more on the backup job failure and OS mount issues. So, I think \"Storage\" is the most appropriate category.
