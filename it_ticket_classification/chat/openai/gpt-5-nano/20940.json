Looking at the content, it appears to involve project code and various terms like \u201ccost recovery,\u201d \u201cbudget,\u201d \u201cinfrastructure costs,\u201d and \u201cform template.\u201d It sounds mostly related to project management and internal projects, plus possibly administrative rights, rather than access control. It doesn\u2019t seem to fit easily into other categories.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI think this ticket falls under the \"Internal Project\" category since it discusses new project code, forms, budgets, and cost recovery. \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant if it involves approvals, but that\u2019s less clear. While \u201cPurchase\u201d comes to mind regarding costs, it\u2019s more about project code than any actual purchase request, so that doesn\u2019t fit well. I should proceed to create a JSON object to formally categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" Here\u2019s the output:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
