It involves a \"picture attached\" and mentions that the file name is too long during upload. This could indicate a problem with file naming restrictions, suggesting it fits best under \"Storage.\" While \"Miscellaneous\" could also work, I should choose the most accurate category for clarity and efficiency in addressing the user's issue.**Parsing User's IT Ticket**\n\nI'm looking at the user's text about an error message regarding file names. It seems to mention that the file name is likely too long, causing issues during upload. The situation does not relate to hardware or HR support, and it might fall under \"Storage\" since it concerns file upload limits. However, if there\u2019s a catch-all \"Miscellaneous\" category, that might be a safe choice too. I should pick the most relevant category overall!**Assigning IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user's mention of \"uploaded files\" and \"file name too long\" points towards file storage limitations, so I should categorize this ticket as \"Storage.\" To respond correctly, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object since the instructions call for that.\n\nI'll provide the category in the format specified, making sure it\u2019s clear and simple, like: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. No extra notes or content needed\u2014just the JSON format is required here!**Categorizing User's Issue**\n\nThe user's message contains a mention of a \"file name too long\" error, which suggests that this is primarily a storage-related issue concerning file uploads. While there's a chance it could be categorized as \"Miscellaneous\" due to its unclear wording, \"Storage\" is the best fit. Another thought about \"Administrative rights\" comes up, but that doesn\u2019t seem relevant here. I'll finalize my response with the JSON format, focusing on clarity: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}."
