The ticket seems to be about setting up recurring wireless network scans in data centers, with requests for automation and monthly recurring tickets. It may fit best under \"Internal Project\" since it's about implementing a recurring process, although \"Administrative rights\" could also be a possibility.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket. It might fit under \"Miscellaneous,\" but let\u2019s look at the specifics. \n\nHardware, HR Support, Access, Storage, and Purchase don\u2019t apply. Access might relate to data centers, but the focus is on scans. \"Internal Project\" fits well since it's about a process change or automation project. While \"Administrative Rights\" could be a possibility if permissions are needed, the ticket is primarily about implementing recurring tasks. So, I'll classify it as \"Internal Project\" and present it in JSON format.**Crafting Final JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond to the inquiry about categorizing the IT ticket with a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. The instructions are clear that I should just provide this without extra commentary.\n\nThe schema reinforces that the response needs to be a valid object with the specified properties. While a brief rationale could be added, the instruction doesn\u2019t require it, so I\u2019ll keep it concise and deliver only the object as requested."
