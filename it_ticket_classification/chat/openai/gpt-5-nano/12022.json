They tried searching for a guide but had no luck, and they're looking for help. Given the context, I think the best category for this ticket would be \"Access,\" since it pertains to their ability to access Outlook.**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt looks like the ticket is best categorized as \"Access\" since the user is having issues accessing Outlook, particularly on their personal phone's calendar. It seems they're looking for guidance on this, so \"Access\" fits perfectly. Other categories like \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" don't seem relevant here. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object to meet the user's request. It\u2019ll look like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
