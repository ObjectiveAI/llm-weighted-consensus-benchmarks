The categories are \u201cHardware,\u201d \u201cHR Support,\u201d \u201cAccess,\u201d \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d \u201cStorage,\u201d \u201cPurchase,\u201d \u201cInternal Project,\u201d and \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d\n\nThe text mentions an access card for new graduates and changing credentials for a permanent status. Given that, it seems to fit best in the \u201cAccess\u201d category, although \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could also apply. I\u2019ll choose \u201cAccess\u201d as the primary category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe request involves changing account credentials, which corresponds to access management. The mention of \"new graduate access card\" and phrases about interns becoming employees suggest this also relates to onboarding. \n\nI see how \"Access\" fits well since it's specifically about access cards and credentials, yet \"HR Support\" could apply due to the onboarding context. However, since the ticket is primarily about access management, I think \"Access\" should be the final choice for the category. I'll format my answer using the provided JSON schema.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
