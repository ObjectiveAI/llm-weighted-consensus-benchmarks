It seems like they're describing a problem with their smartphone hardware, particularly a cracked screen. The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the description of the ticket, it sounds like the best fit would be the Hardware category, since it's clearly a hardware-related issue with the phone screen.**Interpreting Ticket Details**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket, noting phrases like \"corner glass screen intact\" and \"black like light behind.\" They mentioned work related to the phone screen sent on Monday and referred to a shock. It seems the screen looks clear, but the backlight might be malfunctioning, as it appears black. This implies a hardware issue, specifically with the backlight, so I should categorize it as \"Hardware.\" The output should be in a JSON-like format with the \"category\" key set to \"Hardware.\"**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nThe prompt asks me to categorize the IT ticket, and I need to follow the system's guidance. I\u2019ve determined that it fits under the \"Hardware\" category. The required output is a JSON object specifically with a \"category\" field. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I need to make sure there's no extra text included, just the clean JSON format for the response. Let's stick to that!"
