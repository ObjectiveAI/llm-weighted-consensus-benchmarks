It mentions an issue with updating a career development discussion and that submitted information is being erased. I\u2019m thinking it might fit under one of the allowed categories, specifically \"HR Support,\" since it relates to career development and learning opportunities. However, there\u2019s also a possibility for \"Access,\" if it involves disappearing information. I'll finalize which category aligns best.**Resolving IT ticket category**\n\nThe user is asking for a resolution regarding an application that automatically erases filled information, which suggests a bug in the career discussion update process. While \"Miscellaneous\" could fit, I believe \"HR Support\" is more appropriate since this involves HR processes. I need to respond with a JSON object containing just the category field. The final response should simply be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I'll make sure it's properly formatted without any extra text."
