There's also mention of needing an adaptor, which could classify it as \"Hardware.\" However, since the ticket primarily deals with the feedback link loading indefinitely, it\u2019s more about access. In most IT ticket systems, I would prioritize \"Access\" because that's the core problem here.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
