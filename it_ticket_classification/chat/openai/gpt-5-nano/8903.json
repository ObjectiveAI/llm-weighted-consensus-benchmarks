The ticket mentions a \"hardware token\" repeatedly, which indicates it's focused on that issue. Looking at the categories available\u2014such as Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others\u2014I can determine that this ticket falls under the \"Hardware\" category since it specifically addresses a hardware token problem. I want to make sure this is done accurately to help streamline the process!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis IT ticket is focused on a hardware (security) token for a new starter, highlighting actions like assigning and providing a token serial number. I think the best category is \"Access\" since it's related to granting access to systems. While \"Hardware\" could work toocategory\":\"Access\"}"
