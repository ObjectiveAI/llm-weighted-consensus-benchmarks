They mention issues with report access, satisfaction scores, and navigating through requests, which points toward access or possibly administrative rights. Since they're having trouble accessing reports, the most fitting category seems to be \"Access.\" However, if they require specific privileges to view those reports, \"Administrative rights\" might apply too. Overall, it looks primarily related to access issues regarding reports.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIt looks like the user is asking for access to a Wednesday PM report based on their message. They mention issues navigating requests and incidents, which suggests they need help accessing reports. While \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could be possibilities, I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category here. I should respond with a JSON object that clearly defines the category as \u201cAccess.\u201d It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Deciding on Access Category**\n\nI think \"Access\" is indeed the best fit for the category, especially since the user\u2019s message doesn\u2019t explicitly mention needing administrative rights. They\u2019re looking for help navigating requests and reports without a clear indication of permission issues. While it might be worth considering \"Administrative rights,\" I feel \"Access\" is the safer option. Following the instruction to categorize, I\u2019ll just output the required JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra commentary."
