The instructions mention that I need to output a JSON object with a specific category field drawn from a list of options. The user asks me to categorize the ticket, which has to do with \"active contacts\" and related issues. Parsing the request is challenging with all the typos. Let's identify the main issue for an appropriate category.**Mapping IT Ticket Categories**\n\nI see that the issue is about active contacts and survey filters mentioned in the user's message. They're asking for confirmation about why certain contacts are appearing in the filter. The terms suggest it might relate to a software bug, possibly in a CRM system. I\u2019m considering various categories like \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" and while \"Access\" could be a fit, it doesn't quite match. \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Storage\" are clearly not relevant. Let's clarify!**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nIt looks like the user is reporting a bug concerning \"active contacts\" showing up in a filter, which might be related to a \"send survey\" feature. This could suggest categorizing it under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" since it involves a bug in an internal system. I also consider \"Administrative rights\" if the issue relates to viewing filters. However, the direct mention of \"view thanks customer care manager\" doesn\u2019t fit perfectly. Overall, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the safest choice.**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the best fit since this is a bug in an internal CRM system. The taxonomy indicates that this category is for issues related to internal projects or feature requests, and the mention of \"bug\" really suggests it\u2019s a bug report. If there weren\u2019t a dedicated category for software bugs, I\u2019d consider \"Miscellaneous\". But since it\u2019s clearly tied to internal project management issues, \"Internal Project\" seems appropriate here.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m parsing the user's ticket that discusses a bug related to \"active contacts\" appearing in a filter. It looks like they\u2019re asking about why certain contacts show up in a survey filter, which could indicate a UI issue in the application used by customer care managers. I\u2019m considering whether to categorize this as \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" Leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" feels safer since it's a general bug report, and I'll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
