The phrase \"change left two pending reassign\" hints at pending reassignments. I\u2019m considering categories like Access, since \"approval\" and \"reassign\" relate to user access, or maybe Administrative rights due to the approval aspect, but I'm still unsure.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI've narrowed down the categories for the IT ticket. \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" aren't relevant, and \"Internal Project,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" don't fit either. \"Access\" seems plausible since the ticket involves approvals and reassignments related to Oracle, suggesting user access rights. \"Administrative rights\" is a subset of \"Access.\" I think \"Access\" is the best fit. Now, I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Access\"} and include a brief justification to clarify my reasoning.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
