The phrase \"seems disappeared\" indicates there may be a problem with the booking system. I conclude that the best category for this ticket is indeed \"HR Support.\" It would be appropriate to indicate this in a JSON object format.**Responding with JSON Format**\n\nThe required format for categorizing the IT Ticket is clear: I need to respond with a JSON object that includes a category key, choosing from the defined options. \n\nGiven that the ticket content relates to holiday leave, the most appropriate category is \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ve double-checked to rule out \"Administrative rights\" since the issue concerns booking and leave codes. Therefore, I\u2019ll ensure to present the response as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} without any extra text."
