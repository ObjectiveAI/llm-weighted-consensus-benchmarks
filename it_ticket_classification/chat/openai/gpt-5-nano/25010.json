The most relevant categories from the provided list are \"Purchase\" for software licenses, or possibly \"Administrative rights\" since licenses relate to access. There's also a chance it could fit under \"Internal Project\" due to the design code aspects mentioned. However, given the emphasis on \"license,\" I think it's safest to categorize this as \"Purchase.\"**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m mulling over the best category for this IT ticket. It could be \"Administrative rights\" if they\u2019re asking for a license necessary for software installation, but the text doesn\u2019t clearly mention that. The user is asking to \"provide license draw diagrams,\" which is quite unclear. Ultimately, \u201cPurchase\u201d seems to be the best fit given the context around licenses. I'll format my response as a JSON object because that's what's required, resulting in: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s message about \u201clicense draw diagrams\u201d makes it tricky to categorize. It could relate to an \"Internal Project\" if they\u2019re trying to clarify design code, but the repetition of \u201clicense\u201d suggests it\u2019s more about purchasing licenses. Given that, I think \u201cPurchase\u201d is the safest choice. I\u2019ll respond with just the JSON format since the user requested a straightforward categorization. So the output will be: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}."
