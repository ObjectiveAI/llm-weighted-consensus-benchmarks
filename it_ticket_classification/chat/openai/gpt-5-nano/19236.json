It appears I'm meant to output just the category value. I'll ensure I get this right!**Formatting the response correctly**\n\nI realize the platform expects me to follow a specific JSON structure. The request states, \"Please categorize this IT Ticket,\" so I should respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nEven though the schema suggests that \"category\" should be an object type with predefined string values, the actual response I need is simply a string. The format must match exactly, so I\u2019ll double-check the spelling for \"Purchase\" to ensure it aligns with the enum value without adding any extra text."
