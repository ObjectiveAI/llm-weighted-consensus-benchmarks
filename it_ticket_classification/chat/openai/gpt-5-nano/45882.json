They're saying they lost a pass card and want assistance with using a visitor card starting Monday in November. It seems like it's primarily about access control, which makes me think it should fit into the \"Access\" category. While it could also relate to \"Hardware\" since it\u2019s a physical card, it\u2019s definitely more about access issues. So, yeah, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\"**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI see that the output format needs to be a JSON-like object with a \"category\" field. According to the guidelines, it should return something like {\"category\": \"Access\"}. I'm ensuring that it matches the schema provided, which confirms \"Access\" is a valid category. Although the ticket might imply additional complexity, the instruction is clear\u2014just categorize! So, I'll output the exact category as specified without any extra text. Here we go: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
