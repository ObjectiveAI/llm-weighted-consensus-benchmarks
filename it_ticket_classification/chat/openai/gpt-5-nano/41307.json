I\u2019ll carefully analyze the ticket\u2019s content to assign it accurately, as this helps streamline the support process. Let\u2019s make sure I don't overlook any details that would lead to misclassification!**Understanding IT ticket content**\n\nI need to analyze the user's IT ticket description, which discusses an external client struggling to reset their password through a notification. The ticket highlights issues with password expiration notifications and the need for clear instructions for external users versus those with internal access. There's also mention of changing the policy based on existing procedures and blocked resources. It\u2019s essential to capture all relevant details to address these concerns effectively!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m thinking this ticket should go into the \"Access\" category since it\u2019s about password access. While \"Administrative rights\" might seem relevant, it\u2019s specifically focused on resetting passwords, so \"Access\" fits better. \"Miscellaneous\" could also apply, but since there's a clear category for access, I\u2019ll avoid that. I need to format the response as a JSON object with the category field, so I'll ensure it's strictly following the required format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
