It includes terms like \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"induction,\" which suggest it's related to onboarding and HR processes. I'm thinking that \"HR Support\" fits best. I also wonder about \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" but those seem less likely since the focus is on HR-related forms. So, I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support\" as the appropriate category.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm concluding that \"HR Support\" is the best category for this IT ticket, considering it talks about new starter forms and induction. I could think about alternatives like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" but they don\u2019t fit as well. I\u2019ll structure my response as a proper JSON object, which should look like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nThis response includes only the necessary information with correct formatting, just as the user requested. Let's stick to that!"
