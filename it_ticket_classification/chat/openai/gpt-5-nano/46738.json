It mentions issues with logging in, which likely indicates an access problem. While \"HR Support\" might also fit since it's related to their timesheet, the most fitting category seems to be \"Access\" since they can't log in. The message is a bit unclear due to some typos, but the access issue is the primary concern for categorization.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize the ticket as \"Access\" since the user can't log in to their Oracle timesheet. It could also involve \"Administrative rights\" if they need permissions to log in, but the main issue appears to be access. I'm planning to respond with a JSON-like object that follows the required format. The expected output should strictly be {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text, ensuring I follow the specified schema accurately.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
