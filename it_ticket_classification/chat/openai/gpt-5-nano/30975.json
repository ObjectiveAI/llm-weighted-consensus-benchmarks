I\u2019m looking at the categories available: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since it\u2019s about a new starter, this likely relates to HR Support. I\u2019ll format my response in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThis ticket likely concerns onboarding a new starter, so I'm considering categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The mentions of \"new starter,\" \"date,\" and \"attached input\" suggest it's related to HR tasks or onboarding forms. It might not fall under standard IT categories, but \"HR Support\" could fit well since it handles new employee onboarding. I\u2019ll go ahead and categorize it as \"HR Support.\"**Categorizing request for HR support**\n\nThis request seems to involve setting a date for new starter training, and the phrase \"please fill attached\" implies there's a document requiring input. Since it\u2019s an IT ticket, it may relate to onboarding. While \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" are possibilities, they aren't explicitly mentioned. Given everything points to HR onboarding, I think \"HR Support\" is the safest category. I'll confirm by outputting {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
