I need to decide between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the content hints at connection rights and changing restrictions, it seems focused on access. However, if it's about permissions to change settings, \"Administrative rights\" might be more fitting. I need to weigh which category \u2014 \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" \u2014 is the most appropriate.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing whether this issue is about access to connect or about admin rights preventing changes. The user mentions \"changing Wednesday pm,\" which likely relates to changing IT tasks, indicating they might be frustrated by permission restrictions. While \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option if it's unclear, the context around \"granted connect\" points strongly to connectivity access. So, I\u2019m going to select \"Access.\" I'll format the final answer as a JSON-like object: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
