The ticket text is quite messy but mentions dashboard, setup forms, and proposals multiple times. It sounds like it could be related to an Internal Project concerning dashboard setup and cost recovery. So, I think the most appropriate category to choose would be Internal Project.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
