The options for categories are limited: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given that the ticket mentions \"milestone licenses,\" it could relate to software licenses, which leads me to consider \"Purchase,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Internal Project.\" There might also be ties to \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll focus on parsing to determine the best fit.**Choosing a category for tickets**\n\nI'm considering the best category for the ticket mentioning milestone licenses. The mention of \"milestone\" ties to software licenses, which could lead me to think about \"Purchase\" or \"Internal Project.\" However, Milestone is also a brand related to video surveillance, especially since \"decommission cameras\" points to hardware. The ticket focuses on licenses, making \"Purchase\" a likely choice, but also \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" could be possibilities. I\u2019ll aim to select the best single category to capture the primary issue.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe main focus here is on the availability of licenses, which leads me to decide that \"Purchase\" is the best category. While I considered \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" those don\u2019t seem to fit as well. Since the instruction requires a JSON output with a specific category format, I\u2019ll structure the response correctly based on the schema provided. I\u2019ll keep it simple and just return the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
