The ticket is about submitting time cards and issues related to time entry, which suggests it's an HR/payroll system issue. \"HR Support\" seems to be the best fit. I\u2019ll respond in JSON format with the category object, like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Finalizing JSON format**\n\nThe format I need is a JSON object with a \"category\" field. The provided schema confirms that this should be a string. So, my final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I want to keep it straightforward without any additional formatting or text. Just that clean response will do!"
