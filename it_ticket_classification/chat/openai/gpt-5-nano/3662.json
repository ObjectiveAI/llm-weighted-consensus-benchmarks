Given the context, it seems the category should be either Access or HR Support. The \"Access\" category fits well for user access requests and related tasks.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user mentions \"start up wants working,\" possibly referring to a startup environment. They also talk about uploading a screenshot after completing training and mention a location for \"accept decline requests,\" which I'm unsure about but could relate to a request workflow. Given that this seems focused on gaining access and has training prerequisites, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" I'll prepare the response in the specified JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"} to align with the instructions.{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
