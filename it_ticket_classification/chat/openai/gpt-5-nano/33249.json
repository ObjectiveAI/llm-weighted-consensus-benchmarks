The ticket talks about a last name change and requests clarification on how to avoid confusion regarding the maiden name. It\u2019s clear that this involves updating a user\u2019s identity in the system, leading me to consider whether it falls under \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"HR Support,\" given its focus on personal information updates.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"name displayed cases,\" which makes me think they're asking about how to display their name in the system. It seems like \"Administrative rights\" could apply if they needed permission to change it, but that doesn't feel right. Since the focus is on HR information, specifically relating to a name change, I believe \"HR Support\" is the best fit. I\u2019ll go ahead and prepare the response in JSON format, categorizing it as \"HR Support.\"**Formatting the Output**\n\nThe prompt includes a specific category schema for the response. I need to create a JSON object with the appropriate category field. Given our earlier discussion, I determined \"HR Support\" fits best. The prompt instructs me to respond with just the JSON and no extra text, so that's what I'll do to keep it clean. Therefore, my final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
