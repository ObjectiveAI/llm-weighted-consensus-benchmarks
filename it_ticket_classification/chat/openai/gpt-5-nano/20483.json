They wrote something about employees and updating details related to a contractor. It seems like they might be asking for help with updating employee details, possibly within Active Directory (AD). Given this, the most fitting categories could be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It's likely a request for user account management, focused on access rights related to updating employees\u2019 information.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m narrowing it down to either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The user seems to be asking for assistance in updating employee details in Active Directory, which implies they may need admin rights for that task. Given the phrasing about updating information, I think \"Access\" fits best as it's more generic for user access management. I should select it as the primary category and prepare to output this in the required JSON format: {\"category\": \"Access\"}."
