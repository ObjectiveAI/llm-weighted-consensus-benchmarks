Given the mention of the meeting room and potential AV equipment, I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" if it pertains to devices in the meeting room.**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nAfter reviewing the categories, I conclude that \"Hardware\" is the best fit for this IT ticket about the meeting room. The user asked to categorize it, and it seems more relevant than \"Miscellaneous.\" The mention of \"meeting room working\" suggests a hardware issue. I'll follow the instructions to respond in the specified JSON format. So, I'll output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nIt seems unnecessary to add a note, as the format requires a JSON object only.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
