The details include issues regarding maternity leave, deleting meeting series, and informing participants. So, I need to figure out the best category from the available options. It seems to relate to calendar management, which might fall under \"Administrative rights\" due to the permissions involved, or potentially \"Internal Project\" if it's regarding policy.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI think the best category for this IT ticket is \"Administrative rights.\" While \"Access\" could relate to permissions too, it seems more focused on general account access, unlike this ticket, which deals with canceling meetings in Outlook. The focus is on permissions for meeting management. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object: `{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}`. I might also need to include a brief explanation, as the instructions specify providing context for the categorization.**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI see the category \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit here because it relates to the specific privileges needed to cancel meetings or delete meeting series. The user mentioned tasks that require those rights, like \"delete meeting organizer\" and \"inform participants.\" So, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object, ensuring to keep the text minimal as per the instructions. Thus, I'll produce: `{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}`. This should cover it!"
