Considering the context, it looks like the best fit is \"Internal Project,\" as it seems to focus on project management issues. I'll output that in the required JSON format.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing the categories available: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The user's message seems to indicate a missing project form, so \"Internal Project\" is a strong candidate. It could also relate to \"Administrative Rights,\" but that's unclear. The focus appears to be on project management rather than access issues. So, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and format it in the required JSON structure.**Interpreting JSON Schema**\n\nI\u2019m working with a JSON schema for the \"category\" field, which outlines a structure with types and enumerations. The expected response appears to be something like {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. However, the instructions suggest it's a JSON object with a specific type. They want a category field defined according to the schema, indicating that the response should be a structured object. It feels a bit confusing since it seems I might need to wrap it appropriately. I\u2019ll clarify that in my output.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
