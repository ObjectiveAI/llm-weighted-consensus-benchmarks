It's asking for an increase in mailbox size, which clearly relates to storage. The user is dealing with email storage quotas, mentioning the need to remove items and empty the deleted items folder. So, \"Storage\" seems to be the most appropriate category here. Other options like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" don't fit, and it's definitely not an internal project. Hence, \"Storage\" it is!**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nI need to respond with a categorized format in JSON. The prompt requires that I categorize the IT ticket using the provided JSON-like structure. The category should be one of the specified options, and based on the content regarding mailbox size, \"Storage\" is the best fit.\n\nSo, the correct output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}\n\nI need to make sure the formatting is exact, using proper quotes and capitalization. That's my final response!"
