The user mentioned something about sharing an internal audit procedure with Thursday, which seems quite unclear and messy. It might relate to access or administrative rights since it discusses sharing a procedure. The available categories include Access, Administrative Rights, Internal Project, Miscellaneous, and HR Support. I\u2019ll have to decide which one fits best based on this context.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket refers to an \"internal audit procedure\" and mentions sharing, acceptance, and decline, which suggests it might relate to obtaining approval to share this procedure. It could fall under \"Access\" if it\u2019s about sharing it with someone named Thursday. However, if it\u2019s requesting permission to access or modify something, \"Administrative Rights\" may also apply. The content is quite jumbled, but categorizing it as \"Access\" seems safe since it revolves around sharing and accessing a document. Alternatively, it could be \"Internal Project.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
