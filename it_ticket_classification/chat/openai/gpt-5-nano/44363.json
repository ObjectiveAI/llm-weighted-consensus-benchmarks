It could be \"Hardware\" if it's a device issue, but the phrase \"guest not working for a client\" sounds more like a network problem, possibly referring to guest WiFi access for clients. That would fit best under \"Access.\" I need to provide the response in a specific JSON format, including \"Access\" as the category. So, I'll prepare a JSON object structured correctly to reflect this choice.{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
