The text contains various phrases about missing time reports and action reports, which makes it a bit noisy. My task is to classify it into one of the defined categories available in the tool, like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Internal Project.\" Considering the content, it seems like HR Support might be the best fit. Let's see how it goes!**Selecting the best category for the ticket**\n\nI need to pick the most appropriate category for this ticket, which has phrases related to missing time reports and maternity leave. The text mentions a need to update person records and weekly submissions. Given the context, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit. The mention of an \"administration officer\" also suggests it pertains to HR. There\u2019s no mention of access or administrative rights, so I\u2019m leaning toward classifying it as HR Support and preparing a JSON-like response.**Formatting the response in JSON**\n\nThe system has requested a JSON object with a specific format, needing the \"category\" field. Based on my earlier assessment, the value should be \"HR Support.\" I'll simply structure the output as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. The instructions emphasize categorization, so I shouldn\u2019t add any extra notes or commentary. I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s valid JSON without any additional fluff. Let\u2019s keep it straightforward and focus on giving just the category field in the final output."
