Since their request doesn't fall under hardware, HR support, or other specific categories, I think the most fitting category might be \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll assign that for now.**Clarifying ticket categorization**\n\nI'm looking at the ticket about creating command files via Notepad, possibly batch files (.bat or .cmd). The user seems to be requesting clarification on what the file represents and why it was created, which might indicate a security concern. Since they mention permissions, \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant, but if it\u2019s more about the file's contents, \"Miscellaneous\" might fit better. However, without clear information about security, I could lean toward \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\"{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
