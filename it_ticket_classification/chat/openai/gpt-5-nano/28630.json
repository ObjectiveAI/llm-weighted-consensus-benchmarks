The ticket talks about a \"maternity leaver access card\" and mentions a \"maternity leaver form.\" This seems related to access rights for someone leaving due to maternity leave. It could fit under \"Access,\" \"HR Support,\" or even \"Administrative rights.\" Given the focus on the access card, it seems most appropriate to categorize it under \"Access,\" but I also see the HR aspect.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket is in the IT system and references a leaver form and access card, with the user asking for help to fill out forms. The phrase \"by filling out maternity leaver form\" points to an HR process. Still, I need to categorize it! It seems to relate mainly to IT, so I\u2019m considering \"Access\" for the decommissioning of the access card. The mention of the HR form suggests it might also fit under \"HR Support,\" but I'm leaning toward \"Access\" since it's focused on the access card update.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating the ticket again. Although \"Hardware\" fits because the access card is a physical item, the request mainly involves filling out a maternity leaver form, which ties more to an HR process. Ultimately, the best category here seems to be \"Access\" since it relates directly to the access card. Since the system requires a JSON-like response, I\u2019ll format it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I could add a brief rationale, but since the user asked simply to categorize, I think I can keep it concise!**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI see that the output needs to be a JSON object. The schema specifies a \"category\" field as a string. Since I\u2019ve determined that \"Access\" is the best category for this IT ticket, I\u2019ll format it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This looks good, so I\u2019m all set to output that. It feels nice to have a clear, structured response ready!"
