The ticket discusses an employee leaving, mentioning details like \"leaver mailbox,\" \"AD rights,\" and \"forwarding,\" which all point to offboarding processes. Since it's about access removal and rights related to accounts, I think it should fit best in the \"Access\" category, as it focuses on removing that access. That makes sense to me!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the category for this IT ticket. It mentions \"AD rights\" and \"approver,\" which makes me think about \"Administrative rights,\" but there's also a strong focus on offboarding tasks like access removal and mailbox forwarding. Since there\u2019s no specific \"Offboarding\" category, I need to choose between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the emphasis on access-related tasks, I believe \"Access\" is the most suitable choice. I'll output this as a JSON object with the category clearly defined.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
