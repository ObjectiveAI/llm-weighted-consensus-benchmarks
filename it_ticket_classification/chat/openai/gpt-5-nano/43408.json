They mention terms like \"wireless addresses,\" \"address ranges policy,\" and problems with connecting their laptop. From what I can gather, this seems related to a network address availability or DHCP issue. Given that context, I'd likely classify this ticket under \"Access\" since it's all about wireless connectivity and available addresses related to IP assignment.**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm dealing with an IT issue related to network access and IP addressing. The category \"Access\" seems the most appropriate for this issue since it's primarily about network access control, rather than hardware. I need to respond with a JSON object, following the schema provided, which specifies the allowed category values. So, I'll craft the response as {\"category\": \"Access\"} without any extra text, just to keep it concise and clear."
