The ticket discusses internal audit restrictions regarding forbidden software and requests a reminder for colleagues to remove these applications. This concerns policy enforcement, which could fit under \"Administrative rights\" since it's about software compliance. Alternatively, it might relate to \"Storage\" if we're considering the file-sharing aspect. However, focusing more on software, \"Administrative rights\" seems to be the best fit.**Analyzing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm exploring the best category for this IT ticket, which is related to an internal audit about forbidden software. While it could be \"Internal Project\" due to the internal focus, the ticket content emphasizes reminders about software compliance and enforcement. \"Administrative rights\" seems most fitting since it involves user rights and restrictions related to software use. However, since it's about reminders, I might also consider \"Miscellaneous\" if nothing else fits. That said, I lean towards \"Administrative rights.\"**Evaluating IT ticket compliance task**\n\nThe ticket discusses an internal audit related to forbidden software and suggests sending reminders to colleagues to remove these apps. It seems more like an issue of IT policy compliance, which could map to \"Administrative rights\" since it involves software restrictions. Other possible categories include \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access,\" as unauthorized software can impact user access. While \"Storage\" might relate to file-sharing clients, the focus is mainly on compliance rather than storage itself.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe request focuses on removing forbidden applications, so it doesn't relate to tasks like file storage. Categories like \"Purchase,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Hardware\" don't apply. While \"Internal Project\" could fit since it's part of an internal audit, that category isn't strictly for IT ticket classification. The most fitting category is \"Administrative rights,\" as it aligns with enforcing software compliance and user privileges. I'll respond with just the necessary JSON format. Here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}**Delivering IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe system requires me to output the category for this IT ticket in JSON format. After checking the allowed categories, \"Administrative rights\" is the right choice. The instruction specifies that just the category is needed, so I won't include any additional explanations. I\u2019ll make sure the formatting is correct by keeping it as a single line. Here\u2019s my final output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
