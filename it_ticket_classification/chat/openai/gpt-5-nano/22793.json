It appears to involve onboarding a new starter in Bogot\u00e1, mentioning forms, a lead consultant, and a compliance officer. The ticket seems to fit under categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative Rights,\" since it involves IT access provisioning. Given the context, the best fit is likely \u201cHR Support\u201d or possibly \u201cAccess.\u201d I\u2019ll select the category that represents the ticket most accurately.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions phrases like \"new starter,\" \"form completed,\" and \"lead consultant joining,\" which suggest it relates to onboarding and access provisioning for a new user. While \u201cAccess\u201d seems to fit best since it pertains to system credentials, it could also fit under \u201cHR Support\u201d because of the onboarding context. Given the instructions to categorize, I think \u201cAccess\u201d is the most IT-specific choice. I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Access\" since it likely involves provisioning access.**Outputting category in JSON format**\n\nI need to categorize the ticket about onboarding a new starter in Colombia and access provisioning tasks. The prompt specifies that I should respond with a JSON-like category object following a certain structure.\n\nSince the best fit for this ticket is \"Access,\" I'll build the JSON object as outlined. The structure is {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I realize it\u2019s best to avoid extraneous text and stick to just the JSON object for clarity. So, I\u2019ll finalize the output as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Providing category output**\n\nThe instructions are clear: I just need to provide the category without additional justification. So, I\u2019ll simply output the category in the specified format.\n\nTo align with the requirements, I'll format it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This keeps it straightforward, ensuring I follow the guidelines precisely. So, let\u2019s get this done!"
