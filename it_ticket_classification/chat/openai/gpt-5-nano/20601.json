So, the most fitting category is \"Hardware.\"\n\nI'll format the output in JSON as instructed, with the category field labeled accordingly. \n\nHere goes: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Deciding on the category**\n\nI need to decide on the category for this IT ticket. The ticket hints at both \"Purchase\" because it's all about new purchase orders and receipts, and \"Hardware\" since it involves installing a monitor.\n\nHowever, after considering the ticket's focus on logging installation and purchasing procedures, the best fit seems to be \"Purchase.\" Administrative rights, Access, Storage, or Miscellaneous don\u2019t really apply here. So, I'll categorize it as \"Purchase\" since that captures the essence of the request!**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe phrase in the IT ticket mentions \"monitor,\" indicating it's hardware-related. However, the emphasis is on processing purchase orders and installation, making it more aligned with \"Purchase.\" Since the ticket highlights \"new purchase,\" \"PO,\" and \"mandatory receipts,\" this clearly leans towards being purchase-related.\n\nI'll go ahead and categorize it as \"Purchase,\" as that's the best fit. To follow the required format, I'll output the JSON as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} without any additional text."
