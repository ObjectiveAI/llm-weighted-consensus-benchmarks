The categories I can choose from are limited. Given the context, \u201cAccess\u201d seems to be the most fitting, as the certificate is directly tied to accessing machines or services. However, \u201cInternal Project\u201d could also apply if this is part of a specific project, but \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d doesn\u2019t seem relevant here.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nThe user mentioned phrases like \"moving forward,\" \"blocked,\" and \"machine certificate expired,\" which makes me lean toward categorizing it as \"Access\" since the certificate is tied to access and authentication. The mention of a \"big blocker\" also signals a disruption in service. Although the options are limited, \"Access\" seems to fit best. I\u2019ll need to output a JSON object. I\u2019ll go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI should also add a brief note: \"This ticket relates to an expired machine certificate impacting access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
