I'll need to choose the best option from the categories provided: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative Rights\". Since the text references an Apple device and installation, it likely fits under the \"Hardware\" category. I\u2019ll prepare to output a JSON object with that classification.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing the text, which includes references to \"Apple Pro Retina\" and \"Intel Plus Graphics\". It seems focused on hardware installation, particularly mentioning \"log installation\" and \"type hub,\" which could imply a request for a USB or Thunderbolt hub. Given that it's mainly about hardware-related issues, the best category appears to be \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll prepare to respond with a JSON object that indicates this category. I want to make sure my output is clear and follows the required format.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
