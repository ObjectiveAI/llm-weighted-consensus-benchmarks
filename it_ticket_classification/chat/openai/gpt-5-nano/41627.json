The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" After parsing through the content, it seems a bit garbled. However, it mentions \"absence leave,\" suggesting it's related to HR. I think I\u2019ll categorize it under \"HR Support.\" Next, I'll output the selection in the specified JSON format.**Categorizing IT ticket details**\n\nThe user's message points to \"oracle absence leave\u2026\" which raises the possibility of it being related to absence or leave requests. There are references to \"project codes\" and \"task details,\" which could imply a software issue, perhaps linked to Oracle applications. Given the categories I have, it seems like this might fall under \"HR Support\" because of the mention of leave. Yet, \"Internal Project\" also makes sense, considering the focus on project codes and task details. I\u2019ll choose the best fit.**Deciding on the ticket category**\n\nThe user's request involves a \"card showing image\" and \"options for task details bar,\" which is a bit ambiguous. If I\u2019m uncertain, it could fit under \"Miscellaneous.\" However, since project codes and task details are prominently mentioned, I think \"Internal Project\" is likely the most accurate category. While \"absence leave\" hints at HR matters, the main concern appears to relate to task details and the UI of the card. I might also consider \"Access\" if that's the focus.**Analyzing the IT request**\n\nI\u2019m looking closely at the user's message that involves Oracle and mentions \"absence leave,\" \"project codes,\" and a \"card\" with UI options. It seems they might want help with an Oracle Absence/Leave module related to project codes. \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if there are permissions needed for the card UI, but I don't think that's the main concern. \"HR Support\" fits due to the absence leave aspect, but since the user is a technician, I think \"Internal Project\" might be the best category.**Finalizing the JSON output**\n\nI\u2019m considering that the user\u2019s question about \"setting task details bar options\" likely relates to a software UI issue, perhaps linked to Oracle project management or a Jira-style card. The mention of \"absence leave\" connects to HR, but the main focus seems to be on project codes and task details which pushes me to categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" So, I\u2019ll prepare the JSON object for this category and ensure it\u2019s correctly formatted. Here\u2019s my final output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
