Given that it's about a faulty device, I think the right category for this ticket would be \"Hardware.\" It clearly requires a replacement device due to the battery issue.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nThe user's message indicates a hardware issue with a mobile phone. They asked for a response in a categorized JSON-like format, following a specific schema that requires a category field. Given the issue is clearly hardware-related, I need to respond with a JSON object that sets the category to \"Hardware.\" So my response will simply be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra commentary, just the JSON object as instructed."
