New hires need access to accounts and hardware. \"Administrative rights\" generally refers to admin privileges, but typically it's about requesting system access for new starters. The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. I'd go with \"Access\" as the best choice for this situation.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI see that for IT ticket classification, \"HR Support\" is less suitable since HR typically manages onboarding, while IT focuses on access like email and account setups. Given that \"new starter\" is an HR term, I should categorize this ticket under \"Access\" for provisioning accounts. Although \"Miscellaneous\" could also be considered if I'm uncertain, I'll confidently go with \"Access.\" \n\nSo the output will be a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let\u2019s make sure it\u2019s just that, no extra commentary!"
