If there\u2019s no explicit access denial, it likely isn\u2019t hardware-related. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since permissions can prevent uploads. Given the context of a referral system, I think \"Storage\" is probably the best fit, as it relates to file handling and space management.**Deciding on category for upload issue**\n\nAccess seems plausible since the ticket could be resolved by granting permissions. The user's error message, \"unable to upload doc for referral,\u201d points to a generic uploading issue. Typically, file upload problems are categorized as \"Storage\" or \"Application,\" but those aren't options here. \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback, but I'll go with \"Storage\" to represent file upload issues, as it pertains to storage or filing. It makes the most sense! I'll suggest a JSON object response: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Formatting response correctly**\n\nThe instructions specify that I need to provide a category object in JSON format, with no extra text included. I\u2019ll prepare it like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. It\u2019s important to confirm it's valid JSON since the tool might only accept that. So, I\u2019ll make sure to keep the response strictly to the JSON format, without any additional commentary. Let's deliver it as instructed!"
