Based on these details, the best category seems to be \"Purchase,\" since it's focused on buying monitors. However, \"Hardware\" could also fit since it concerns the monitors themselves. Still, I think \"Purchase\" is more appropriate for this context.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket requests details about model ranges, sizes, and approval for monitors, indicating hardware procurement and delivery. Given the context, it fits the \"Purchase\" category in IT ticket taxonomy. I need to craft a response in the required JSON format. The output should strictly follow the system's requirements without any extra text. So I'll format it as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nI'll ensure that it adheres exactly to that format."
