The user mentioned \"new starter\" along with a request for help and an attachment. This points towards a possible onboarding situation. I think it could relate to Access or Administrative rights because they may need permissions set up for filling out forms. While HR Support is relevant, it isn't in the IT list provided, so I\u2019ll categorize it as Administrative rights or Miscellaneous.**Identifying IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m grappling with how to categorize an IT ticket mentioning \"new starter\" related to onboarding. The user seems to need assistance with filling out a form, likely for access to systems and accounts. The categories include Access and Administrative rights, both plausible options. The phrase \u201chelp by filling out\u201d hints at onboarding tasks, while \u201cnew starter Wednesday pm\u201d suggests a specific timeframe. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as Access or possibly Administrative rights.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nIn categorizing this IT ticket, \"HR Support\" might seem relevant due to the onboarding mention, but it isn\u2019t strictly an HR issue. The ticket's phrases like \"new starter,\" \"please find attached,\" and \"please help by filling out\" suggest they might need forms, likely related to IT access. I think the best fit would be \"Access\" for setting up the new starter. However, if I\u2019m unsure, \"Miscellaneous\" could be a safer choice. I\u2019ll prepare to provide a JSON-like category object as a response.**Preparing category response**\n\nI need to respond with a category object in a specific JSON format. The allowed categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the ticket mentions \"new starter\" and \"please fill out\" for forms, it seems related to Access. Therefore, I\u2019ll choose \"Access\" for the category. The format requires no extra text, just the JSON response. I'll ensure it matches perfectly: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
