It mentions \"installation tickets,\" \"devices,\" and \"mini machines,\" which points toward the \"Hardware\" category. However, there's also a mention of \"Administrative rights,\" so that's a possibility too. The ticket could fit under \"Internal Project\" as they want to allocate two installation tickets. I'll need to determine the best category for this mixed content based on context.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize the IT ticket. It might be \u201cPurchase\u201d if they\u2019re requesting devices, but \u201ctwo installation tickets\u201d hints at an internal process. The mention of \u201cdevices\u201d and \u201cinstallation\u201d suggests it falls under the \u201cHardware\u201d category. There's also an attachment mentioned, which needs consideration. I think I should produce a JSON object responding with the category. Based on the guidelines, \u201cHardware\u201d fits best, and I need to ensure proper casing for the response.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
