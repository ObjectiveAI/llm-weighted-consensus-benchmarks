This suggests it's related to \"License management.\" Given the context, it could fit under \"Purchase,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, since it's mostly about license procurement and pricing, \"Purchase\" really seems the most appropriate category.**Determining category**\n\nI'm considering whether to categorize this ticket under \"Access\" since it relates to access rights, but it primarily focuses on license management and purchasing. I think \"Purchase\" is more appropriate. I should format the final answer as a JSON object with the category string \"Purchase.\" According to the schema provided, it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. So, I\u2019ll respond with just that JSON format and no extra text."
