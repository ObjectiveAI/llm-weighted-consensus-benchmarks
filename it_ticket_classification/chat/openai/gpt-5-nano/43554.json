They've mentioned trouble uploading into the referral system, Select Minds, and this seems to lean towards a technical issue with web applications or browsers like Chrome and IE. Since the options don't directly mention \"Software\" or \"Application,\" the best fit among the provided categories might be \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll choose the one that best aligns with their problem.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize the IT ticket. The user can't upload, which could relate to access rights. However, it doesn't mention permissions specifically. \"Access\" usually covers login issues, but this is more about a upload problem. The \"Miscellaneous\" category might be best since it seems to be a general software problem. \u201cInternal Project\u201d could apply if it\u2019s project-specific, but without clear indications, I'll stick to \"Miscellaneous\" for simplicity. I'll provide a concise response to categorize the ticket accordingly.**Preparing JSON Response for IT Ticket**\n\nThe user wants the IT ticket categorized, so I need to respond with a JSON object. The structure requires a \"category\" field with a value from the provided options. Given everything considered, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the correct choice for this ticket. \n\nI\u2019ll format it properly as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Although I might add a brief justification, I think sticking to just the category might keep things concise. I\u2019ll make sure my response adheres to the specified format!**Creating the JSON Category Response**\n\nI realize that the category type is based on a schema, so the actual response should just provide the category value. The key here is \"category,\" which means the API expects something like: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.\n\nI could mention alternatives like \"Access,\" but I'll stick with \"Miscellaneous\" since it feels more neutral. So, I\u2019ll prepare the final response in plain text JSON format without any extra text or formatting. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
