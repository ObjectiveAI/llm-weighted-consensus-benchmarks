The prompt outlines that I should create a JSON object with a specific schema, indicating the category. Given the user's request for a RAM upgrade, it seems like the most fitting category is \"Hardware,\" although \"Purchase\" could also apply since they're requesting an upgrade. I\u2019ll choose one of those categories for the JSON output.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI'm looking at this ticket where the user is requesting more RAM, which points to an immediate need for a hardware upgrade. The categories include \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" and others, but given the context, the best fit is definitely \"Hardware.\" Even though there's an implication of tracking and maybe buying, \"RAM needed\" strongly indicates a hardware issue rather than a purchase. So, I'll go ahead and provide the JSON object as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Providing JSON Output**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object for the IT ticket categorization, specifically including the category. The format is clear: it should be something like {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I'll make sure to follow the syntax correctly, using quotes and curly braces. Keeping it succinct is key, so there will be no additional commentary. I\u2019ll just deliver the required response as specified. Let\u2019s go ahead and finalize that output!"
