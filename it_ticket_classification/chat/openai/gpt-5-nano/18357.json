Given the context, the category can be either \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" However, since it specifically involves ordering, going with \"Purchase\" feels most appropriate for this ticket. I'll format it into a JSON output accordingly!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize the IT ticket based on the user's provided text. The mention of \"order\" and \"receive\" indicates it\u2019s likely related to a purchase process. I have a few options to choose from, like \"Hardware\" if it's about asset support or more directly \"Purchase\" if it specifically involves buying a monitor riser. Since the user specified they wanted a category, I'll go with \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object with the category defined.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI\u2019m aiming to keep things concise and straightforward. The response should simply be a JSON object with the category clearly defined. So, I'll craft it as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It\u2019s important that I don\u2019t add any extra text or context here\u2014just the necessary output that fits the user\u2019s request. Keeping it short and clear is definitely the way to go!"
