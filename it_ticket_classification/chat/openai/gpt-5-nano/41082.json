Given the options, it's definitely HR-related, so I'll categorize this ticket as \"HR Support.\" It looks like a straightforward choice to me!**Confirming Category Selection**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket, and it clearly falls under \"HR Support\" based on the content provided. The user requested a JSON format for the response, so I'll follow that instruction without adding extra text. The valid categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and more, and since \"HR Support\" is one of them, I'm all set. I'll output just the necessary JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That should do it!"
