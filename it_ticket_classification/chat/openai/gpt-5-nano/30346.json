They mentioned terms related to disaster recovery and service recovery tests, which makes me think \"Miscellaneous\" might fit since it doesn't fit neatly into other categories like \"Hardware\" or \"Access.\" I\u2019ll output the categorization in a JSON format, following the schema given. It should be a simple object containing the chosen category string to comply with the required format.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering possible categories for the IT ticket based on the user's keywords. The terms like \"restore,\" \"template,\" and \"tests\" hint it might relate to a project task, suggesting \"Internal Project\" could be a fit. \"Storage\" also seems relevant due to \"restore location\" but not in the hardware sense. \"Administrative rights\" doesn't seem applicable. After evaluating, I think \"Internal Project\" captures the essence, given its focus on developing disaster recovery plan templates and testing efforts. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as such.**Formatting the Output**\n\nThe instructions specify that I need to output a category object. I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I should double-check that I'm correctly following the string format as specified in the guidelines. It looks like everything matches up, so I\u2019m ready to respond with this structured JSON. This should effectively convey the selected category for the IT ticket, keeping things clear and compliant with the required format."
