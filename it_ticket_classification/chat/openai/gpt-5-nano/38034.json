They\u2019re mentioning issues related to their Outlook credentials, password changes, and persistent prompts, which feel somewhat garbled. It seems likely this falls under the \"Access\" category since it\u2019s primarily about credentials and authentication. Alternatively, I could consider \"HR Support,\" but \"Access\" fits best. I\u2019ll respond with the category: Access and maybe include a brief note for clarity.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nThe system outlines a JSON schema that requires a category field. I need to create a JSON object with the category set to \"Access,\" as it aligns with the user's issue regarding Outlook credentials and password prompts. While \"Administrative rights\" could also be a possibility, it seems that \"Access\" is the best fit since it focuses on authentication. I'll ensure to return just the JSON object as required. So my final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
