There\u2019s an \"Access\" category, but also \"Administrative rights.\" However, they only want to grant queue membership, not full admin rights, which complicates things. Since \"Access\" seems more fitting for this context, I'll go with that. The final answer will be in a JSON-like format with {\"category\":\"Access\"} to align with their requirements.**Determining category for ticket**\n\nI see the instruction outlining a JSON format for categorizing tickets. The options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Given that this ticket is about ServiceNow queue membership, \"Access\" feels like the most fitting category. I briefly consider \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but they don't seem as relevant here. So, my final result will be a simple JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, ensuring it meets the required format with no extra text."
