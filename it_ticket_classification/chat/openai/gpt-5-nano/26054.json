They mention editing problems, locked cells, and access\u2014so I'm thinking this likely fits under \"Access.\" The ticket doesn't seem to relate to hardware, HR, or other categories. I'll go with \"Access\" since it seems to be about permissions preventing necessary changes. So, it\u2019s settled!**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nThe user appears to be facing issues with access permissions related to forecasting and editing locked cells in a spreadsheet. This seems primarily focused on not having the rights to edit, so I think the ticket fits best under \"Access.\" Although it could also be classified as \"Administrative rights,\" given that granting editing permissions is typically an admin task. I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" since it directly pertains to user permissions for modifications.**Finalizing category output**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket accurately. Since it involves granting permissions to a forecasting file, \"Access\" seems like the best fit because it\u2019s straightforward and commonly used for such permissions. The response should be in structured JSON format, specifically with the category property. The output will look like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nEven though \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, the focus on \"permissions\" and editing access points more clearly to \"Access.\" I\u2019ll stick with this approach!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
