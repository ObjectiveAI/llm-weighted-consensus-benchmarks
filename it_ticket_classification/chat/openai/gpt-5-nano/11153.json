It mentions things like \"checklist for leavers\" and \"remove the from connection.\" This all makes me think it relates to access management, especially since it talks about removing accounts. There's a mention of \"change code\" and \"client link,\" too. So, I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"Access,\" but it could possibly fit under \"Administrative rights\" as well.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user's ticket includes phrases like \"check list for leavers\" and \"remove from connection,\" which suggest it's about offboarding. It involves tasks such as disabling accounts, updating client links, and changing codes, pointing toward a focus on access control. So, \"Access\" seems to be the right category. I need to format my response as a JSON-like object with the category field. My final output should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
