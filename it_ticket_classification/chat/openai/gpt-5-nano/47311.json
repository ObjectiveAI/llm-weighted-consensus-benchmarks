The phrase \u201cext your zone\u201d isn\u2019t really clear, so it could fall under \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d The context is vague with possible references to external zones or vendor/assets. Since the ticket text is confusing and doesn\u2019t fit neatly into other categories like hardware or storage, I think \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is the safest choice. It might be helpful to suggest that more details or alternative categories could be provided in the future.**Clarifying ambiguous references**\n\nI see that references like \"software tester,\" \"mobile,\" and \"external zone\" are quite ambiguous. If the user provides more context, we can certainly re-categorize it. I\u2019m thinking of posing clarifying questions, such as whether this relates to a device issue, access to a network, a specific internal project, or a hardware defect. For now, I\u2019ll select \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d and suggest that users fill out fields like a brief description, steps to reproduce, and any error messages that might help clarify their issue.**Crafting JSON output**\n\nI need to create a final answer in a JSON format for categorizing an IT ticket. According to the instructions, I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON structure, specifically with a \"category\" field set to \"Miscellaneous.\" I want to make sure to follow the schema correctly, but I'm wondering if I should include any additional comments. To keep things straightforward, I\u2019ll just provide the JSON object itself to minimize extra text. My final output will look like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI need to make sure that I\u2019m using the correct case for the category, as \"Miscellaneous\" must match the enum properly. So, the final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I think that's clear and straightforward, and it meets the requirements perfectly. Let\u2019s finalize with that!"
