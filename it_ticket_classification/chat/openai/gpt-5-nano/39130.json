The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket discusses an incorrect approval flow related to requisitions and cost centers. Since it primarily revolves around the requisition process and approvals, it seems to fit best under the \"Purchase\" category. While \"Miscellaneous\" could be a consideration, \"Purchase\" appears to be the most suitable choice here.**Formulating ticket classification**\n\nIt seems the user wants to log a ticket regarding an issue with the approval workflow in requisitions and cost centers. This relates to purchase processes, so I should categorize it as \"Purchase.\" I need to respond with a JSON object formatted correctly, which specifies the category: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I want to make sure I'm following the requirements, including only providing this JSON response, since the system directly asked for that format. Okay, let's go ahead and finalize that!"
