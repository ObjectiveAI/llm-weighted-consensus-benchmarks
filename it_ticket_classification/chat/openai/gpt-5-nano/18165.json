The user mentions \"waiting create log credentials,\" \"disable jabber,\" and \"need advice on access.\" It seems to relate to access rights and login credentials, possibly falling under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" There are also references to managing Jabber, which makes me lean towards those categories. Overall, I should categorize it based on the management of access and credentials.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm deciding between categorizing this ticket under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket discusses credentials, login, account issues, and disabling Jabber, so \"Access\" seems like the best fit. There's no clear mention of granting admin rights, which leans me away from \"Administrative rights.\" If it were too ambiguous, I might consider \"Miscellaneous,\" but the repeated references to Jabber access make it clear. Therefore, I should respond with the category as a JSON object. \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
