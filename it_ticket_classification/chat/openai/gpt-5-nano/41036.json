Maybe \"Miscellaneous\" works since it's somewhat generic, or \"Internal Project\" if it relates to a specific project. The user is reporting a bug where accessing tracking status incorrectly shows a list of meeting rooms. It\u2019s more about UI behavior than access or permissions, so \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access\" seems the closest fit, but it really leans toward a UI bug.**Classifying bug report categories**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to categorize a ticket related to an Outlook bug. It might fit best as \"Miscellaneous,\" or possibly \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s tied to a specific project. The user mentioned logging a ticket for investigation, but that\u2019s not very clear. \"Access\" could be justified if it concerns viewing permissions, but it seems more like a bug in the tracking status section, so \"Miscellaneous\" is more appropriate. I\u2019ll need to respond with a JSON-like object for the category.**Providing category for ticket**\n\nThe instructions clearly indicate I need to respond with a JSON-like object containing a \"category\" field. Here, I think \"Miscellaneous\" fits best since this IT ticket seems to be about a software bug in Outlook. While \"Access\" might also seem relevant because it concerns viewing tracking status, this situation is more about a UI issue than access permissions. So, I'll stick with \"Miscellaneous\" and ensure my response is clean, just outputting: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
