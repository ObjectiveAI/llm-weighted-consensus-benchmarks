The potential categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and more. Considering the mention of \"Oracle scheduling absence,\" it seems to fit best under \"HR Support\" since it pertains to a human resources function. So, I\u2019ll format this into a JSON object that includes the selected category.**Analyzing ticket details**\n\nThe user describes an issue with Oracle's scheduling absence feature. They mention a missing drop-down to select the type of absence, indicating a problem with accessing this function. I need to determine whether this falls under \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\" Since it relates to a human resources process\u2014specifically absence scheduling\u2014\"HR Support\" seems most fitting. However, if permissions are the problem, \"Access\" might be appropriate too. I'll conclude with \"HR Support\" for categorization.**Identifying the category**\n\nThe issue seems to be with the Oracle Scheduling Absence application, specifically a missing drop-down for selecting the type of absence. Given the categories listed, \"HR Support\" appears most suitable since this relates to an HR system. \"Access\" pertains to permissions, while \"Administrative rights\" is more specific. Since the user is looking for help with scheduling in an HRIS, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and return the JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
