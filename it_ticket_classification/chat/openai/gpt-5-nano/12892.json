The options are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since it mentions deleting mailboxes, it could fit into \"Storage\" for email management or \"Administrative rights\" if they need permission to proceed with the deletion. I\u2019ll weigh both categories and decide.**Categorizing mailbox deletion**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize the request about deleting an email mailbox. If it requires permission, it would fall under \"Administrative rights,\" but if it\u2019s related to data retention, then \"Storage\" makes sense. The user says \"please delete mine,\" indicating they want their mailbox removed. They also mention holidays and printing, which is a bit confusing. I'm not sure if those dates are holidays or related to mailbox deletions, so I need to clarify the intent before making a final decision.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think the best category for this IT ticket is \"Storage\" since mailbox deletion relates to storage management and data retention. However, it could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" because the user is requesting to delete their mailbox, which might require permission. The phrase \"please delete mine\" indicates it's a request for resource deletion rather than system access. In most IT systems, this kind of request typically falls under either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Storage,\" particularly since it mentions \"mailboxes\" in plural.**Categorizing ticket as JSON**\n\nThe user\u2019s request mentions multiple elements, but I think the core focus is on deleting mailboxes. Given that, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Storage.\" I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object per the instructions, so it looks like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}\n\nI need to keep it concise and stick to the format without extra text since the request is straightforward. It seems the user doesn\u2019t want any explanations, just the category output. So, here we go!"
