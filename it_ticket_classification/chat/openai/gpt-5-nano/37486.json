The request is a bit unclear, but it could fit under \"Access\" if it\u2019s about entering a password or \"Miscellaneous.\" It might also relate to an \u201cInternal Project\u201d if it's about development. I\u2019m trying to understand where this fits based on the options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. This could be tricky!**Interpreting IT Request**\n\nThe user seems to want to enter a code for an upcoming week and make changes, possibly related to scheduling or authorizing updates in Oracle. They mention needing \"Access,\" which could imply requesting permission. The holiday reference suggests a need for scheduling adjustments. However, I don't see clear connections to categories like hardware or storage. Given the generic nature of the request regarding Oracle code, the best classifications might be \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" It\u2019s a bit tricky!**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe user has requested to \"make changes\" and \"enter code,\" which suggests it\u2019s related to Oracle code changes, possibly for an \"Internal Project.\" While some might categorize unclear requests as \"Miscellaneous,\" I think \"Internal Project\" fits best since it concerns code within an internal system. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object according to the schema provided, showing the category clearly without extra text.\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
