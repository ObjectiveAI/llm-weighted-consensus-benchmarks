It mentions various aspects related to a \"leaver mailbox\" and processing offboarding. Key phrases like \"access to leaver mailbox\" and \"transfer mailbox\" point towards needing access, making \"Access\" the most fitting category. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also apply. Since it involves offboarding, \"HR Support\" might be relevant too. Ultimately, I'll select \"Access\" as the best option for this ticket.**Determining offboarding category**\n\nFor offboarding tasks related to mailbox transfer, it\u2019s clear that this involves user access to a mailbox. Phrases like \"transfer mailbox\" and \"leave tomorrow\" suggest administrative actions might be needed. The most fitting category here seems to be \"Access.\" I\u2019m eliminating other categories like hardware, storage, or purchases since they don\u2019t apply. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize this IT ticket as \"Access\" and respond with a JSON object that includes the category field as such: {\"category\": \"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
