I need to pick a category from the options like Hardware, Purchase, and Internal Project. Since the user is requesting a monitor, it feels most appropriate to categorize it as \"Hardware.\" I suppose it could also fit under \"Purchase,\" but my best bet is \"Hardware\" as it's a request for a tangible item. Now, I\u2019ll format my response clearly!**Formatting JSON response**\n\nThe task requires me to respond with a structured JSON object for the category. Based on the user's request mentioning a monitor, it seems the clear choice is \"Hardware.\" While \"Purchase\" could fit since they might want to acquire a monitor, the primary focus is on it being a hardware request. So, I\u2019ll prepare the response as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to meet their specifications without any extra text. Now, I\u2019m all set to send that!"
