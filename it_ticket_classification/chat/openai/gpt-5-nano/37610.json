Since it refers to access privileges and not functioning well, \"Access\" appears to be the most suitable category. If it concerns permissions, \"Administrative rights\" could also apply.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI realize the phrase \"already other users too\" indicates there's an access issue affecting multiple users, not just this one. The ticket asks for investigation regarding access to dashboards and viewing their details. \"Administrative rights\" don\u2019t seem relevant since the request doesn't mention them explicitly, so \"Access\" feels most suitable. I need to format this as a JSON-like object with the category value. In the allowed enum, I'll choose \"Access\" and present it accordingly.**Structuring JSON Response**\n\nI realize I need to format the output as a JSON object. While the simplest response would be just `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`, the specified schema requires a more complex structure: `{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}`. It\u2019s important to match the expected format. Given the instructions, I will return the complete object rather than just the category string. So, the response should be formatted properly.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket and think the best output is `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I'll keep it straightforward and avoid any extra commentary. While there's a chance they might consider \"Administrative rights\" due to the request for a fix, the mention of issues with viewing details across users suggests that \"Access\" is more appropriate and general. So, I\u2019ll just return the final JSON object without any added fluff."
