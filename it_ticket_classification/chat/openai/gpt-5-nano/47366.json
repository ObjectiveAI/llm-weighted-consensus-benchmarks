The categories I have include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and a few more. The ticket seems to discuss permissions and access controls, mentioning Active Directory. It seems like the user wants help fixing the ability to assign permissions. Given the context and the key terms, the best category might be \"Access\" or possibly \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll clarify this!**Determining the category for IT ticket**\n\nI am debating whether to categorize the IT ticket as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \"Administrative rights\" feels more specific to admin privileges, while \"Access\" covers a broader range of permissions. The ticket suggests the user wants to fix an issue related to permissions in Active Directory, so it clearly relates to access issues. I need to format the response as a JSON object that fits the required schema. Let's get that right!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
