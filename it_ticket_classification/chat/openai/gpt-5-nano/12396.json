It looks like this ticket is primarily an access issue, so I\u2019ll select \"Access\" as the category. Finally, I should output this as a JSON object with the appropriate format.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket is about permissions for deleting attachments and pages in Confluence, which relates to access rights. I see the options are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" While both could fit, the user\u2019s request is focused more on access control. Given the request seems to be about permissions rather than administrative privileges, I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate category. However, it could also fall under \"Administrative rights\" if it's considered an admin task.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
