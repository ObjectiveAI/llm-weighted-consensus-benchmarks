Although I considered other categories like \"Hardware\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage\" fits best. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object that specifies the category as \"Storage.\" Let's finalize that format!**Determining category format**\n\nThe system has defined a \"category\" type with specific allowed categories, so I should output a JSON object according to that format. The user only wants the categorization, which is typically delivered as just the category name. However, the required schema suggests I present it as a JSON object. Since the instructions indicate I should provide a concise response, I'll format it this way: `{\"category\":\"Storage\"}`. It\u2019s straightforward, and that should work well!**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nThe user has asked for a categorization without needing any elaboration, so I'll just provide the category in the required format. Though the system might expect a direct category name, to be cautious, I\u2019ll use JSON to meet the schema requirements. I\u2019ve decided to present it as `{\"category\":\"Storage\"}`. It\u2019s clear and concise, and I think that should meet the user\u2019s needs perfectly!"
