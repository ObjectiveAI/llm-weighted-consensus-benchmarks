It seems like they\u2019re asking for a bigger screen without a secondary monitor; however, the message is a bit garbled. \n\nI\u2019ll look at the categories available, which include \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" and possibly others. Since they mention \u201claptop\u201d and \u201cbigger screen size,\u201d it likely falls under \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase,\" especially given the term \"requisition,\" indicating an order.**Categorizing IT ticket for screen upgrade**\n\nIn categorizing this IT ticket, it seems the user is requesting a screen size upgrade, which fits under \"Hardware.\" However, since they mention \"hard requisition,\" it also leans towards \"Purchase,\" indicating a procurement request for a larger built-in screen without an extra monitor. \n\nI need to determine whether to categorize it as \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" Since the user explicitly asked for categorization, I\u2019ll prepare to respond with a JSON-like object containing the selected category.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe system indicates that I should provide a category for the IT ticket, requiring a JSON-like output. The request references a \"laptop\" and a \"bigger screen size,\" implying a hardware upgrade. However, the mention of \"hard requisition\" leans more toward it being a procurement request. \n\nSo, I think the best category to choose is \"Purchase\" since it aligns with the concept of requisition. I\u2019ll format the output accordingly: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} and make sure it's clear and straightforward with no extra text."
