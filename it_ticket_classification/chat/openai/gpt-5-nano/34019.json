Since the main focus is on purchasing and hardware accessories, I'm thinking the most suitable category would be \"Purchase.\" It definitely aligns with the content of the ticket!**Deciding on category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the right category for the IT ticket. Since it mentions \"tempered glass,\" it could relate to \"Hardware,\" but it's primarily a purchase request. The frequent mentions of \"purchase,\" \"final owner,\" and \"swap process\" highlight that it's clearly about buying something. \n\nI've ruled out categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" So, \"Purchase\" fits best. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object specifically formatted to relay this category. It will look like: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
