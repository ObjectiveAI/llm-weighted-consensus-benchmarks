The relevant categories I can choose from include \"HR Support,\" which seems to fit this situation best since it\u2019s about onboarding. It\u2019s important I select the right category to ensure it gets the proper attention!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the options for categorizing an IT ticket: \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Given that the message mentions creating tickets for onboarding and includes starter forms and attachments, it seems that \"HR Support\" is the best fit. It leans towards HR issues rather than IT. Since the user wants a structured response, I\u2019ll format it in JSON as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} to align with their request!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
