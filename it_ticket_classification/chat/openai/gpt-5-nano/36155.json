The instructions specify I should format my response as a JSON object. Since the issue seems likely related to access, I'll categorize it under \"Access\" and format the output correctly as {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nI need to determine the proper category for an IT ticket regarding a license issue, likely related to JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA. The user mentions a license server problem, indicating access issues with their software. This seems to fit best under the \"Access\" category, though \"Administrative rights,\" \"Purchase,\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could also apply. Since the issue directly involves access to licensed software, I\u2019ll go with the \"Access\" category and format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI'm narrowing down the categories for the IT ticket. \"Internal Project\" seems unlikely, and \"Administrative rights\" doesn't fit since there's no request for admin rights. \"Purchase\" relates to buying a license, but the user isn't asking for that\u2014just diagnosing an issue. \"Miscellaneous\" is too general, so \"Access\" is the best fit since it involves access to software. I\u2019ll finalize my response as {\"category\":\"Access\"} and stick to the required JSON format."
