The ticket discusses onboarding a new starter in Colombia and mentions details like job title and grade. This seems primarily like an HR/Onboarding request rather than something involving access rights. So, I'm concluding the category should be \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll format the output as {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. Let's ensure that\u2019s allowed.**Formatting the response**\n\nI see I need to respond with a JSON-like object based on the instructions. The focus is on providing a \"category\" key with an enumerated type that fits the allowed categories. The prompt specifically says to \"Respond with JSON only,\" which means I should keep it straightforward without any extra text. So, I'll simply output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This should align perfectly with the task requirements! Let's go ahead and proceed."
