After considering the relevant categories like Hardware, Purchase, and others, it seems to be related to hardware since they\u2019re requesting equipment to connect devices. However, \u201ccable request\u201d could hint at a purchase needed. Ultimately, I think \u201cHardware\u201d is the best choice, but I could see it also fitting under \u201cPurchase.\u201d**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket by providing a JSON object that respects the given format. The categories to choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and more. \n\nFrom the details given, it sounds like a cable request related to connecting two monitors, making \u201cHardware\u201d a reasonable choice. However, since it\u2019s a cable, \u201cPurchase\u201d could also fit. I\u2019ll stick with \u201cHardware\u201d for clarity and ensure my response is concise. The JSON will look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
