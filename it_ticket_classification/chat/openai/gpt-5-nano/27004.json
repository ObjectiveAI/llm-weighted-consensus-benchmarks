They've provided details about a \"new starter\" and mentioned a \"starter form,\" which suggests HR onboarding. Since the categories include \"Access\" and \"HR Support,\" I think this ticket might fit best under \"Access\" because it's related to onboarding access for the new starter. However, it's also relevant to \"HR Support.\" Ultimately, I'll lean towards categorizing it as \"Access.\"**Categorizing an IT Ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket based on the text, which suggests it's about a new starter form. It seems like a request for onboarding, possibly to create accounts. While categories like \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" come to mind, it doesn't seem to fit \"Administrative rights.\" Since this involves setting up access for the new starter, I think \"Access\" is the best choice.
