The sentence mentions not receiving a notification after a change request update about increasing pool addresses for guests, and there's also a reference to a cancellation and resubmission. \n\nI'll focus on \"notification not received,\" which makes it sound like a communication issue related to the change request. The most fitting category from my list is probably \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d as it doesn't clearly fit into the other options.**Identifying IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m parsing an IT ticket about increasing pool addresses for guests and a notification issue after a change request update. The user mentions logging an incident, along with references to cancellation and resubmission related to a change management process. \n\nThis could possibly fit under \"Administrative rights,\" but I'm not sure it aligns perfectly. It's not about access, and \"Internal Project\" might work if linked to a project. Ultimately, the best fit seems to be \"Miscellaneous,\" considering the notification aspect.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm realizing that the content here is primarily about notification issues in Change Management, rather than rights, which leads me to think \"Miscellaneous\" is likely the best category. \n\nI should respond with the JSON format: `{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}` since that's what the prompt requires. However, I\u2019m also considering \"Administrative rights\" because of references to logging incidents and resubmissions. Ultimately, though, I think \"Miscellaneous\" fits better for this ticket. So I\u2019ll present it in the specified format.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
