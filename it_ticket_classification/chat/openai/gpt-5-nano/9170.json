The user mentioned \"leaver form question\" and other related phrases suggesting it's about the offboarding process. While \"Administrative rights\" doesn't fit, \"HR Support\" seems the closest, since the leaver form is part of HR procedures. There's a chance \"Access\" could relate to system access rights, but since it's primarily focused on offboarding, I'll stick with categorizing it under \"HR Support.\"**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nI see that the content mentions needing guidance on filling out a leaver form and refers to details related to a senior developer. This leaver form clearly pertains to HR-related issues, making \"HR Support\" the most suitable category. Now I need to format my response as a JSON object, with the category specified accurately. The expected output format is clear and should be structured as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I'll ensure it adheres to the predefined schema.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
