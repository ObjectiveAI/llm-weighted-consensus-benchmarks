However, since the ticket doesn\u2019t explicitly mention \"Scheduling,\" I think \"Access\" might be the best fit overall.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the ticket again and think it fits best under \"Access.\" The phrases \"problem connecting\" and \"please add user\" suggest this, as \"Access\" typically covers user access and connection issues. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply, the text seems to lean more towards granting user access. Plus, \"Hardware\" relates more to physical machine issues, which doesn\u2019t seem relevant here. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and format my output as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
