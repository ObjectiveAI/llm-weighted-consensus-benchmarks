The ticket includes terms like \"pas rights\" and \"modify unknown pipelines,\" suggesting a request for access rights. The user seems to want permissions for modifying pipelines, probably within a CI/CD context.\n\nGiven the repeated mentions of rights and modifications, this ticket best fits the \"Access\" category or possibly \"Administrative rights.\" So, I\u2019ll prepare the JSON object with the appropriate category!**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket where the user mentions granting rights and modifying pipelines, which seems related to a DevOps context. The categories I have to choose from are \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access.\" Given that the request is specifically about modifying pipelines, it sounds like it requires privileged access, leaning toward \"Administrative rights.\" However, I also need to keep in mind general access permissions. But since pipelines are involved, I'd classify it as \"Administrative rights\" and prepare the JSON object.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
