The categories I can choose from are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the content of the ticket focuses heavily on sick leave and an operation, \"HR Support\" seems the most fitting. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply, there\u2019s no mention of access issues.**Submitting category**\n\nI'll categorize the ticket as \"HR Support\" since it focuses on sick leave. The system requires me to output a JSON object with the category value. It\u2019s important to strictly follow the format: a category object with a string type. I just need to provide the JSON without any extra commentary. So, I will respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That's clear and straightforward."
