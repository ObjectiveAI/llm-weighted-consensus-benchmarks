I\u2019ll rule out other options like Hardware or Storage since they don\u2019t apply here.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering additional context like \"input needed,\" \"attached board,\" and \"senior consultant.\" While it could suggest \"Administrative rights\" if permissions to create boards are needed, the ticket doesn\u2019t explicitly mention a lack of rights. Instead, it seems to focus on project management by stating, \u201ccreate boards for the same project.\u201d Thus, I believe the best category here is \"Internal Project.\" It might be helpful to ask the user clarifying questions for more details!**Formatting output as JSON**\n\nI need to provide a JSON-like output based on the instructions I've been given. The tool expects a category object with the category string from the specified options. Since the user is asking me to categorize this IT ticket, I\u2019ll output it as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019m keeping it concise as instructed, but maybe I could add a brief justification, though the guidelines suggest to focus purely on the JSON structure. So, I'll stick with just the category object."
