The terms mentioned, like \"hosts assignment\" and \"two physical machines,\" imply a focus on hardware setup. There's also the possibility of \"Internal Project,\" reflecting a project management aspect. Since the ticket seems a bit unstructured, I should classify it as \"Hardware\" for the physical server setup, but I\u2019ll keep \"Internal Project\" in mind too.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering categorizing this ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it involves setting up hosts and configuring a cluster. However, if it focuses on authoritative slaves and IP addresses, it might lean toward \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" though it doesn't seem like access control is involved. \n\nTo keep it clear, the best fit could still be \"Hardware\" due to the mention of \"two physical machines.\" Ultimately, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware\" and create a JSON object to reflect that.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to ensure the output for the IT ticket categorization follows the required format. The system specifies a JSON object with a \"category\" field, and there are predefined category options. \n\nIt seems like the user might just want the category string, but the schema requires a JSON object. The instruction indicates that the output will be parsed by code, so I\u2019ll deliver exactly what\u2019s needed without any extra text. I'll finalize with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, ensuring the \"H\" in \"Hardware\" is capitalized as specified."
