This could fall under either Access or Administrative rights since it involves permissions and access to the mailbox. There's also a \"Storage\" category, which might relate to mailboxes, but it's not exactly that. I need to decide which category fits best!**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI need to choose one category for this ticket that mentions a user requesting a shared mailbox. It seems like this falls under \"Access\" since it\u2019s about granting access to a mailbox. However, there\u2019s also the \"Administrative rights\" category, but that feels broader and may refer to elevated privileges. Since the request is specifically about accessing a shared mailbox, I think \"Access\" makes the most sense. I\u2019ll format it as a JSON object with the category value: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Formatting IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe prompt clearly asks me to categorize the IT ticket, so I need to respond with a JSON formatted line that shows the category. Based on the earlier allowed format, I\u2019ll go with the category as \"Access.\" There's no need for any extra text since the instructions specify that I should only provide the category object. So, the final response will be exactly: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let\u2019s deliver that!"
