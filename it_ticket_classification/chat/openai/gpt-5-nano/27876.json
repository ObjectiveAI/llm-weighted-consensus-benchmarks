The ticket mentions offices and assigning teams for ordering cards. It looks like it relates to access control, suggesting the \"Access\" category is the best fit. Since \u201caccess cards\u201d refer to hardware for accessing secure areas, I\u2019ll confirm it fits under the \u201cAccess\u201d category. Now, I will respond with the appropriate JSON format reflecting this choice.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI need to produce a JSON object categorizing the IT ticket as per the instructions. The ticket clearly relates to access cards usage, so \"Access\" fits best. Following the schema, I should respond simply with the category value in the format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. There's no need for additional explanation, so I'll keep it concise and ensure I'm following the provided guidelines. The final response will be {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's go with that!"
