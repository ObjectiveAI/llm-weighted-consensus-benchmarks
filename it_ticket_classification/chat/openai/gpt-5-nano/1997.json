Therefore, it best fits the \"HR Support\" category since it's about leave management. I'll structure it as a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Categorizing leave booking issue**\n\nThe user mentioned they're facing a problem indicated by the phrase \"screen cannot book free.\" This suggests a system access issue related to leave booking. They're unable to book annual leave due to a technical problem, which seems to fit into several categories: \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"HR Support.\" Since this is about an HR process (leave management) and involves a system issue, I believe the best category is \"HR Support.\" So, I\u2019ll categorize it accordingly.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
