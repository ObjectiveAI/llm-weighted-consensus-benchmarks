The user seems to want help submitting Oracle time for a former employee. It's about entering time, which likely falls under HR Support since it relates to payroll and timekeeping. While there could be some mention of access, it primarily revolves around time submission, so HR Support seems to be the best fit for this ticket.**Categorizing Oracle Time Submission**\n\nI'm working on categorizing a ticket about Oracle time submission for a former employee. It seems like it could fit under \"HR Support\" since it's an HR-related request about submitting time entries. While \"Administrative rights\" might apply if it involved access rights to the Oracle system, the focus is clearly on submitting hours. So, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"HR Support.\" Now, I just need to format the response correctly in JSON. The output should look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the schema for the response, which requires a JSON object with a \"category\" field. It seems that the right fit here is \"HR Support.\" The task was to categorize the IT ticket, and I need my response to be concise, just the JSON object without any extra text. While I considered other categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" none fit better than \"HR Support,\" so my final response is indeed: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
