The content mentions \"oracle issue,\" \"update hours,\" \"absence leave,\" and \"inaccurate information.\" It seems like it's related to HR support due to the leave and hours. The \"oracle issue\" could link to Access since it might refer to database access, or possibly Administrative rights due to privileges. Overall, HR Support seems to be the most relevant category for this ticket.**Categorizing ticket content**\n\nI have a text that mentions an \"oracle issue,\" hours, absence leave, and inaccurate information. It sounds a bit messy but seems to lean towards HR Support because it's focused on hours and leave. However, it could also relate to Access if they\u2019re having trouble with Oracle. Since the request is for updating hours and addresses absenteeism, it feels like it's HR-related. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as HR Support and return the JSON object as required: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
