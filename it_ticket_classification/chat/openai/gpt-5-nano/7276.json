It sounds like they\u2019re having trouble logging into the Oracle Expenses app on their phones, which likely falls under the \"Access\" category because it relates to login issues. If there's any ambiguity, I might categorize it as \"Miscellaneous.\" I'll prepare a JSON response format that includes the category property, ensuring it follows the required structure. This will help clarify the nature of the issue for the user!**Classifying ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ve identified that the user has an explicit issue with \"trouble logging in,\" which fits the access/authentication category. The allowed categories include \"Access,\" so my response should simply reflect that. I need to format it as a JSON object with a category property that's set to the string \"Access.\" According to the schema, there's no need for extra commentary; I should just deliver the category directly as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's go ahead and finalize this!"
