It seems to fit \"Access\" more generally, but \"Administrative rights\" is specific to admin privileges. The ticket includes terms like \"rights fusion,\" \"approvals,\" and \"have rights approve,\" all related to access rights for roles.\n\nSince the content focuses on approval rights needed to perform actions, I think the best choice is \"Administrative rights.\" So, I\u2019ll output the category in the required format: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
