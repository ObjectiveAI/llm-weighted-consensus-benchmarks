The relevant categories provided are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Based on the content, it seems like this aligns with \"HR Support,\" as it relates to onboarding processes and form submissions. So, I\u2019ll construct a JSON object with that category.**Deciding Ticket Category**\n\nThis ticket clearly involves the onboarding process for new starters, including forms and handling email attachments, virus protection, and what types of files might be blocked. I\u2019m considering categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Access.\" The mention of an \"administration officer\" suggests an HR role, making \"HR Support\" the most fitting category. It seems focused on onboarding steps, so I\u2019ll categorize this ticket under \"HR Support.\" That\u2019s the logical choice!**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nThe category \"HR Support\" is definitely fitting for this ticket about onboarding forms for a new starter. It references an \"administration officer\" and discusses sending a starter form along with attachments. While \"Administrative rights\" sounds relevant, the main focus seems to be on HR processes. There are mentions of security controls, but \"Security policy\" isn\u2019t an option, and \"Miscellaneous\" would only apply if needed. Given the context, I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support\" and format the output as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
