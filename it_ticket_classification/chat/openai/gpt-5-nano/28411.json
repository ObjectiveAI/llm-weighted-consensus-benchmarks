The relevant categories include hardware, HR support, access, miscellaneous, storage, purchase, internal project, and administrative rights. Given that it involves installation of TV stands, I initially consider it as \"Hardware.\" It also mentions purchases and receipts, which could suggest \"Purchase,\" but since the main focus is on installation, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware.\" In my response, I should format it as a JSON object with the category \"Hardware.\"**Formatting the category response**\n\nI see that I need to provide a JSON object responding with a \"category\" field. The provided schema confirms that it should be formatted accordingly. The ticket clearly revolves around hardware installation, specifically \"install tv stands,\" which fits under the \"Hardware\" category. While I briefly wondered if \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" could apply, the main focus is indeed hardware. So, I\u2019ll respond straightforwardly with {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\u2014only the required JSON, without extra text or formatting."
