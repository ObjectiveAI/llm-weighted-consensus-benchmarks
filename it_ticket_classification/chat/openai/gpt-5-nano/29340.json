It seems clear that this falls under \"Internal Project\" since it's about site migration. However, there's also a mention of access and editing rights. But really, the primary task is the migration. So, I\u2019m making a final decision to categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and will present it as a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nThe system indicates that bullet lists are acceptable, but for this case, a single JSON object is what I need to provide. I'll format it as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.\n\nIt's crucial I get the capitalization right, since the enum specifies \"Internal Project\" with a capital I and P, and I want to follow that exactly. So, I\u2019m making sure to keep it precise. Let's stick with that format!"
