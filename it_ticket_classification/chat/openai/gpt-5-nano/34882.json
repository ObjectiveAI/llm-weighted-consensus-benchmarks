They mention a high memory usage issue, possibly indicating a memory leak, and they've attached a screenshot. The ticket requests urgent help, so I have to choose a fitting category. It seems that \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate choice since it relates to RAM and memory usage, despite not being a hardware failure directly.**Determining the category**\n\nI need to decide on the appropriate category for an IT ticket related to memory usage issues. \"Storage\" is usually for disk space, while \"Hardware\" pertains to physical devices and performance issues. It looks like \"Hardware\" is the best choice here. I'll output the response as a JSON object according to the provided schema. The required format specifies that I should simply include the category name, so I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. No extra commentary needed!**Finalizing the ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned a screenshot in their request, specifically saying, \"print screen attached could you please lend hand asap thank you.\" Even though they provided that detail, I'm focusing on the memory usage issue they described. I think I\u2019m ready to finalize my response and categorize the ticket as related to hardware. I want to ensure I've considered everything before wrapping this up!"
