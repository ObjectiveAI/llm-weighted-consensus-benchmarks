This message raises a couple of possible categories: \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" Since it's about requesting physical equipment, \"Hardware\" seems appropriate. However, it\u2019s also clearly a procurement request since they\u2019re asking to obtain new backpacks. So, \"Purchase\" might fit better here, but I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"Purchase\" since that aligns with the request to buy something.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nWhen triaging IT tickets, I usually categorize equipment requests under \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" In this case, the user is requesting two laptop backpacks to replace worn ones. It\u2019s clear that they\u2019re not asking for access or admin rights, so I need to choose the best category. Although both could work, \"Purchase\" seems more precise since it's a request to obtain items. So, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Categorizing IT request**\n\nThe user's message indicates a request for two laptop backpacks, which clearly suggests a need for procurement. The mention of \"replacing backpacks\" further confirms that it\u2019s about replacing an item. In IT ticketing, these types of requests generally fall under \"Hardware\" or \"Procurement,\" but since \"Purchase\" is the specific category available, I'll choose that. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} while keeping it simple and straightforward, just as instructed."
