I\u2019ll make sure to accurately reflect this in the categorization. Let\u2019s label it accordingly and then move forward.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories and noting that, while there\u2019s no direct option for \"Password issues\" or \"Authentication,\" the \"Access\" category fits well for the ticket described. It clearly relates to password changes and access problems. So, it makes sense to categorize it as \"Access.\" I'll present the output in the required JSON format as instructed, ensuring it's clear and concise.
