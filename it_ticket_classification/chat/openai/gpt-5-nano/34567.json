This definitely falls under access issues. I think the best category here would be \"Access,\" as it directly relates to login problems. Now, I should respond with a JSON-like format for the categorized ticket as instructed.**Outputting category**\n\nI need to follow the expected format from previous tasks, which involves providing a JSON object with a category field. Based on the instructions, I should reply with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It seems straightforward, but I wonder if I should add a brief note. However, the prompt specifically says to categorize and provides a category object without extra commentary. So, I\u2019ll stick to the requirement and just output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
