The best categories might be Hardware for the allocation part and HR Support due to the mention of leaver forms. Access could fit if it's about provisioning, but the focus seems mainly on hardware and offboarding processes. I'll finalize my categorization accordingly.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI need to choose a category for this ticket regarding bulk leaver forms for interns, which suggests offboarding. The mention of \"bulk hardware allocation\" indicates hardware provisioning or deallocation. The phrases about filling out the forms hint at administrative tasks, possibly involving access revocation and hardware return. Given the options, \"Hardware\" best fits due to the bulk allocation, but \"HR Support\" also seems relevant for the offboarding aspect. I'll decide on the best category based on this context.**Evaluating ticket categories**\n\nThe ticket is about \"leaver forms,\" which suggests offboarding, so \"Administrative rights\" might be a fit for access rights. However, there isn\u2019t a clear mention of specific software or apps related to access. It seems more relevant to categorize it as \"Hardware\" since it talks about allocating hardware to departing interns. Alternatives like \"Access\" could apply if it involved revoking rights, but the text focuses on \"bulk hardware allocation,\" which strongly indicates hardware distribution. \"HR Support\" could also work since it's related to intern offboarding. I'll settle on the best category based on this.**Finalizing category output**\n\nFor the IT help desk request, I\u2019ll categorize it as \u201cHardware,\u201d which fits well with hardware provisioning or offboarding. The system requires a JSON-like format for the output. I need to structure it properly as the prompt states to \"produce category\" in a specific schema. My final output should simply be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nNo extra text or details\u2014just sticking to the required format to meet the instructions. I'm ready to send that!"
