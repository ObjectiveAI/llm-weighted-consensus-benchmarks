The user mentions \"notification decommissioning,\" migration, and \"git import existing git repository.\" This situation likely fits into categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or maybe even \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" There are several terms like \"decommissioning,\" \"content migrated,\" and \"empty repository maintains commit history\" that indicate it relates to managing a git repository. Overall, it seems focused on migrating content.**Categorizing IT requests**\n\nI'm examining the categories available: \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The user's ticket includes phrases like \"please prepare,\" \"decommissioning,\" and \"migration,\" suggesting they need permissions to create a repository. Since it involves managing a project and includes terms like \"git import existing git repository,\" it seems best suited for the \"Internal Project\" category. I just need to remember that it should be formatted like a JSON object for clarity.**Structuring the category**\n\nThe instruction asks for a JSON object to categorize the IT ticket. I\u2019m considering \"Internal Project\" since it involves migrating a git repository. While there are references to \"Administrative rights,\" the focus is on the migration steps, not directly requesting access. The presence of terms like \"decommissioning\" further supports it being an \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll just ensure the format is correct according to the schema. The output will be: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`."
