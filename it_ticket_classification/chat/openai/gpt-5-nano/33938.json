The allowed categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. The user's message is a bit unclear, mentioning connecting network ports and additional bench usage. It seems they want to expand or connect network ports on their floor. I\u2019ll need to decide which category fits best based on what they need.**Determining the Right Category**\n\nIt seems the user wants to connect network ports on a specific floor and is seeking approvals for changes. This relates to network infrastructure, making me think about which category to assign. The options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. Since this involves network hardware and infrastructure, \"Hardware\" appears to be the most appropriate category. I'll format the response as a JSON object with \"Hardware\" as the category string value.**Formatting the Response**\n\nThe instruction indicates that I need to respond with a category object that includes the category field. So, I\u2019ll organize the information as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It's important that I quote this exactly and keep it minimal. The required format is strictly a category object, based on the prompt \"Categorize this IT Ticket.\" I'll make sure my response consists solely of that JSON object, without any additional text or explanation."
