It seems to be about a computer not starting, where they've tried pressing the power button and removing the battery, but nothing is changing. That sounds like a hardware issue, so I\u2019ll likely categorize it under \"Hardware.\" There\u2019s also mention of \"drive training,\" which could suggest \"Storage\" or \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" for now.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user's phrase about \"drive training\" seems to suggest they might want to borrow a drive, but the main concern is the PC not starting. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it under \"Hardware.\" According to the guidelines, I need to provide a JSON object with this category. The correct output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I need to ensure it\u2019s formatted correctly, without extra commentary, and that \"Hardware\" is a valid choice from the list."
