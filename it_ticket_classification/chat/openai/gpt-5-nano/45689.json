It seems clear that this is an access issue since they're unable to log in. So, I\u2019ll structure my response as a JSON object focused on the \"Access\" category. This aligns with the problem described, ensuring I properly categorize the ticket! I'll get that ready now.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing whether this issue should be categorized as \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it involves a login issue with Oracle, it feels like an \"Access\" problem. The user faced an error after trying to log in and has already cleared their cache. Given that context, I\u2019m confident that \"Access\" is the appropriate category. Now, I just need to format my response correctly as a JSON object, which I'll prepare: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's finalize it!"
