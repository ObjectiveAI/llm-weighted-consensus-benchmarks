The ticket mentions memory errors and video driver crashes, which could relate to hardware or software issues. The provided categories include Hardware and Miscellaneous. Given the focus on memory errors and laptop performance, I'm leaning towards categorizing this ticket under Hardware. However, Miscellaneous might also fit depending on any additional context. Let\u2019s make sure to input it correctly in JSON format.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the possible causes for this ticket, which may relate to hardware issues like RAM or GPU problems, as well as potential software crashes. Given the limited categories, \"Hardware\" seems to be the most appropriate choice. The response should be a JSON object that states, {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. The provided schema indicates that the response format must include this \"category\" field, so I want to ensure I follow that while keeping it simple.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
