The user mentions \"clearing tasks on an internship project,\" which seems to suggest that it relates to an internal project. \n\nWhile \"Administrative rights\" could fit if it involves access rights, I think the \"Access\" category might be more appropriate since the user emphasizes assigning tasks. I'll lean toward categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" based on the content.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nIt seems the user wants to assign tasks related to an internship project. Given the phrase \"clearing tasks on an internship project,\" I believe \"Internal Project\" is the best fitting category. \n\nThough I see mentions of \"Administrative rights,\" that might only apply if they need access rights. The phrase \"clear tasks\" could imply cleaning or organizing, which adds to the confusion a bit. But overall, I think \"Internal Project\" aligns best with the user's request.**Finalizing Category for IT Ticket**\n\nThere's no mention of access credentials in the user's request\u2014it's focused on clearing tasks and assigning them. I believe \"Internal Project\" is the appropriate category. \n\nNow, I need to format my response as a JSON-like object per the specified schema. The output will simply be: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. This keeps it concise and adheres strictly to the requirements without any extra explanations."
