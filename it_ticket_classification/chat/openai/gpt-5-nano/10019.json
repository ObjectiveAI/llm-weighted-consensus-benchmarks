The options are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since it\u2019s primarily about a cable request that\u2019s hardware-related, I think the best fit would be \"Hardware.\" However, it could also lean toward \"Purchase\" if the request involves ordering. I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" for clarity.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket regarding a cable request. It seems mostly about wanting to order a cable for a monitor, so \"Purchase\" might fit since it's about ordering hardware. Still, the system could categorize it under \"Hardware\" since it involves hardware components. However, the text emphasizes the request to purchase. I think I\u2019ll go with \"Purchase\" as the appropriate category. Now, I\u2019ll format it as JSON: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}{\"category\":\"\"}"
