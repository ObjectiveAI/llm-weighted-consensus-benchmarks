I\u2019m tasked with categorizing this IT ticket based on a defined schema that includes categories such as Access and Storage. Since the mention of a recovery key usually pertains to access, I\u2019m leaning toward \u201cAccess\u201d as the appropriate category. However, there\u2019s also a hint of hardware mention with the backpack, which could make it relevant for hardware issues.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe main point from the user\u2019s request is that they needed a recovery key, which appears to have been fixed. I\u2019m considering categorizing this as either \"Access\" or \"Hardware,\" but \"Access\" seems like the safer choice. According to the required format, I'll respond with a JSON object specifically stating the category. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text. While \"Miscellaneous\" could make sense, the focus on the recovery key points clearly to access control."
