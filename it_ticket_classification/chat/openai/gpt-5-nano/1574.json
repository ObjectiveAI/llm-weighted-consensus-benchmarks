The user's message indicates they want to cancel a recurring meeting because the owner is no longer available. It sounds like the most fitting category might be \"Administrative rights,\" since it involves changes to a meeting's details. I'll ensure I understand their request clearly and place it in the right category based on their needs.**Considering meeting cancellations**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a request related to recurring meetings. The user indicates there's a need to cancel meetings because the owner is on maternity leave. This situation involves calendar management, ownership, and possibly permissions. It seems like the best categories to consider are \"Administrative rights\" for managing these meetings and possibly \"Access\" if they can't get into the calendar. Ultimately, this request revolves around issues of authorization regarding meeting ownership and the ability to delete recurring meetings.**Finalizing the category response**\n\nI noticed that the content doesn\u2019t mention any access restrictions or login issues. The request revolves around canceling meetings within a series titled \"planning retrospective sessions\" in a restricted room. Given that the owner is no longer managing these, the right category to choose seems to be \"Administrative rights.\" I need to format the response correctly as a JSON object. So, I\u2019ll respond with the following: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. Let\u2019s make sure it meets the requirements!**Preparing the JSON response**\n\nI see that the instruction is clear: I need to respond with just one JSON object, specifically including the \"category\" field. I\u2019ll present it simply and ensure there\u2019s no extra commentary, as it has to be easily parsed by code. So, I\u2019ll format it as: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. Let\u2019s go ahead and provide the answer just like that!"
