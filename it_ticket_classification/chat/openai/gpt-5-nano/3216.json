It seems related to an internal project focusing on managing client codes within a system. It could also require administrative rights for creating client codes. The tasks involve creating new codes in a system, specifically mentioning Oracle, indicating that this is likely a project within IT systems rather than related to hardware or HR. The categories \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous\" seem most relevant.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI'm assessing the need for creating client codes in Oracle. It might relate to access permissions, but I need to choose the best category. The ticket mentions needing new client and project codes, client creation, and a form. Since this is an internal IT request about project creation, \"Internal Project\" seems like the right fit. The allowed categories include options like \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" but I think sticking with \"Internal Project\" is best for this case. Now, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like object to categorize it as instructed.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
