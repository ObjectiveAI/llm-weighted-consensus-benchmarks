Although access might be blocked, it's mainly a storage issue causing the bounced emails. The message is a bit jumbled, but it\u2019s clear that \"Storage\" is the most fitting category. I\u2019ll prepare to output this in JSON format.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize this IT ticket, and I have the schema to follow. I need to provide a JSON object with the category set as \"Storage.\" Following the prompt, I\u2019ll format it correctly as {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. There\u2019s no need for extra content or explanation since the instruction is simply to respond with the category. I\u2019ll make sure to get the spelling exactly right and deliver just that JSON object."
