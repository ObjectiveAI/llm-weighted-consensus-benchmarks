It's clear they're focused on branding, not hardware or access issues. It could potentially be classified as \"Internal Project\" if it relates to internal updates or \"Miscellaneous\" if it doesn't fit neatly into those. I think \"Internal Project\" is the best match here!**Categorizing IT Tickets**\n\nI'm assessing this ticket and confirming it's not about access, hardware, HR, or administration rights. Since it involves updating branding assets across tools, I believe \"Internal Project\" is the fitting category. I need to output this category in a JSON format as specified. The format requires a JSON object with a \"category\" property, so I'll respond with: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nIt might also be good to add a brief note for clarity, but it looks like they really just want the category JSON!"
