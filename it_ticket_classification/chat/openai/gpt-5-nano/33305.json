The categories available include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. This ticket seems to fit either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it focuses on permissions. Given the context about adding rights, I should choose \"Administrative rights\" as it\u2019s more specific. It's crucial to select the most fitting category when categorizing tickets!**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nI'll select \"Administrative rights\" as the category since \"Access\" feels a bit too broad for this ticket. The user asked me to categorize it, so I should return a proper JSON object with this information structured correctly. I need to make sure it follows the provided schema, which means I\u2019ll output it like this: `{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}`. It\u2019s essential to ensure the format is exact and includes the necessary quotes. The ticket input was brief, but I think this categorization fits perfectly!**Delivering JSON output**\n\nFor the final response, I need to provide a JSON object with the category, and it seems most appropriate to select \"Administrative rights.\" The content mentions \"access rights\" and requests to \"add right,\" which implies permissions related to a user possibly being granted rights as a test lead. Since \"Administrative rights\" is a more precise fit, I'll structure the response without any extra text. It will look like this: `{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}`."
