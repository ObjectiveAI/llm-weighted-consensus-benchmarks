They mentioned issues related to deleting large emails that are stuck in the outbox. So, this seems to revolve around mailbox and storage problems. Among the possible categories, \"Storage\" or perhaps \"Miscellaneous\" fits best. \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" don\u2019t really apply here, and it seems there's no specific category for email issues, but \"Storage\" seems most appropriate.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket seems to relate to mailbox storage issues since the user is struggling with large emails stuck in their outbox. So, I\u2019ve decided to categorize it as \"Storage.\" There's no specific \"Mail/Messaging\" category available, which would have been ideal, but \"Storage\" is the next best option. I need to ensure the response follows the required JSON format without any extra text. So, I'll output: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} without any additional explanations. That should cover it!"
