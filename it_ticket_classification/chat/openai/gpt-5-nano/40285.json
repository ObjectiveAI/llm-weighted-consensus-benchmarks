They mentioned a \"board issue,\" and it seems like it's related to visibility of epics in some project management tool, like Jira. Based on the content, I see potential categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since there's no specific \"Software\" or \"Project Management\" category, I'll lean towards \"Internal Project,\" given the context around internal tools.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating the IT ticket and considering that \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it involves permissions to view epics. The phrases \"board issue\" and \"epics visible\" make me think there's a problem with how the board is configured in a project management tool. I believe \"Internal Project\" is the best category since it's about board configuration, rather than hardware or HR. I\u2019ll output the category in JSON format as requested.**Outputting category as JSON**\n\nIt looks like the user is asking me to help categorize their IT ticket with the phrase \"I think issue with boards; epics visible.\" The most fitting category seems to be \"Internal Project.\" I need to respond in a specific JSON format, as the instruction outlines. So, I\u2019ll construct a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I'll make sure there\u2019s no extra text, just the required category object in the correct format.**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with the exact JSON format. While I briefly wondered if \"Miscellaneous\" could be appropriate due to the ticket's unclear nature, the presence of \"board\" and \"epics visible\" strongly suggests it's related to project management. Thus, \"Internal Project\" really does seem like the best fit. I'll go with: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} and make sure there\u2019s no extra commentary. It's time to finalize this!"
