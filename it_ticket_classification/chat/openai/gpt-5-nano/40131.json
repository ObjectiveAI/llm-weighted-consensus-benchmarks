I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the required structure, ensuring I include the category as \"Hardware\" for the final output.**Formatting category output**\n\nI need to format the category for the IT ticket response. It looks like I'm supposed to return just the JSON category. Based on the prompt, the correct structure is just {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.\n\nI initially considered if it might fit into \"Internal Project,\" but since it specifically mentions \"laptop broken,\" it clearly falls under \"Hardware.\" So, I'll stick to providing only the necessary JSON output in a concise manner. Let's finalize that!"
