Since the content mentions a hardware issue with the laptop screen, it\u2019s clear that the \"Hardware\" category is most fitting. I also consider that it could relate to \"Internal Project\" if it's about data collection, but given the specifics, \"Hardware\" is likely the best choice. I\u2019ll respond with the appropriate JSON format: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}.**Determining the Category**\n\nI need to classify the IT ticket based on the provided details. The required format is a category object, so I should respond simply with {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. However, I also consider whether \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" might fit better since the text mentions a laptop screen issue and a PC restart, suggesting a potential software error. Ultimately, the hardware issue is the primary concern, so I'll stick with \"Hardware\" for the response. Let's go ahead and deliver that."
