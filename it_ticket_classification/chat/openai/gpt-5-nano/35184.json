The main themes in the message are related to \"approval,\" \"security issue,\" and mentions of \"notification\" and \"manager.\" It sounds like this could fit into either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" considering it seems to center around an approval workflow issue. I\u2019ll have to determine which category is the best fit for this ticket!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe user describes an \"approval issue,\" which likely relates to a security problem in the approval process. The mention of \"tested chrome explorer\" suggests a browser-specific issue, possibly with notifications. I think \"eel\" might reference \"EEL approval.\" While \"Administrative rights\" is focused on specific permissions, this seems more about access control related to approvals. Since \"Security\" isn't an option, \"Access\" appears to be the best choice for categorizing this IT ticket effectively!**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI need to create an output in the specified JSON format for the category. The schema clearly defines that it should be an object, so I\u2019ll have to structure it properly. It looks like the category we decided on is \"Access.\" Following the format, the JSON object should look like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure not to add any extra text, so that it meets the requirements and stays clean and straightforward!"
