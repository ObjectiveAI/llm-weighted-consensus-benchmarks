However, I think \"Internal Project\" fits best since it relates to an IT task about deployment. \"Miscellaneous\" could be another option if it seems generic. Still, I'll go with \"Internal Project\" since it seems more appropriate. \n\nI\u2019ll generate a JSON response with that category!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
