Since there's no specific category for monitoring in the list, I think the best fit might be \"Miscellaneous,\" as it seems to be a generic IT task. It\u2019s tricky!**Categorizing a ticket request**\n\nThe user mentioned wanting to \"order monitoring polls,\" which might mean they want to set up some monitoring. But there's also a request to remove something from monitoring. This seems more like a scheduling task than an internal project, so I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best category. Now, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object, showing that it should be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}\n\nI\u2019ll verify that \"Miscellaneous\" is indeed included in the allowed values before finalizing my output."
