Based on the provided categories, it could fit into \"Purchase\" due to the purchase order and receipt focus. There's also the \"Hardware\" option since it relates to keyboard installation. However, given the emphasis on the purchase order, I think \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category for this IT ticket. Let's go with that!**Classifying installation request**\n\nI see this request asks to log the installation of a purchased keyboard. The message includes terms like \"purchase po,\" \"purchased keyboard,\" and \"log installation,\" but it\u2019s a bit jumbled. It falls into either \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" Given the mention of a purchase order and receipts, I think \"Purchase\" is the more fitting category. \n\nI\u2019ll prepare to output a JSON object to reflect this category as \"Purchase.\" The response will focus on that.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on how to categorize this IT ticket properly based on the user's request. The instruction asks for a JSON response with a category. I think \"Purchase\" fits best since it deals directly with the purchase order and receipts.\n\nWhile \"Hardware\" could also work because it\u2019s about a keyboard, the emphasis on logging the installation leans more toward \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll ensure the JSON is perfectly formatted as **{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}** and leave it at that!"
