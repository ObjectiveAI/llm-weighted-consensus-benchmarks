It could involve hardware tokens or security tokens used for 2FA. The key aspects seem to center around shipment logistics rather than administrative rights. It's about tracking and logging, so \"Storage\" seems fitting, but \"Purchase\" might also apply since tokens are being bought and shipped. Overall, focusing on shipment tracking is essential here.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm thinking about how to categorize this IT ticket related to tokens. \"Storage\" could apply if it's about storing, but it seems more focused on shipment. \"Internal Project\" might fit since it's related to an ongoing project, but I lean towards \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware\" since the tokens sound physical. The term \"token shipment\" suggests hardware items, and logging is often part of inventory management. Since it's about shipping hardware tokens, I think the best category would be \"Hardware.\"**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided on \"Hardware\" as the category for this ticket. I need to respond using the specified JSON format, which looks like this: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[...]}}}. The actual response should just be a valid JSON object, so I\u2019ll keep it simple. \n\nThe final output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I want to ensure it matches the required format precisely, without any extra text, so that's all I'll send back."
