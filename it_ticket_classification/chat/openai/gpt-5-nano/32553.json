It's definitely not about HR, Access, or Storage, but it does touch on inventory with \"restock adapters\" and \"test restock cables.\" Since the focus is on fixing and inspecting physical items like cables and remote controls, I think \"Internal Project\" fits best due to the large scope. However, \"Hardware\" could also work since it deals with replacing equipment.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
