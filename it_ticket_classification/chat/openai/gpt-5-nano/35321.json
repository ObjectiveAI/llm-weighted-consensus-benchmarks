It mentions slow notebook performance and loading issues after installation. This suggests it might involve performance after software installation, which makes me think it could be related to hardware. However, I need to consider that it might also need \"Administrative rights\" if installation permissions are a factor. The closest fit seems to be \"Hardware\" based on the mentioned slow performance.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out how to categorize the IT ticket, which mentions slow performance but not storage issues. I think \"Hardware\" fits best as it sounds like a performance issue with the notebook. The available categories don't include Software, so it can't fall under that. I'll format the response as a JSON object that contains the category, which will be like: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. However, there's a hint about installation that might imply \"Administrative rights,\" but I\u2019ll stick with \"Hardware\" for clarity.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
