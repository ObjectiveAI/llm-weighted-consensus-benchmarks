It looks like they\u2019re struggling with submitting entries due to an update that broke things, so the best category to choose might be \"Application/Software.\" I don't see that listed among the provided categories, but \"Storage\" could possibly fit. Hardware, HR Support, and others don\u2019t seem applicable here.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm thinking through the best category for this IT ticket. It relates to an Oracle issue with submitting timesheets, which ties into HR and payroll processes. The \"HR Support\" category fits well since it's about annual leave and timekeeping. While \"Miscellaneous\" is an option if things aren\u2019t clear, I believe \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate choice. I\u2019ll prepare the output as a JSON object with the category clearly defined.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
