It might fall under \"Access\" due to new starter access and forms, or \"HR Support\" since it involves onboarding tasks. There's also a chance it relates to \"Administrative rights\" if admin rights are requested, but the primary focus appears to be on access or HR support.**Deciding IT ticket classification**\n\nI'm looking at a ticket that mentions \"new starter february pm re starter form va officer february pm starter form ext.\" It's a bit unclear. \"VA\" could mean \"virtual assistant\" or even \"visa officer.\" \"Starter form\" usually relates to onboarding, and \"ext\" might indicate an extension. However, since it's mostly about onboarding and new access, I think the best fit for classification would be \"Access.\" This is because it likely involves user account creation and access rights for the new starter.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m narrowing down the category for the IT ticket, and it looks like \"Access\" is the best fit. Options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" and others just don't apply here. The user specifically asked for a category, so I need to stick to the required format, which is a simple JSON-like object. It needs to be structured correctly, so I'll return it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThis ensures everything is clear and follows the guidelines!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
