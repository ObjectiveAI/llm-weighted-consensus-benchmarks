The content suggests it relates to onboarding, which fits under \"HR Support.\" Although \"Onboarding\" isn't a category, \"HR Support\" seems apt. Other options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Miscellaneous\" don't fit well. \"Access\" could work if the request involved system access, but that isn\u2019t mentioned. So, I'll go with \"HR Support.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user's request involves a \"starter form,\" likely related to onboarding. They\u2019re asking for help with this form, which means we should categorize the IT ticket as \"HR Support,\" since it pertains to a new starter. I need to respond with a JSON object according to the schema provided. It specifically asks for a category, so I\u2019ll format my response as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I'll keep it brief and ensure it aligns with the enumerated category. Let's deliver that!"
