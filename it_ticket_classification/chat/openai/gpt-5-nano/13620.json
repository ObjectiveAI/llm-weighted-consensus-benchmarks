I need to decide among \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" since it doesn't strictly fall under any of the other categories provided.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm debating how to categorize this IT ticket. The description involves maintenance windows for updates on production servers, including downtime, testing, and rebooting the host OS. While \"Administrative rights\" came to mind due to the reboot mention, it doesn\u2019t request admin rights. \u201cMaintenance\u201d isn\u2019t an option. I\u2019m considering \"Miscellaneous\" for tickets that don't neatly fit anywhere, or potentially \"Internal Project.\" However, since it's just about monthly updates, I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous.\"{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
