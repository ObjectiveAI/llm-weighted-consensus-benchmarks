The ticket is about a request for a second monitor. It seems like it fits best in the \"Hardware\" category since it's about connecting a second monitor to the CPU. Although it could also be seen as a \"Purchase\" request, it's not explicitly asking to buy one. Therefore, I think \"Hardware\" is the most accurate category for this ticket.**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to respond with a category object formatted in JSON. The format requires a specific structure, with the \"category\" property being one of the enumerated types like \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" \n\nGiven that I\u2019ve determined the appropriate category is \"Hardware,\" I\u2019ll format my response simply as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nIt's important to stick to the required format, ensuring I adhere to the specification without overcomplicating things! So, I'll go with that straightforward response.**Finalizing category response**\n\nI need to ensure there\u2019s no extra punctuation or commentary in my response. I should also consider whether \"Tuesday December PM\" indicates a scheduling aspect, but the category will still remain \"Hardware.\" It\u2019s a straightforward request regarding the second monitor. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and finalize my response as follows:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"} \n\nThis keeps everything clear and to the point, just as it should be!"
