They\u2019re asking for a new category addition related to hosting and data storage services. The provided categories include things like Hardware, HR Support, and Storage. Given that the ticket mentions hosting and storage specifically, I think \u201cStorage\u201d is the most appropriate category for the ticket. Let's ensure we select the right one to streamline the process!**Deciding on category**\n\nIt seems this IT ticket is focused on hosting and data storage services. Considering that the provided options include \u201cStorage,\u201d this seems like the best fit. While it could potentially relate to an \u201cInternal Project\u201d due to the mention of adding a category, everything points to \u201cStorage\u201d being the primary concern here. So, I\u2019ll output the required JSON object in the format: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} with proper capitalization.**Confirming the category**\n\nLooking at the user\u2019s text, it mentions a \"new category addition\" focused on IT hosting and data storage services. While I briefly considered other categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" they don\u2019t seem to match well. \"Storage\" clearly stands out as the most appropriate choice here. Now, I\u2019ll ensure to respond with just the required JSON object to fit the developer\u2019s expected format, delivering only: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}."
