It\u2019s clearly dealing with HR and the hardware handover process, mentioning terms like \u201cfinal contract date\u201d and working arrangements. So, it involves both HR Support and Hardware aspects. The possible categories include \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support,\" so I should choose the most appropriate one. Since it focuses on the leaver process, \"HR Support\" seems to be the best fit.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm focusing on categorizing the ticket related to the leaver form and hardware handover. While it clearly involves HR tasks like the leaver form and contract date, it also discusses the hardware handover. The categories available include \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support.\" Given that the ticket emphasizes arranging hardware handover, I think \"Hardware\" could be the most fitting category. However, I also consider \"HR Support\" due to the leaver form aspect. Balancing both, I'll lean toward \"Hardware.\"**Choosing ticket category**\n\nThe repeated mention of \"leaver form\" leans towards categorizing this under HR. The content highlights aspects like the final contract date and arrangements for hardware handover tomorrow. It seems like IT is coordinating the return of hardware from an employee leaving. While I have options like \"HR Support\" and \"Hardware,\" I\u2019m inclined to go with \"Hardware\" primarily since it emphasizes the handover process. However, I wonder if proposing multiple categories would be safer. Ultimately, I\u2019ll choose \"Hardware\" for the JSON output."
