The phrasing is a bit unclear, especially with \"pm forms\u201d and \"write senior developer member.\" I\u2019m considering several categories: it could fit into \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" due to the focus on permissions. Alternatively, it might relate to \u201cHR Support\u201d since it's about onboarding a new member. \"Internal Project\" might work too, but \u201cHR Support\u201d seems most appropriate!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe content mentions \"new member on Wednesday\" and hints at a request for help with \"PM forms.\" It could relate to onboarding, with \"PM\" possibly meaning \"People Management\" or \"Project Management\" forms. This leads me to think about categorizing the IT ticket; it likely falls under \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" since it deals with onboarding and provisioning access. The phrasing suggests it might be linked to scheduling onboarding, so I\u2019ll categorize it accordingly.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nThe text mentions needing help with \"PM forms,\" possibly asking about writing them. The \"senior developer member\" could relate to adding someone to a mailing list or an access group. Given the available categories, \"Access\" seems to be the best fit for provisioning access for a new member. While \"Internal Project\" is another option, I\u2019ll just categorize it as \"Access\". I\u2019ll make sure to format it correctly in the expected JSON output.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
