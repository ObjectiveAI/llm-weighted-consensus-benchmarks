The ticket mentions phrases like \"speed test\" and \"access speeds,\" suggesting it\u2019s likely about network speed issues. From the list of categories \u2014 Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights \u2014 I think it fits best under \"Access,\" since it's related to connectivity issues. However, if the details are unclear, \"Miscellaneous\" might be a fallback option.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
