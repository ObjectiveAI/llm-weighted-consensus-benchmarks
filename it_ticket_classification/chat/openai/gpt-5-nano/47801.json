The mention of \"assigned items,\" \"load,\" and \"view cleared\" could imply inventory management or assets. I'm thinking it's likely an IT system issue with an application in Oracle. While \"Access\" could apply since clearing items is mentioned, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the best fit for IT tickets that don\u2019t fit neatly into other categories. However, there\u2019s no mention of login or permission concerns here.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
