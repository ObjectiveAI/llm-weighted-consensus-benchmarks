The content is about annual leave and HR-related concerns, so it fits under \"HR Support.\" \n\nI should format my response as JSON. Following the required schema, I'll output: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. That aligns with the given instructions, and that seems to be the right approach!**Finalizing the response format**\n\nI need to return the category as a JSON string. The correct format is {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. The instructions suggest that I should follow the exact schema provided. \n\nEven though previous tasks might have asked for a simple string like \"HR Support,\" the schema indicates an object format. It\u2019s safer to deliver the response as a JSON object. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll stick to that and produce: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}."
