This leads me to think it could be about a hardware device or perhaps some administrative rights. However, I'm leaning toward classifying it under \"Hardware\" since it relates to an installation event.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering categorizing the user\u2019s request, which involves logging an installation related to a \"back cover.\" They mentioned contacting an administrator by phone, so it seemed like it could be \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" but since \"Access\" isn\u2019t an option, \"Administrative rights\" is still on the table. After parsing the message, it seems to revolve around hardware installation, specifically a back cover. Given this context, I'll opt to categorize the ticket as \"Hardware.\"**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to respond with just the JSON format for the category. The instructions specify that I should categorize the IT ticket by providing a simple JSON object, like {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. There\u2019s no need for heavy formatting; it should be succinct and clear. Given that, I\u2019ll output only the necessary JSON object for clarity and precision. Here goes: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
