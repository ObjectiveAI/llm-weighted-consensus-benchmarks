The ticket content focuses on visitor cards, which connect to activation, deactivation, and updates. It seems to fit best under \"Access\" since it deals with access control. To follow the required format, I\u2019ll output a JSON object stating the category as follows: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This keeps everything straightforward and clear!**Outputting Category Format**\n\nI need to follow the specified format for categorizing the IT ticket. The guideline indicates that I should respond with a JSON-like structure, specifically for the \"category\" tag. The schema outlines the expected output, and it looks like I\u2019ll provide: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I should use \"Access\" with a capital A as stated. It's important to stick to the format closely, so I'll make sure no extra content gets included and keep it straightforward!"
