I need to figure out if it's about \"Administrative rights\" for a sheet. \"Reject sheet period\" could imply a Google Sheet, but it\u2019s unclear. \n\n\"Access\" might fit as it mentions \"reject\" access or \"schedule\" adjustments. \"Internal Project\" could also work if it's about a specific project. However, if nothing is clear, going with \"Miscellaneous\" seems safest!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
