The text discusses password change issues leading to connection problems with an application after updating the Active Directory password.

The most fitting category for this ticket appears to be \"Access.\" I\u2019m considering whether \"Administrative rights\" applies due to the password change privileges, but I think Access is the best choice.  \n\nI'll present the category as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"} according to the required format, ensuring there\u2019s no extra commentary in the output.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user is facing connection errors after changing their Active Directory password. This situation likely falls under \"Access\" because it relates to login issues rather than \"Administrative rights,\" which would pertain to system management permissions. Since the focus is on access rather than privileges, I can confidently determine that \"Access\" is the correct category for this ticket. It's straightforward and ensures we're capturing the right issue!"
