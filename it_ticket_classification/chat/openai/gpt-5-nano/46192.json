This ticket seems to be about \"annual leave requests,\" which connects to HR since it involves line manager approval. Given that the user is asking to categorize the ticket, I'll select \"HR Support\" as the appropriate category. Now, I\u2019ll format the response as a minimal JSON object.**Formatting category response**\n\nThe \"Valid channels\" indicate that I need to output a response in the format of a JSON-like object with the key \"category\" and its value. The user provided some messy text that points to sending annual leave requests, line manager approvals, and changing line managers, so \"HR Support\" fits best. The instruction is clear: categorize this IT Ticket, and I need to stick to the specified format without any extra commentary. So I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
