Analyzing the ticket content, it seems to focus on HR processes related to \"leaver letters,\" late submissions, and digital reminders. There's mention of deadlines and processing related to leaving dates and locations. Given these aspects, it likely falls under HR Support, but there might be elements related to Administrative rights as well.**Categorizing HR ticket**\n\nI've noticed mentions of being penalized for late submissions and issues around leaver letters, which definitely point to HR processes. The categories include \"HR Support,\" which seems fitting, whereas \"Administrative rights\" might not apply here. There's confusion about glitches in submissions and reminders. Ultimately, I'll classify this IT ticket as \"HR Support,\" given its strong HR focus. But, if it involves modifying permissions for form submissions, \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe message indicates that the form relates to a HR leaver process, likely for notifying HR about an employee's departure. The ticket suggests investigating a glitch affecting submissions and mentions possible penalties. There are clear references to reminders about submission actions and leaver details. Since this involves an HR administrative process impacted by an IT glitch, I'll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" I need to respond with a JSON object: {\"type\":\"category\",\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
