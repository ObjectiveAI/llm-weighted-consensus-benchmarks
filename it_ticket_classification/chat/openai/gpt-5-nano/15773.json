It might fit into \"HR Support\" for onboarding help, \"Access\" for accounts, or \"Hardware\" for equipment provisioning. Administrative rights could apply if it involves permissions. I need to decide!**Determining ticket categorization**\n\nThe request refers to equipment and mentions an equipment catalog link, suggesting they might be looking to order appropriately sized hardware. It connects with \"new starter\" indicating onboarding tasks. I think \"Hardware\" fits for provisioning new equipment, while \"HR Support\" could apply to onboarding forms. As it mentions \"re starter form,\" suggesting a focus on employee onboarding, I need to pick the best category from the options provided. The hardware aspect is key here!**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI believe I should categorize this ticket as \"Hardware\" since it mainly deals with equipment provisioning. Although \"Access\" could relate to login credentials and \"Purchase\" might apply when ordering equipment, the focus seems to be on checking the equipment catalog. Since the ticket also references onboarding forms like \"attached starter form,\" there's an \"HR Support\" angle. However, given the overall context, \"Hardware\" seems to be the most appropriate choice for the category.**Confirming category response**\n\nThe text clearly refers to an \"equipment catalogue\" and mentions something being \"too large heavy,\" which likely means heavy equipment. This points to hardware provisioning for a new starter, combined with the attached starter form. Therefore, I can confidently categorize this ticket as \"Hardware.\" \n\nNow, I just need to respond in the right format, ensuring no extra text is included. I\u2019ll output the JSON object as requested: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
