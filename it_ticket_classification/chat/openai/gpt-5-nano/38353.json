It looks like \u201cHardware\u201d is the most suitable category, but I\u2019m considering all options!**Classifying IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"Performance issues after upgrade,\" which suggests it could be hardware-related due to the PC performance issues. While it seems more software-focused, the best fit amongst the provided categories is likely \"Hardware,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Given the context of PC performance and restart times, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware.\" I should output the chosen category in the required JSON format: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}` and maybe add a short note for clarity!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
