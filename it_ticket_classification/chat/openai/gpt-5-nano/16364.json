There's no specific \"Facilities/Room Booking\" category, which is frustrating! The closest options are \"Administrative rights\" for room resource creation or \"Miscellaneous\" for general IT issues. The user's request is about creating a room in Outlook for Wednesday PM with specific capacity and overlaps, so it feels more aligned with resource creation. However, \"Administrative rights\" usually refers to user permissions. It's a bit tricky!**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nThe user is asking to create a room in Outlook, which involves provisioning rather than straightforward user access. I\u2019m considering categorizing it as \"Administrative rights,\" since creating a room mailbox is similar to other administrative tasks like creating user accounts. Alternatively, I could use \"Miscellaneous\" for vague requests, but given the specific nature of their request, \"Administrative rights\" seems appropriate. I'll go ahead and assign that category, including a brief rationale about provisioning a new resource in Outlook.**Formatting the output**\n\nI need to create the output in the required JSON format, which is an object with a property called \"category.\" For this case, I'll set it to \"Administrative rights,\" making sure to match the casing exactly, with a space and a lowercase 'rights'. \n\nSo, my output will be:  \n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}  \n\nThey only asked for categorization, so I should keep it simple and stick to the instruction that the output may be parsed by code. That makes sense!"
