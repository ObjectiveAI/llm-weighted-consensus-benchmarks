It seems like this might relate to permissions, perhaps administrative rights. I'm considering the user as the \"analyst\" and \"Access\" might fit as a category. If they're trying to delete documents uploaded by someone else, they may not have permission. I need to clarify if they need admin rights to delete these documents and categorize it under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Choosing ticket categories**\n\nI'm considering the categories for the user\u2019s request about not being able to delete documents uploaded by Yammer. \"Access\" seems appropriate, but \"Administrative rights\" could also be relevant if they lack the necessary permissions. Typically, IT tickets focus on \"Access\" for login or permission issues, but since this is about document deletion specifically, I might categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" under permissions. I need to decide which category best fits their situation based on the request details.**Formatting IT categorization**\n\nIn IT categorizations, there's a category for \"Administrative rights\" to request elevated privileges. Since the user seems unsure if they did something wrong, this category feels right for their issue. I should respond with a JSON object specifying the category. The proper format will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nI need to provide just this category object without any extra text since that aligns with the request for categorization. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and produce that JSON response."
