It looks like there's a problem with scanning a project and a server rejecting requests with an error code. I\u2019ll consider this information to determine the most fitting category for the ticket.**Identifying ticket category**\n\nI see there are mentions of tested credentials for web console access, but it seems there are potential issues with authentication tokens, like \"invalid token.\" The user referenced \"Apache Tomcat,\" indicating it\u2019s likely an access/authentication issue. Given the categories on hand\u2014like Hardware, Access, and Internal Project\u2014I think this ticket would fit best under \"Access\" due to the authentication problem. However, it could also relate to \"Internal Project\" since it pertains to a specific project. I\u2019ll frame the final answer in a JSON-like format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
