This task seems to relate to storage since \"snapshots\" suggests a backup context. Given the categories provided \u2014 like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others \u2014 I\u2019m leaning toward the \"Storage\" category, as it fits best. I need to structure my response as a JSON object. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.**Interpreting IT ticket details**\n\nThe ticket requests removing \"caps int\" and its snapshots, indicating that this likely pertains to a storage resource. The phrase \u201cplease create snapshot caps\u201d seems contradictory\u2014are they asking to create a snapshot while deleting? \n\nDespite the confusion, it appears the primary focus is on storage operations involving snapshots. Thus, categorizing this ticket as \"Storage\" seems fitting. I\u2019ll structure my output as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
