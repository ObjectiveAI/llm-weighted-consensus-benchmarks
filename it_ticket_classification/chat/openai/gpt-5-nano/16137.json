I'll carefully review the ticket text to see which category best fits. It's important to select the right category so that the ticket gets to the right team for efficient resolution. Let's make sure I\u2019m being precise with this classification process!The user provided a lengthy sentence, likely detailing a feature request. It mentions adding a new issue type for project management, specifically concerning candidates. It seems they're asking to activate an option that would allow including specific candidate information, summary details, and labels for different disciplines. Also, there are references to issues concerning core skills, grades, and interview statuses. This suggests they\u2019re looking for improvements to a project management system focused on candidate tracking.It looks like the user has provided details about a ticket related to a recruitment or HR system integration, possibly with an issue tracker like Jira. The fields mentioned cover candidates, interviews, hiring statuses, and core skills, indicating an HR focus. Given the request to categorize the IT ticket, it seems to fit best under \"HR Support,\" but it could also be categorized as \"Internal Project\" if it relates to customizing issue types within their internal system. It definitely isn't about hardware, storage, or access.The category options include \"Internal Project,\" which seems relevant since it's about system customization. The content focuses on HR recruitment aspects like candidates and interview stages. However, the user asked specifically to categorize the IT ticket, not just to analyze it. The best fit appears to be between \"HR Support\" and \"Internal Project.\" Since this ticket relates to adding a new issue type for tracking HR recruitment, I think \"Internal Project\" might be the most suitable category here.The available categories include \"HR Support,\" but the ticket is about configuring a new issue type for tracking candidates in a project management tool. It's more focused on IT configuration than strictly HR support. Since the user is asking to categorize the ticket, I think \"Internal Project\" best fits the context. I\u2019ll prepare the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This matches the required format without any extra commentary. I\u2019ll ensure it\u2019s clean and straightforward."
