There\u2019s no clear mention of hardware or access rights. I wonder if it fits better in \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Internal Project.\" Since it has location references, it might lean towards being an internal project. I\u2019ll need to consider my options!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize this IT ticket, considering it's about \"installation.\" It suggests a service is required, possibly leading to \"Purchase,\" but that doesn't fit. \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Hardware\" don\u2019t apply either. Maybe it\u2019s asking for \"Administrative rights,\" but that\u2019s unclear. \"Internal Project\" could work if it relates to a project in a specific district, but it\u2019s so vague. Ultimately, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the safest choice since it covers the ambiguity here.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with the correct JSON category format since the user asked me to categorize the IT ticket. The required output is a JSON object containing a \"category\" field. I see the list of categories provided. It looks like I should return something like: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. While the user may want justification, it seems they just need the category itself without any extra text. So, I\u2019ll keep it simple and provide: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}."
