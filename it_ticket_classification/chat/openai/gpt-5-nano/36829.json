The predefined categories I can choose from are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the issue seems related to the career section, I think the best fit could be \"HR Support.\" I'll structure the response as a JSON object with the selected category.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering that \"HR Support\" might be the right category because the ticket mentions the \"career section\" and \"feedback,\" suggesting it relates to HR or a career portal. The phrase \"missing people\" likely refers to missing entries in this section. It seems the user is asking to add people and can request feedback. While \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could fit, \"HR Support\" seems most appropriate given the context about adding entries to a career directory.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
