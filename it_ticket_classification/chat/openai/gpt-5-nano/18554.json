The message mentions a \"new starter\" and a starter form that needs to be filled out. That makes me think it could relate to onboarding, which typically involves access provisioning. So, I'm considering \"Access\" as a potential category, but it might also fit under \"HR Support\" since it's dealing with human resources. I'll choose one definitive category for this ticket.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing this IT ticket as \"Access\" because the starter form relates to onboarding and access provisioning. However, \"HR Support\" is also a valid option since it deals with personnel matters. The ticket mentions both \"new starter\" and \"former employee,\" which could imply offboarding. Still, given the focus on the starter form, which includes granting access and accounts, categorizing it as \"Access\" seems like the best choice."
