The options are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the ticket addresses mailbox storage issues, it should fit under \"Storage.\" The ticket is likely for Exchange, which clarifies this further. I\u2019m preparing to respond with a JSON object that just has the category, so it\u2019ll look like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. No extra text is necessary; just JSON.**Confirming Category**\n\nI see that the ticket repeatedly mentions terms like \"mailbox almost full,\" \"increase space,\" and \"delete items.\" This definitely reinforces that the correct category is \"Storage.\" I\u2019ll go ahead and finalize that response since it aligns perfectly with the issue at hand. It\u2019s important to make this clear in the ticket, so I'll respond without any extra details \u2014 just stick to the category. Let\u2019s wrap this up!"
