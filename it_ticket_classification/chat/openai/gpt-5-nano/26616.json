The text points towards \"cooling pad request,\" which aligns with the Hardware category since it's a device. It might also fit under Purchase, given that the user is asking for it to be provided. However, it seems more fitting for Hardware as it refers to a specific accessory. Overall, either Hardware or Purchase categories will work, but Hardware feels more accurate.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm deciding on the appropriate category for the IT ticket about a cooling pad request. Since it's specifically described as a cooling pad, it points to the Hardware category, which fits requests for hardware items. There's also a Purchase category, but in this case, Hardware is more accurate for this accessory. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object indicating the category: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It seems important to follow the prompt format, so I'll stick to that structure.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
