It seems like the main topic is about editing and access rights. Keywords like \"editing rights,\" \"old site,\" and \"upload files\" appear frequently. I think the best fit would be either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since both seem relevant. It's interesting that they're listed separately \u2014 I wonder how to determine which is more appropriate?**Identifying category for IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket discusses \"editing rights\" and \"administrative rights.\" Given that \"editing rights\" implies access to edit content, I'm considering how to categorize the IT ticket properly. \"Access\" seems fitting for general user permissions. However, \"Administrative rights\" might be more appropriate if the request pertains to managing these editing privileges. It\u2019s tricky without more context, though! The specific usage of \u201cediting rights\u201d could also align better with \"Access\" instead of \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d More information would help clarify!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket seems to be mainly about editing rights related to a new PM LA testing site. I need to categorize it, leaning towards \"Access\" since it involves permissions for editing and uploading files. However, \"Administrative rights\" could indicate more technical actions, but it might not apply here. Since the emphasis is on access control, \"Access\" feels like the safer option. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object to meet the requirements. \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
