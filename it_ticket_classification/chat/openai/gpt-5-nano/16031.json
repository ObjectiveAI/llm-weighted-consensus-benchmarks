I need to respond in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I want to stick to the instruction and avoid unnecessary explanations, so I'll keep it straightforward.**Confirming category selection**\n\nI'm going to provide the category as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It seems the system requires the response to be one of the specified categories, and \"Purchase\" fits best here. I considered if \"Hardware\" might apply because it's about a mouse purchase, but the ticket focuses on a new purchase order and receipts, making \"Purchase\" the more accurate choice. So, I'll go ahead and respond with {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Sounds good!"
