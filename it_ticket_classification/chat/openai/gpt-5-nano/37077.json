They mentioned something about \"old is not working\" and \"forms infrastructure view ribbon\". I think I should consider whether this relates to software issues with Microsoft Forms. It might fall under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access,\" depending on the context. I need to choose the most suitable category for this ticket based on the user\u2019s vague wording.**Categorizing IT Ticket Options**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out the best category for the IT ticket related to \"forms infrastructure view ribbon.\" The user\u2019s mention of \"forms\" might indicate a product like Microsoft Forms, but our categories don\u2019t specifically list software or applications. The closest options are \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Access.\" If it\u2019s about an internal project, I might choose \"Internal Project.\" If it relates to software issues, then \"Miscellaneous\" could work better. I should suggest the category in a JSON format.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI'm confirming the JSON format required for the category. The tool specifies that I must respond with a structure that features a \"category\" field. Given the context of \"forms infrastructure view ribbon\" and considering it isn't a hardware or storage issue, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the most appropriate label. While \"Internal Project\" could be relevant, the general nature of the user's request leads me to think \"Miscellaneous\" fits better. So, I\u2019ll format my response correctly: \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
