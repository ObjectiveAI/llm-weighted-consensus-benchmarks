The possible categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nUpon parsing, keywords stand out like \"new purchase,\" \"PO,\" and \"log installation.\" This indicates it likely falls under \"Purchase\" or possibly \"Administrative rights.\" The content seems primarily related to purchases and installation, which helps narrow it down.**Finalizing category response**\n\nGiven that the ticket is about a new purchase order, receipts, and installation, I think categorizing it as \"Purchase\" is the right call. The system's instructions mention that I need to respond in a specific JSON format. \n\nI'll format my output exactly as required: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. I need to be careful to provide just that, without any additional text or quotes. While \"Administrative rights\" was a consideration, it seems clearer to stick with \"Purchase\" as the category."
