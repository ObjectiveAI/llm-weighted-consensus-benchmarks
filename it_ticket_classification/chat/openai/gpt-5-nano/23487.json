The message suggests this is related to onboarding a new employee. Hmm, since \u201cnew starter\u201d implies HR involvement and there\u2019s mention of attached documents, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"HR Support.\" However, there's also the possibility of it relating to \"Administrative rights\" due to potential provisioning needs. Let\u2019s go with \"HR Support\" as the primary category.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm categorizing an IT ticket about a new starter. It could fit \"Access\" for setting up user access or \"Administrative rights\" for granting permissions. The message mentions scheduling for a new starter and an attached joiners list, indicating it\u2019s related to onboarding. Since onboarding tasks typically involve HR, I\u2019m leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the primary category. The mention of \"joiners\" suggests it could connect to account setup, but it\u2019s primarily an onboarding request.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nIn typical IT ticket triage, tasks for new starters often fall under \"Access\" for account provisioning or \"HR Support\" for onboarding. Since the ticket mentions a new starter and includes an attached joiners list, it suggests administrative tasks, but that category isn't listed. I believe \"HR Support\" fits for onboarding. However, since this is an IT ticket, I lean towards \"Access\" since it relates directly to enabling accounts for new employees. I'll format the response as a JSON object with \"Access.\"**Delivering Category Response**\n\nI need to keep my response straightforward and not overspecify. The instruction asks to categorize the IT ticket, so I should simply provide the category. The required format is JSON-like, so I\u2019ll format my response as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. While I could include a brief rationale, the instructions don\u2019t require it, so I\u2019ll stick to just delivering the category in that specified format. Alright, I\u2019m ready to go!"
