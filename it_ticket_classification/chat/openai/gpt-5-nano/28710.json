I think it fits best under \"Internal Project\" since it relates to managing project tasks. \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" may not apply here.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"project management,\" including tabs and a query about changing the tab menu. This isn't related to hardware, HR, access, storage, purchase, or administrative rights. It seems to fit best as an \"Internal Project\" category, likely related to a UI feature request. After categorizing, I need to format the response in JSON to show the category. I'll ensure it reflects the required structure for the final output.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nThe provided category schema indicates that I should respond with a JSON object containing the property \"category.\" Given the discussion around the ticket, I\u2019ll set the value to \"Internal Project.\" So, the output should be structured as:  {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. \n\nI need to ensure the formatting is precise since it needs to follow the schema. This minimalist approach works well, and I\u2019ll include a brief justification in my response to clarify that \"Internal Project\" is the appropriate category based on the ticket content."
