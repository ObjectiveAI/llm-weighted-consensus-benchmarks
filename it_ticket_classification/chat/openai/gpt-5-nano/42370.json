This points to a need for admin rights to modify the hosts file. Then there's the part about the broken survey link, which puzzles me as it might fit under \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" However, given the emphasis on admin rights, categorizing the ticket primarily under \"Administrative rights\" seems the most fitting. But I also need to address the broken survey link. It's a bit chaotic!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing this IT ticket as \"Administrative rights.\" The main issue revolves around the hosts file needing admin rights and the problem of modifications not persisting. Even though there's mention of logging a ticket for a broken survey link, which isn\u2019t about admin rights, the core concern is indeed the access rights. I\u2019ll provide the answer in the required JSON format without any extra text. Here goes:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
