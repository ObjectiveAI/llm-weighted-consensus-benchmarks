They\u2019re asking about an issue related to absence form generation after requesting annual leave, mentioning a populated template. From my analysis, these keywords indicate a connection to HR processes. Among the ticket categories, \"HR Support\" seems to be the best fit. It could be \"Administrative rights,\" but that doesn't really apply here. \"Access\" isn't relevant since it's about forms, and \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option if it's unclear.**Categorizing an IT Ticket**\n\nThis ticket is focused on the absence form generation issue. I feel like \"HR Support\" is a suitable category since it involves HR processes. However, it might also relate to \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The ticket mentions absence form generation and a template doc, suggesting some automation, although the grammar is a bit messy. Since it ultimately relates to absence forms and annual leave, I'll go with \"HR Support\" for categorization.**Outputting IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe category for this ticket seems to fit as \"HR Support\" since it's about absence form generation, which is definitely related to HR processes. Although I considered \"Internal Project,\" the main issue revolves around the problem with sending \u201ccc\u201d and the absence form. The user likely needs a JSON object for the category. So, based on the instructions, I'll respond with just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That should fit the requirements!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
