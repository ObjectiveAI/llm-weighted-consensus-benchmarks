It mentions \"request for access oracle,\" which makes me think it fits into the Access category. However, there\u2019s also the term \"Administrative rights\" included. Since the request is specifically about access to an Oracle system, I lean towards classifying it under Access rather than Administrative rights, even though they are separate categories. That's my thought process here!**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize a request about access to Oracle. It might fit under Access, but there's also mention of \"Administrative rights\" for higher privileges. The text is a bit messy and possibly multilingual; phrases like \"la tool si ca va\" seem to suggest some mix of languages. Nevertheless, the main focus is on the \"request for access oracle.\" So, it makes sense to categorize it as Access. I'll format this as a JSON object for the output.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
