The categories I can choose from are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket content mentions \"decommissioning\" and \"cost estimate,\" which makes me think it's likely related to hardware, storage, or an internal project. Since it seems focused on a decommissioning project, \"Internal Project\" appears to be the most fitting category.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m sorting out the best category for the IT ticket. The terms \u201cdecommissioning\u201d and \u201ccost estimate\u201d suggest it\u2019s linked to a project, which leads me to categorize it under \"Internal Project.\" While \u201cStorage\u201d could apply if it were specifically about decommissioning storage, it seems broader. I need to ensure I respond with the correct JSON format, specifically: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. There\u2019s no need for extra commentary; I'll keep it straightforward."
