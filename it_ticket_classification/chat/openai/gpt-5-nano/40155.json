This suggests it should fall under the \"Access\" category, as it relates to permissions or authentication for documents.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the ticket's focus on document access issues, including upload problems. While I briefly thought about \"Storage,\" it's more about access than storage itself. Given the available categories, \"Access\" fits best since the main concern is accessing and opening documents. \n\nI\u2019ll prepare the response as a JSON object. The required output format specifies a category field, so I'll present it like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
