The report isn't working properly, showing errors and taking a long time to process. It seems to be linked to a shared custom report not returning information, and the same problem occurs with a secured report. Since it\u2019s clearly an application issue, it seems more fitting for a \"Software\" category rather than \"Hardware\" or \"Access,\" even though \"Software\" isn\u2019t listed.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering the best category for this IT ticket. It seems to fit \"Access\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous\" because it's about reporting permissions. They mention issues with a secured report, a shared custom report, and an absence report, asking for a high-priority investigation. Access rights seem relevant, as there's a potential permissions issue. Since \"Access\" is indeed a category in the list, I'll classify it as such. Now, I need to provide the output in a structured JSON format.**Providing the JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object for category classification. The allowed categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the relevant category is \"Access,\" I\u2019ll format it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The system expects this specific JSON structure. I might wonder if I should include a note, but since the instructions emphasize the JSON format, I\u2019ll stick to providing just the JSON output, ensuring the capitalization is exactly right."
