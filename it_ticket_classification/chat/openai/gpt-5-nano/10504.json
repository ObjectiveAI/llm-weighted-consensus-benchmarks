The ticket mentions \"access to Tuesday PM\" and \"file named statements per path banks.\" This makes me think it's related to access permissions. It could involve access rights to a folder or a specific schedule. The two potential categories are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Both seem plausible, but I'll lean toward \"Access\" since it emphasizes permissions without any indication of admin-level tasks.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the categorization of an IT ticket. The request seems focused on accessing specific files, and \"access to Tuesday PM\" could refer to a calendar event or shared files. The phrase \"file named statements per path banks\" is a bit confusing, but it looks like it's about accessing files. Given that the request doesn't specify administrative rights but just access, \"Access\" is the most fitting category. I'll structure my response in a JSON format as instructed.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
