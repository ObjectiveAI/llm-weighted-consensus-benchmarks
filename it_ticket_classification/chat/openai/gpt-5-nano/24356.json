The ticket seems to be about accessing reports related to an upcoming release. It touches on various aspects like report layout, upload procedures, and repository storage, which makes it a bit confusing. I\u2019m considering whether to classify it under \"Access\" due to its focus on permissions or possibly \"Storage\" since it involves report storage locations. \"Administrative rights\" might also fit if it\u2019s about permissions.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket details which include terms like \"granted SP site provided reports upload,\" and \"view ribbon,\" hinting it revolves around access and the storage of reports. Since there isn't a \"Reports\" category, I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the primary category because it emphasizes gaining permissions for reports. Although \"Storage\" might also fit due to mentions of repository locations, it\u2019s more about providing access. I need to respond with the correct JSON-like structure for the category. So, I\u2019ll go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
