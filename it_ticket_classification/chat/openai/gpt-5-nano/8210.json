I\u2019m weighing between the categories of \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or maybe even \"Internal Project.\" I need to determine which of these best fits their request!**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket relates to access for planning and the ability to upload and manage requests to accept or decline. This suggests it involves permissions for a planning module. It could fall under \"Administrative rights\" since the user is asking for functions typically tied to admin actions, like approving or denying requests. While \"Access\" is more general, \"Administrative rights\" is specific to modifying permissions and handling these tasks. Given the user\u2019s need, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Administrative rights.\"**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI need to create a JSON object with the category set to \"Administrative rights\" based on the schema given. The format requires me to output a JSON representation like: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. Since the instruction tells me to categorize the IT ticket, I'll focus on just that field. I should ensure \"Administrative rights\" is exactly correct with proper spacing. I\u2019ll respond with just the categorized JSON, avoiding any extra explanation. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll produce:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
