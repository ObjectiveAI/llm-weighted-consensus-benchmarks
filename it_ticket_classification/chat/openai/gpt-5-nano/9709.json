It seems to focus on submitting forms, which suggests it's HR-related. Given the context, the \"HR Support\" category seems the most fitting. Although it\u2019s an IT ticket, \"HR Support\" is also one of the valid categories for classification here. Let's go with that choice.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI see that the request involves submitting leaver forms and a timecard, but there isn't a clear IT problem listed. It seems more HR-related, pointing towards the \"HR Support\" category since it's about HR processes. Although it could also hint at \"Administrative rights\" if it concerns access to fill forms. The user asked to categorize this IT ticket, so I just need to return the JSON with the appropriate category. I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support\" for the output.**Finalizing the response**\n\nI need to be concise while ensuring I return the correct output. In this case, I\u2019ll output the JSON format as required. So, I'll just provide: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That seems straightforward and fits the user\u2019s request perfectly. I'm ready to finalize this and get it sent!"
