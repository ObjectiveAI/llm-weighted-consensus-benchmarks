The user's request seems to revolve around annual leave, approvals, and issues related to flow in a system. It relates closely to HR processes, so \"HR Support\" looks like the best fit. \"Administrative rights\" may also apply since it seems to involve permission aspects regarding leave approval.**Categorizing leave approval workflow**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing an IT ticket related to the leave approval workflow. Since it involves leave, \"HR Support\" feels like the best category, although \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could apply too. Specifically, it seems focused on annual leave approvals. The phrase \"remove as annual leave\" suggests someone might want to take away a leave request, but it still connects to HR. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object, which should look like: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} in accordance with the guidelines.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
