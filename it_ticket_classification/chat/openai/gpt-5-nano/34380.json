The ticket discusses hardware issues, specifically about replacing a broken monitor. While it could fit in the \"Purchase\" category since they're requesting a new monitor, the focus seems to be more on replacing the broken hardware. I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Hardware\" given the context of needing a functional monitor.**Deciding on category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT ticket. The user mentions needing a new monitor, which leans towards a purchase, but the old monitor's malfunction indicates a hardware issue. Since this request is for monitor replacement, it aligns best with the \"Hardware\" category. Even though \"Purchase\" is also relevant, categorizing this as \"Hardware\" seems more appropriate. So, I'll go with that and produce the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe prompt clearly states I need to provide a JSON object with a \"category\" field. The allowed categories include \"Hardware,\" which fits well with the issue being discussed. Since my task is to categorize the IT ticket, I\u2019ll prepare to respond with a straightforward JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I must ensure it's formatted correctly and keep it free of any extra text or analysis. This meets the requirements perfectly!"
