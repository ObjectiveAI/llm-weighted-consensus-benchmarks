The text clearly mentions a \"new purchase\" and items like a headset, mouse, and cables. It also refers to logging installation and mandatory receipts, which suggests it's all about purchasing hardware and the related processes. Given the mention of \"purchase order,\" it seems like the \"Purchase\" category fits best since the focus is on acquiring hardware items and managing installation.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve thought through the categories again after checking the details. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" don\u2019t apply here. \"Hardware\" might relate to installation, but the main focus is on the \"new purchase\" with \"po\" and the mention of mandatory receipts. Therefore, the \"Purchase\" category seems the most fitting. I need to return the classification in a JSON format as specified, ensuring the spelling and capitalization are correct. So, I\u2019ll output:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
