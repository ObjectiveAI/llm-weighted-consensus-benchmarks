The allowed categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and a few others. I notice mentions of \"pre natal,\" \"post natal,\" and \"leave,\" which likely indicate it's related to maternity leave. So, given these clues, \"HR Support\" seems to be the best fit for this ticket based on its content about leave management.**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON category object for the IT ticket categorization request. The prompt indicates we should provide a specific category format, and the allowed categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. Since \"HR Support\" is the suitable choice based on the previous thoughts, I\u2019ll format my response like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. \n\nI want to keep it concise without additional explanations since the user just needs the category object. So, I'll deliver that straightforward response."
