They mention \"not working,\" which suggests it's related to network connectivity. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Access\" for network access, but it could also relate to \"Administrative rights\" if it\u2019s about permissions. Ultimately, it seems to best fit in the \"Access\" category due to the clear indication of a connectivity issue. I'll create the appropriate JSON object for that.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nConsidering the user's ticket, the \"Access\" category feels like the most appropriate choice, especially since they're experiencing connection issues. It could have been \"Miscellaneous,\" but there\u2019s a clear focus on access concerns. My output will simply be a JSON object indicating this category. I\u2019ll format it correctly as {\"category\":\"Access\"}, which fits the required standards. I want to make sure I provide the requested format without any extra notes, so I\u2019ll stick to just the category output.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
