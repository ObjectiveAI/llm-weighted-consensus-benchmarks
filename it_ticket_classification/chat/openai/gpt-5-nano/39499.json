There are mentions of disabling a blocker and issues with functionality in Chrome and Internet Explorer. I think it fits best under \"HR Support,\" given the context of leave days. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as JSON-like format with a key \"category\" and assign the value \"HR Support.\" This structure should clarify the classification!**Determining IT Bug Category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at an IT bug ticket related to an application showing annual leave days, probably part of an HR system. The ticket requests to \"cross check available annual leave days.\" It mentions disabling a blocker, which could imply it\u2019s a bug report. Since it does discuss HR information, \"HR Support\" seems to be the best fit. This categorization aligns well with the user's need and the nature of the issue!**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object categorizing the ticket as \"HR Support.\" There's a specific format that requires the response to follow the schema: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[ ... ]}}}. However, my final answer will focus on the category itself using the required format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I just want to make sure I keep it concise and relevant without adding extra commentary. So, here it is: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
