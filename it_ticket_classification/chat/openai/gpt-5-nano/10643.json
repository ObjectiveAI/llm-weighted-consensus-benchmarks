It seems relevant to both \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase\" due to the mention of specifications and costs. Considering this is from a senior developer, it might fit \"Internal Project\" too. I want to pick the most fitting category to ensure the user receives appropriate support. Let's choose wisely!**Parsing IT ticket details**\n\nLet's break down the message: it talks about a quad-core requirement and related costs. \"Quad-core\" makes me think it falls under \"Hardware,\" while the cost discussions hint at \"Purchase.\" I really need to determine the best single category. If the focus is on hardware specs, \"Hardware\" is the way to go, but since cost is mentioned, \"Purchase\" might fit too. However, since it primarily concerns hardware, I think I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\"**Formatting category response**\n\nI see that the task specifies formatting as a JSON object, with \"category\" as the type. The allowed categories include \"Hardware,\" among others. Based on this, I'll construct a response in the required format. My understanding is that the correct JSON should simply state {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It looks like I won\u2019t need the additional object layer. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and provide just that concise output."
