The description mentions problems with adding an address and a recurrent issue when reaching a step. It seems related to Outlook, so maybe it's an \"Access\" issue? However, it could also be \"Miscellaneous\" since the description is quite ambiguous. It definitely doesn't fit under hardware, storage, purchase, HR, internal projects, or administrative rights. I\u2019ll decide between \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Analyzing Outlook issue**\n\nThe user describes an Outlook issue, specifically mentioning difficulty with adding an address. It's unclear whether they\u2019re trying to add an email to a contact list, address book, or distribution list. The phrase \"recurrent issue whenever reached step\" suggests trouble at a specific point in the process. Given the categories, it seems to fit \"Miscellaneous,\" but if it's about permissions, \"Access\" might be more suitable. I\u2019m weighing the options to categorize accurately.**Categorizing Outlook issue**\n\nThe user seems to be facing an issue with the Outlook email client and adding an address. Although they didn't mention any permissions problems directly, the step they're struggling with could relate to \"Contacts.\" This suggests it aligns with a broad \"Outlook issue,\" likely categorizing under \"Miscellaneous\" in the IT ticket taxonomy. According to the format required, I\u2019ll output a JSON object specifically containing the category, which will be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Let's proceed with just that!"
