This could relate to updating a field, possibly in procurement or finance. There's also a mention of \"analyst\" at the end. The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Given the context of financing and purchasing, I think it most likely fits into the \"Purchase\" category.**Clarifying IT ticket category**\n\nThe phrase \"financed by Friday pm\" might suggest updating a field, and \"new value for financed by\" indicates a data update. The relevant categories don\u2019t seem to include \"Finance,\" making \"Purchase\" the closest fit, as it relates to financing. Although \"Internal Project\" could apply if it's about a project. Since the content isn't very clear, it might be wise to ask the user for clarification, but I need to provide a category based on what I have.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
