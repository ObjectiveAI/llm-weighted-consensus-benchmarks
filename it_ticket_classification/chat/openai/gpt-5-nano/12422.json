The user's text talks about a password reset, which is urgent since the user mentions it expires today. Looking at the categories, \"Access\" seems the best fit because the words indicate they're having trouble accessing something due to a configuration problem. It makes sense that the urgency around a password reset aligns with the \"Access\" category. So, I'll classify it as \"Access.\"**Outputting JSON category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to provide a JSON-like object with the \"category\" field. According to the instructions, I must output just the JSON without any extra text. I think \"Access\" is the appropriate category since it's a password reset request and it's urgent. Although I'm considering if \"Administrative rights\" might fit too, it seems the ticket relates more to accessing the system. So, I'll go with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
