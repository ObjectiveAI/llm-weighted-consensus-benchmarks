It looks like this fits best under \u201cHR Support\u201d since it involves employee onboarding. I also considered \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" because they might need access provisions, but the focus on filling out the starter form suggests it's primarily an HR-related task. So, I\u2019ll lean towards classifying it as \"HR Support.\"**Selecting the Right Category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for the IT ticket about a new starter needing help with a form. It seems to fit under \u201cHR Support\u201d because it relates to onboarding and HR processes. The message doesn't mention hardware or access directly; it just asks for help with a form. While \"Administrative rights\" could be possible if access is needed, it isn't explicit. So, I'll go with \"HR Support\" and respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI need to create a JSON object based on the system's category schema, which includes predefined categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. I\u2019ve decided to categorize this as \"HR Support\" since it suits the request. It's important to make sure I provide valid JSON, so I\u2019ll keep it concise without any extra commentary. The final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Let\u2019s proceed with that!"
