While \u201cSoftware\u201d isn\u2019t an option, it seems this ticket needs to fit under \"Miscellaneous,\" since that's likely the best match for this type of software-related issue.**Categorizing IT issue**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating the best category for this IT ticket. While \"Access\" could apply due to calendar and meeting room availability, the ticket is more about a general IT issue, so \"Miscellaneous\" seems to fit best. The other categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"HR Support\" don\u2019t apply here. Ultimately, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON output that specifies the category as \"Miscellaneous\" since it captures the essence of the issue. Let\u2019s make sure it\u2019s output correctly!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
