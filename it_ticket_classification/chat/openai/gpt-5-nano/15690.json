The appropriate categories to consider are \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" Since it appears to be a request for an additional keyboard, I'm leaning toward labeling it as \"Hardware.\" However, it could also fit under \"Purchase\" if it's specifically about procuring hardware. I'll go with \"Hardware\" as it\u2019s more direct for a request like this.**Returning JSON Object**\n\nI see that we need to return a JSON object with a \"category\" field. The required format specifies an object type with properties. I think I should include \"category\": \"Hardware\" since it's about a keyboard, which is indeed hardware. It could also fall under \"Purchase\" if it's about ordering, but given the context, \"Hardware\" fits best. \n\nSo, the final output should be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI\u2019m ready to deliver that!"
