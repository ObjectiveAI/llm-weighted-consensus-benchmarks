Still, \"Access\" is relevant too, as it deals with granting or changing approvals. Ultimately, \"Administrative rights\" feels like the best match here.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket, leaning towards \"Access\" since it deals with user access to the approval flow. However, \"Administrative rights\" fits better for requests related to modifying admin privileges, like granting admin rights. The ticket talks about \"removing supplier contracts flow\" and replacing approvers, suggesting a need for access rights in workflow configuration. While \"Internal Project\" could apply if it were part of a project, it\u2019s not explicit here. I\u2019ll choose \"Administrative rights\" and format the response in JSON.**Formatting IT Ticket Response**\n\nThe instruction simply asks me to categorize the IT ticket without needing an explanation. It specifies that I should use a JSON format for the output. So, I'll ensure to use the exact category string \"Administrative rights.\" I just need to keep it straightforward and provide that JSON response. Here's how it will look: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. Nice and clean!"
