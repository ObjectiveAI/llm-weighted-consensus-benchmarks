The user mentions they can't open any documents, indicating it could relate to Access or maybe Miscellaneous. Since there's a software issue with document access, my best guess is it falls under Access, but I wish I had the specific error message to confirm this more accurately.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nAccess seems to fit best for the description \u201ccannot open documents,\u201d as it points to an access issue with files. While it could also relate to Storage, it\u2019s more about devices. Given that typical ticket categories often include access issues, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" \n\nNow, I\u2019ll craft a JSON response with the necessary format: it will contain the category field as requested. I'll ensure it follows the schema provided! So, the response will be a simple JSON object with category: \"Access.\"**Outputting category JSON**\n\nI'll be outputting the category as a JSON object, specifically: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. There's no need for extra text since the instruction wasn't explicit on that. \n\nI need to make sure that my quotes and braces are correct. Since the schema clearly indicates this should be JSON, I'll go ahead and provide just that. Even though there could be other category considerations, \"Access\" seems the most accurate for the situation described. So, I'll respond with the JSON object only."
