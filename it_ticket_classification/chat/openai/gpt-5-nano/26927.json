The text seems to be about \"new starter tower,\" which possibly implies onboarding a new employee. The part about \"disable accounts change status per attached forms\" suggests they want to disable intern accounts. The reference to \"interns testing discipline accepted\" seems a bit incoherent, but it hints at something related to \"tester\" accounts. I'll need to clarify this further.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the IT ticket and it seems the user might want to disable accounts or change statuses based on attached forms. The phrase \"new starter tower\" probably refers to a desktop PC for a new employee. It probably concerns onboarding and disabling intern accounts until they officially become employees. \n\nConsidering the categories we have, \u201cAccess\u201d fits best because it relates to account disabling. Additionally, I\u2019ll note that JSON format for the output should include {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Following output format**\n\nIt looks like I need to adhere to a specific output format for the JSON object. The schema indicates I should respond with an object that includes a \"category.\" Based on the earlier thought, I determined that \"Access\" is the right category. \n\nTo stay compliant with the instructions, I'll format my response strictly as {\"category\":\"Access\"} without adding any extra text. This way, I'm following the guidelines clearly and safely."
