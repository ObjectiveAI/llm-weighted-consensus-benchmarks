It could be \u201cStorage\u201d too, but I\u2019ll go with \u201cAccess\u201d as it fits best.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on the user's request for share credentials to upload files. This clearly indicates a need for access management, so \"Access\" seems to be the best fit. I should output the category in the required JSON format.\n\nThe correct response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. \n\nWhile the user didn't ask for additional details, I might consider adding a brief note for clarity, but the primary focus remains on providing the JSON object as instructed.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
