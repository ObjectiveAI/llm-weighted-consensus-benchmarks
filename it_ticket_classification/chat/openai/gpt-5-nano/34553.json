The user mentions troubles logging in and modifying their leave hours. This seems more related to HR support rather than hardware or any other categories like purchasing or storage. While there might be a hint of access since it involves logging in, it's clearly an HR-related problem due to the focus on annual leave. So, assigning it to \"HR Support\" makes the most sense.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user is trying to log their annual leave hours but is facing issues with their leave balance. This clearly falls under HR or absence management, making \"HR Support\" the right category. I see that \"HR Support\" is indeed included in the list of allowed categories, so that's perfect. I need to return a JSON-like object containing this category. Therefore, I will respond with the exact format required: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`."
