Since it involves requesting a laptop, \"Hardware\" seems like the best fit, while \"Purchase\" might apply if it includes ordering. Let's go with \"Hardware\" for this!**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nThe request mentions a \"laptop for our guest visiting today,\" indicating it\u2019s primarily about hardware provision. The text also talks about \"ordering\" and \"connecting,\" suggesting a secondary aspect related to \"Purchase.\" However, since I need to pick just one category, I believe \"Hardware\" is best. While there might be a connection access requirement, the main focus is on providing a laptop. I'll justify the choice and might ask the user for any further clarification.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
