The user has asked to categorize this ticket. My task is to select a category from the allowed options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. I'll format my response as a JSON object with the selected category value included.**Choosing the right category**\n\nThe text revolves around a full mailbox, maternity leave, undeliverable messages, and recipient acceptance issues. I\u2019m thinking this likely relates to Storage due to the mailbox being full, which indicates a storage problem. While maternity leave might connect to HR, the core issue here is around mailbox capacity. So, I believe Storage is the best fit. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object saying, {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. It's crucial to ensure the JSON is correctly formatted!**Finalizing the JSON response**\n\nThe UI specifies that I need to output a category as a JSON object, following a defined schema, which suggests something like {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\"...}}. However, the response I want to provide is just {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. \n\nI need to keep it straightforward with no extra text. I briefly considered whether it could be classified as \"Access\" due to the user's mention of mailbox issues, but since the primary concern is the full mailbox, I'll stick with Storage for the categorization. Let's go with that!"
