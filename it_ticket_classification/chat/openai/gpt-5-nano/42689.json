It looks like a financial calculation issue, but there\u2019s no direct category for \"Finance\" or \"Billing\". The closest options I see are \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or potentially \"Administrative rights\" since it\u2019s about software systems for calculations. The user is clearly concerned about the problem with calculating total project costs and revenues, and I want to choose the best fitting category.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI'm deciding between \"Miscellaneous\" and \"Internal Project\" for this IT ticket because it relates to internal project cost calculations. \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t fit, and \"Access\" isn\u2019t relevant either. I think \"Internal Project\" is the best choice since it specifically deals with project costs. The user's message confirms it\u2019s about a bug in the cost and revenue calculations within their project management system. So, I should output a JSON like {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
