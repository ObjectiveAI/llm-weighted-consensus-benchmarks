The ticket content feels messy, but it seems related to welcoming a new head of analysis. It talks about creating important communication until she joins and congratulating her on her role. While there aren't specific IT tasks, it leans more towards HR concerns or organizational announcements. The best fit seems to be under \u201cHR Support\u201d since it\u2019s about recruitment and onboarding.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI think \"Administrative rights\" and \"Miscellaneous\" could fit, but \"HR Support\" is clearly the best option for this ticket. The prompt requires a specific format for the output as a JSON-like object. I need to ensure it matches exactly, so I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It\u2019s crucial that the enum is precise and conforms to the required structure without any extra text. Let's make sure it\u2019s just right!"
