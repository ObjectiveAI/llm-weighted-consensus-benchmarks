It mentions \"snow settings change request,\u201d likely relating to ServiceNow, suggesting it\u2019s a request for a change. The rest of the text is challenging to decipher, but it seems to involve issues with approvals and access to machines. Given these details, I think the best category could be \"Access,\" as it touches on the user's inability to approve changes related to their machines.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering which category fits the IT ticket best. Since it mentions \"Snow settings change request,\" it could relate to admin rights or a software change, likely needing approval. The phrase \"unable to approve both his machines\" suggests an issue with access, but it\u2019s unclear if it\u2019s about hardware or administrative rights. Since it seems to be a change request for settings requiring admin approval, I'd lean towards categorizing it as \"Administrative rights.\" However, \"Access\" could also be appropriate.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI see this request is about changing settings in Snow, which seems to be failing due to approval issues on machines. It could be about access or approval problems. Since it involves admin-level changes, I think \"Administrative rights\" fits best, as it specifically relates to changing permissions. While \"Access\" could also work, \"Administrative rights\" is more precise. The text mentions \"unable to approve,\" emphasizing the need for elevated privileges, so I'll respond with a JSON category: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.**Delivering category**\n\nI\u2019m ready to deliver the category for the IT ticket. I'll present it simply as {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} since the user specifically asked me to categorize it without needing a lengthy explanation. The instruction was clear: just provide the category. So, I\u2019ll proceed with the JSON response. Here it goes!"
