It sounds like they\u2019re requesting a power outlet adapter, which would fit into the \"Hardware\" category. However, they also mention the need to purchase it, which might suggest the \"Purchase\" category. But since it's primarily about the hardware request, I'm leaning towards classifying it as \"Hardware\". I'll confirm that choice in the system.**Determining Category for IT Request**\n\nThe user appears to be requesting an outlet adapter, which suggests hardware procurement. Even though they didn't explicitly request a purchase, the need for an adapter still falls under the \"Hardware\" category. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object since the instructions specify that. The required output will simply indicate the category. I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra text included, so the final output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
