Phrases like \u201cfailure delivery to address\u201d and \u201cbeing rejected when sending\u201d point to problems with outgoing emails possibly being blocked by the recipient's server. The user is asking for an investigation into whether the issue indeed resides on their side. Now, I need to categorize this issue into one of the provided categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to find the best category for an email delivery failure issue. Since none of the other categories like \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Hardware,\" or \"Administrative rights\" fit, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the best choice. I considered \"Access,\" but the user's problem isn't about system access or credentials. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and produce the output in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. This should satisfy the schema provided!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
