The user mentioned terms related to a \"leaver,\" indicating someone leaving the company, and it's mostly about access-related issues like AD rights and mailbox management. Given that, I think the \"Access\" category is the most suitable fit since it covers items like mailbox forwarding, roaming profiles, and personal mailboxes. I'll ensure that I clearly identify the key areas when I categorize it.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to categorize the IT ticket. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit since it mentions AD rights, the focus is clearly on verifying the leaver's status and related items like mailboxes and roaming profiles. So, I believe \"Access\" is the most appropriate category. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object formatted correctly as the system requires. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s clear and meets the instruction!"
