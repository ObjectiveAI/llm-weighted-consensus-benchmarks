The ticket strings include phrases related to accessing an employee's card, leave forms, access rights, and mailboxes. It seems to mainly involve access provisioning and deprovisioning, especially since it's about a leaver. The best fitting category for this ticket is \"Access,\" possibly with \"Administrative rights\" as a subcategory. I\u2019ll make sure to format it accordingly, looking something like a JSON object.**Preparing JSON Category Response**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket following specific instructions. The category should be in JSON format with a \"category\" field. The options are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. For this ticket, I\u2019ll respond with: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}  \n\nI want to make sure the output is precise and just that, with no extra text, since the platform needs it parsed as JSON.
