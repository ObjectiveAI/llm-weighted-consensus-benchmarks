The message has keywords like \"new purchase,\" \"PO,\" and \"log allocation,\" which suggest it relates to a Purchase Order, along with mentions of receipts and compliance. So, parsing through this, I think the best category for this ticket is \"Purchase.\" It seems to cover the essentials, focusing on orders and asset allocation.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI need to classify the IT ticket into a category. The content focuses on purchases, receipts, and compliance, especially with mentions of a \"mandatory receipts section,\" which suggests it's related to procurement. The logical choice appears to be \"Purchase,\" given the references to new purchase orders. While \"Administrative rights\" or \"Hardware\" might initially seem possible, they don't fit as well. I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
