The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nSince it seems related to a new purchase for technology, the \"Purchase\" category seems the most appropriate. I\u2019ll format this in a JSON-like object with the category field set to \"Purchase.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket focuses on a \"new purchase\" order for a monitor, involving aspects like allocation and receipts. I think it fits best under the \"Purchase\" category since it emphasizes the purchasing and logging processes. Although \"Hardware\" might also apply because it\u2019s about a monitor, the main action centers around the purchase. Given the instructions to categorize this ticket, I\u2019ll go with \"Purchase\" as the most fitting category.**Delivering category response**\n\nThe category \"Purchase\" fits well for this IT ticket. The instruction specifies that I need to respond with the category only, and the system requires a JSON-like object. So, I\u2019ll format my response as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It's important to ensure that the string is exactly from the enum, so this should work perfectly. Alright, let\u2019s deliver this without any extra commentary!"
