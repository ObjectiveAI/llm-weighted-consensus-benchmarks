The ticket content mentions a \"photos folder\" and issues related to \"migrated photos\" and \"links.\" Since it revolves around photo storage and access, I interpret this as primarily about the photos folder and its migration. Therefore, I'm leaning towards categorizing it under \"Storage\" due to its focus on managing photo files and links.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket again, noticing mentions of \"link photos\" and \"access.\" This makes me think it might fit under the \"Access\" category. But then there\u2019s also \"photos folder on new\" and references to \"migrated photos,\" which leans me more toward \"Storage.\" The focus seems to be on accessing and managing the photos folder. I\u2019ve decided to categorize it as \"Storage\" since it\u2019s primarily about photos and their migration. \n\nNow, I just need to output that in JSON format.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
