They mentioned \"network access,\" \"add confluence,\" and \"different configurations tower offices.\" This makes it tricky, but it seems like the ticket mainly pertains to \"Access.\" However, there's the possibility it could be linked to \"Administrative rights\" if access rights are needed. Considering the content, my best guess is \"Access\" because it focuses on network connectivity.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at this IT ticket and trying to determine the right category. The text mentions aspects like \"testing discipline lead\" and \"tower offices,\" which hint at the need for access to configurations and Confluence. Since it revolves around access rights, my best choice is \"Access.\" I\u2019ll respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. While I ponder that the user might want more context, the instruction states to categorize it simply, so I\u2019ll stick to the JSON output."
