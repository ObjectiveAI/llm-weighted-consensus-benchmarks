Given the standard required format, my final response will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Preparing to return JSON**\n\nI just need to return a JSON object based on the instruction given. The \"category\" field is the key point here, and I should keep my response straightforward. \n\nSo, my final response will be just the necessary JSON object with the category specified. Here it is: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
