The ticket discusses issues with emails stuck in the outbox, which makes me think about the best fitting category. \"Storage\" doesn\u2019t quite fit, nor does \"Administrative rights.\" \"Access\" might work if it relates to mail access, but it seems more aligned with general issues. \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the most suitable option here, since it doesn't specifically fit into the other categories clearly.**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nThe options for categories are quite limited. The ticket mentioning \"mails stuck outbox sent\" suggests an issue, possibly related to \"Storage,\" but since our categories are meant for IT ticket triage, I think \"Miscellaneous\" works better. \n\nI plan to express the final category in a JSON format, like: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. It\u2019s important to provide only the structured category without any extra text, as the system expects a clean response. So, I'll stick to that format."
