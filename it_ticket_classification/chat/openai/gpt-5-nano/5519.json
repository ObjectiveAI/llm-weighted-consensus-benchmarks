I am considering \"Hardware\" as well since a backpack is an accessory to hardware. However, I'll lean towards \"Purchase\" since it's specific to procuring new equipment, even if it\u2019s just a backpack.**Finalizing JSON Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the most precise category for the ticket. I think \"Purchase\" works best since it's clearly about obtaining a new item. Although \"Hardware\" also applies, the focus is primarily on the acquisition. I need to format my response in a JSON-like object. So, I will output:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}  \n\nI\u2019ll make sure this is valid JSON. The instruction is specific about returning just the category object, so that\u2019s all I\u2019ll provide!"
