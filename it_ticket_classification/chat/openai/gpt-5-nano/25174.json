I\u2019m leaning towards \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Categorizing IT Tickets**\n\nI need to classify the user's ticket into one of these categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative Rights. The mention of \"approve nomination\" might suggest a need for administrative rights, but it appears to be more related to an internal feature\u2014specifically the \"zone award nomination.\" So, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit since it reflects a workflow related to internal systems. I\u2019ll respond using the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
