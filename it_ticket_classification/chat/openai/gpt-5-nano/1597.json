It's definitely messy, mentioning things like \"expired password\" and instructions like \"press ctrl alt delete\". It seems the ticket is primarily about password expiration and possibly changing the password. There\u2019s also a note about confidentiality regarding attachments. I should classify this under \"Access\" because it relates to password management and security issues.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe user is asking to categorize the IT ticket, so I need to focus on that rather than extracting other information. The main issue seems to be the \"expired password,\" which falls under an access issue. I think \"Access\" is the right category. The category might also connect to \"Administrative rights\" if admin privileges are needed, but \u201cAccess\u201d is more fitting. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object, ensuring it\u2019s valid and concise: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
