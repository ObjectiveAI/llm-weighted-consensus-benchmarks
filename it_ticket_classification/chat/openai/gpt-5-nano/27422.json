The ticket text includes mentions of purchasing and logging installation, but the primary action is the installation itself. I could consider \"Hardware\" due to the mouse's nature, while \"Purchase\" could also fit because of the purchase order mentioned. However, since the focus is on installation, the most appropriate category seems to be \"Hardware.\" Therefore, I would respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"purchase PO,\" \"purchased mouse,\" and \"log installation,\" suggesting it's a request to log the installation of a mouse purchased under a PO. Since this involves the installation of a hardware device, \"Hardware\" seems to be the right category. For clarity, I'll create my response as a JSON object. The format should look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This keeps everything straightforward and aligns with the required output format."
