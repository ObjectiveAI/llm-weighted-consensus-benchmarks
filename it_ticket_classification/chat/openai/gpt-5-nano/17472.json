It might fit under \"Access\" for granting membership, or possibly \"Administrative rights,\" but that seems too specific. So, I think \"Access\" is the best fit since it's about adding a member to a group or meeting.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe request \"add member to tuesday pm\" suggests that the user is looking to add someone to a distribution list or meeting group. The mention of \"vice president\" indicates that the requester might be from that position. Given this context, I should categorize the ticket as \"Access.\" I'll respond in the required format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply, \"Access\" seems broader and is the safer choice for this situation. So, I'll go with that."
