The user mentions \"adaptor needed\" for travel, which makes me think it's hardware-related or possibly procurement. The ticket could fit into either \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase,\" since it\u2019s a device request. Since they\u2019re asking for a specific item, I believe it\u2019s more appropriate to call it \"Hardware.\" But some may consider it a \"Purchase\" request depending on the workflows.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019ve identified that there\u2019s a \"Purchase\" category for items to buy, but the phrase \"please provide adaptor\" suggests a procurement request. The mention of \"adaptor needed friday pm\" indicates a specific need for time, which might suggest an internal process for a temporary asset. However, to be safe, I think \"Hardware\" is the better classification. I need to output a JSON object stating the category, so it should look like: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. No extra commentary needed!"
