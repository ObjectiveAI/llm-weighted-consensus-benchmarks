The user\u2019s ticket discusses an SOW update and contract changes, with some urgency for resolution. It seems more like a procurement or legal matter than IT support. \"Purchase\" could fit, but it might also align with \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" due to its contract management focus.**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe ticket clearly relates to procurement and contract management rather than access or hardware. Among the limited IT categories, \"Purchase\" is the most fitting for contract updates. Although \"Internal Project\" might be applicable for project-specific work, this ticket focuses on SOW updates and contracts. The content suggests a request for assistance with these updates, indicating that \"Administrative rights\" aren\u2019t needed. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize the ticket as \"Purchase\" and respond using the JSON format required for the \"category\" schema.**Outputting JSON for Category**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to provide a JSON object that categorizes the IT Ticket. Following the schema, I\u2019ll create the object with \"type\": \"object\" and a property for \"category\". \n\nSo the output will be exactly:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nI\u2019ll keep it neat without any extra text since that's what the instruction specifies. Just following the format closely!"
