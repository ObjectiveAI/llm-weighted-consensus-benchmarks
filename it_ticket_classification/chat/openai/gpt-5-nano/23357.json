They're discussing mailbox management, archiving, and size increase. Looking through the available categories, I don't think it's hardware, HR support, purchases, or internal projects. \"Access\" could be a consideration since it involves mailbox configuration. However, it seems most relevant to categorize this ticket under \"Storage.\" So, I'll respond with a JSON object that includes \"Storage\" as the category.**Outputting IT ticket category**\n\nThe prompt instructs me to categorize an IT ticket and respond with a JSON structure. I need to ensure that I follow the required format with a \"category\" key and the value \"Storage.\" The schema confirms that storage is appropriate since no \"Email\" category is available. So, my response will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}\n\nIt's important to avoid adding any extra text and just provide the JSON as requested. Let's proceed!"
