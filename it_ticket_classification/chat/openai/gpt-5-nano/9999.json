It seems to relate to a maternity leave form activation and completion, which is typically HR-related. I think \"HR Support\" fits best, although in the category options provided, it wasn\u2019t clear initially. I\u2019ll double-check the taxonomy to confirm if \"HR Support\" is indeed listed. Since it focuses on HR processes, I want to ensure I classify it correctly. Let's clarify that!**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nGreat, \"HR Support\" is indeed included in the categories, so that's the right choice for this ticket. The content references enabling a maternity leave form and completing an attachment, indicating a need for IT support regarding HR processes. Since there's no specific \"Maternity Leave\" category, \"HR Support\" fits best. \n\nI\u2019ll finalize my response as a JSON object in the required format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This way, it\u2019s clear and concise, just as the prompt requests!"
