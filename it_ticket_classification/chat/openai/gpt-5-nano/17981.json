The ticket can fit into \"Internal Project\" since it involves maintenance work. It could also be seen as \"Access\" due to the dashboard being unavailable; however, it really focuses on maintenance and communication, like notifying users. \"Administrative rights\" doesn't seem relevant, and \"Miscellaneous\" might be the fallback if nothing fits, but \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best option.**Defining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at typical categories for IT tickets: Hardware, Software, Network, Access, Storage, and others. However, in this case, we don't have a Software option listed. Since the ticket is about a maintenance window for a dashboard, the best fit seems to be \"Internal Project.\" It involves notifying users about the dashboard's unavailability, which aligns with internal project tasks. So, I\u2019ll create a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} and make sure it\u2019s valid."
