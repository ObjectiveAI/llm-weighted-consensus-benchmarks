The text suggests it's about a \"pixel,\" likely referring to a Facebook tracking pixel, with discussions on activating it on pages in a testing environment for campaigns and audience gathering. Essentially, the focus is on enabling this feature on various website locations. It seems to involve testing and activation rather than any hardware or access issues.**Evaluating Ticket Categories**\n\nI'm considering which category to place the ticket in. It might belong to \"Internal Project\" since it's about implementing a pixel for tracking on the live site, which is an internal task. It could also be \"Administrative rights\" if enabling the pixel requires permissions, but the focus is more on activation rather than direct access. \"Miscellaneous\" could apply if it doesn\u2019t fit well elsewhere. Hardware, HR Support, Storage, and Purchase don\u2019t seem relevant here. I'm still deciding.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
