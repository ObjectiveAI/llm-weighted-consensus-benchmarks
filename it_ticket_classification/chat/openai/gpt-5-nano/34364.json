It\u2019s important to choose the category that fits best for clarity and organization. I\u2019ll output a JSON object that includes the \"category\" field, making sure it reflects the selected category accurately. Let's make sure I get this right!**Identifying network issues**\n\nThe ticket details a traffic restriction problem involving client connections and increased remote certificates. As connections rise, we observe more frequent failures, especially during peak times like mornings and late evenings when everything else seems fine. It looks like there's a network connectivity issue that could stem from traffic restrictions, perhaps related to firewalls or rate limiting. Unfortunately, the current categories don\u2019t seem to include options like Networking, Security, or Performance, which would be more fitting.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to find the best category for this ticket, thinking \"Administrative rights\" isn't a good fit. \"Access\" might relate to traffic control, but it revolves around network restrictions and exceptions. \"Internal Project\" doesn\u2019t apply here either, so I consider \"Miscellaneous\" as a catch-all. However, since the issue is more about access restrictions, \"Access\" seems plausible too. Ultimately, since it\u2019s ambiguous, I think \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is the safest choice. I\u2019ll format it as a JSON object."
