The mentions of \"contractor,\" \"starter form,\" and \"rejected contract\" suggest it relates to HR or administrative functions. Out of the provided categories, \"HR Support\" seems the most fitting, while \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" aren't applicable because the email lacks explicit mentions of permissions or access systems. \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback, but I think it\u2019s clearly HR-related. I'll proceed with that!**Ensuring output format**\n\nI need to make sure my output format matches the specified category schema exactly. The right structure is crucial for proper categorization. Based on the content mentioning \"starter form contractor\" and \"rejected contract,\" this seems to connect to HR onboarding, making \"HR Support\" the most suitable category.\n\nI'll go ahead and produce the JSON object with that category: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`. I won't add extra text, sticking strictly to what was requested."
