They describe a disconnection and reconnection, which is about storage hardware. \n\nI need to categorize this into one of the schema options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the focus on the disk partition problem, \"Storage\" seems like the most fitting category.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize the IT ticket and provide it in JSON format. The required structure specifies that \"category\" must be nested within an object. \n\nBased on the ticket content, I\u2019ve determined the appropriate category is \"Storage.\" \n\nI need to deliver it precisely as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} with no additional text or commentary. I've got that clear now, and I'm ready to provide the output in the correct format!"
