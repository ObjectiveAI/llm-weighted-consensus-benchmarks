The ticket mentions \"new starter hardware allocation,\" which suggests it's related to hardware. There are additional references to an \"induction\" and \"attached starter form,\" but the most significant aspect here is the hardware allocation for a new starter. Therefore, I'll categorize it under \"Hardware,\" as that seems to be the main focus of the request!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nLooking at the categories, the best fit seems to be \"Hardware\" since the ticket is about hardware allocation. \"Administrative rights\" isn\u2019t applicable, nor is \"HR Support,\" which would be related to onboarding. Other categories like \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Storage\" don't match either. The content clearly mentions \"new starter hardware allocation,\" confirming it\u2019s related to hardware provisioning. Therefore, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON format: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}` \u2014 that aligns perfectly!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
