The categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll respond with a JSON structure that follows the specified schema for categorization.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object where the category key is set. I'll output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} to match the user's request to categorize the IT ticket without extra explanation. The user specifically asked for categorization, so I don't need to elaborate unless they ask. I\u2019ve checked the ticket details, and it confirms that this is clearly about internal project work related to dashboard maintenance. I'll provide that final formatted response now."
