The user's input seems rather garbled, but it hints at an access issue from network Belgrade to network Sonar. Given the context, it sounds like they are asking for help with access and setup. I'll need to clarify things further to ensure accurate categorization.**Categorizing IT ticket access**\n\nThe content mentions \"access from network Belgrade to network Sonar,\" suggesting it's related to an access issue. Other phrases like \"other members assist setup,\" \"mobile device,\" and \"consultant mobile\" indicate potential requests for help with access and setups for mobile devices. I need to decide whether to categorize this as Access, Administrative rights, or possibly Hardware. Considering the main focus is on access provisioning, \"Access\" seems to be the most fitting category. I'll respond with a JSON object to confirm this.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
