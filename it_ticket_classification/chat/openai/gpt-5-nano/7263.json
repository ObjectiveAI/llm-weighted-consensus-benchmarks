They mentioned attempts at upgrading their system and that the problem is likely due to an underpowered CPU. I think the best fit for this ticket would be the \"Hardware\" category since it mainly concerns hardware resource issues, although \"Purchase\" could apply if a CPU upgrade is needed.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nThey asked for a category for the ticket, and I think \"Hardware\" is the best choice since it's about PC resources and mentions an underpowered, low-voltage CPU. I need to respond with a JSON format, specifying the category clearly. The schema indicates that the output should be a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll ensure there's no extraneous text; I\u2019ll just provide the precise JSON response that the user requires."
