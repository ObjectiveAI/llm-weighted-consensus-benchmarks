The phrase about \"change issues approved instead of implemented\" raises questions about change control. I wonder if \"Administrative rights\" fits if it involves permissions. I might need to ask clarifying questions, but ultimately, I should respond with a single category label for the IT ticket.**Deciding on category**\n\nI'm considering the best fit for this as \"Internal Project\" since it revolves around change requests and tasks, which are part of project management. However, \"Administrative rights\" might also be relevant due to possible changes in access. The mention of \"presence manager\" suggests it could link to access issues, but there's also a note about a request that disappeared which complicates things. Overall, I think I should prioritize \"Internal Project\" since it pertains to IT operations and change control, but \"Administrative rights\" could also be a valid choice.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm reviewing the provided categories, with \"Administrative rights\" likely for admin privilege requests. The text mentions \"change control presence manager managed mob annual leave,\" which might refer to management on leave. However, I think \"Internal Project\" fits best as a general category for change management. This ticket discusses approved changes that weren't implemented, so I\u2019ll label it as \"Internal Project.\" If needed, I can suggest \"Miscellaneous\" as an alternative. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON-like object for clarity.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
