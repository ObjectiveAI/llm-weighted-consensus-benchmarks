They\u2019re having trouble with approving a requisition, facing issues with privileges and invalid actions. This looks like it could fit into \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or possibly \"Purchase,\" since requisition generally relates to purchasing. I\u2019ll focus on the fact that they can't approve the requisition due to a lack of privileges, so \"Access\" feels like the most appropriate category to assign here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe text indicates concerns over permissions related to approving a requisition. Phrases like \"invalid action\" and \"privilege to perform action\" signal access issues. It makes sense to consider the \"Administrative rights\" category since it relates directly to permissions. The system requires a JSON format for the output. Since \"Administrative rights\" seems the most fitting due to the focus on privileges, I'll format it as follows: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. That should fit the requirements!{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
