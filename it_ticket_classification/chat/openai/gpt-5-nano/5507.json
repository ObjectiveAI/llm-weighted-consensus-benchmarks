This includes phrases like \"new starter,\" \"joiners lead,\" and \"grade provisional,\" which indicate a focus on HR or administrative matters rather than IT hardware. It seems I should classify it under \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights\" or maybe even \"Access.\" I\u2019ll need to consider which category fits best based on those elements mentioned.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe message includes terms like \"joiners,\" \"new starter,\" and references to documents and dates, suggesting it relates to onboarding. I'm considering if this fits under \"HR Support,\" given the onboarding context and mention of grade provisional. There are IT categories, but there's no direct reference to access issues. It feels more aligned with HR tasks than anything else, so I think I'll go with \"HR Support\" for this ticket category. I\u2019ll prepare the JSON response for it too!**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to produce the output in JSON format and it should look like this: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`. The instructions indicate that a single object containing the category is required, so the final structured response should just be that JSON. Given the content about onboarding, new starters, and documents, I\u2019m confident \"HR Support\" fits best. I just need to ensure it meets the criteria without any extra commentary. So I'll finalize it as `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`."
