They're asking for help with access to a file server, particularly regarding write permission and creating folders in a \"training internship folder.\" This seems to involve access rights. Now, I\u2019m torn between two categories: \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" While \"Access\" directly addresses their need for permissions, \"Administrative rights\" also applies since creating folders typically requires those rights. Which should I choose?**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize a ticket regarding an \"unable to copy files into folder\" issue linked to a file server. The user is asking for \"write permission including creating folders.\" While this seems like it fits under \"Administrative rights,\" given the need for elevated permissions, it could also be classified as \"Access\" since it's about accessing the file server. The request for creating folders suggests it's more than just basic access. Ultimately, I should probably go with \"Administrative rights\" to be precise about their needs.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user wrote about a \"file server access request\" mentioning \"write permission including creating folders.\" This indicates a need for elevated rights. While the primary category might lean towards \"Access\" because it's about resource access, it also fits \"Administrative rights\" due to the specifics of write permissions. However, the system requires one category. I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" since it\u2019s the broader fit and suits the provided JSON format. So I'm ready to respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
