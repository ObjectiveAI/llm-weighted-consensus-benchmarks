The user is asking about monitor setups and productivity with parallel applications on two same-sized monitors. It seems like this relates to hardware rather than administrative rights. Considering the content, I\u2019ll place it in the \"Hardware\" category since it focuses on the monitor setup and improving productivity. It definitely fits that category best!**Determining Category Format**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether the ticket could fall under \"Internal Project,\" but it primarily mentions \u201cspending debugging\u201d and running applications in parallel on two monitors, which reinforces that it's about hardware. I need to respond with just the required JSON object containing the category \"Hardware.\" The format is clear: it should be a category object. To keep it concise, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any extra content. Here we go!"
