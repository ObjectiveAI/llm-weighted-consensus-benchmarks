The available categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Looking through the ticket details, it appears focused on a requisition that has been rejected, touching on various related aspects. Given this, it seems most appropriate to categorize it under \"Purchase\" due to its emphasis on requisitioning.**Delivering JSON Response**\n\nI\u2019ve determined that the ticket fits the \"Purchase\" category since it deals with a rejected requisition along with its details, such as approvers and attachments. The response should be in JSON format, specifically: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. The instructions say to provide only the required category, and it seems straightforward. So, I'll make sure the capitalization of \"Purchase\" is correct and avoid any extraneous text. Here\u2019s the output we\u2019ll deliver: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}."
