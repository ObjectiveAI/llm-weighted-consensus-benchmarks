The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, and more. The phrases suggest it's related to a storage limit, likely a mailbox storage quota since \"deleted items folder\" is mentioned. It seems fitting to categorize this as \"Storage\" because they want an increased quota. \"Access\" doesn't quite apply here.**Formatting category output**\n\nI need to finalize the category for this IT ticket. It seems like the best fit is \"Storage\" given the user's request to extend limits. Now, I see I have to format this response as a JSON object, structured according to specific instructions I've received. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll create the output as `{\"category\":\"Storage\"}` without additional explanations, since the prompt doesn\u2019t specify that I need to provide one. I\u2019ll just deliver this JSON as instructed!"
