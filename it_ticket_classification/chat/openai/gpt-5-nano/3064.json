It involves things like new repositories, git, deploying test versions, and automated tests. From the provided categories, I think the best fit might be \"Internal Project\" since it relates to version control, repository creation, and automation framework. \"Miscellaneous\" could also work, but I feel like going with \"Internal Project\" makes more sense based on the content.**Deciding on the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the right category for this IT ticket. \"Internal Project\" seems most fitting since it\u2019s about development and repositories. \"Storage\" might relate, but not precisely. \"Access\" doesn't work unless they explicitly need Git repo access, and \"Admin rights,\" \"Hardware,\" and \"Purchase\" don\u2019t apply. So, I\u2019m sticking with \"Internal Project.\" Now, I need to format this as a JSON object, specifically: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That aligns with the required schema!**Finalizing the output**\n\nI need to ensure the category matches exactly, so I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" with the correct capitalization. It fits within the enum options. The user just wants the category, so I shouldn\u2019t add any extra commentary. I\u2019ll format the response as requested: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra whitespace since that could cause issues. Alright, I\u2019m ready to deliver this cleanly!"
