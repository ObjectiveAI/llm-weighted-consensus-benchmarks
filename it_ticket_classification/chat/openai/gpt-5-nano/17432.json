The ticket content is quite messy, mentioning \"shutdown,\" \"outage,\" \"engineers,\" and \"scheduling.\" It seems primarily about equipment shutdowns, which suggests that \"Hardware\" fits best. However, I\u2019m considering \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" but it\u2019s not about credentials. Overall, I think \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate category, so I'll format the output as a JSON.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket and provide it in a specific JSON format with a \"category\" field. The allowed categories include options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. For this case, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware.\" It\u2019s important to stick to the required output format, so I\u2019ll provide the final result as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI might think about adding a brief note, but the spec indicates I should focus strictly on the category object."
