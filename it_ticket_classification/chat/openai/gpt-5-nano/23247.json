The ticket discusses issues related to migration of old folders, permissions, and site management. It includes terms like \"restrictive rights\" and \"edit old folder,\" which suggests it's highly focused on access control. The best fit for this ticket is likely either Administrative rights or Access, as it revolves around managing folder permissions during the migration process.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThis content centers around permissions for folders, migration to a new site, and decommissioning old sites. The goal is to gain access or change permissions to facilitate migration. I could categorize it as Access, Administrative rights, or Internal Project. If I have to choose one, Administrative rights fits well due to its focus on permission schemas and restricted rights. However, Access also fits since it\u2019s more general. Ultimately, I\u2019ll pick \"Access\" because it emphasizes the focus on permissions and migration.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
