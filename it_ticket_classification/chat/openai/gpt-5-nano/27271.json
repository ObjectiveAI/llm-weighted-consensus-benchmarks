Phrases like \"budget update,\" \"enhancing initial budget proposal,\" and \"change requirements\" suggest it's more about project management. Since it falls under the \"Internal Project\" category, it's likely related to budget and planning tasks. \n\nTherefore, I need to respond with the category object in a JSON-like format, specifically: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. That's the plan!"
