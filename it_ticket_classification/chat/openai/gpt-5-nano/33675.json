The system allows specific categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" or others. I need to decide which category fits best. The ticket's context suggests that it should be categorized under \"Purchase.\" I think I should output this as a JSON object: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`. Time to format that correctly!**Determining the category**\n\nI\u2019m parsing the given IT ticket that features keywords like \"purchase request,\" \"approved,\" and \"purchased monitor.\" It's clear the main focus is on purchasing hardware, which leads me to consider the categories \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" Since it\u2019s primarily about a purchase request, the \"Purchase\" category seems most applicable. Even though there might be aspects related to hardware replenishment, the central action revolves around the purchase. I think I\u2019ll go with \"Purchase\" as the final category choice!**Outputting the category in JSON**\n\nIn IT ticket triage, a request for purchasing hardware falls under the category of \"Purchase.\" The \"Hardware\" category applies more to asset or issue specifics, but since this is about requesting a purchase, \"Purchase\" is the right choice. \n\nI need to ensure the JSON format is correct and clear, so I\u2019ll output it simply as: \n\n```json\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n```\n\nThis meets the required format and instructions for the response!"
