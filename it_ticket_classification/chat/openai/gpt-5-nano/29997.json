The user asks to categorize a ticket about changing the status to active for a project on Thursday. It seems to point towards \"Internal Project,\" as it focuses on project status changes. However, if it were about changing access rights, it might fit \"Administrative rights.\" Overall, I'll lean towards \"Internal Project\" since it\u2019s clearly about the project status.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket is asking to change the status of a project, suggesting it could fall under \"Internal Project.\" If the change requires permissions, then \"Administrative rights\" could apply, but the request focuses on performing the action rather than asking for permissions. It seems that \"Internal Project\" is the best fit, especially since it's specifically about changing a project's status. The reference to \"project Thursday PM\" might indicate it's about a project named that. Overall, I think \"Internal Project\" works best here.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe user's mention of \"order log effort\" could indicate it's a separate action within the project. I'll categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project\" and respond using the required JSON-like format. The prompt specifies that I should provide a category with one of the allowed values. So, my output will be structured like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It's essential to follow the structure precisely and keep the response brief, as the user asked for a categorization only. So, I'll answer with that."
