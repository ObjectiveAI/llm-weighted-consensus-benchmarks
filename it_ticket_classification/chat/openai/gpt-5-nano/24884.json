The provided categories include hardware, HR support, access, and a few others. Given that the content focuses on access cards, their usage, ordering, and control related to teams and locations, it looks like the most fitting category is \"Access.\" This ticket clearly relates to access control and usage, so I'm confident in that choice.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the request about access cards, their usage, and team assignments. While \"Purchase\" might seem relevant since they mention ordering cards, the main focus appears to be on access control rather than the purchasing aspect. The \"Access\" category aligns best with the request. Following the expected output format, I need to provide a JSON object with the property \"category\" set to \"Access.\" So, I'll provide the response as:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
