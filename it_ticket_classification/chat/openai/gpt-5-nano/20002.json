The ticket talks about changes to approvers in an Oracle project, including workflow and flight bookings. Given the references to approvals and project management, it could fall under \"Administrative rights\", \"Purchase\", or \"Internal Project\". The key terms suggest it's messy, but \"Access\" could also fit due to permissions around approver changes.**Identifying appropriate category**\n\nThe categories available don't include \"Application support\" or \"Procurement.\" I\u2019m thinking that the \"Purchase\" category might apply to the flight bookings mentioned in the ticket. Since the user is looking to book flights, that could relate to procurement and travel. In corporate IT ticketing, the \"Purchase\" category usually covers things like procurement and quotations, which suggests it\u2019s a fitting choice for this ticket regarding flight bookings.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize a ticket that discusses an Oracle project approver change, along with various flight bookings and adjustments. Based on the mention of the Oracle project and the focus on internal processes, it seems like this ticket could fit into the \"Internal Project\" category. This category usually pertains to internal project management systems, making it a likely choice for the content focused on approvals and project-specific tasks.**Determining ticket categorization**\n\nI'm considering if this ticket might fall under \"Administrative rights\" since changing an approver likely requires specific access permissions. The mention of \"approver flow fixed until then please clear out way\" indicates workflow adjustments. There are both \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" categories available. It looks like changing the PM approver in Oracle relates to permission adjustments, so I need to decide which one fits best. Based on the context, it seems like \"Access\" may be more accurate as it focuses on approval workflows and configurations.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI've decided that this ticket could be categorized as \"Access\", \"Administrative rights\", or \"Internal Project.\" The mention of \"internal templates\" hints at it being an internal project related to project approval flows in Oracle. However, it looks like the primary focus is on adjusting approvers and workflows, which leans more towards \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nSince the ticket includes tasks related to changing the PM approver and managing access rights, I'll go with \"Administrative rights\" for this. So, I'll format my response as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
