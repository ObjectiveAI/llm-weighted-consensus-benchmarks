So, my guess is that it fits into either \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or possibly \"Internal Project.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIn categorizing the IT ticket, it seems like the request about creating Outlook groups and managing rights relates to Access management or Administrative rights. Since it mentions \"Outlook groups,\" this indicates it involves permissions and access control. The category \"Access\" feels appropriate, especially since they reference \"trainers rights,\" suggesting privileges related to group membership. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and prepare the response in the required JSON format. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
