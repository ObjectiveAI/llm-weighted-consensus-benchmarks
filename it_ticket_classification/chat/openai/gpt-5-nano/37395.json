I\u2019m considering if it could also fit under Access, given that it concerns access to HR information. Let's go with HR Support for this.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket seems to focus on HR processes, mentioning \"annual leave,\" \"vacation request,\" and their approval, which indicates it's about visibility issues in the Oracle HR system. The category \"HR Support\" appears to be the best fit, though \"Access\" might apply if it's about accessing the system. Since the user wants me to categorize it, I'll make sure to respond with a JSON object like this: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. I could check for any ambiguities if needed!{\"category\": \"HR Support\"}"
