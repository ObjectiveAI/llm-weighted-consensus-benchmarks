The text describes issues connecting to a resource and mentions high importance and persistent connection problems. It sounds like the user is having difficulties connecting for the past couple of days, needing urgent assistance as they\u2019re working overtime. The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I\u2019ll determine the most fitting category here.**Determining access category**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on an access issue since the user can't connect to a resource. It seems like \"Access\" is the most suitable category, even though \"Administrative Rights\" is a consideration as well. However, the access aspect predominates. I need to provide a JSON object with the category field formatted correctly. The schema specifies that I should output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to ensure I follow the required format exactly!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
