In IT ticket categorization, I see that \"Purchase\" fits as it covers hardware procurement and POs. So, I'll prepare the final response as a JSON object with the category set to \"Purchase.\" I need to keep it simple and adhere to the specified format: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"} \n\nI'll focus on clear delivery since the user asked for a straightforward category output.**Delivering JSON Output**\n\nI see that I need to output a JSON object based on the provided schema. The schema specifies a \"category\" field that must include one of the enumerated strings like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and so on. Since the context is related to purchasing, I'll set the category to \"Purchase.\" My final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nI\u2019m ready to deliver that straightforwardly, following the schema's guidelines precisely!"
