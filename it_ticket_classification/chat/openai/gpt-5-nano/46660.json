Based on the content, it seems to be related to hardware since it mentions \"monitor change\" and \"resolution issues.\" While it could also fall under Purchase if it's a request for a new monitor, the main focus is on the hardware aspect. However, the message is a bit unclear and jumbled, which makes it tricky!**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"change monitor,\" \"resolution issues,\" and possibly a request for the serial number of the current monitor. They may want to replace it due to these issues. Since this relates to hardware, categorizing it as \"Hardware\" makes sense, especially if it's about device replacement. While it could also be a \"Purchase\" category, the main focus is on the hardware problem. It's clear that \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" and \"Internal Project\" don\u2019t fit here, making \"Hardware\" the best choice!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
