The user\u2019s message has details that seem quite cluttered but indicate they want help. \n\nI need to check the predefined categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It seems fitting to categorize this under \"Access\" or perhaps \"Administrative rights,\" since it's related to software license management. Let's decide what fits best!**Deciding on category classification**\n\nI\u2019m trying to find the best category for this ticket. The options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nIt seems like the ticket's focus is on a software license, which could connect to Access, especially since it mentions installation tools and allocation. However, it might fall under Purchase if they are requesting to procure a license. Since it\u2019s primarily about installation, I lean toward Access but will finalize it in a structured way like this: { \"category\": \"Access\" }.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
