The available categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket talks about issues like \"self signed certificate\" and \"certificate verify failed,\" which imply SSL/TLS certificate verification problems. \n\nOf the options, it sounds like \"Access\" fits best since these certificate issues affect server access. This will lead me to classify the ticket accordingly.**Classifying server certificate issue**\n\nThis chain of thought revolves around categorizing an application or script dealing with server certificate verification, particularly issues related to TLS verification and self-signed certificates. I'm debating between using \"Access,\" given that it concerns accessing a server with an invalid certificate, or \"Administrative rights,\" which seems less fitting since it\u2019s more about verification than rights. Since the user wants a category, I\u2019ll choose \"Access\" and prepare to output the JSON object without extra text.**Outputting the category**\n\nSo, I need to produce a response based on the expected schema, which is likely a JSON object. I\u2019ve decided on using:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nIt seems important to make sure this is valid. The available categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I've confirmed that \"Access\" is the best choice. Now, I just need to respond with this formatted output correctly."
