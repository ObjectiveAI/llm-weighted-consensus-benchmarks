This indicates an issue with access to their workstation, likely related to the password reset. I\u2019ll categorize it as \u201cAccess\u201d and frame the response in JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Finalizing access category**\n\nI need to focus on categorizing the ticket correctly. The user might want an explanation or recommended steps, but since the instruction is to categorize, I'll provide the necessary JSON object. It's clearly an \"Access\" issue because the user is unable to log in to their PC after a password reset. While it could be \u201cHardware\u201d if the PC was corrupted, the main problem lies with access. \n\nI\u2019ll prepare the final output as: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text."
