Given that it involves a physical device, it clearly falls under the \"Hardware\" category. Although there's a mention of warranty, which isn't covered by our categories, it's still best to classify it as \"Hardware.\" Perhaps I could note a subcategory like \"Mouse\" or \"Peripheral,\" but for now, \"Hardware\" seems appropriate.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to respond to an IT ticket by categorizing it in a specific JSON format. The schema defines that it should be an object with a \"category\" field that aligns with supposed values like \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support.\" Since the issue I've identified is a hardware problem, I will create a JSON object with the \"category\" set to \"Hardware.\" \n\nSo, the correct output will be: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. I\u2019ll make sure to keep it concise, with no extra commentary.**Delivering JSON response**\n\nThe user mentioned that the master mouse loses connection and asked about the warranty, which suggests two issues: a mouse disconnection and warranty status. I think it\u2019s best to classify this under \"Hardware,\" since it's primarily a hardware problem. I won't add \"Maintenance\" since that's not in the options. I need to ensure that I return a response in plain text format containing JSON. So, I'll deliver that clearly and concisely!"
