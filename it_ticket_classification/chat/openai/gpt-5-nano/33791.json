The ticket mentions changing a role name, switching roles, and other administrative details. Considering the provided categories, it seems to fit under \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"HR Support.\" Given that the user might be referencing Active Directory with the mention of \"AD,\" it looks like it's primarily about managing access and permissions related to role changes.**Categorizing user roles**\n\nI think the ticket is focused on modifying user roles and potentially the officer's location. It seems best categorized under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" since it relates to access provisioning and role changes. The mentions of \"role change\" and \"change role name,\" along with the start date, indicate it's indeed an HR/IT access issue. \"Ext\" likely refers to an extension number, while \"zone\" might be a building area. Overall, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d is more specific and fits better, capturing the essence of this request.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
