It looks like the right category is \"Purchase.\" So, I'll create a JSON object formatted like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} to match the system's expectations for my response.**Formatting response correctly**\n\nThe wrapper expects the response to be in JSON format as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} or just the category string. The system's specified format indicates I need to output a JSON object with that field. So, to follow that structure correctly, I\u2019ll ensure I respond simply with: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I want to keep it concise and avoid any extra text to make sure it\u2019s proper JSON. Let's get this done!"
