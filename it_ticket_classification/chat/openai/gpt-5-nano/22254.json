This seems to fall under HR Support since it's related to an internal transfer request. \"Administrative rights\" might be an IT category, but it doesn\u2019t quite fit here.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI need to classify an IT ticket based on its content, which talks about an internal transfer request, a transfer form, and changes involving the architecture discipline.
