It talks about managing licenses in a Mac environment along with running software solutions. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Internal Project.\" The content seems to suggest it relates to software licensing, so I need to choose carefully to ensure it fits the right category. Let's look at the details to find the best match!**Analyzing ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering that \u201chow users parallel software solution\u201d might refer to deploying software for multiple users. If that's the case, it could fall under \"Internal Project,\" which relates to implementing a solution. The core topics here involve software licensing on Macs and providing advice on parallel software use. Categories like \"Administrative rights\" pertain to software installation permissions, while \"Access\" relates more to software availability. \"Purchase\" could apply if licenses are involved, but I think I\u2019m leaning toward \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" as the best fit.**Clarifying software licensing inquiry**\n\nThe user\u2019s phrase about \"license, Macs environment, and parallel software solution\" likely relates to software licensing and deployment for multiple users on Macs. The term \"parallel software solution\" might refer to Parallels Desktop for Mac, which allows running Windows applications. If they need a solution for shared software usage, that relates to licensing. I might categorize this under \"Administrative rights\" for installation permissions or \"Internal Project\" if it's about setting up license management. There's also \"Access\", considering software availability for users.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions advising on how users can deploy a \"parallel software solution,\" likely referring to Parallels for virtualization to run Windows on Macs. This raises licensing issues connected to software use. Typically in IT categorization, licensing maps to \"Purchase\" for acquiring licenses and \"Administrative rights\" for management. Since the focus is on advising users about deployment and licensing management, \"Administrative rights\" seems to be the best fit. I\u2019ll respond in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
