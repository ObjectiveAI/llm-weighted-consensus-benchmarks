While this reflects an IT issue, the closest category seems to be \"Miscellaneous\" since \"Network\" or \"Incidents\" aren\u2019t listed. I\u2019m still not entirely sure about the right fit.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket relates to an outage on the 3rd floor, possibly a facility or IT infrastructure issue. With limited categories, \"Miscellaneous\" seems best to indicate a general IT outage. \"Access\" could also work if it's about system access due to the outage, but since the user wants it looked into ASAP, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is more fitting. I\u2019ll also suggest asking clarifying questions about affected systems and exact timings while providing the response in JSON format.**Formulating JSON Output**\n\nThe prompt indicates a specific output schema for a category, which is a JSON object requiring a category field. Since the instruction is to categorize the IT ticket, I need to respond with just that category value. \n\nWhile \"Access\" could be relevant due to the outage potentially blocking access, it seems more appropriate to go with \"Miscellaneous\" since the outage relates more to infrastructure. I'll keep the response concise, providing the output as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Finalizing the Output**\n\nI\u2019m thinking \u201cInternal Project\u201d and \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d don\u2019t apply here. Since the user has specifically asked for a category, I'll stick to providing that. However, I could offer clarifying questions in case they need more details later. For now, the focus is on delivering the required category. I\u2019ll craft the final output concisely, ensuring it meets the prompt's requirements while being straightforward."
