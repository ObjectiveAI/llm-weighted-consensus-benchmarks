The categories available include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the ticket focuses on trying to connect to servers without success, it seems to fit best under the \"Access\" category. While \"Networking\" might also apply, it isn't listed, so \"Access\" is my top choice. It could also be a miscellaneous or internal project issue, but \"Access\" feels most accurate.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m preparing to respond with a JSON object to categorize an IT ticket. The required format shows a \"category\" field with specified options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. I need to output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, which seems appropriate based on the ticket's content. I also want to make sure I stick to just providing the JSON without any extra text or notes to keep it clean. So, I\u2019ll finalize and return: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
