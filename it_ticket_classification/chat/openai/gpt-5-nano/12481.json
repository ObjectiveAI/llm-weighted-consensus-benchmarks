It's essential to address the locations of the rooms and integrate them into Active Directory, specifically noting something about a \"black active directory.\" The request involves several types of meeting rooms with various names and attendees, and there's an urgency in configuring these before a deadline in July. I need to clarify details and ensure proper actions are taken.**Categorizing project and access needs**\n\nI'm considering which category fits best for this task. \"Internal Project\" seems appropriate since it involves configuring meeting rooms and assigning extensions, which are IT-related tasks. \"Access\" also fits due to mentions of extensions and Active Directory (AD) integration. There may be a need for \"Administrative rights\" to make changes, but the primary focus is on configuring these meeting rooms and assigning the corresponding extensions. The request includes specific meeting room names, which signals an update to the setup is needed.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm trying to figure out the best category for this IT ticket. I think \"Internal Project\" fits well since it's about an IT task. The prompt specifies that I need to output a JSON-like object with the category field. Based on the required format, I should respond simply with {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I need to make sure I include just that and no extra explanations, even though I\u2019m wondering if \"Access\" might also be a suitable choice.**Finalizing category for the project**\n\nI'm looking at the task of configuring meeting rooms, assigning extensions, and adding to Active Directory, all of which needs to be done by July. This clearly falls under internal projects, so I think \"Internal Project\" is the right category. I need to keep things straightforward and concise, so I\u2019ll just go ahead and provide that category in my response. This seems like the best fit for what the task entails."
