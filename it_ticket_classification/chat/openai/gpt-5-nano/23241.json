The required format is a JSON object with the category specified. I\u2019ll respond simply with the necessary JSON structure: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I need to ensure that the response is valid JSON without any additional text. I'll also briefly consider if \u201cInternal Project\u201d might be a contender, but Access fits best here.**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on categorizing membership in Active Directory for internship accounts, and I think \u201cAccess\u201d is the most appropriate choice here. It aligns well with what\u2019s being described. Now that I've made my decision, I can prepare to finalize this categorization. It's straightforward: I just need to convey the choice clearly, ensuring that it's accurate and fits the context. Let\u2019s go ahead and wrap this up!"
