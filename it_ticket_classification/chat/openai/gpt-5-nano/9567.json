It seems like the main task involves duplicating a report, so it doesn't relate to hardware or HR matters. I\u2019m considering options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access.\" Since it's primarily an administrative task regarding the reporting system, that feels like the best fit!**Deciding on the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering that this task could fall under \"Internal Project,\" especially since it involves cloning a report. However, \"Administrative rights\" seems to suggest permissions rather than the task itself. I find \"Miscellaneous\" too broad to apply here. Since the user's request talks about cloning, it might fit more under \"Internal Project.\" Yet, there's no category explicitly about reports. I could also consider it \"Administrative rights\" if it involves logging into a reporting system, but that feels off too.**Choosing the right category**\n\nLooking at the options, \"Access\" is not suitable since it deals with rights rather than the task itself. \"Purchase\" relates to buying, and cloning a report isn\u2019t a purchase\u2014it's just related to purchase orders. \"Storage\" and \"Hardware\" don't fit either. \"Administrative rights\" could apply if cloning needed permissions, but the ticket doesn\u2019t mention that. So, I'm focusing on \"Internal Project\" as it seems to align best with creating or managing tasks related to cloning the report.**Finalizing the category response**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize the ticket as \"Miscellaneous,\" especially since it might fit for changes that don\u2019t neatly fit elsewhere. But given the specific action of cloning a report, \"Internal Project\" feels more accurate since it\u2019s tied to completing a task within a project framework. I'll provide a clean JSON object to respond, following the schema given: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nThat should be perfect! I\u2019ll just make sure it\u2019s valid JSON without any extra information."
