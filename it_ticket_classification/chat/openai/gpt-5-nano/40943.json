The ticket mentions issues accessing job ads on a tablet and mobile phone, which clearly indicates an access problem. Looking at the provided categories\u2014like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Access\"\u2014it's straightforward. So, I\u2019ll compile a JSON output with the category set to \"Access.\" This reflects the user's reported issue accurately, ensuring the ticket is routed correctly for support!  \n{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI need to format the response precisely as specified: outputting a JSON object with the key \"category.\" The required format calls for something like {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to ensure there's no additional text and that it's valid JSON. Although I\u2019m considering if \"Access\" is the best fit\u2014maybe \"Hardware\" could work too if it\u2019s a device issue? But since the user can't access the site on a tablet, I think \"Access\" is still more appropriate.  \n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
