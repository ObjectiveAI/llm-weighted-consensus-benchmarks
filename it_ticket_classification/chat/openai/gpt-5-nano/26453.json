It mentions a problem related to \"oracle completion,\" which makes me think it might link to the Oracle database. There are mixed terms about an \"annual leave\" and \"hitting submit,\" making it a bit messy to decipher. I\u2019ll categorize it into one of the predefined categories such as \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access\" and output that as a JSON object.**Classifying IT issues**\n\nIt looks like this ticket is regarding an Oracle completion problem related to form submission. I have to decide how to categorize it. The options include \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" This seems like an internal IT matter, possibly falling under \"Miscellaneous\" since there's no explicit mention of \"Software.\" However, \"Internal Project\" could work if it relates to a project, but I think my best guess is to go with \"Miscellaneous.\"**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe guidelines say I should provide a category value string in a specific JSON-like format. While it seems logical to categorize it as \"Internal Project\" due to its association with the Oracle completion issue, the unclear content might mean \"Miscellaneous\" is a safer choice. I need to create a JSON object for the category value and stick to the required output format. In the end, I'll categorize this IT ticket as either \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\"{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
