It\u2019s possible that it fits under \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Access,\" as it involves completing necessary forms for a new employee.**Classifying the ticket**\n\nI\u2019m feeling like this ticket is more HR or administrative in nature rather than IT. There's a mention of \"Access,\" which could relate to system access for a new starter. The content references a \"new starter,\" an induction form, and an attached return form. I need to decide between \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since it doesn\u2019t mention permissions or admin rights, it seems more appropriate to classify it as \"HR Support\" since it\u2019s focused on onboarding tasks.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize the IT ticket, so I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object. The correct format will include the \"category\" string, and I should go with \"HR Support\" since the ticket is about onboarding, as it mentions \"starter form induction.\" While \"Access\" could be relevant too, the focus here is definitely on HR matters, making \"HR Support\" the better choice. My final output will look like: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
