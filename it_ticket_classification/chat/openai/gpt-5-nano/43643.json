It's primarily about accessing files through a browser and involves insecure connection warnings. While it might lean towards \"Administrative rights\" if it\u2019s about permissions, the main issue is related to opening Excel, which suggests it's an application problem rather than hardware. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" since it revolves around file access and browser security issues.
