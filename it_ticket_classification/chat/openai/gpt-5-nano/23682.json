Since the ticket is in English and requests multiple reports for December, it seems more fitting for \"Internal Project.\" It looks like it involves generating reports by client, which is workload-oriented. I should categorize it accordingly and respond with the JSON format, including the required category field.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}  \n\nI\u2019m deciding on the response format for the ticket. While \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d seems safer, the task looks more aligned with \u201cInternal Project\u201d since it's about generating several reports for December. This involves various summary reports and isn't about hardware, so I think \u201cInternal Project\u201d fits better. I\u2019ll make sure the JSON format is correct with the enumerated value included, then return: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, keeping it clear and simple without any extra comments."
