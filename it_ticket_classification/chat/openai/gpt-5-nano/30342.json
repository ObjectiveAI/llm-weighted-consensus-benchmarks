The system offers categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since it's focused on HR nominations and feedback, the most fitting category appears to be \"HR Support.\" Alternatively, it could also be \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but \"HR Support\" seems most appropriate. I\u2019ll output a JSON object with the selected category property.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe user asked for help in categorizing an IT ticket, and my instinct tells me that \"HR Support\" is the best fit since it\u2019s about an award nomination. But the text also mentions a \"zone tab under communities drop down,\" which hints at a user interface navigation issue. This could also point to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" if it's about navigating that drop-down. Given the messy nature of the text, \"Miscellaneous\" might work too. I need to clarify the primary issue!**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe category list doesn\u2019t include \"Navigation\" or \"UI.\" I think \"Access\" might fit because of the mention of the \"zone tab,\" but the text also contains evaluation comments about a nominee, indicating it\u2019s about a nomination review. Since it's part of an internal nomination workflow, \"Internal Project\" seems appropriate too. However, the \"HR Support\" category stands out because the phrase \"zone award nomination\" strongly implies this involves HR processes. It makes sense to categorize it as \"HR Support.\" So, I\u2019ll output a JSON object with that category.**Structuring JSON Response**\n\nThe system instruction is clear: I need to categorize an IT ticket. Since the allowed categories are specified in the JSON schema, I plan to respond with a JSON object that includes a category field. The instructions indicate that I should output a JSON object with \"category\": \"HR Support.\" So my final output will be concise and proper JSON, containing only the necessary information. I\u2019ll provide the following response:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
