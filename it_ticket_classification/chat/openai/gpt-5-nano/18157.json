I should structure my response as a JSON object with a category property reflecting the best fit. Given the focus on \"recurrent tickets\" and \"weekly tasks,\" it likely belongs in the \"Miscellaneous\" category.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize this IT ticket and ruling out options like hardware, HR, access, and storage. The text seems to focus on recurring tasks and logs, so it could fit under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it mentions \"service now,\" which connects to project work, it's leaning toward \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and respond with a JSON object setting the category to \"Internal Project.\"**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nI need to provide a response with an appropriate category based on the allowed values: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the analysis, \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems like the right fit. The system requires a JSON object with the category property properly formatted. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward and respond only with the JSON output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This approach meets the requirements without adding unnecessary text."
