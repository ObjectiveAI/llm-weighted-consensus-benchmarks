It mentions things like \u201cbackup inserts,\u201d \u201cdatabase structure,\u201d and \u201cassign,\u201d but the text is a bit garbled. \n\nFrom what I can make out, it seems focused on backups and databases. I\u2019m leaning towards the \u201cStorage\u201d category because of the backup references, but it might also fit as an \u201cInternal Project\u201d if it relates to a specific project. I have to decide the best fit!**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI'm looking at categories for an IT ticket: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. \n\nThe ticket mentions backups, database structure, and assigning an instance, which seems related to \u201cStorage.\u201d There's also a hint of an \u201cAccess\u201d request, but it\u2019s not clear. The mention of \u201cFriday PM\u201d adds some scheduling context, and \u201cneon inserts instances\u201d might imply something about the Neon cloud, but that part is tricky. \n\nOverall, I think the best category is \u201cStorage,\u201d so I\u2019ll respond with the appropriate JSON object.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
