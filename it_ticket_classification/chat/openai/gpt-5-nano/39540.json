The text mentions deleting the form and issues related to bereavement days, which seems HR-related. So, \"HR Support\" looks like a suitable category since it pertains to absence forms and HR processes. However, there might also be an access issue, which could place it under \"Administrative rights\" if permission is needed for deletion.**Categorizing IT request**\n\nThe user's repeated request to \"delete absence form\" indicates this issue relates to the HR system, so I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"HR Support.\" While I considered \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" it doesn\u2019t fit those categories since it\u2019s specifically about HR. \"Administrative rights\" might come into play if permissions are needed, but the user doesn't mention them needing access. The mention of bereavement days reinforces that \"HR Support\" is indeed the most fitting choice.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
