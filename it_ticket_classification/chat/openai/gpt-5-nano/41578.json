From what the user says, it seems they have a problem submitting their annual leave request in the Oracle system on Tuesday. They're trying to enter leave from last week but can\u2019t select any task detail needed for the submission. I believe I should categorize this as \"HR Support\" and output a JSON object with {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} for clarity.**Finalizing JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m ready to produce the final answer as a JSON object. Since the user simply asked me to categorize the IT ticket and not diagnose it, I'm focusing on providing just the classification. The schema indicates that I need to present this in a specific format. So, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON string: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Keeping it straightforward and ensuring it matches the required format is key here. Let\u2019s deliver that!"
