I need to categorize this request into one of the listed categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The mention of an approval workflow and cost centre suggests it might pertain to an IT process or workflow change. I\u2019m leaning toward \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights\" as possible categories.**Evaluating Approval Flow Change**\n\nThe request revolves around changing the approval flow, moving approvals to a different person or cost centre while ensuring transactions can still be approved without disrupting existing processes. They mention needing more details and provided terms like \"PM flow change,\" \"cost centre,\" and \"manual.\" This seems like it could fit the \"Internal Project\" category since it's about modifying an internal workflow. However, \"Access\" could also fit, as this pertains to approval permissions. \"Administrative rights\" might apply if they're seeking to assign approval rights, but it's primarily about workflow changes.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since this involves changing the Oracle approval flow, it feels more like a system or project task rather than hardware or HR. I'm contemplating whether to categorize it as \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" The user's message outlines a request for a workflow change in approvals, so I'll need to output the category in a JSON format as instructed.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
