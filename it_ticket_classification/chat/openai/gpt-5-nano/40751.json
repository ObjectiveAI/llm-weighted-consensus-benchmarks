The phrase about why the expense report reached approval points to an approval workflow related to purchasing and reimbursements. \"Administrative rights\" is less likely to apply here, so I\u2019ll stick with \"Purchase.\" I should respond with the category in a JSON-like object format, ensuring no extra text is included.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
