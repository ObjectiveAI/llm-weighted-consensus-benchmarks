It seems to relate to HR due to the nature of the request. The categories provided include \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights,\" but given the error message about leave scheduling, \"HR Support\" seems most appropriate. This issue pertains specifically to leave management, so I'll format my response as a JSON object with \"HR Support\" as the chosen category.**Outputting JSON Format**\n\nI see that the instruction requires me to output a JSON object. It specifies the category as \"HR Support.\" Since the user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, I need to stick to the required format and respond appropriately with just the JSON. So, my answer will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI need to ensure accuracy in matching the braces and follow the structure as indicated in the prompt. It's important to avoid adding any extra text and just deliver the JSON object. Let's proceed!"
