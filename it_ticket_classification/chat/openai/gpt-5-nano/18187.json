From what I can gather, it relates to career development and promotions, so I need to categorize it properly. I see references to grade increases, role changes, and promotions, which might fall under \"HR Support.\" There are also mentions of job titles and salary adjustments, so those details could be \"Administrative rights.\" Let's break it down into the appropriate categories according to the JSON schema!**Selecting the right category**\n\nI need to pick the category that fits the user's ticket about career development, promotions, grade increases, salary changes, and job title history. The most suitable category seems to be \"HR Support.\" It covers topics related to HR systems, promotions, salary adjustments, and title changes. Since the provided JSON schema requires a category string, I will respond with a JSON object, specifying \"HR Support\" while ensuring proper capitalization. I won\u2019t include anything extraneous\u2014just the essential output!**Delivering category in JSON**\n\nI\u2019m ready to provide the response in the exact format needed: a JSON object that specifies the category as \"HR Support.\" I need to make sure the formatting is perfect, as it\u2019s crucial for the user to receive it correctly. The outer wrapper has to be plain without any extra details. So, I\u2019ll just deliver it as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This way, I'm ensuring everything is delivered precisely as required!"
