It clearly mentions \"new monitor,\" \"second monitor,\" and even some location details. From the categories provided\u2014like Hardware, Purchase, and Miscellaneous\u2014the Hardware category stands out as the most fitting since it relates to monitor hardware. It could be a Purchase if they\u2019re requesting a new monitor, but overall, Hardware seems like the best category.**Preparing category output**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket and follow the instruction to provide a JSON-like format. The ticket mentions terms like \"second monitor\" and \"new monitor,\" which could imply an issue with hardware, or possibly a request to purchase a new monitor. If it\u2019s about requesting a new item, then \"Purchase\" might fit better. Ultimately, since it leans toward hardware issues and clarifications, I\u2019ll consider that when finalizing the output as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Finalizing category output**\n\nI'm looking at this rather jumbled text about a \"new monitor\" and something about a \"second monitor\" that needs to be returned. It sounds like they borrowed it from a colleague and are trying to clarify the return details. The main focus here is monitors and hardware issues. Given the context, the safest category is \"Hardware.\" \n\nAccording to the instruction, I\u2019ll stick to the required format and finalize my output as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
