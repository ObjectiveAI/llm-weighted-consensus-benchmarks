They\u2019re asking about a policy that allows this kind of purchase within the past two years, so it seems to involve asset management. \n\nGiven the context, I think the best category for this ticket would be \"Purchase.\" However, I should also consider if \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights\" fits. I\u2019ll decide on the most appropriate category.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nIt looks like this IT ticket is about the policy on asset purchases related to resignations, which ties to procurement policy. The category \"Purchase\" seems to fit best since it directly involves acquiring assets. While \"HR Support\" could apply due to the resignation aspect, the focus is on policy. \n\nI'll format the output as a JSON-like object with the selected \"Purchase\" category. It'll look like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.**Confirming Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about whether this ticket might fit into \"HR Support\" since it relates to resignation policy. However, the mention of the \"policy which allows purchase past two years\" makes me lean more towards \"Purchase\" since it focuses on asset acquisition. \n\nSo, I\u2019ve decided to stick with \"Purchase\" as the final category. I\u2019ll format it concisely as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. That sounds clear and straightforward!"
