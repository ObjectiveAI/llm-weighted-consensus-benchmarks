The ticket clearly mentions \"purchase request\" and notes about approval, allocation, and installation. It fits well within the \"Purchase\" category since that's the main focus. While there is mention of \"tower installation,\" the primary request is still about purchasing. I\u2019ll return a JSON object with the category set as \"Purchase.\" Let's make it concise and focus on that category. \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}**Providing category JSON**\n\nI need to make sure I structure the response correctly based on the given schema. The instruction is clear: categorize the IT ticket in the specified JSON format. It states that the output should be an object with the \"category\" property, which is a string. So, rather than nesting it further, I\u2019ll just stick to what is required. The right response is straightforward: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
