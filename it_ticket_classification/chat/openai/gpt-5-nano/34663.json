The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It seems most likely to fit under \"Hardware\" if it relates to meeting room equipment. However, it could also be \"Miscellaneous\" since it\u2019s not a perfect fit for any specific category.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI see that \"meeting room\" might indicate audio-visual equipment, and \"issue with phone\" suggests hardware. The original user phrase is a bit jumbled but seems to relate to experiencing issues with the meeting room in Frankfurt and Taipei. While \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could be possibilities, I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit since it relates to the equipment. \"Miscellaneous\" can be a safe choice for unclear situations. I should propose the category as a JSON-like object while potentially asking for clarification.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nI need to provide a category in the required JSON format. The interface calls for a \"category\" field, which must be one of the specified values. Given the user's mention of the meeting room and issues with the phone, I'll choose \"Hardware\" since it relates to equipment. It's valid to say that meeting room issues may also involve AV hardware. So, I\u2019ll output the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, ensuring it\u2019s formatted correctly and without any extra commentary."
