They seem to be requesting something related to a new Oracle project and code creation, mentioning a form and asking for additional information. The categories available include Hardware, HR Support, Access, and Internal Project among others. Given that it relates to a new project, \"Internal Project\" seems most plausible, but I also wonder if it could fit into \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights\" since they talk about creating code.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize the IT ticket based on the user's input about a \"new project\" in Oracle. The term \"pm\" could refer to \"Project Manager\" or just a time reference, but \"Internal Project\" seems like the best match for this request. I've got the instructions to respond in a JSON format, so I need to create the object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It's important to ensure the quotes and format are correct, confirming that \"Internal Project\" is in line with the categories specified."
