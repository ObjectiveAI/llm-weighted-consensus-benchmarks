The text mentions accessing and modifying a template, specifically regarding name changes and emergencies.\n\nI think it fits into either the \"Access\" category or \"Administrative rights.\" It clearly relates to permissions needed to modify template names, which seems central to the user's request. It appears to involve managing a document or template within an IT system.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm figuring out how to categorize this ticket, which is requesting access to a template and changes to its name. The categories I'm considering are \"Access\" for requesting the template access and \"Administrative rights\" for the ability to modify the name.\n\nSince it involves changing the template name, \"Administrative rights\" seems more precise. However, both categories could apply. The user's request highlights the necessity for access to manage the template effectively.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" for categorizing this ticket. The list includes both, so it's important to choose wisely. The ticket references gaining access to a template and changing its name, but changing the name feels like the more significant action, which falls under administrative rights.\n\nGiven that template management is central to the request, I think \"Administrative rights\" is the most appropriate category. Now, I should prepare a JSON response with that category value!**Preparing the JSON response**\n\nI'm focusing on how to respond to the instruction to categorize the IT ticket. The request specifies that I should provide the response in JSON format.\n\nI need to ensure that my response matches the schema they provided. So, I\u2019ll format it as `{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}` without any additional text or commentary, as that should satisfy the requirement. This format seems straightforward and should work perfectly!"
