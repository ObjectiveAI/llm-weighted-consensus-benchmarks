The reference to \"change approvers\" connects to access control and permissions, suggesting it relates more to administrative rights. However, \"Access\" could work well if we keep that distinction. There's also something about other odd phrases like \"friday december pm gone wild\" that makes me think it could fit into \"Miscellaneous\" too. Ultimately, I\u2019m deciding on \"Access\" as the safest choice, so I\u2019ll format it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Delivering Category Response**\n\nI see that the system requires a \"category\" object with a \"category\" field. Based on our previous discussion, I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I could ask clarifying questions, but since the user specifically asked for a categorization, I think it\u2019s best to provide the answer directly. I want to make sure I'm delivering exactly what\u2019s needed, so let's get this formatted and sent out!"
