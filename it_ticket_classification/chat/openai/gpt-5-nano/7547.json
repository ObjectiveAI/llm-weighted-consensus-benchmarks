The user's mention of \"galaxy\" seems ambiguous \u2014 it could refer to a group name or system. \n\n\"Add member\" might suggest this is about Access or Administrative rights, but could also fit under Miscellaneous or Internal Project if it pertains to a mailing list for a project.**Categorizing Access Rights**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the IT ticket and considering the relevant categories. \"Administrative rights\" typically involve granting permissions or admin privileges, while \"Access\" relates to general access rights. Since \"mailing\" suggests something about an email list and there's no specific category for that, it could fit into either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The word \"galaxy\" might be a project name or system. Given the context, I'd lean towards categorizing it as \"Access,\" as it seems more aligned with managing a mailing list than actual administrative permissions.**Finalizing the Category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to categorize this IT ticket. Since there isn\u2019t a specific category for Email or Distribution lists, I could consider \"Miscellaneous,\" but it's clearer to categorize it under \"Access.\" In IT ticket tasks, adding a member typically relates to granting access to a system or resource, so I\u2019ll go with that. I need to confirm and provide just the required JSON object, which will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
