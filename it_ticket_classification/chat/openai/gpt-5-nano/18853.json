The content suggests it's focused on approvals involving purchases in the Oracle system. Given this, it makes sense to categorize it under \"Purchase\" due to its connection with requisitions and approvals. However, there\u2019s also a chance it may relate to \"Access\" if the issue involves lacking permission to approve. I'll clarify this in the JSON object.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe mention of \"approve button\" and potential \"administrative rights\" suggests this user might lack permission to approve, which could lead to categorizing it under \"Administrative rights.\" However, given it's mainly about requisition approvals, \"Purchase\" seems more fitting. I don\u2019t think it fits under \"HR Support\" or \"Internal Project,\" and even \"Miscellaneous\" seems vague. So, the best choice is \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object reflecting this category without adding extra text.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
