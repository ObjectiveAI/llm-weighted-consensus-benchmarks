The user has mentioned having trouble extracting reports and accessing their previous view rights, which seems to imply a permissions issue. \n\nI see two potential categories: \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since this is mainly about permissions related to reports, it looks like it might fit best under \"Access.\" I\u2019ll go with that choice for now.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've got a user request about Oracle issues with reports that includes access to view rights and the ability to extract reports. It sounds like it should go into the \"Access\" category since it's mainly about user permissions. However, \"Administrative rights\" also comes into play since that's about more specific permissions for admins. I need to decide if this ticket fits better under the general \"Access\" category or the more specific \"Administrative rights.\" It\u2019s a bit tricky!**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned \"current view right\" and \"previously had option,\" which suggests they are having permission issues accessing and extracting reports. I think I should categorize this ticket as \"Access.\"\n\nNow, I need to format my response as a JSON object that matches the schema provided. It should look like this:\n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nBut I have to be sure to follow the schema correctly. So, I\u2019ll respond with:\n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Access\"}}. That should do the trick!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
