The user provided a ticket about a \"connection problem\" that's impacting client work and marked as high importance. This suggests the issue is urgent and likely falls under the \"Access\" category since it involves connectivity issues. I can then output a JSON object that aligns with this structure: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt looks like this is a network connectivity issue. I have several category options like Hardware, HR Support, and Access, but \"Access\" seems the most fitting since it's related to connection problems. Although it could also relate to Hardware due to cable issues, the user specifically mentions trouble connecting. Therefore, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" \n\nI'll respond strictly with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra comments or explanations."
