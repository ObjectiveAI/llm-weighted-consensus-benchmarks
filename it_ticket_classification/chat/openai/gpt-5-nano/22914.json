There's a bit of hardware mention, but it's not the core focus. I\u2019ll go ahead and categorize this ticket strictly under HR. The user asked for a categorized JSON object, and based on the guidelines, I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This should keep everything clear and organized!**Finalizing JSON Response**\n\nI've been thinking about the best way to categorize this, and I believe \"HR Support\" is indeed the most fitting choice. I briefly considered \"Administrative rights,\" but that's not quite right for this context. So, I'll go ahead and format the final output strictly as JSON, without any extra text. I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This should keep things clear and concise!"
