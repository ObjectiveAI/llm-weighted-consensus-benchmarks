Given the mention of notification flow and incident warnings, it's clearly about retrieving archived emails. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll create a JSON object indicating \"category\" as \"Storage,\" since that aligns with the purpose of the IT incident ticket.**Outputting JSON for IT ticket**\n\nThe user has prompted me to categorize an IT ticket and provided a schema for the output format, which requires a JSON object with a \"category\" field. I\u2019ll focus on ensuring that my response follows that schema correctly. \n\nBased on the content about not being able to retrieve archived emails, \"Storage\" is clearly the appropriate choice, as it's a storage-related issue. Therefore, I\u2019ll produce the final JSON object as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}\n\nI'll make sure there isn't any extra text or whitespace in my response."
