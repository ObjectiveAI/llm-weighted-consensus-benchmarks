The ticket text indicates a problem, mentioning \u201cOracle\u201d and issues with entering data from last week, suggesting a data entry issue. It could fall under categories like Access or Miscellaneous. I\u2019ll focus on understanding the user\u2019s request and decide if it fits better under Access for admin issues. This parsing might be messy, but I believe it\u2019s essential to categorize it accurately.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI notice the user states they \"cannot enter data for last week,\" pointing to a data entry problem. The phrases like \"please help again\" and \"code usable\" are a bit confusing. I can categorize this as Access due to potential issues with permissions or logins. \"Administrative rights\" might also fit if they lack necessary permissions. \"Miscellaneous\" could work if I'm unsure, but Access seems like the best fit here. I'll go with that!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user mentions they \"cannot enter data for last week,\" which suggests a problem with data entry linked to permissions, possibly related to the Oracle database. The phrase \"hello again code usable\" could hint at a code snippet. If the user needed administrative rights, that would be different, but here, it seems to be an access issue. The best category for this ticket would be \"Access.\" I\u2019ll output that in the required JSON format. \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
