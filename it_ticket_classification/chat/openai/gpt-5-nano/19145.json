The phrase \"code setup\" suggests they want help setting something up. Since it's related to a project in Oracle, it seems to fit best under an Internal Project. However, it could also be viewed as an access request\u2014hmm, I need to decide!**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm looking at the ticket categories, and \"new project code\" suggests an Internal Project, since it indicates a new project creation in the system. \"Oracle Fusion\" is the relevant product, and \"code setup\" likely refers to configuration tasks. While \"pm code setup\" could imply project management, they\u2019re not asking for access or hardware support. It seems most logical to categorize this under Internal Project, as it involves creating a new project code in Oracle Fusion. Let's go with that!**Formatting IT Ticket as JSON**\n\nI need to output the categorization of the IT ticket as a JSON object. The request is clear: it should include a \"category\" field, and the value must come from the enumerated categories. The schema does provide guidance, focusing on the proper format. While I need to produce just the category value in a JSON object, the example shows it's simply formatted like this: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. So, I\u2019ll finalize my response as {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}"
