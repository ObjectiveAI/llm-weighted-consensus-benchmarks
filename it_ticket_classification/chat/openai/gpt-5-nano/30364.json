Given that they mention \"extension cord\" multiple times, it clearly relates to hardware. While it could potentially fit under \"Purchase,\" it seems more accurate to categorize it as \"Hardware\" since extension cords are indeed hardware equipment. I'll response with a JSON-like object, specifically {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, to fulfill the user's request effectively.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to return the appropriate category for the ticket. While \"Purchase\" could be relevant if they're seeking to buy an extension cord, the phrasing in their message doesn\u2019t make that clear. Given that it's most explicitly about an extension cord, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware\" since it's hardware-related. I'll ensure the output is a JSON object as required, specifically formatting it as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} without any extra explanations, sticking to the instructions."
