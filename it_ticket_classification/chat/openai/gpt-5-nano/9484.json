The request seems related to granting access since someone joined today and they mentioned a \"shared folder per attached.\" Considering the categories available, \"Access\" appears to be the most fitting since it directly relates to permissions. However, it could also touch on \"Storage\" if it pertains to shared storage. \"Administrative rights\" might work if they need specific permissions, but \"Access\" is general enough for this context.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI see the ticket mentions a \"shared folder\" and indicates a new employee, which typically means they are requesting access. The most fitting category here is \"Access.\" I need to respond in the specified format, ensuring the output is a JSON object that contains the category. The instruction clearly states we should provide a category field. So, I\u2019ll produce the output as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, while keeping it concise. It's straightforward, even if the text is somewhat repetitive.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
