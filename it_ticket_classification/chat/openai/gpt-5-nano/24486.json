I need to figure out whether to classify it under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it's focused on access control and permissions, \"Access\" seems like the better fit.**Categorizing Access Rights**\n\nThe ticket concerns editing access rights for a \"starter leavers folder.\" I\u2019m considering whether to classify it under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" While \"Administrative rights\" generally implies broader system privileges, this request is focused on granting access to the folder. Given that it's primarily about folder access rather than system-level admin rights, \"Access\" seems to be the right choice. I'll need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category as \"Access.\"**Responding with JSON**\n\nThe system requires the category to be provided as a string in JSON format. Therefore, I'll respond simply with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI shouldn\u2019t include extra commentary since the user requested just the category. It\u2019s essential to stick to the specified format. So, confirming, I will provide only the JSON response without any additional text. Let\u2019s implement that now!"
