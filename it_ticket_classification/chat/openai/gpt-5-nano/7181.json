The user mentions error codes and issues with the upgrade process that have removed apps and caused errors. It seems like the most appropriate category from the provided list would be \"Miscellaneous,\" since \"Software\" isn\u2019t an option. I want to ensure I'm placing it correctly!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize the IT ticket, which mainly discusses OS installation failures related to partitions and drives. While \"Storage\" seems to fit well due to their mention, I also considered \"Administrative rights,\" but that's a stretch. The user refers to the senior developer and scheduling, but ultimately, \"Storage\" makes the most sense as it aligns with the focus on partitions. I'll format the output as a JSON object per the instructions.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
