The user mentions issues with remote connections and logging in, which leads me to think it falls under a specific category. The options available include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the context, it seems most relevant to choose \"Access,\" as it relates to their remote connection troubles.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m identifying a remote access issue, which probably fits under the \"Access\" category, or perhaps \"Technical access.\" Since \"Access\" is directly relevant, I'll craft my response as a JSON object with the category field. The output needs to be in a specific format that follows the required schema. \n\nSo, my final answer should simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nI\u2019m ensuring I only include the needed information without any extra text.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
