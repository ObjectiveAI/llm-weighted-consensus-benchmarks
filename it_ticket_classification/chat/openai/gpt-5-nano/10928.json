The ticket mentions booking meeting rooms, guest passwords, and storage areas, suggesting it's primarily about access. It seems like the best fit could be \"Access\" since the user is requesting access-related items. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also work due to the mention of guest passwords. I\u2019ll analyze further to choose the most appropriate category.**Deciding on category**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on the provided string. The key phrases suggest it's primarily about access since there are mentions of \"guest passwords\" and tasks like \"book meeting rooms\" and \"library view docs.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could fit, it seems more about general access rather than special rights. The best choice looks like \"Access,\" so I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON with just that category: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
