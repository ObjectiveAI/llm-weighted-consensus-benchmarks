The user mentions a \"new project code request\" and includes terms like \"oracle,\" \"attached code,\" and \"log against.\" These keywords are a bit messy, but it seems to point towards an access request\u2014possibly relating to an Oracle database user or project. It might fit as an \u201cAccess\u201d request due to the nature of the request for project codes and administrative rights.**Analyzing ticket categorization**\n\nI'm evaluating how to categorize this ticket about the \"new project code request.\" It seems like it could fit under \"Access\" since the request may relate to obtaining access codes or resources, possibly linked to \"Administrative rights\" for elevated permissions. While there's a mention of \"Oracle,\" I\u2019m not sure if it implies administrative access or something simpler. \n\nThe main takeaway is that the \"Access\" category seems most logical for this request, given the context.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe user mentioned \"Please attached code,\" indicating they might be looking for specific code to be attached. The phrase \"log against\" suggests they want to log something in a system. I see a few options: it could fit under \"Miscellaneous\" if it's too ambiguous, but \"Access\" seems like the best choice since they are requesting access to a new project code in Oracle, which could relate to internal project management. Overall, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Internal Project\" or \"Access\" based on the context.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThis ticket is focused on creating an internal project code in Oracle, rather than regarding access rights or hardware issues. Therefore, it fits best in the \"Internal Project\" category. When the user mentioned, \"code hi guys please attached code,\" it seems they were asking for something to be attached. I'll prepare a JSON object with the required category field: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI\u2019ll avoid adding any extra comments since the instruction is clear about providing just the classification."
