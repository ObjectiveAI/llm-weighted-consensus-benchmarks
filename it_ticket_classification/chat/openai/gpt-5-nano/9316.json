The clear terms indicate it relates to access permissions, suggesting \"Access\" is a strong fit. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also apply since it deals with permission levels. I'm weighing both options and trying to determine which category best aligns with what the user needs. I'll lean towards classifying this as \"Access.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI've been asked to categorize an IT ticket with content about arranging permissions for a shared drive. The key phrases suggest it's centered around access rights, leading me to think \"Access\" would be the primary category. There might be a case for \"Administrative rights,\" but since the user didn't mention elevated privileges, I feel more confident with \"Access.\" This option covers their request effectively, so I\u2019ll categorize it as Access."
