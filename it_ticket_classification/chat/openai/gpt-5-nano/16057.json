Considering the content, it seems most appropriate to categorize it under \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Access,\" as it relates to managing visibility for members. I'll go with \"Internal Project\" since it aligns with project management requests.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket. The text mentions a \"project list,\" \"visibility,\" and \"members,\" which makes me think it\u2019s about creating a project list with certain access permissions. I\u2019m weighing between categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" or \"Access.\" Since it deals with project management and visibility for team members, I believe \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. However, \"Access\" could also be relevant for the permissions aspect.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
