The ticket could potentially fit into \"Internal Project,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Access,\" considering the focus on data security and encryption processes. Since it\u2019s about disk encryption, which involves access control, I\u2019m leaning towards the \"Access\" category or maybe \"Administrative rights.\" I want to ensure I choose the category that best reflects the ticket's intent!**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI'm thinking that this IT ticket could fit under \"Internal Project\" because it involves a project for data encryption. However, it also relates to \"Storage,\" given that encryption is connected to data storage. \"Administrative rights\" might apply, but it's not explicitly mentioned. Since the ticket discusses encrypting a folder and includes steps for implementation, I believe categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" makes the most sense. The response should be a JSON object with the category property, like `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`.**Choosing the right category**\n\nThe content mentions \"disk encryption\" multiple times and indicates a security process involving an incident, possibly related to \"VIR.\" There are no specifics about hardware, so my best guess for categorization is \"Internal Project.\" However, I also consider \"Access\" since encrypting folders may require access controls, but it's not explicitly stated. Since the user is asking for just the category, I\u2019ll provide a JSON object formatted like this: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`, ensuring it aligns with the required schema."
