It seems to involve onboarding someone and possibly granting access rights. The categories I can choose from are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nGiven the context, it sounds like I should classify it under \"HR Support\" for onboarding a new employee. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object accordingly.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding how to categorize an IT ticket that mentions a \"new starter\" in Belgrade. Given the content, it seems to be about granting access rights, which leans toward the \"Access\" category. Alternatively, it could be \"Administrative rights,\" especially since there's an \"administrator\" mentioned. There's also a mention of an attachment related to the joiner, suggesting it's about onboarding. So, I'll go with \"Access\" as it fits best with access provisioning for the new user.**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m settling on the best category for this IT ticket, which seems to involve account creation and access provisioning. The mention of \"administrator\" hints that this person might handle it. Since \"joiner\" refers to a new employee, I'll categorize it as \"Access,\" which aligns with provisioning steps. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit if it were about granting admin privileges, there's no clear indication of that. So, I'll output the final JSON with the category \"Access.\"**Providing the Response**\n\nThe system has prompted me to categorize the IT ticket. I know I should follow the required format and output a JSON object with the \"category\" property. Based on my earlier reasoning, the most suitable category is \"Access.\" I'll make sure to format my response correctly without extra commentary. So, I'll proceed to produce exactly:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
