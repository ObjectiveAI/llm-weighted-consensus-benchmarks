However, since they specifically want to change ownership themselves, that leans more toward \"Administrative rights.\" It looks like I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as Administrative rights and craft a response including that in JSON format.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to format my response as a JSON object, specifically with a \"category\" field that reflects the user's ticket classification. \n\nI'll set the \"category\" to \"Administrative rights.\" The instruction emphasizes that the response should contain only the JSON object without any extra text. So, I'll just go with this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}\n\nI just need to be sure about the escaping and keep it simple. Now, I\u2019m ready to finalize this response!"
