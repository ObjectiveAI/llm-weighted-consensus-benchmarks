The ticket mentions adding to Confluence and seems somewhat garbled. It hints at issues with access or permissions, which makes \"Access\" the most fitting category. While there are references to adding users, it doesn't seem like an internal project, so I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" since it aligns with user permissions in Confluence.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe request to \"add to Confluence\" seems to relate to granting access, so I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Access.\" While it could also imply \"Administrative rights\" if they want to grant admin capabilities, the garbled text leans more towards access issues, particularly about user addition. I\u2019ll format the output as JSON. The final answer should simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, as that aligns with the request to categorize this IT ticket. Let's proceed with that."
