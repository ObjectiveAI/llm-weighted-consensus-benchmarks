The keywords provided include references to \"oracle approvals\" and other approval-related terms. Given the predefined categories available, I need to decide which one fits best. Since the ticket seems related to approvals, I\u2019m thinking \"Purchase\" might be the most appropriate category. I\u2019ll output a JSON object indicating this choice, noting it follows the required schema format.**Deciding on the IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket related to \"oracle approvals,\" which likely pertains to software license or purchase approvals. The mention of \"PM approvals\" hints at project manager oversight, with phrases like \"cost investigate resolve\" suggesting cost approval. Since \"information confidential\" indicates sensitivity, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Purchase\" as it aligns with the context of software and cost approvals. Even though \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" were considered, they don\u2019t quite match. I\u2019ll finalize the category as \"Purchase\" and format it as a JSON object.**Formatting the JSON output**\n\nI need to ensure that the JSON is valid, using proper quotes and following the specified format. The instruction confirms that \"category\" must be a string and limited to the enumerated values. Therefore, I\u2019ll go ahead and output the JSON as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019m also considering that the user might want to categorize with multiple options, but the schema only allows for one. So, I\u2019ll stick to providing just that single category in the output."
