The ticket is related to an employee leaving and includes details like the leaving date, location, and items such as mailbox, roaming profile, and AD rights. This clearly involves access management and user account deprovisioning. I think the category \"Access\" fits best, but maybe \"Administrative rights\" could also apply since it talks about specific rights and inventory tasks. It\u2019s all about the leaver\u2019s transition!**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI'm looking at the categories available, including \"Administrative rights,\" but the ticket mainly deals with access removal and deprovisioning, like mailbox deletion and AD rights. \"Access\" seems to be the best fit for this ticket. While \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" might also apply, I'm quite confident about categorizing it as \"Access.\" \n\nI need to respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"} to match the required format clearly.
