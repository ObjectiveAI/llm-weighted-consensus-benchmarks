It seems to be focused on access rights, specifically requesting write access to certain files and folders. The main categories to choose from are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since \"write access\" represents basic permission, I'll categorize it as \"Access,\" unless the user is specifically asking for escalated admin rights, which might then qualify it for \"Administrative rights.\"**Classifying IT ticket request**\n\nThe user's request is asking for \"write access\" related to files and mentions \"double rights.\" This seems to imply elevated privileges but isn't entirely clear. When classifying IT tickets, I have the categories like Access and Administrative rights to consider. Since the request focuses on write access to files, it fits better under \"Access\" rather than \"Administrative rights,\" which implies needing admin privileges. Therefore, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access,\" resulting in the final classification being JSON-like as { \"category\": \"Access\" }.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
