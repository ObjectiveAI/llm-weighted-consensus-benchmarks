However, it could also relate to \"Administrative rights\" since data wiping might require administrative access. I need to choose the best-fitting category from the options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I'll lean towards \"Storage.\"**Categorizing IT ticket again**\n\nI\u2019m considering the ticket again, and it looks like a \"data wipe request\" fits best with the \"Storage\" category, even though \"Security\" isn\u2019t provided. The text has some unclear parts, especially the mention of an \"accounts receivable accountant ext,\" which might hint at a contact person. But overall, the key is that it\u2019s about wiping data. I\u2019ll respond in the required format, outputting a JSON object with \"category\" set to \"Storage.\" A brief justification could be added to clarify the choice.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
