We have categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nThe content mentions issues with connection, DNS resolution, and server certificate verification. It highlights problems with host resolution, reconnecting instances, and possible network connectivity errors. Given all this, it seems appropriate to categorize this ticket under \"Access\" due to the connection-related issues.**Determining the right category**\n\nThis IT ticket doesn't fit \"Hardware\"; it leans more towards \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The details highlight issues with server certificate verification and problems resolving host addresses, suggesting a connection issue likely tied to DNS.\n\nThe categories we have include Access, Internal Project, Miscellaneous, and a few others. Given the focus on connectivity but lack of specific mention of accounts, I think \"Access\" fits best for network access, although \"Miscellaneous\" could work too since there's no direct category for network issues.**Choosing the category for the ticket**\n\nIf I have to pick a category, \"Miscellaneous\" feels a bit too generic. \"Access\" covers issues related to system access, and this ticket involves applying a script to connect to a service. It might even fit under \"Internal Project\" if it's related to a specific project. \n\nHowever, since the ticket describes issues like \"cannot connect\" and \"cannot resolve host address,\" \"Access\" seems the most appropriate. Therefore, I should output the response in JSON format like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
