The categories provided include \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" and others. Since this ticket relates to the acquisition of a flash drive, I think \"Purchase\" would be the most appropriate category. I\u2019ll output a JSON-like object indicating this category, formatted according to the provided instructions. Let's get this right!**Deciding on Category**\n\nI need to determine the best category for this IT ticket, which revolves around a \"new purchase order\" for a flash drive. The text suggests it concerns logging allocation and mandatory receipts, indicating a procurement or expense nature. Although it could be categorized as \"Hardware\" given the flash drive reference, the main focus is on the purchasing aspect. I conclude that \"Purchase\" fits best, so I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object indicating this category.**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with the appropriate JSON structure for the category, which is \"Purchase.\" The format requires a specific type and properties setup. So, I\u2019ll make sure my output matches the schema described in the instructions. Although it's tempting to consider \"Storage\" for the flash drive, the ticket clearly centers around creating a new purchase order. Therefore, I'll go with \"Purchase\" and deliver a concise answer in the correct format. Here\u2019s the response:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
