Given the context, it looks like an access request, so I think \"Access\" is the right category. However, I also wonder if it could fall under \"Administrative rights,\" depending on the organization's definitions.**Determining Category for Access Request**\n\nThe user is requesting access to \"friday pm,\" which suggests placing it in the \"Access\" category rather than admin rights. I think providing a JSON-like response is essential, as I'm instructed to format it. So, I'll prepare the response as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nIt seems that \"friday pm\" could refer to a platform, and categorizing it as \"Access\" makes sense. I'll stick to the instruction to just output the category without any extra explanation.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
