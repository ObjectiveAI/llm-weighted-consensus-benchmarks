The mention of an attached form makes me think this might fall under categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll classify it as \"HR Support\" since onboarding usually relates to that area.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket mentions an \"attached form\" and the location \"Belgrade.\" Without additional context, I want to be cautious and lean towards categorizing it as \"HR Support\" for onboarding. While \"Access\" might also fit, the ticket doesn't specify access rights. \"Administrative rights\" could be considered, but it feels less likely. I think \"Internal Project\" is not applicable here. So, I'll stick with \"HR Support\" and then format my response in the required JSON category structure.**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object for the category field. My plan is to format it as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. While \"Access\" could be a contender since \"new starter\" suggests account creation, the attached form makes \"HR Support\" feel more fitting. The context points towards HR for onboarding rather than just provisioning access. Even though \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could be possibilities, \"HR Support\" is the safest option related to onboarding forms.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
