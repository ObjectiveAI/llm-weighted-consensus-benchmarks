It\u2019s important to choose the right category to ensure it gets to the right team quickly, reducing back-and-forth later. I'll carefully review the ticket details and then pick the most appropriate category. Let's make sure this process goes smoothly!**Clarifying the messy text**\n\nThe text is quite jumbled, but it seems to center around issues with time sheet codes, forms, and links. There's mention of encoding help and some complaints about browser problems while trying to download or fill out these forms. Additionally, there's discussion on creating two time codes for specific tasks related to digital strategy and automation. I need to pull together these points to create a clear summary for better understanding and assistance.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm looking at this ticket that mentions issues with document setup and form plugins, but it's not related to hardware, so that rules out the Hardware category. There are problems with links and forms that suggest it could fall under \"Access.\" However, since it\u2019s also discussing digital evolution in terms of projects, it might fit \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I need to categorize it correctly and output a JSON with the category field based on the allowed options.**Deciding on the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking this ticket could be categorized as \"Access\" due to issues with forms, but phrases like \"link displays blank\" and \"document setup form plug misbehaving\" indicate software functionality problems rather than user access rights. The mention of \"digital evolution\" suggests it might fit into \"Internal Project\" since it's centered around forms and time codes related to a broader project. \"Miscellaneous\" is an option, but I prefer to be precise. I\u2019ll categorically choose \"Internal Project\" and prepare the JSON response accordingly.**Formatting the response**\n\nI see that they only need the category field in the response. The system message specifies that it should be a category object with a string from the provided enumeration. So, I\u2019ll format it like this: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}`. It\u2019s important to maintain the exact casing as stated in the enum provided. I\u2019ll keep it clear and simple, returning just the JSON object without any additional commentary. Let's proceed!"
