The ticket I have seems focused on a new purchase order, mentioning installation and receipts. Given all these details, it looks like the appropriate classification is \"Purchase,\" as it explicitly mentions purchase orders and items related to that. I'll proceed with that category choice!**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket includes phrases like \"new purchase PO,\" \"order,\" \"receipts,\" and \"installation,\" which suggest it\u2019s focused on purchasing and installing adapters. My task is to categorize this IT Ticket and output a JSON object. Based on the content, the category should be \"Purchase,\" as everything seems to center around purchase orders and receipts. I'll confirm that by formatting the output as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. That's straightforward and clear!**Finalizing JSON Output**\n\nI realize that the required format is simply to output a JSON object with the category, like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. The instructions are clear that I don\u2019t need to include additional structure like \"type\":\"object.\" They just need the category field to match the provided schema. So, I'll ensure that my final output is succinct and appropriately formatted: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. That keeps it straightforward and meets the expectations!"
