It seems best to focus on the service outage, but none of the categories explicitly mention \"Outage\" or \"Maintenance.\" So, that\u2019s a bit tricky!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the best category for this ticket. \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" could work, but \"Internal Project\" seems most suitable since the message talks about implementing a change today, indicating a maintenance window. If it were about changing admin rights, \"Administrative rights\" might fit, but that\u2019s not mentioned here. Given that it\u2019s a planned shutdown affecting users, I\u2019ll propose \"Internal Project\" as the category and prepare the JSON response.**Responding with JSON**\n\nThe instruction specifies to categorize the IT ticket without requiring an explanation. It just needs the category field, so I'll provide the JSON response directly. I\u2019ll format it correctly to ensure it\u2019s a valid JSON string with double quotes. So the response will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nThat seems straightforward enough, and I can deliver it like that without additional commentary. Let's get this done!"
