I have to make sure to pick the right one!**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI need to categorize the ticket, and while \"Infrastructure\" is mentioned in the content, it\u2019s not one of the available categories. The options are \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" and others. \n\nGiven that this ticket is about deploying Oracle at the Bogota site, \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best. \"Access\" might apply if it were about access rights to Oracle. I'll prepare to respond with a JSON-like object, specifically: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} as per the instructions.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to produce a JSON object specifically with the field \"category.\" It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, making sure the capitalization is exact since \"Internal Project\" is in the enum.\n\nWhile I considered \"Access\" because the ticket mentions \"setup,\" it seems to focus more on deploying Oracle in Bogota. So, I\u2019ll stick to the clearly fitting category. I\u2019ll ensure my final response is only this one-line JSON without any extra text. Here it is: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
