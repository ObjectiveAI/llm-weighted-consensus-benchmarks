However, \"Administrative rights\" is also a possibility.**Categorizing Role Amendments**\n\nIn categorizing the IT ticket, it seems the content focuses on role amendments and restricted roles, which likely fits under \"Access\" or more precisely, \"Administrative rights.\" There\u2019s a strong emphasis on modifying user permissions, so \"Administrative rights\" seems the most suitable option. \n\nThe ticket doesn't relate to hardware, storage, or purchases, so I\u2019m confident that the proper response would involve categorizing it as \"Administrative rights.\" I'll respond accordingly with a structured format.{\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}"
