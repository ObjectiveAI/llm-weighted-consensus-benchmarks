Looking at the category list\u2014Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights\u2014I think this request is primarily about hardware, since it\u2019s for a physical device. However, it could also fit under Purchase since they\u2019re looking to acquire the extension cord. Typically, requests for equipment like this would fall into either Hardware or Purchase categories.**Categorizing IT Ticket Request**\n\nThe user is requesting an extension cord, which clearly indicates it's a hardware request. The choices are either \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" While the request seems to fit \"Hardware\" since it's for a physical item, many IT help desks might categorize this as \"Purchase\" given it\u2019s a procurement-related request. In the output, I need to follow a specific JSON format. So I\u2019ll return: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, though \"Purchase\" could be considered if I want to reflect the procurement aspect more precisely.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
