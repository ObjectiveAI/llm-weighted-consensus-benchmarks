It seems there are multiple problems, such as issues entering hours for two date ranges, specifically before July during a system switch. There's also mention of entries not appearing, despite being copied over. It's a bit messy, but it focuses on time sheets and the difficulties the user is facing with their submissions. Let's sort this out!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user's message indicates time sheet issues, which I need to categorize. I think \"HR Support\" is the most fitting since it's related to payroll timesheets. While \"Access\" could apply due to issues entering hours, the focus is more on HR processes. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Projects\" don't seem right here. \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback, but I really feel \"HR Support\" captures the essence with terms like \"time sheets,\" \"hours,\" and \"submitted.\"{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
