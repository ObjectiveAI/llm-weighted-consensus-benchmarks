The ticket mentions \"cost estimate,\" an app, a large database, and various specifications. It looks like it's about estimating the cost for a system related to an IT project. I see mentions of access and possible changes in specifications for demand. Given these details, it seems appropriate to categorize this ticket under \"Internal Project\" or perhaps \"Miscellaneous\" since it involves multiple elements.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm reviewing the category options for this IT ticket. It could be \"Purchase\" if it's related to obtaining hardware or software based on the cost estimate. However, it seems more likely to be \"Internal Project\" since it involves a consultant, design, and specifications. The ticket also mentions a medium app, a large database, and an OS. Although \"Purchase\" might fit with the cost estimate request, \"Internal Project\" seems more appropriate given the context and details provided.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s request includes details about accessible average usage hours and whether users can temporarily adjust specifications to handle varying demand, involving a consultant. This points to planning and cost estimation for a project, rather than a purchase order. Therefore, the category \"Internal Project\" fits well. Since my task is clear and the instructions specify that I should provide a response in a JSON format, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This keeps it concise and on point!"
