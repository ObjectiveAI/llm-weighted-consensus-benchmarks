The category options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the ticket is about gaining access, it seems to fit best in the \"Access\" category. However, I also wonder if \"Administrative rights\" should be considered as a subcategory of Access since it relates to permissions, but it\u2019s listed separately. Choosing Access seems right overall.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s ticket states \"wants planning available bench accept decline requests,\" which likely refers to a planning module, possibly like SAP Planning. The term \"available bench\" could relate to \"bench time\" or a \"bench calendar.\" It seems they're requesting access to a planning tool to manage benches and respond to requests. Since it\u2019s about gaining access, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Access\" and format my response as a JSON object with the \"category\" field.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
