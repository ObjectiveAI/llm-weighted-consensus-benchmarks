It mentions reminders for report performance testing and issues with a replaced tool. Possible categories include Internal Project, Miscellaneous, or Administrative rights. Since it's largely about internal project reminders, I think \"Internal Project\" might be the best fit, though it could also go under \"Miscellaneous\" due to its ambiguous nature. Ultimately, I need to choose one category.**Parsing reminder content**\n\nLet\u2019s break down the user's message: it looks like they\u2019re referencing a weekly reminder about a performance testing report that's expired. There\u2019s mention of an \"officer reminder\" and a replaced tool, plus a request to submit a report form. This seems tied to an internal project focused on performance testing. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize this as \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll format my response in a JSON structure as required: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} to fit the expected output, though I'm pondering if plain content is also necessary.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
