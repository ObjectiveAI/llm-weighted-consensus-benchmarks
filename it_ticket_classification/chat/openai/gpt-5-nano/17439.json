The main issue revolves around how employees can identify assets. Terms like \"starter procedure\" and \"assign profile\" suggest a structured approach. It might involve inventory management, covering hardware and software assets, licenses, and associated costs. Given the categories mentioned, I think \"Internal Project\" suits the task of creating an inventory procedure best, although some aspects may relate to \"Hardware\" as well.**Categorizing Software and Hardware Assets**\n\nThe ticket mentions both software and hardware assets, particularly with a focus on licenses and costs. While \"Hardware\" typically refers only to hardware, the ticket suggests a broader scope, including software. The project seems to involve creating procedures to identify these assets by employees. I think categorizing this as an \"Internal Project\" is appropriate. I'll respond in the required format, confirming that the category is indeed \"Internal Project.\"**Finalizing JSON Response**\n\nI need to create a JSON object with the specified category. The system requires this format without any extra text, so I'll keep it simple. The category will be \"Internal Project.\" \n\nI'll finalize the response as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}  \n\nOkay, that\u2019s ready to go!"
