The messages discuss visibility issues related to annual leave days, absences, and notifications. The user mentions terms like \"annual leave days visible\" and \"submit annual leave requests,\" so it appears to be related to HR support. However, since it\u2019s an IT ticket about internal communications and forecasting, the \"HR Support\" category seems the most appropriate, even though it touches on HR processes.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm considering typical IT categories, like Access, HR Support, and Internal Project. The issue at hand seems related to permissions because the user mentions \"visibility issues\" and struggles to submit requests or see their leave days. This points toward the Access category, as it\u2019s about permissions and visibility. Since the user specifically wants me to categorize this IT ticket, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object with the category labeled as \"Access.\"**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI need to provide a brief note, focusing on the instruction to categorize. The output should just be the category in the specified format. The schema shows I need to output an object with the category, so I\u2019ll keep it simple: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I have to ensure there's no extra formatting since the system expects exact JSON. It\u2019s clear that my response should just be plain text without additional details. That's the final output!"
