The required output must be a JSON object that includes the category property. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll format it simply as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. \n\nIt seems like there's no need for any additional commentary, so I'll stick to just the required output format. Let\u2019s ensure it aligns with the schema specified in the instructions, but keep it straightforward."
