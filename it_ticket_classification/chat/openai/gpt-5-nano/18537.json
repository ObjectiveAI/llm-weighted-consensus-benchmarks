The ticket mentions decommissioning projects, validating owners, and reminding them about migration. It could potentially fit in \"Internal Project,\" considering it discusses project decommissioning and ownership migration. While \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" could apply, they don't match as closely. Ultimately, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit since the focus is on internal processes related to migration and decommissioning.**Categorizing project tasks**\n\nI see the phrase is a bit jumbled but highlights some clear tasks: validating owners, confirming their migration, providing status updates, and reminding owners about migration. It feels like a project management task within an IT framework, so I think \"Internal Project\" is the right category. \n\nNow, to format my response correctly as a JSON object: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nLet\u2019s keep it straightforward without extra explanation!"
