The text references a \"new Tuesday location change\" and \"Wednesday PM location change,\" along with mentions of employees and infrastructure. The confusion seems to revolve around locations, employees, and liabilities. The categories include \"Access\" for permissions, \"HR Support\" for onboarding, and \"Administrative rights.\" Given this context, it sounds like the ticket might fit best under \"HR Support\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI see that terms like \"location change\" and \"setup these employees\" probably relate to access provisioning. \"Setup these employees\" might mean onboarding accounts or granting access to systems, hinting at the \"Access\" category. However, there\u2019s also a possibility it involves \"Administrative rights,\" especially for admin privileges. The mention of \"infrastructure registered\" feels more governance-related and maybe not directly relevant. Clarifying questions might help narrow it down, but I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category based on the user's requests.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m tasked with categorizing a request that mentions both \"setup these employees\" and \"location change.\" The \"setup\" could imply onboarding accounts while \"location change\" might relate to access based on location, though it\u2019s a bit ambiguous. \"Administrative rights\" aren\u2019t explicitly stated here, so I believe the best fit is \"Access,\" focusing on user access to systems. While \"HR Support\" or \"Internal Project\" could be potential options, this request aligns best with \"Access.\" Now I need to format this as a JSON object with the appropriate category field.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
