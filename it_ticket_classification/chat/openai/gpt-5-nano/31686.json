The ticket text seems to revolve around code activation and inactivation, owner changes, and approvers, suggesting it should fit into a specific category. I want to map the content accurately, focusing on the request to update the codes and the involvement of different coordinators. It's essential to ensure everything is organized properly for efficient handling.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI'm assessing the right category for this IT ticket, considering options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" and \"Internal Project.\" The content mentions activating and inactivating codes, owner changes, and approvers. Since it's related to access control, it seems like a fit for the \"Access\" category. I want to draft a JSON object to encapsulate this, matching the required format with the category field included. This should help clarify the necessary steps for managing user access rights to applications and projects.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
