It mentions links becoming unavailable and instructs users to migrate their instances. It seems like it might fit into categories like \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but that's not quite right. Given the content, I think it fits better under \"Access\" since it\u2019s about instructing users to manage their access to the system.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize an IT operation communication regarding the decommissioning of an old system. \"Administrative rights\" doesn't seem fitting, but \"Internal Project\" might work if it's related to the decommissioning task. \"Access\" could relate to the links becoming unavailable, while \"Miscellaneous\" serves as a catch-all for unclear cases. Ultimately, I think it's best categorized as \"Internal Project,\" since it's about migrating and decommissioning the old version.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
