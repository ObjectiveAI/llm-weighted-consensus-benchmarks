Since the ticket asks for a specific category, \"Access\" makes the most sense because the main request centers on providing tester role access.**Categorizing the access request**\n\nThe task mentions \"link updated pp configuration plan doc note please attach newly completed,\" which seems connected to the access request. It suggests attaching the project plan document, but the primary focus is still on access. So, I think the best category here is \"Access.\"\n\nWe need to format the response as a JSON object based on the given instructions. The schema looks like this: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[...]}}}. So I\u2019ll create a JSON object with the \"category\" key set as \"Access.\" Here we go: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Determining category for the request**\n\nI'm considering whether \"Internal Project\" fits due to the mention of the \"pp configuration plan doc,\" but when I think about the typical ticket categories, \"Access\" seems more appropriate. The request strongly indicates the user is asking for \"tester role\" access. \n\nTherefore, I'll go with \"Access\" for the category. Now, per the instructions, I\u2019ll craft the final response as a JSON object without any extra text. Here we go: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
