It seems to involve issuing a replacement mobile phone, which falls under the \"Hardware\" category since it's all about a device. It doesn't appear to connect with HR support, access, storage, or purchasing in a procurement sense. I think \"Hardware\" is the right choice, but I might also consider asking some clarifying questions for further context.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI\u2019m tasked with categorizing an IT ticket, and it looks like I need to respond with a specific JSON format. The required structure indicates I should provide an object with a category property. Since \"Hardware\" is a valid choice based on the context, I'll format my response simply as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It\u2019s important to stick to the exact format without adding any extra text, just the JSON object itself. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and produce that!"
