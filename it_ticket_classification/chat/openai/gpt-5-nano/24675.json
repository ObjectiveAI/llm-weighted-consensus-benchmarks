The user\u2019s text covers multiple aspects, mentioning help, approval, and the monitor itself. According to the category taxonomy provided, I see it as fitting into either \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" The main focus is on procuring and installing a second monitor. Since it\u2019s both a hardware request and relates to procurement, \"Purchase\" might be the best choice, but \"Hardware\" also makes sense given the context.**Categorizing IT Ticket Request**\n\nThe user's message about purchasing a second monitor suggests it's a purchase request, so I should categorize it as \"Purchase.\" However, since it involves hardware, I wonder if I should consider \"Hardware\" too. The instructions clearly indicate that I can only choose one category, so \"Purchase\" is the most accurate choice here. I need to format my response correctly as a JSON object that includes this category. It should look something like this: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
