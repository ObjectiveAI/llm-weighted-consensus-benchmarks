The user's message seems a bit unclear, but I think it might be about onboarding a new starter on Wednesday. It might relate to HR Support since onboarding often includes that, but it could also connect to Access or Administrative rights, especially if it involves system access for the new starter.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm interpreting \"new starter\" as a reference to onboarding a new employee. The phrase \"pm re\" could be a garbled version of \"please find attached,\" indicating there's an attachment. I think the most fitting category might be HR Support since onboarding usually falls under that. However, there's also potential for Access if it relates to account provisioning. Given that HR typically coordinates onboarding and IT handles access, \"HR Support\" seems most appropriate for this ticket.**Categorizing ticket content**\n\nThe message I\u2019m analyzing seems to be about scheduling, mentioning \"new starter,\" \"Wednesday February,\" and \"pm,\" along with \"please find attached.\" It could be a notification to HR regarding a new employee. For the category, while \"Access\" might indicate granting IT access to systems, it lacks a clear mention of that. The safer choice appears to be \"HR Support\" since it relates to onboarding. The ticket is IT-focused, but \"HR Support\" aligns well with the context. So, I'll categorize this ticket as:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize this IT ticket based on the provided categories. Although I think \"Access\" might be applicable for provisioning system access related to a \"new starter,\" there's no explicit mention of access in the text. The user likely expects me to choose \"HR Support,\" especially since the phrase \"new starter\" is a common HR term. Given the ambiguity, I\u2019ll opt for \"HR Support\" and respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
