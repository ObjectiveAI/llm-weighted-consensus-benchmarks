It looks like someone is having a problem with their laptop not starting, which certainly indicates a hardware issue. They\u2019re requesting a temporary laptop replacement until it\u2019s fixed. While this could fall under both \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase,\" since it\u2019s primarily about equipment failure, I think the best fit for categorization here is \"Hardware.\" That captures the essence of the situation quite well!**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nThe request is for a temporary laptop replacement, which clearly indicates a hardware issue. Since this problem is related to the laptop itself, I think \"Hardware\" is definitely the best category. I need to provide a JSON object with the \"category\" field and the value specified as \"Hardware.\" Since the instructions are pretty clear on the format, I\u2019ll output it simply as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. A short note reiterating the categorization might also be helpful!**Delivering the JSON output**\n\nAlright, it's clear that I just need to provide the JSON format without any extra text. So, the output will simply be {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Keeping it straightforward and concise like this will make it easier for whoever is handling the ticket! I\u2019m on it\u2014no fluff, just the essentials."
