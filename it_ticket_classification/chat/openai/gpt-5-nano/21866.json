It looks like they mention \"credentials\" and \"app help,\" which might indicate an issue related to access. The category options available include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. So, I should parse the message carefully to figure out the most fitting category for this IT ticket.**Parsing IT ticket text**\n\nI\u2019m looking at this message that says, \"for on Tuesday PM hello works pro manage same credentials app help thanks digital product strategy.\" It seems to reference managing credentials in an app, possibly related to \"Works Pro.\" My best guess is that they want help with account access, which likely makes \"Access\" the most appropriate category. There\u2019s also \"Administrative Rights,\" but since their main focus is on managing credentials, I\u2019ll go with \"Access.\" If it remains unclear, \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize this IT ticket and provide a JSON output with a \"category\" field. The options available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nConsidering the message talks about managing credentials, \"Access\" seems like the best fit. I don't want to overthink it, but I could see how \"Internal Project\" might come up, too. Still, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" for now and format my response in JSON like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
