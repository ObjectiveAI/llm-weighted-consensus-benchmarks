The ticket involves a lot of aspects related to a leaver, including their mailbox, rights, and other information. I see several keywords like \"leave date,\" \"mailbox,\" and \"rights,\" which hint that this might fit under a few categories. Given the context, I think \"HR Support\" could be the most appropriate category for this ticket. Let's clarify this together.**Assigning category to ticket**\n\nI need to assign this IT ticket to one appropriate category. The ticket mentions various terms related to a leaver, like \"leaver form,\" \"leave date,\" \"AD rights,\" and \"personal mailbox.\" It looks like this is all about user access changes and deprovisioning, suggesting that \"Access\" is the best fit. While \"Administrative rights\" seems relevant too, I think it\u2019s clearer to categorize it solely under \"Access.\" I\u2019ll finalize the response with \"Access\" in the category field.**Formatting response**\n\nI need to provide the response in a specific format, so I'll output a JSON-like object with the \"category\" key. The category in this case is \"Access,\" which aligns with the ticket's content. The required response format follows the guidelines, so I\u2019ll keep it minimal and focused. I'll just provide the necessary object without any extra commentary. \n\nThe response will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That's all set!"
