I\u2019m unsure if this falls under \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access.\" It's definitely not related to hardware, storage, purchasing, or HR. I should consider it as \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Administrative rights\" based on permissions.**Classifying the ticket**\n\nThe user can open the form but encounters a \"Thanks for asking\" message upon submission. They want me to investigate this issue. The potential categories are \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" with \"Miscellaneous\" possibly covering general IT problems. Since the user is submitting a feedback form, it likely connects to an internal project or an IT service desk. It's definitely not hardware-related. Given its nature, \"Miscellaneous\" seems fitting, but I might also consider \"Internal Project\" for internal software issues.**Choosing a category**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"technical evaluator\" and has been ongoing for months, but I don't think those details are essential. I need to choose a category, and since this is about a feedback form submission issue, I'll go with \"Internal Project.\" This seems fitting, as it's related to an internal application. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too broad here. The user requested a categorization, and I believe \"Internal Project\" is the most accurate choice. My final response will be a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
