It might fit \"Miscellaneous\" since it's a general notification, but I'm also considering \"Internal Project.\" However, it likely doesn\u2019t align well with \"Hardware\" or \"Access.\" So, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the safest choice.**Categorizing IT incident**\n\nThe ticket appears to relate to an IT incident, specifically a notification about an overbooked issue and unplanned works. Since the categories don't include \"Incident\" or \"Outage,\" the best fit is probably \"Miscellaneous.\" The user asked to categorize this IT ticket, so I need to respond in JSON format as specified. The format will be straightforward, ensuring correct capitalization for \"Miscellaneous,\" resulting in the output: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. No extra commentary needed."
