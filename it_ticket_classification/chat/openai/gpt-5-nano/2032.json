The content references \"usage of new project template,\" \"creation requests,\" and an \"excel form.\" It seems to focus on project template usage and possibly requests guidance or training on it. Given that there\u2019s no mention of hardware or access issues, it seems to fit best in the \"Internal Project\" category since it pertains mainly to project templates and user guidance.**Deciding IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm trying to determine the best category for this IT ticket. Initially, it could fit under \"Administrative rights\" since it mentions requests and admin tasks. However, the emphasis on \"new project template usage\" and continual requests suggests it may be more relevant to \"Internal Project.\" Even though there's a mention of an \"excel form,\" it seems the focus is on reinforcing template usage. So, I\u2019m leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as the more appropriate category.**Analyzing IT Ticket Content**\n\nLet\u2019s break this down: the ticket refers to the usage of a \"new project template\" for creating projects and indicates that users keep submitting creation requests that come with an Excel form. They want to reinforce the template\u2019s usage to manage these requests effectively. The best category for this seems to be \"Internal Project\" since it's focused on internal templates. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit if it involved access, it\u2019s primarily about using the template, making \"Internal Project\" the most suitable choice.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI need to provide a JSON object categorizing the ticket as \"Internal Project.\" The required format is clear: a category object with a property as a string enum. So, I\u2019ll structure it like this: \n\n{\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}\n\nI want to ensure this format is valid and follow the instruction correctly. It seems we should respond with just the JSON, without any extra commentary. Alright, I\u2019m ready to deliver that succinctly."
