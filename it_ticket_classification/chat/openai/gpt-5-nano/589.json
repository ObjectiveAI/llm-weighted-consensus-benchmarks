The mention of \"forbidden software\" and colleagues involved with games and file sharing suggests it relates to access and potentially misuse of software assets.\n\nI need to decide which category fits best from the options provided: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. Based on the context, I'll likely categorize it under \"Access.\" \n\nNow, I\u2019ll prepare the JSON format for the output.**Interpreting the IT Ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing this ticket, which revolves around forbidden software and mentions things like internal audit and colleagues using games and torrent-based file sharing. It seems focused on identifying and monitoring software that shouldn't be in use.\n\nI\u2019m weighing the categories: could it fit \"Access,\" since it deals with resource access? However, \"Miscellaneous\" might seem too vague. It could be viewed as \"Internal Project\" linked to internal audits, but the overall theme feels more related to security and compliance issues. I need to choose carefully!**Finalizing the IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm working on categorizing the IT ticket but notice there's no \"Security\" option available. \"Administrative rights\" could fit due to software installations, yet the user is asking me to categorize it.\n\nConsidering alternatives, \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" could apply. However, since it involves an internal audit focused on forbidden software, \"Internal Project\" feels most appropriate. The ticket details also hint at asset management, but given the emphasis on prohibited software, \"Internal Project\" makes the most sense. \n\nI'll finalize the JSON output as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
