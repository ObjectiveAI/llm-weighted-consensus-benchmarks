The user mentions things like \"manager change,\" \"change back,\" and \"investigate,\" which makes me think it could relate to either access or administrative rights. \"Manager change\" hints at a role change, while \"change back\" suggests a need to revert something. Given that context, I\u2019ll have to decide which category fits best among the available options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, etc.**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m sorting through categories for this IT ticket. The options are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket mentions \"manager change\" and \"investigate,\" which could be about updating access or permissions. Since there are separate categories for Access and Administrative rights, it\u2019s tricky. If it's about changing permissions, it might fit Administrative rights, but it could also be Internal Project if it's specific to a project. I need to choose the best fit!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nThe content of the ticket isn't fitting neatly into Hardware, Storage, Purchase, HR Support, Internal Project, or Administrative rights categories. It mentions \"manager change\" and notes that changes have been made by colleagues, but nothing about technology. It could fit under \"Miscellaneous,\" yet I think \"Access\" is more appropriate since it deals with changes to roles. So, it sounds like this is about user role adjustments. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON category object to match the required format!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
