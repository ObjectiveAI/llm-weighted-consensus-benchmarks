The closing line adds more confusion. It's not specific enough to classify it as hardware or storage, so it seems to fall under \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019ll provide my best guess for the category and note that we can reclassify later if needed. This way, I can keep things organized despite the vague details.**Enhancing Ticket Categorization**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that if we had more information, we could suggest more precise categories and ask the user for clarification. I'll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" since the ticket text is unclear and lacks specifics about hardware or access issues. It mentions attachments, but not what they contain. I could suggest clarifying questions to better understand the user's needs, like what the problem is or what the attachments refer to, while keeping the instructions in mind.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
