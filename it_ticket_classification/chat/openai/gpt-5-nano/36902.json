They've mentioned issues with a recruiting tool for uploading resumes and recommending candidates. I'll consider the categories available: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It seems like this ticket best fits under \"HR Support\" since it relates to recruiting efforts and functionality with the tool. More clarity on their specific issue would help further!**Analyzing IT Ticket Issues**\n\nThe ticket mentions that \"social is unusable,\" along with problems related to the tool for recommending candidates and uploading resumes. They've tried multiple browsers, suggesting an access or miscellaneous issue. However, since this revolves around recruiting, it aligns more with \"HR Support,\" even though that might confuse with the provided categories. The crucial part is that \"HR Support\" is indeed listed, so I should go with that category as the best fit for this ticket!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nLet's review the provided categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. HR Support is definitely relevant since the ticket concerns a recruiting tool. They mention \"browser used,\" which hints at access or troubleshooting but isn't about system access. The key issues point to it being an HR tool for recruiting, so I will categorize it as \"HR Support.\" The response should be a simple JSON object, like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. No extra text needed!**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to respond with just the category object in JSON format, without extra commentary. Since \"HR Support\" is the correct category, I'll ensure it's formatted properly. My response will simply be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. No additional text or context is necessary. I'll keep it straightforward and accurately reflect what\u2019s needed!"
