I see mentions like \"new starter\" and \"starter form,\" which likely relate to HR onboarding. The most fitting category might be \"HR Support,\" as it focuses on employee orientation. While \"Access\" could work too, it doesn\u2019t clearly indicate a request for access rights. So, I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support\" since it aligns best with onboarding forms.**Delivering category in JSON**\n\nThe phrase \"re starter form\" indicates it's about a new starter form. The context suggests that it\u2019s requesting completion of this form, which aligns with onboarding processes. In this case, \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category since it's HR-related. So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object containing the category. I need to format it correctly, with the category field included. Here\u2019s what I'll deliver: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
