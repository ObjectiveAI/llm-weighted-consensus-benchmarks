The text mentions a \"new starter\" and refers to filling out a starter form, likely for a new employee named Lazar. It also discusses file attachments and how to handle them securely. This looks like it's centered around onboarding, so I'll categorize it under \"HR Support.\" It seems the issue pertains to the administrative process involved in welcoming new staff.**Deciding on category**\n\nI'm weighing my options for categorizing the IT ticket. It looks like \"HR Support\" would make sense given the reference to a \"new starter,\" which relates to onboarding. However, there's also the aspect of granting access and handling attachments securely, which could tie into \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019m considering if it fits better under \"Administrative rights\" or if it should just stay under \"HR Support.\" This is tricky, but I\u2019ll aim for clarity in choosing the best category.**Interpreting ticket request**\n\nThe ticket indicates that a new starter, likely named Lazar, needs to fill out a starter form, and there's mention of a file link and attachments. It emphasizes virus protection and managing what types of attachments can be received, suggesting an IT policy. So, I'm pondering whether to categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It also touches on security policies, which may lean towards \"Access,\" especially since the request involves attachment handling and compliance measures.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket, which mentions a \"new starter\" and a \"starter form.\" This aligns closely with onboarding tasks, making \"HR Support\" the likely best category since it's related to HR functions. Although \"Access\" could relate to system rights, the focus is on a form and attachment policy. I need to craft a JSON response that clearly indicates the chosen category, ensuring I use the proper format with a string value for the \"category\" property. Let's make it clear and straightforward!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
