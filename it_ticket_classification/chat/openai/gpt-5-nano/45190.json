Since it ties to leave balances, the \"HR Support\" category seems fitting, even though it\u2019s an IT ticket. It's important to get the right classification to address the user's concern effectively!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI see that \"Internal Project\" isn\u2019t relevant. The \"Miscellaneous\" and \"Administrative rights\" categories don't quite fit, so \"HR Support\" is the best option. I\u2019ll prepare the response as a JSON object because it specifies only the category field. The required structure is clear, so it should look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This matches the expected format, and I'll stick to providing just the JSON object since that's all that's needed here!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
