The phrase suggests that the ticket likely relates to providing access or administrative rights. Given the context, I should classify this ticket under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" That seems to fit best with the user's request!**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering that there isn\u2019t an explicit request for access, but the phrase \"new starter\" likely refers to onboarding tasks like account creation and provisioning. The most appropriate category seems to be \"Access,\" though \"Administrative rights\" could also fit because it\u2019s a subcategory of access in some systems. Since I need to respond in a specific format, it would be ideal to output a JSON object like: {\"category\":\"Access\"} to fulfill the request.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m set to produce the output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I want to make sure it\u2019s the most fitting choice. The phrase indicates onboarding, and while \"HR Support\" relates to HR tasks, this ticket focuses on the new starter's access. \"Administrative rights\" refers to granting admin permissions, which might fit, but I believe \"Access\" is more general and appropriate for setting up accounts. Since the output needs to be concise, I\u2019ll go with the pure JSON format without any extra text.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
