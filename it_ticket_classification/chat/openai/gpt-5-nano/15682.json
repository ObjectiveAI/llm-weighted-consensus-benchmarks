The text mentions \u201ctemporary external hard disk\u201d and emphasizes an emergency, which suggests it\u2019s about a hardware storage device. I\u2019m considering whether to label it as \"Storage\" or \"Hardware.\" Since it specifically references an external hard disk, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Storage.\" But I\u2019m still wrestling with whether \"Hardware\" might also be relevant, as both categories apply to this request.**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that the ticket about a temporary external hard disk definitely falls more into the \"Storage\" category. The user asked to categorize it, so it makes sense to respond with a JSON object that includes this category. I should output something like: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.\n\nI\u2019m considering the message mentions urgency and the term \"external hard disk,\" which reinforces my choice. Even though \"Hardware\" is also relevant, \"Storage\" is the more precise option here since it specifically refers to a storage device.**Responding with category**\n\nSince the user asked for categorization, I think \"Storage\" is the best option. I'll keep it simple by providing a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.\n\nAccording to the instructions, no extra explanations are required; I just need to present the category straightforwardly. It\u2019s important to ensure the format is exact as specified, focusing solely on the category without additional information. So, let\u2019s go with that response!"
