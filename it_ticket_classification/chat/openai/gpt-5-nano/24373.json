The message mentions uploading reports and issues with formats. I have to map it to one of the category options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. Considering the user's focus on report layouts and issues, it seems most appropriate to classify it under Miscellaneous or Internal Project. I'll decide on the best fit!**Interpreting the IT ticket**\n\nThe content is about a monthly report issue focused on dates, specifically relating to December. The user mentions an uploaded link, layouts, and forms, indicating a problem with reports. Considering the categories I have, it doesn't seem to fit hardware, access, storage, purchase, HR support, or administrative rights. It could go under \"Internal Project\" since it involves reporting, but \"Miscellaneous\" may also work if it doesn\u2019t fit neatly. The user is asking for advisement on this issue.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering categorizing this IT ticket. It could relate to \"Administrative rights,\" especially since the message talks about refreshing a button, but that's not very clear. The mention of a \"pas monthly report\" might reference an internal system, making \"Internal Project\" a reasonable fit. Alternatively, \"Miscellaneous\" feels too generic. Since the ticket involves monthly reports, layouts, and data issues, I'll go with \"Internal Project,\" as it aligns well with the internal systems mentioned. The response should be a JSON object confirming this category.**Preparing the JSON output**\n\nI need to create a JSON object based on the category for the IT ticket. The format requires me to set the category field, which should be \"Internal Project.\" The required structure is an object with the \"category\" property defined as a string. Although I see some expectations around the exact type wrapper, I\u2019ll stick with the instructions. The user hasn't asked for an explanation, so I'll keep it simple and just provide the final JSON: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
