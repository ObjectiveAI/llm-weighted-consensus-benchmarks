The content mentions something about a \"board not visible\" along with terms like \"support\" and \"engineer.\" It seems a bit jumbled, but the core issue seems to relate to access, possibly indicating an access problem with the board. Given the available categories, I think \"Access\" would be the most appropriate choice for this ticket.**Clarifying ticket categorization**\n\nI've got a few possible categories to work with: Access, Administrative rights, Hardware, and more. The mention of a board not visible likely pertains to \"dashboard visibility\" in a software tool, which could mean it's an access issue. Since it seems to be about visibility permissions, categorizing it as \"Access\" makes the most sense. I'll structure the final output in a JSON-like format with the category property, clearly indicating it\u2019s categorized as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
