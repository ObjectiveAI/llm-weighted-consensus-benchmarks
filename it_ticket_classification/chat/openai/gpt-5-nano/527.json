They also mention rising next tickets, which might imply something else. Given the categories available\u2014like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others\u2014I think the best fit would be \"Internal Project\" since it relates to deployment jobs. That sounds appropriate!**Deciding on ticket categories**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize the IT ticket. While \"Administrative rights\" might apply if it involves job creation permissions, it feels a bit unclear. The mention of \"export job\" suggests it could relate to application jobs, which might fit \"Storage,\" but that's not quite right. Since the task involves environment configuration and deployment, \"Internal Project\" seems like the most suitable choice, as it deals with restoring and creating jobs across different environments. I'll use the structured format for the category response!**Structuring the JSON response**\n\nThe system instruction is clear: I need to provide a category in a specific JSON format. The valid categories are set in the schema, and I've decided on \"Internal Project\" as it fits well. Since the user expects just the category, I won't add extra explanations. I\u2019ll ensure that the capitalization matches exactly to avoid any issues. The final output will be a JSON object with the category key, like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. No extra text, just the JSON!"
