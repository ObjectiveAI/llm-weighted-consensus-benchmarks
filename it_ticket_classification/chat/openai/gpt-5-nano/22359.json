The term \"Similar profile\" might imply duplicating a VPN profile, which complicates things a bit. It\u2019s definitely not just standard \"Access,\" as that would mean granting user access. However, \"Internal Project\" usually refers to tasks within a specific project. If I want to be safer, I might also go with \"Miscellaneous\" for more ambiguity. I'll lean towards \"Internal Project\" for now.**Categorizing ambiguous tasks**\n\nI think the best classification for this ambiguous task is \"Internal Project\" since it doesn't involve a user service request and is more about configuration. The repeated phrases like \"add site\" and \"similar profile\" suggest it's related to setting up a site-to-site VPN. Without a specific \"Network\" category available, \"Internal Project\" works well. I'll respond with the required JSON format that includes only the category property. The output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
