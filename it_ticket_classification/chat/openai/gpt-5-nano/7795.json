Let's get this done with clarity and precision!**Interpreting IT ticket request**\n\nThe user's message is quite garbled, but it seems to be about restricting access to certain resources, possibly linked to a location. The main action here is \"restrict access,\" which points strongly to the \"Access\" category. It could also hint at \"Administrative rights,\" but given the emphasis on restricting access, I think \"Access\" fits best. Other categories, like \"Internal Project,\" \"Hardware,\" or \"Storage,\" just don't seem relevant. So, I'll categorize this as \"Access.\"**Finalizing category output**\n\nI\u2019m considering the user\u2019s request about resources in an area, and it's clear that it doesn't relate to storage or purchases. It's definitely not HR Support either. The main focus is on \"restrict access,\" which aligns with the \"Access\" category rather than \"Administrative rights,\" since they're not granting admin privileges here. I need to respond strictly with the correct JSON format, so the final output should be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll make sure it\u2019s clean and concise!"
