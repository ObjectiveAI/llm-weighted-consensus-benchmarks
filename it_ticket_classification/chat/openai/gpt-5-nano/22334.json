It mentions completing forms, job titles, and an administration officer, which strongly suggests it's related to onboarding a new employee. The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Given that it seems to pertain to securing access for a new employee, \"HR Support\" looks like the best fit here. However, there's no specific \"Onboarding\" category.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm looking at the IT ticket concerning forms for a contractor and admin officer. The text mentions \"new starter,\" \"contractor complete,\" and \"form completed,\" which suggests it relates to onboarding a new contractor. The existing categories are \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" and others. Since there's a focus on onboarding and access provisioning, I think it's reasonable to categorize it as \"HR Support\" or \"Access,\" since neither hardware nor storage is relevant here.**Categorizing onboarding forms**\n\nI see that the forms for a contractor probably relate to access provisioning, which is covered under the \"Access\" category. The user's message indicates it's about setting up a new starter account. So, I think it makes sense to categorize it as \"Access\" to align with account provisioning. But there's also a strong onboarding aspect, leaning towards \"HR Support.\" Since it's about onboarding, I think \"HR Support\" feels like the right choice for this IT ticket. I'll output the category in a JSON-like format.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize the IT ticket related to new starter forms. It seems like the more appropriate category might be \"Access\" because it's about provisioning new user access, although the request isn't explicitly clear about that. The user mentions \"administration officer\" and \"form completed,\" which leans towards HR administrative tasks. However, there\u2019s also a category for \"Administrative rights.\" Since both \"Access\" and \"HR Support\" relate, I think \"HR Support\" is the best fit for this. I'll return the category in the requested JSON format.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nIt seems like this ticket is about onboarding and related to administrative rights, though it doesn't explicitly mention them. Given that it focuses on new starter details, I think \"HR Support\" is the right category since it deals with onboarding paperwork. The user likely wants to classify this as part of the HR process. So, I\u2019ll return the category in the specified JSON format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll ensure it\u2019s formatted correctly and keep it concise!"
