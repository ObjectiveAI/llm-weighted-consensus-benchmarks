It sounds like it could lean more towards HR Support since it\u2019s about a new hire's paperwork, but there\u2019s also an IT element since they need access accounts. The user asked to categorize this IT ticket, and I think the best options could be HR Support or potentially Administrative Rights for access requests.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThis request is primarily about a new starter form, which makes \"HR Support\" the best category to choose. Other options like \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" seem too vague, while \"Access\" could apply but isn't the main focus since it's about onboarding. I'll respond with the appropriate JSON object to categorize this request clearly. It will look like this: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. I'll ensure the formatting is valid and concise, without any extra text."
