The user mentions \"scans\" and some technical terms like \"sonar caps pilot\" and \"failed jobs.\" This suggests it might relate to an internal project or technical issues. I should analyze the main points. The mention of \"recently upgrade migration\" hints at upgrades, so I\u2019m thinking it falls under \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll confirm which category makes the most sense!**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket, and \u201cInternal Project\u201d seems to fit since the terms like \"pilot\" and \"upgrade migration\" suggest a testing phase. While \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could be potential fits, the context of \"sonar\" likely points to a tool related to code quality. Based on the details, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" Now I need to prepare a JSON response indicating this category, formatted correctly.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
