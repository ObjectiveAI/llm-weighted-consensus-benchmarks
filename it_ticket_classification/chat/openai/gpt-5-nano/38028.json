The format requires categorizing it properly, so I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} while remembering the correct schema for the category field. Let\u2019s get this correctly structured!**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m working on the response, which should be a JSON object that looks like: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. But I see the instructions actually describe a more structured object with a \"category\" key wrapped in additional details. The valid channels clarify that the final answer needs to match that schema without extra commentary. I think the ultimate output should still just be the JSON object reflecting the \"HR Support\" category, so here\u2019s what I need to output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
