The text is pretty messy, but it seems they\u2019re facing an issue with editing, perhaps related to OneDrive. They mentioned getting a message that persists even after reloading. So, I should map this issue to a category from my list: \u201cAccess,\u201d \u201cStorage,\u201d or \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d seem to fit here. Let\u2019s identify the right one!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI think categorizing this IT ticket as \"Access\" makes the most sense because editing a workbook usually involves permissions related to OneDrive or SharePoint. The user's message hints at an access issue, especially since they're unable to edit and the problem persists even after attempting to reload. While \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, it seems like the \"Access\" category fits better here. Now, I'll format my response correctly as a JSON object with the category set to \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
