This could fit into either \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Additionally, there might be an aspect involving \"Administrative rights\" if they need permission to make the updates. I'll decide on \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" as the best category.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"polls,\" which I believe refers to a software feature, so it might fit under \"Internal Project.\" The request to update the description based on an attached document suggests it\u2019s a change request rather than a hardware issue. Since we only have eight categories, this seems like it could either be \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" Given the context of a task for updating a feature, I'll classify it under \"Internal Project.\"**Formatting the response**\n\nThe instruction specifies that I need to provide a category object formatted as a JSON string. The user simply asked for a categorization, so I should respond with just the essential information without any extra text. Therefore, I\u2019ll return:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}  \n\nI\u2019ll make sure to match the capitalization and spacing exactly as specified. It's all about delivering a clear and concise response that meets the required format!"
