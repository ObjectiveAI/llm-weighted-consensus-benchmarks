The ticket mentions a request for a \"PC display needed\" for a \"tower PC,\" which likely means they want a monitor for the PC towers they're moving. Since it's related to hardware, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" I should also prepare a JSON object that includes this category.**Responding with JSON Category**\n\nI'm working on structuring a response with a JSON object based on the instruction provided. The ticket clearly requests a display/monitor for a tower PC, so I should categorize it as \"Hardware.\" The final response should be straightforward, without extra commentary, and presented as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI briefly considered if it could also fit in \"Miscellaneous\" due to the moving aspect, but since they still need a display, \"Hardware\" feels right. Let's go with that!"
