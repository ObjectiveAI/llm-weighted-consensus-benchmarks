I'll output that in the required JSON format.**Formatting JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nI need to format the response as a JSON object with the category labeled as \"HR Support.\" The prompt asks me to categorize the IT ticket, and it seems clear that the text relates to onboarding procedures. \n\nIt's a bit messy, but it focuses on a new starter checklist, confirming it fits \"HR Support.\" I don't think \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" are right choices here. So, I\u2019ll stick to outputting: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} with no extra text, ensuring it is valid JSON."
