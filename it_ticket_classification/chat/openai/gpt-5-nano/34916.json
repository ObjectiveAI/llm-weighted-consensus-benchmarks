However, our categories don't explicitly include \"Software.\" The closest fit might be \"Miscellaneous,\" since it doesn't quite fit any other category. There\u2019s also a chance it relates to an \"Internal Project,\" depending on context.**Responding to IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket includes a phrase: \"your help was notified thanks senior developer.\" Noting that, I need to categorize the IT ticket and respond with a JSON-like format. The text implies possible errors, which could fit \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access.\" Since it mentions issues submitting a card, it might also relate to \"Administrative rights.\" However, I think \"Miscellaneous\" works best for software errors that don't fit other categories. So, I'll format the response as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Let's ensure we keep it concise!"
