The user mentions \"new mouse\" and describes receiving a wireless mouse. This likely indicates a hardware issue, so I'll categorize it under \"Hardware.\" However, I could also consider \"Purchase,\" since it may involve a new purchase request for the mouse. I'll respond with a JSON object like: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned \"new mouse received wireless mouse.\" This could mean they received a wireless mouse, rather than requesting a purchase. The term \"new mouse\" suggests it's likely related to hardware or an asset delivery. Since the categories include Purchase, but this seems more focused on equipment, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" I'll just provide the JSON object output as instructed, which would look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
