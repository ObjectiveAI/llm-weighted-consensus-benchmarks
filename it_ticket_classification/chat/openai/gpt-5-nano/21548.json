Since it mainly talks about access cards, it definitely fits under \"Access\" rather than the others. I should respond with a JSON format indicating this category. It looks like I\u2019ll output a JSON object with \"category\": \"Access.\"**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nI need to keep my response concise, focusing on the category for the IT ticket. The prompt emphasizes providing a category, so I'll format my output as a JSON object. It's clear that I need to output only the necessary content: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I must ensure that the format adheres to the specified structure. That's straightforward, so I can deliver this directly!"
