They mention a \"leaver form\" and that an \"intern has processed leaver yet,\" which suggests it's related to HR. Given phrases like \"leaver,\" \"internship,\" and the request to provide a leaver form, this ticket likely fits best into the \"HR Support\" category. It seems clear that the user needs assistance with an HR-related process, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support.\"**Mapping categories**\n\nI need to ensure I'm mapping the categories correctly. The list includes \"HR Support,\" which fits the user's request. The instruction is to categorize the IT ticket and respond in a JSON format. Based on the schema provided, I'll format my output as a JSON object like this:  {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It's essential to keep it simple and not include any extra text. So, I\u2019ll finalize the output as just that JSON object."
