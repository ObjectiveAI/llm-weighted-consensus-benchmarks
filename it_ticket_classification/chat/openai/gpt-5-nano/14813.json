The system requires one category, so I'm deliberating. \"Administrative rights\" fits if it\u2019s about admin rights to folders. However, since it emphasizes rights management and secure access, \"Access\" seems most appropriate. It captures the essence of file access rights, permissions, and transfer, while \"Storage\" could relate to the physical locations of files, but that feels secondary.**Finalizing JSON for access rights**\n\nI'm focusing on the central theme of access rights for HR files and permissions for moving between folders. \"Access\" is indeed the right choice for categorization. I\u2019ll prepare the final answer as a JSON object with the category field set to \"Access.\" Following the required format, it will look like this: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. No need for extra explanation; I\u2019ll just deliver that JSON object succinctly."
