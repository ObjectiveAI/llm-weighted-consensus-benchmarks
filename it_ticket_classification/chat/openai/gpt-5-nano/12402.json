The user's input includes terms like \"leaver form,\" \"leaving date,\" \"AD rights,\" and more, suggesting it's about offboarding. The available categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the context, it seems most fitting to categorize it under \"HR Support,\" focusing on the offboarding and access elements. I'll output a JSON object with this category.**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nI\u2019m seeing terms like \"AD rights,\" \"mailbox,\" and \"roaming profile,\" leading me to consider the \"Access\" category, as it relates to access rights and accounts. \"Administrative rights\" feels too specific. Since the ticket is primarily about offboarding, \"Access\" suits it best. There's also \"Storage\" mentioned for inventory, but offboarding is the focus. The output needs to be a valid JSON object. I\u2019ll make sure the response is formatted correctly. I should provide:  \n{\"category\":\"access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
