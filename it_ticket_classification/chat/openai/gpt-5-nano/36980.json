The user mentioned trying to add risks for a client named Shillings, but it\u2019s not appearing in the list. This could relate to risk management, possibly fitting under \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since there\u2019s no category for \u201cScripting\u201d or \u201cApplication,\u201d I think \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d or \"Internal Project\" might be the best options here.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nIt seems that if the ticket is about client risks in a project management tool, it likely falls under \"Internal Project.\" The user mentioned something about something not appearing in the list, and they need advice. Based on the context, the category should reflect either \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since \"Internal Project\" fits well, I\u2019ll categorize it as such. Finally, I need to format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
