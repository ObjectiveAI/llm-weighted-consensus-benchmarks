The phrases suggest it's a software issue with notifications, not hardware. It could fall under \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d or possibly \u201cAccess.\u201d But since it seems more about a general IT problem rather than specific access rights, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d It makes sense as a default choice for general IT issues that don\u2019t neatly fit into other categories.**Creating JSON Output**\n\nI want to craft a JSON object for the category with the value \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d The user\u2019s prompt indicates I need to categorize an IT ticket, and I have a schema that requires a category field with a string type. So, I\u2019ll produce the output as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I just need to ensure that there\u2019s no extra text in there, keeping it clean and straightforward as a JSON object.
