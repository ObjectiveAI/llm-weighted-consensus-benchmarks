It might suggest reports are suspended but still functioning. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Administrative rights\" if access rights are involved or \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s related to specific reporting features. If it's unclear, \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option. Asking for clarification might help!**Classifying ambiguous tickets**\n\nI have a straightforward classification task on my hands. The content of the ticket is ambiguous, so I think categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights\" might work. The phrase \"report polls suspended but up\" could refer to a monitoring issue. Among the categories, \"Internal Project\" could fit if it relates to internal reporting. \"Administrative rights\" would work if it's about managing polls. If I\u2019m unsure, I might need to ask clarifying questions before deciding!**Determining ticket categorization**\n\nWith no clear context, the safest choice is to categorize the ticket as \"Miscellaneous.\" However, the phrase \"report polls suspended but up\" could suggest issues with reports and polling in a specific app. It might fit under \"Internal Project\" if it relates to a particular project. According to the service desk taxonomy, it\u2019s essential to consider other categories like \"Administrative rights.\" Since the user wants me to categorize, asking for clarification might be helpful before deciding!**Outputting category**\n\nI need to respond with a category for the IT ticket. The chosen category will be \"Miscellaneous,\" as it seems the safest default. I considered \"Access\" because of the word \"suspended,\" but it doesn't directly refer to permissions. Since the instructions specify that I should output a JSON object, I\u2019ll go with just the category without extra text. The format will be clean and straightforward, like this: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I\u2019ll make sure everything is correctly formatted!"
