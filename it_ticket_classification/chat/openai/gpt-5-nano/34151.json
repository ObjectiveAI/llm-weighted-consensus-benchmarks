There are several categories to choose from: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nNone of these fit perfectly, but \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the best option since it covers general IT issues. \"Internal Project\" isn't right either, so I'll go with \"Miscellaneous\" for this ticket.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object for the category type. The prompt clearly states that I should return a JSON with a \"category\" field. In this case, it would look like `{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}`. \n\nSince the user asked to categorize an IT ticket, I'll stick to the required format without any extra explanation or formatting. The focus here is to just provide the JSON response to meet the specifications, so I'll keep it simple. Let's finalize that!"
