The focus on storage provisioning makes \"Storage\" the most fitting category. There's also a mention of costs and budgets, so \"Purchase\" could be relevant if it involves license costs. However, Storage is definitely where I\u2019d place this ticket.**Finalizing category output**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" fits, but this ticket mainly discusses setting up a database storage environment, making \"Storage\" the best fit. So, I need to produce the category object: `{\"category\":\"Storage\"}`.\n\nThe instructions indicate it should be a JSON object, and while the wrapper might detail types, I'll focus on just providing the required category output clearly. So, here it is, just the category object without any extra text:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
