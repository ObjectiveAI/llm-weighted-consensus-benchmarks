The categories I have to choose from include \u201cHardware,\u201d \u201cHR Support,\u201d \u201cAccess,\u201d and others. This ticket really seems to center around HR processes because it mentions accessing and terminating employee accounts. So, I think the best fit is \u201cHR Support,\u201d but \u201cAccess\u201d is also a possibility since it involves revoking access for leavers.**Categorizing IT ticket in JSON**\n\nWhen categorizing an IT ticket for departing employees, the relevant categories are often \"Access,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The user wants an output in a JSON-like format. Since this ticket talks about leaver management and termination, it seems to fit both \"HR Support\" and \"Access.\" However, since it also involves deprovisioning access, I think \"Access\" may be the best choice. Still, \"HR Support\" is also a strong contender because of the focus on leaver forms and processes.**Choosing the right category**\n\nIn this IT ticket, the categories often include \"Access\" for revoking permissions and \"HR Support\" for coordinating with HR. The ticket mentions \"termination\" and \"attaching leaver forms,\" which points towards HR processes, but since it also involves revoking access, I think \"Access\" is the best fit. \"Administrative rights\" is a bit too specialized. Therefore, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" and respond with a JSON snippet specifying that category. A brief justification might be helpful, but I should prioritize just outputting the category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
