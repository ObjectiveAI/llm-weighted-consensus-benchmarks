The ticket's text is a bit messy but seems focused on a password reset, which is expiring today. It involves tasks related to access, including changing credentials and communicating issues. I'll classify it as an access-related request based on the prominent details.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions disabling device credentials, connected by cable, OS changes, and password resets. Since it's primarily about access management and passwords, I think it fits the \"Access\" category best. There are indications that the content includes a generic message about confidentiality, but the crucial part is the request for steps to reset a password that expires today. While \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, access seems to better capture the ticket's focus on password resets and credential management.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
