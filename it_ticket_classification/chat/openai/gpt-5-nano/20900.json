I'll analyze further to determine the best fit.**Analyzing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for this IT ticket. It mentions \"new project,\" \"code required,\" and \"cost recovery,\" which complicates things. \"Internal Project\" could work, given the \"new project\" mention. However, \"drive cost recovery\" makes me think it might relate to storage or hardware. The ticket lists numerous terms like forms and templates, so I\u2019m weighing categories like \"Storage\" for drives against the idea of it primarily being a cost recovery task. I need to decide which fits best!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this ticket. It could be \"Internal Project\" since it starts with \"new project,\" but the focus seems to be on administrative tasks and cost recovery. \"Purchase\" seems like a strong fit due to the references of order and forms. I think \"Miscellaneous\" could work if things were unclear, but \"Purchase\" lines up best. I'll output it in JSON format as required: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. Let's proceed with that!"
