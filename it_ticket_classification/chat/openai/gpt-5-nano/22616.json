They mention \"create a service delivery managers snow wednesday,\" which makes me think it might relate to \"ServiceNow.\" The repetition of \"create snow\" suggests a focus on a ServiceNow-related request. Their ask about \"same members ad same name\" adds to the confusion. Given the categories available, I\u2019m leaning toward \"Internal Project,\" as it seems to relate to setup or configuration within a service environment.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking this IT ticket might be about creating a group or user alias in Active Directory, particularly with the repeated mention of \"snow.\" The reference to \"ad\" suggests it ties to Active Directory. When the user says \"same members ad same name,\" it sounds like they want to duplicate an existing group. Since this involves access control and user accounts, I believe the best category for this ticket is \"Access.\" I\u2019ll prepare a response that categorizes it as such in the required format.**Formatting the Response**\n\nI need to ensure I use the correct format for categorizing this IT ticket. The instruction is clear: it should be a simple response with the chosen category only. While the required format suggests a JSON object with a \"category\" property, the most straightforward output I should give is simply `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`.\n\nIt seems that keeping my response concise is essential here. I\u2019ll proceed with that format, focusing on clarity and correctness!"
