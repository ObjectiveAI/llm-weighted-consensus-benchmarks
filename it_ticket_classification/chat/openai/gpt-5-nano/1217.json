The ticket mentions a \"new purchase\" and various details about a mouse order, including logging allocation after receipt and receipts. It seems pretty clear that this ticket falls under the \"Purchase\" category. While it also mentions \"administrative rights,\" that doesn't really apply here. So, I\u2019ll classify it as \"Purchase\" and respond with a JSON-like format for clarity.**Generating JSON Output**\n\nI need to output a JSON-like object with a specific format that includes a \"category\" key. The instruction says I should define it within the parameters set by the system. So, I\u2019ll produce a valid JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.\n\nSince the user only wants the category for the IT ticket, I won't add extra text\u2014just the structured object. I absolutely must ensure that the string matches the enumerations exactly. So, my final response will simply be {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Let's do this!"
