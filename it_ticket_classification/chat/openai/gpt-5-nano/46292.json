The user provided text about adding generics for a startup project, but it\u2019s not very clear. I\u2019m seeing mention of access rights and member codes, which makes me think this relates to permissions. The main options are \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Internal Project.\" It looks like the most fitting choice might be either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe text highlights issues around access rights and enabling generic member codes, which makes me think it\u2019s primarily about permissions. The options I see are \"Access\" or \"Internal Project,\" but I lean towards \"Access\" since it's directly related to enabling features. The mention of \"start up project codes\" hints at project management, but since it deals with permissions, \"Access\" seems best. I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON-like category object and provide that to the user.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
