It looks like the user may need assistance filling out something for the advertisement related to the new starter. I'll consider these clues while assigning a category, likely leaning towards \"HR Support.\"**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering that this ticket might relate to \"Administrative rights,\" especially given the mention of a new starter and \"ext.\" The phrase \"please help by filling out\" suggests the user might need assistance with an extension or perhaps a form to complete. Since it refers to a new starter, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the most fitting category, indicating they likely need access to systems like Active Directory. I'll structure the response in JSON with the appropriate category.**Categorizing Access Request**\n\nIt seems this ticket is definitely about Access. They might need administrative rights for a new starter, possibly concerning Active Directory group membership, but not necessarily requiring full admin rights. Given that \"new starter ad\" likely indicates an IT access task, I'll categorize it as Access. \n\nI\u2019ll provide the category as a JSON object formatted correctly according to the instruction: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This aligns with the schema provided. I'm ready to submit that!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
