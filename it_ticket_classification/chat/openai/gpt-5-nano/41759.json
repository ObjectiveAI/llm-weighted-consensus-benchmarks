The user reports trouble submitting a weekly form, which seems to be where the error occurs. They can save but not submit. I\u2019m thinking this is more a software issue than a permissions one, despite mentioning \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d I need to find out how to help them resolve this submission problem urgently.**Finalizing category assignment**\n\nI\u2019ve determined that the issue at hand is a function problem rather than a permission one, so \"Miscellaneous\" fits best. It seems to be a generic IT issue relating to submission errors. The \"Access\" category doesn't seem right since it's not about login credentials but rather about submitting a weekly form. I'll craft the final response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. This keeps things clear and avoids any unnecessary content.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
