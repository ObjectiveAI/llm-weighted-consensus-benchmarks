So, my output would be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering what category fits best for this IT ticket. It could be \"Access\" if they're requesting permissions for a new user, since a new starter typically needs access rights. However, the context points more toward \"HR Support\" because it's about onboarding a new starter and a job title change.\n\nThe mention of \"please fill\" suggests a possible form related to HR. So, I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Choosing a category for IT ticket**\n\nThe mention of \"new starter\" clearly points to onboarding, which falls under \"HR Support.\" I'll select that category now. The instruction requires a JSON-like object format for the response.\n\nEven though previous tasks focused on just providing a plain string, the structure indicates I should adhere to the category format. Therefore, I\u2019ll finalize my answer as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Keeping it concise and straightforward without extra commentary is key!"
