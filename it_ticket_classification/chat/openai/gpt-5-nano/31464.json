I think it fits best under the \"Purchase\" category since it\u2019s about procuring a license. However, if it's part of a broader internal initiative, it might also qualify as \"Internal Project.\" Overall, this ticket appears to be focused on software license procurement and testing.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI'm looking at the categories we have: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Since this is about license procurement, it clearly falls under the \"Purchase\" category. While \"Access\" could apply if it were about permissions, it's definitely centered on a license. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object, specifying the category as \"Purchase.\" So the final result will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. Alright, let's confirm that!"
