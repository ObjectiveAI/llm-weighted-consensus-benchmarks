Since it's about purchasing parts and approvals, I think it fits best under \"Purchase.\" I'll prepare the output in JSON format with the chosen category.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user provided a garbled message about submitting parts that need manager approval and mentioned \"Oracle,\" which might refer to the Oracle system. Given the focus on approvals and the submitted parts, categorizing this ticket under \"Purchase\" makes the most sense. While \"Access\" could relate to permissions, the main theme is clearly about purchasing and approvals. I'll format the output correctly as a JSON object with the category field set to \"Purchase.\" Here's how it will look: `{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}`."
