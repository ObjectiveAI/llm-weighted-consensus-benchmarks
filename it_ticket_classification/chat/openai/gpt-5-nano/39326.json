It seems to mention an error with \"changing prompts\" and some request status regarding a line manager. I\u2019ll be looking at the provided categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others to decide the best fit. Since the content is a bit garbled, I'll focus on the main issue of prompt changes as a starting point for classification.**Analyzing IT Ticket**\n\nIt seems there could be a prompt change error here. The user\u2019s message mentions checking the status of a change request for their line manager but also highlights that assignments are not made. There\u2019s a request for direct assignment, which could indicate an issue with access or administrative rights. While \u201cchanging prompts\u201d might suggest a miscellaneous category, the specifics about assignments and workflow improvement suggest it might actually belong to the internal project category.**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at various categories for this IT ticket: Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. Since the issue involves change requests and assignments, \"Internal Project\" might seem fitting as it relates to process improvement. However, considering the user's request about direct assignment, \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights\" seems more appropriate since it deals with permissions and task assignments. There\u2019s mention of a line manager and requests not assigned, so I think \"Access\" would be the best choice for clarity.**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket related to \"Administrative rights\" and a \"prompt error.\" It seems there\u2019s a request to check the status of a change request for a line manager\u2019s access. I think it's appropriate to categorize it as \"Access\" since that's a broader term for permissions and assignments. Now, I need to craft a final response in JSON format with the category specified. The output should reflect the expected format clearly, indicating the chosen category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
