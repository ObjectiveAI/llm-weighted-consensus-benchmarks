They mentioned missing add/edit buttons from the Change Request (CR) form and requested that it be logged and investigated. This doesn't seem to fit hardware, HR support, or access issues. It seems to relate to a software UI issue, which might best fit under \"Miscellaneous\" since it's a bug that doesn\u2019t align with other categories. There\u2019s also a chance it could relate to \"Internal Project.\"**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to best categorize the IT ticket about missing add/edit buttons in a form. Since it\u2019s clearly an application issue, it doesn\u2019t relate to hardware, storage, or purchases. \"Miscellaneous\" seems the most fitting. Some organizations might label this as \u201cInternal Project\u201d for internal tooling, but it\u2019s more accurately categorized as \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object with the required structure: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I need to follow the exact format as specified!"
