The details include the door staying open for hours and possibly triggering an alert. This suggests that it relates to either hardware or access control systems. Given that the categories are \"Hardware\" for door hardware and \"Access\" for door access, I think \"Access\" might fit best since it addresses the access control aspect.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a ticket about a balcony door that\u2019s not closing properly. The mention of it possibly triggering a security alert suggests some connection to access control. However, \u201cdoor not closing properly\u201d hints at a hardware issue with the door sensor. So I\u2019m weighing the categories: \u201cHardware,\u201d which applies to physical equipment, versus \u201cAccess\u201d for security aspects. Since it\u2019s mainly about a physical door, I think \u201cHardware\u201d makes the most sense here.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
