The options available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since the ticket directly relates to storage capacity, the best category is \"Storage.\" There might be room for additional details about the issue, but for now, my focus is strictly on categorizing the ticket accurately.**Understanding JSON output**\n\nI'm working on categorizing the IT ticket. The prompt asks for a JSON-like object with a \"category\" property, which should contain one of the specified categories. The response format is pretty clear: it needs to match the schema provided.\n\nI realize that the best output will be minimal, so I can simply return a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. While I could include a justification, the instructions indicate that brevity is key here, so I\u2019ll stick to just the JSON.**Outputting plain JSON**\n\nI need to provide a plain JSON string for the response. The platform sometimes expects plain text, but since I have a valid format to follow, I'll stick to the required structure. \n\nSo, the output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. That aligns with the expectations, and it's straightforward, which is great! Let's go ahead and do that!"
