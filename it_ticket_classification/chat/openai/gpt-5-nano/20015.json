The user message indicates that they are referring to a new purchase order for a wall TV, mentioning installation and receipts. \n\nIt seems that the best fit would be \"Purchase\" since it directly relates to the new order and documentation, but \"Hardware\" might also work due to the nature of the item.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI have to categorize this IT ticket, and from the user's message, it seems like they're discussing a new purchase and installation. Phrases like \"new purchase po\" and \"log installation\" imply procurement tasks, suggesting that \"Purchase\" might be the most suitable category. Although \"Hardware\" could also apply since it involves a physical item, \"Purchase\" aligns more closely with the request. I need to format my response in a JSON-like object for clarity.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe instruction outlines that I need to output a JSON object with a specified schema. It seems the suitable category for this IT ticket is \"Purchase.\" So, I\u2019ll format my response strictly using this schema, ensuring it matches the requirement for the \"category\" field.\n\nI\u2019ll respond simply with {\"category\": \"Purchase\"} because that seems to be exactly what the user expects. No extra text or bullet lists are necessary here. Let's provide just that!"
