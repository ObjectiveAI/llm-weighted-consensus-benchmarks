The ticket mentions a second monitor, which clearly falls under hardware. So, I believe the category should be \"Hardware.\" However, since the user also mentions provisioning a new monitor, I\u2019m considering \"Purchase\" as a potential category. Ultimately, \"Hardware\" seems to fit better since it\u2019s focused on the physical request rather than just the purchase aspect.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nFor this IT ticket taxonomy, I need to categorize a request for a second monitor due to relocation. It seems clear that this should fall under \"Hardware,\" although \"Purchase\" could work if they want to procure it. However, given that it's specifically about providing a hardware asset, \"Hardware\" feels like the right choice. I'll format my response strictly as a JSON object with the category labeled as \"Hardware,\" ensuring no extra content. Here\u2019s how it will look: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
