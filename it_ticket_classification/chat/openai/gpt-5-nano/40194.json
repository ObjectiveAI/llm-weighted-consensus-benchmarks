The text provided seems a bit garbled but refers to ServiceNow, missing service requests, and mentions an administrator and reports.\n\nFrom the list of categories, this sounds related to \"Access\" or potentially \"Administrative rights\" since it's about viewing service requests. There\u2019s a lot of information about accessing views and logs, so my best guess would be to classify it under \"Access.\" It seems to involve permissions or access issues related to service requests.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the user's IT ticket. It mentions \"administrative rights\" and \"log ticket for assign,\" which could suggest needing admin privileges. However, it also talks about a problem with \"missing from service requests view,\" indicating a potential software issue. \n\nThe available categories are somewhat limited, so I\u2019m leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Administrative rights\" seems too specific, and \"Internal Project\" doesn\u2019t quite fit. I need to pick the best option to represent the user\u2019s issue.**Parsing the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the user's ticket text, which is about ServiceNow and a missing service requests view. There\u2019s definitely a suggestion of needing access or permissions, so \"Access\" seems like a reasonable category. However, there's also \"Administrative rights,\" which pertains to specific admin privileges. Both categories are available, but \"Access\" feels more generic and appropriate for this situation. I just need to clarify which option better fits the user's concern regarding access to the service requests.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
