The ticket discusses a scheduled network outage in offices and requests specific timing, mentioning the possibility of weekend work and notifying clients. \n\nThis sounds like it could fit into \"Internal Project\" since it deals with scheduled outages affecting office operations. I\u2019m also considering \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" but the focus on notifications and scheduling leans more toward \"Internal Project.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nFor categorizing this IT ticket, I'm considering a few options based on the content. The ticket mentions a scheduled network outage affecting office access. While \"Administrative rights\" doesn't apply, \"Access\" could be relevant since the outage impacts network accessibility. \n\nHowever, it seems more appropriate to categorize it as \"Internal Project\" because this is a planned outage linked to a project upgrade. Therefore, I\u2019m confident that the best fit is \"Internal Project,\" and I'll provide that as my categorization.**Generating JSON output**\n\nThe instruction clearly states that I need to respond with a JSON format for the category. I must create an object with the category field set to \"Internal Project.\" Since this is allowed by the prompt, I\u2019ll ensure the JSON is valid without any extra text.\n\nI\u2019ll format it carefully and confirm that \"Internal Project\" matches the enumerated values correctly. Here\u2019s the output:  \n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
