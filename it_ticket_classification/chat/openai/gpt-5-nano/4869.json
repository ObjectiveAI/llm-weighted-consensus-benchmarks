The categories available include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The user asks for a categorization and gives me a rather confusing text about overtime and apologies.\n\nIt seems to relate to HR or perhaps administrative rights since it discusses overtime and annual leave. I'll decide on a fitting category based on the content!**Categorizing HR-related tickets**\n\nI'm identifying the best category for this IT ticket. The text mentions \"annual leave\" and \"paid overtime,\" which seem more HR-related than IT. Given the categories available, \"HR Support\" is the most fitting since it's about leave and overtime.\n\nThe user wants to categorize it, and I\u2019ll return just a JSON object as instructed. The format required is straightforward. I'll go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"} \n\nThat should do the trick without needing any extra justification!"
