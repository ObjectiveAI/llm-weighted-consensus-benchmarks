It appears to be an HR-related issue, which should fit under \"HR Support.\" However, it could also relate to access problems if they're having login or permission issues. Since they're specifically asking for help with the annual leave, \"HR Support\" seems like the most appropriate category for this ticket.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI should categorize this ticket as \"HR Support,\" since that's the closest fit. Although there's also \"Administrative rights,\" which might relate to permission issues, the user is clearly asking for help submitting an annual leave request. The description indicates it\u2019s about accessing HR processes. While \"Access\" could also work if they're having login issues, \u201cHR Support\u201d is generally how IT categorizes HR-related tasks. So, I\u2019ll go with \"HR Support.\u201d**Outputting ticket category**\n\nI need to respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. The required format just needs to include the property \"category\" as a string, with no extra text or commentary. So, I\u2019ll simply output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This keeps it clear and straightforward, which is exactly what I want! Let's deliver that now."
