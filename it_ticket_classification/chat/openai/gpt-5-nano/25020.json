It mentions items like \"key fob\" and \"joiner infrastructure,\" which seem related to access and hardware. \n\nGiven the options, \"Hardware\" and \"Access\" appear to be most relevant, as the ticket deals with hardware tokens used to access resources. However, it might also touch on \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights,\" depending on how it's framed. I'll lean toward \"Hardware\" for security devices.**Assigning IT ticket category**\n\nThe text mentions \"joiner infrastructure,\" which relates to onboarding a new hire. I need to categorize this IT ticket properly. \n\nConsidering the context, \"Hardware\" seems most fitting since it's focused on a hardware token, like a secure ID token or key fob. \"Internal Project\" could apply if it's for onboarding, but it feels more hardware-oriented. \n\nI plan to structure my output as a JSON object, clearly stating \"category\": \"Hardware\" as the best choice. A brief justification might be helpful, but it's optional.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
