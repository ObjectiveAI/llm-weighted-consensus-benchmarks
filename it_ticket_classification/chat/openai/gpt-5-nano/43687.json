The categories I have to choose from include options like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" and \"Storage.\"\n\nGiven that the problem is clearly about mailbox capacity, the best category is \"Storage,\" not \"Access.\" I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object, providing the category as \"Storage.\"**Preparing JSON output**\n\nThe required output format is a JSON-like object that includes a category property based on the user's request. The schema specifies that the category can include options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Since I determined that the best fit is \"Storage,\" I need to respond with exactly that JSON format.\n\nSo, I'll format the response as {\"category\":\"Storage\"} without any extra text. Let's go ahead and do it!"
