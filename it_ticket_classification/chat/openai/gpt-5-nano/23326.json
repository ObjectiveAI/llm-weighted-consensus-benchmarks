But I see that \"Administrative rights\" is also listed separately, which might actually suit the context better, given the mention of ownership transfer and member permissions. The user's request\u2014\"ownership request ownership hi please ownership specifically each needs add members thank officer\"\u2014suggests they want to assign ownership and add members. But it could also align with \"Internal Project\" if it relates to a team, though no project name is provided.**Determining the proper category**\n\nI think the best category for this ticket would be either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it's focused on ownership and adding members, which involves access control and permissions. Using \"Administrative rights\" makes sense as it's a more specific form of access. The user\u2019s request for categorization and the provided text suggest they\u2019re looking to grant or modify administrative rights. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object with the chosen category.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
