Given the problem is about a screen not working, \"Hardware\" seems like the best fit. While \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option, it\u2019s less specific. So, I need to respond with a JSON object that includes \"Hardware\" under the proper schema format. My final output will be: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}.**Categorizing IT Ticket Response**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket based on their description, which includes a \"blank screen\" issue. I need to follow the JSON schema provided, which specifies that the response must include a \"category\" field. Given this is a hardware issue, \"Hardware\" seems to fit best. I\u2019ll keep it simple and respond with just the necessary JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. No extra text needed!**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user mentioned a \"screen working problem,\" which makes me think this could fit into different categories, like \"Hardware\" or \"Internal Project.\" However, since they\u2019re referring to a screen, it\u2019s clear this is a hardware device issue. Although other categories like \"Administrative rights\" exist, \"Hardware\" is the best option. So, I\u2019ll go with that and finalize my response as: {\"category\":\"Hardware}. Now, that should do it!"
