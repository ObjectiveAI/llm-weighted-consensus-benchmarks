This could fall under \"Access\" since managing access revocation for departing employees is crucial. Alternatively, if it concerns an internal process, \"Internal Project\" might work too. However, \"Access\" feels like the best fit here based on the context provided.**Formatting the category response**\n\nI need to prepare the category option in JSON format, specifically as an object with properties. It should look something like this: type is \"object\" and properties that include \"category\" as a string with defined options. Based on the context, I'll select \"Access\" as the category. So I\u2019ll output the JSON as follows: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's important to ensure that I match the case, as it needs to conform to the schema provided.**Delivering the JSON response**\n\nThe schema indicates that I need to produce an object with a property called \"category.\" So, I'll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It seems the instruction is clear that I should only output the category without any additional text. While \"Internal Project\" could be a possibility, the context suggests it\u2019s really more about decommissioning access for employees leaving, making \"Access\" the most fitting option. I'm ready to deliver the final answer: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
