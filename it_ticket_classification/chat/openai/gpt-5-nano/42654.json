The user managed to log in on mobile but encounters a \"password incorrect\" prompt on another laptop. From the provided categories, it seems to fit best under \"Access\" since it's all about login issues. Although \"Administrative rights\" or \"Hardware\" could potentially apply, the login access issue makes \"Access\" the most appropriate choice.**Parsing IT ticket details**\n\nI'm analyzing the user's message about their login issues. They mention being unable to log in after a previous password reset but can still access their account on mobile. Unfortunately, they get an incorrect password prompt on another laptop. This clearly points to an access/login inconsistency across devices. I think the best category for this is \"Access,\" rather than \"Administrative rights\" or others. Next, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the appropriate category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
