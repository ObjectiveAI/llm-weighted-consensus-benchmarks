I'm trying to figure out the best category. It seems to relate mostly to hardware since it's about retrieving a device, but it also touches on purchase orders. I don't think it really fits under Administrative rights. So, I'd lean toward classifying it under Hardware or Purchase.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm working on categorizing a ticket based on phrases like \"log allocation,\" \"retrieve old device,\" and \"purchase PO.\" It seems that \"retrieve old device\" fits into the Hardware category since it's about a device. However, it also mentions \"purchase PO\" and receipts, which points toward the Purchase category as well. Since there's asset management involved, it would have been nice to have an \"Asset Management\" category, but I think Hardware is the best fit here, with Purchase as a close second.**Classifying IT ticket category**\n\nIt seems the user is looking for the most relevant category to classify the IT ticket they provided. Considering the content, \"Hardware\" fits well since it mentions \"retrieve the old device\" and \"allocation.\" The format needs to be a JSON object, specifically: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I need to make sure there are no extra comments in the response, just the category as requested. So, I'll go ahead and return that JSON object without any fluff."
