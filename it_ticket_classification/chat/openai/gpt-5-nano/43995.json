The content indicates they're asking to disable lost guest cards and enable new ones. This clearly falls under access and access control due to the nature of guest cards. While it could also fit under \"Administrative rights,\" the main focus is on access control. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" Responding with a JSON format for the category would be a good approach!**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nThe prompt asks me to categorize the IT ticket with specific options provided. The output needs to be in JSON format as a structured object. Based on the ticket content, I\u2019m categorizing it as \"Access\" because it relates to managing guest cards. While \"Administrative rights\" could also fit, \"Access\" is more relevant for this request. I should avoid adding any extra text and focus solely on providing the JSON. So, here it is:  \n\n{\"category\": \"Access\"}"
