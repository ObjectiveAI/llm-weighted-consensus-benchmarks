The text mentions cleanup, deleting resources, and stopping resources, which might relate to either Storage or Administrative rights. There are specific tasks around cleaning up and managing resources on particular dates. Given the wording, this seems to be about Storage cleanup tasks. So, I'll lean towards categorizing it under Storage since it fits the context of managing resources.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI see multiple date mentions in the ticket text regarding deleting resources on Fridays and Wednesdays, along with the mention of a consultant. I need to categorize this ticket into one of the provided options, like Storage or Administrative rights. Given the focus on deleting resources, I think Storage is the likely choice. Although Administrative rights could be relevant due to \"assign queue\" and \"requested tickets\", there's no clear mention of admin rights. Therefore, I lean toward categorizing it as Storage and will briefly explain this reasoning.**Formatting the response**\n\nThe system requires me to provide a category in JSON format. I'll structure my response as a JSON object with \"category\": \"...\". Since the earlier instructions specify that the category is \"Storage,\" I\u2019ll ensure it\u2019s formatted correctly without any extra text. Even though bullet lists are mentioned, the task clearly states to return just the JSON object. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"} \n\nThis should meet all the requirements!"
