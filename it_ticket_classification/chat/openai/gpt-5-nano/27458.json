So \"HR Support\" seems to fit best since it's focused on HR changes in Oracle. I think I need to output a JSON object with the category set to \"HR Support.\" The required format will follow the guidelines provided.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI need to provide the JSON response as stated: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. However, the schema requires a specific structure with \"type\": \"object,\" and under \"properties,\" it needs to detail the category. The instruction clearly asks me to categorize the IT ticket. To meet those requirements, I should output a JSON object that matches the schema while still ensuring that it conveys the category accurately. I'll ensure it's concise. Let's deliver that result!"
