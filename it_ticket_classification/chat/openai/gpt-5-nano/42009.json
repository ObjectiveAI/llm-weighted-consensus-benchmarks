The ticket seems to mention issues with timecards being submitted for approval, errors during that process, and also involves the Oracle system. It looks like the user wants to resubmit due to changes related to annual leave as well. Based on this context, I think the appropriate category for this ticket would be \"HR Support\" since it directly relates to HR and timecard approvals.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the categories for this IT ticket, which mentions timecard submission and Oracle errors. While \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access\" could fit due to Oracle being a system, this ticket is clearly HR-related. Therefore, \"HR Support\" seems like the best match. The instruction specifies to categorize the IT ticket, so I'll strictly follow that with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. No need for additional explanations since the instruction just asks for the categorization."
