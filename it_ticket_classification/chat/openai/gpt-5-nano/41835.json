It mentions projection issues and display problems related to a second monitor setup, specifically about a black strip on the primary monitor and applications shifting left. Since this clearly involves hardware, I should categorize it under \"Hardware.\" While it could also fit \"Internal Project,\" it seems more appropriate to label it as a hardware issue. Categorizing as \"Miscellaneous\" might be too vague, so \"Hardware\" is the best choice.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI need to respond with the ticket categorized in the correct JSON format. The instruction clearly asks for output as a JSON object, specifically for the \"category\" field, designated as \"Hardware.\" \n\nTo ensure I'm following the schema, I\u2019ll format the output correctly: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}` without any extra text or heavy formatting. This aligns with the guidelines about avoid excess formatting since it might be parsed by code. I'll just deliver the JSON as requested."
