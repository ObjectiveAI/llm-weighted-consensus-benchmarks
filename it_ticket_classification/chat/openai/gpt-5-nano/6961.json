The user mentions \"starter forms\" and a \"starting date,\" which makes me think this falls under the \"HR Support\" category. There are also elements that hint at \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" It looks like the user needs assistance with forms related to a new starter, so I'll lean towards categorizing this ticket as \"HR Support.\"**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing a ticket related to onboarding a new employee. It mentions user accounts, access, and starter forms, which leads me to believe it's best categorized as \"HR Support.\" The key details are about confirming a starting date and attaching forms, not directly requesting access provisioning. While \"Access\" is an option, it doesn't seem to fit as well since the focus is on onboarding paperwork. So, categorizing this ticket as \"HR Support\" seems like the best choice!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to produce a JSON object with a valid category string. The options include categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and a few others. \n\nIn this case, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" since the ticket is focused on onboarding information for a new starter, rather than access to a dev environment. So, I'll confirm this with the output:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
