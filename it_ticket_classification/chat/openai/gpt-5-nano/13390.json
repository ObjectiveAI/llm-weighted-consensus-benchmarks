It seems related to team management and changes, which could fit under \"Internal Project.\" The task is to format my response as a JSON object, including the specified category. The guidelines indicate that I have valid channels like analysis or final, and it's important to maintain the proper format with the \"category\" field clearly defined. Alright, I\u2019ll output it like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Analyzing ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m looking at an IT ticket that mentions line management changes, programme portfolio officer, and other unclear phrases. The references could suggest it's related to HR Support or Administrative rights. I think line management changes imply organizational modifications, which might fit under HR Support. The phrase \"initiate nostrum programme\" could be a quirky way of saying \"our programme.\" Since it revolves around internal processes, I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as an Internal Project. Let's nail down that category!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think this ticket could fit within \"HR Support\" since it addresses line management changes, but that category usually covers things like onboarding or leave requests. The mention of a \"programme portfolio officer\" suggests it could relate to an Internal Project instead, as it hints at restructuring. Evaluating all the clues, particularly around team changes and the test lead, I feel confident categorizing it as \"Internal Project.\" So, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
