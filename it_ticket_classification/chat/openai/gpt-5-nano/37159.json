It sounds like the user has been struggling with this for a while, seeking help with their Outlook app for mobile. So, the best category is likely \"Access.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI have a few category options to consider: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since this issue with the Outlook mobile app is related to sending emails that are stuck in the outbox, it doesn\u2019t really fit into hardware or storage.\n\nIt seems more like an app issue, so I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Access\" might work too if it involves emailing access. Overall, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" and respond with a JSON-like format for clarity.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
