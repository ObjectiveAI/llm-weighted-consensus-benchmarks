Given the content, it seems best to categorize this ticket under \"Access.\"**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m weighing whether to classify this ticket as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" depending on the need to grant owner rights. The term \"owner access\" suggests admin rights for a mailing list, which seems more precise as \"Administrative rights.\" However, it is about granting access to a mailing list, so \"Access\" could work. Ultimately, since a mailing list owner role is administrative, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll structure my response as JSON with the chosen category.**Determining the category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the text that mentions \"mailing list owner access\" and \"please add owner.\" This indicates it's specifically an access request for adding an owner, which doesn't fit into categories like hardware or storage. The term \"owner\" implies administrative rights, suggesting that the appropriate category would be \"Administrative rights.\" So, I\u2019ll respond with `{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}`. It seems straightforward, and I\u2019ll keep it succinct for the user."
