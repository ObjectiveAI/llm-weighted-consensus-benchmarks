The schema defines a \"category\" field with specific enumerated options. \n\nIt looks like I should create a JSON object that simply states {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}, even though the schema indicates an object structure. Since it doesn't specify what's required beyond being an enumerated type, I\u2019ll go ahead and stick to that straightforward output.
