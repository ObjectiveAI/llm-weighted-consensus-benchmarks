The ticket seems to be a request to connect a workstation to the network, which suggests a Network/Connectivity issue, although it's not among the categories. I think the best fit is either Access or Hardware. I guess I'll go with Access since it's related to network access rights.**Formatting the IT ticket**\n\nI see the output format needs to be a JSON object with a category field containing one of the specified strings. The ticket's text specifies a request about connecting a workstation to the network, which makes it about network connectivity. I think the best category here is \"Access\" since it relates to network access. So, I\u2019ll just output this as a JSON object with no extra commentary: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
