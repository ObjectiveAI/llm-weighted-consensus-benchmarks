The user mentions problems with OBI reports, specifically regarding open requisitions from last year and parameters or errors with the tool. It seems like this is a technical support issue related to reporting. The available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I wonder if \u201cAccess\u201d fits best here since it involves reports and requisitions.**Classifying the ticket**\n\nThere's no specific category for \"Software\" or \"Applications,\" so I\u2019m considering \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The user is asking if parameters are set or if the tool has errors, which might point to needing access to reports. However, since they mention issues with a report and view permissions for last year's requisition, it leans more towards a software/reporting issue. I think \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit, but I wonder if \"Internal Project\" would work if it's project-specific. I need to output this as a categorized JSON-like object.**Deciding on the category**\n\nThe user provided categories and specified the required output format as a JSON object with a category string. I\u2019m considering whether to choose \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access.\" I\u2019m leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" since it's a broad reporting issue, and there's no \"Software\" category present. However, given that the user refers to opening requisitions and parameters, \"Access\" could be more accurate because it relates to retrieving data from last year. Ultimately, I think I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous\" for a generic fit. I'll format the response as {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
