The user mentions a \"change of discipline\" and a \"transfer form\" related to a job title, salary change, and involvement of an administration officer. This suggests it's related to HR matters. I should lean towards selecting \"HR Support\" as the most fitting category, but \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" could also be considered. I\u2019ll finalize the best choice soon!**Categorizing HR Request**\n\nLooking at the content, it seems to be a request involving a change of discipline and an attached transfer form, which likely relates to an internal HR process. Since it's focusing on job title, salary grade, and not specifically about access rights, I think the best category is \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object categorizing it accordingly, ensuring it meets the requested structure with the category value as \"HR Support.\"**Outputting JSON Format**\n\nThe prompt indicates I need to categorize this IT ticket using a JSON-like object. The correct format is clear: it should include a \"category\" property with a value of \"HR Support.\" According to the schema provided, I need to stick strictly to this format. So, I\u2019ll prepare the JSON response neatly without any additional text. Let's make sure it looks perfect! Here goes:  \n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
