The text mentions \"pending approval\" and suggests something is missing regarding access or permissions. Given that it relates to seeing an approval in Oracle, it seems like \"Access\" would be the more fitting category over \"Administrative rights.\" So, I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"Access\" since it seems to focus on permission issues.**Choosing category for IT ticket**\n\nI'm examining whether to categorize the IT ticket as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The user mentions not being able to see an approval status in Oracle, which might imply they need permissions to view it. Since that seems more related to access within the approval workflow, I'm leaning towards \"Access.\" However, if they require admin rights to actually approve something, \"Administrative rights\" could also be valid. Ultimately, I think \"Access\" fits best.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nSince the user mentioned they cannot see the approval status, and there's no indication of needing admin rights, \"Access\" is the more suitable category. I need to format my response correctly as a JSON object, as specified in the prompt that requires a structured reply. Therefore, I\u2019ll respond with: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text, keeping it concise and clear!"
