It could fall under Access (like password changes or account access), or maybe Administrative rights (for permissions). The phrase \"change career\" seems irrelevant here, while \"change password\" fits better. Since the user has tried to resolve this on their own and encountered errors, it looks like the best category is Access, specifically for user access or password reset. Some parts of the ticket are a bit confusing, though!**Formatting IT ticket category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize this IT ticket, and I need to present my answer in a specific JSON format. I will respond with just the category as instructed. Based on the context, the category is \"Access.\" To follow the required formatting, I\u2019ll structure it like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The prompt clearly states what they want, so I'll keep it simple and ensure that the format is correct according to the schema provided.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
