The phrase \"ext phone\" probably indicates an extension phone, and \"infrastructure\" might refer to the team involved. Based on the provided categories, it seems this ticket fits best under \"Internal Project,\" since it involves adding a user to a project team.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nIt seems this ticket is an access request for granting access to a project team. The most fitting category is \"Access,\u201d though there's also the potential for \"Internal Project\" since it\u2019s about adding a user to an integration project. However, since the request clearly indicates it's about access management, I believe \"Access\" captures the essence best. I should create a JSON object for the output with the \"category\" field included.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
