The user requests access for Thursday PM and mentions ordering the Black Duck software. It seems like this involves both access and procurement for the software. I need to decide if it fits better under \"Access\" or \"Purchase.\" Given the nature of the request, it aligns closely with \"Access,\" since the user primarily needs access to the tool for a specific timing.**Categorizing IT Access Request**\n\nThe request mentions providing access to Black Duck for Thursday PM and includes details about linking and ordering the software. I'm trying to decide between categorizing this as \"Access\" or \"Purchase.\" It seems pivotal since they're seeking access to the software and requesting a link, suggesting it's about gaining access primarily. However, the mention of \u201cordering\u201d also hints at a procurement aspect. I think \"Access\" is the main priority, so I'll lean toward that category.**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI see that the user requests both access and purchase related to Black Duck. Since they explicitly mention needing a link and ordering the software, it raises the question of categorizing this as \"Access\" or \"Purchase.\" Given their primary request is for access to the software, I think \"Access\" fits best. Although \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant, it seems too specific. I\u2019ll go ahead and categorize this ticket as \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
