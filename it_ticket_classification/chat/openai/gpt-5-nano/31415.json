It\u2019s important to get this right for efficient handling!**Classifying Ticket Type**\n\nIt looks like the text is referring to a \"starter form\" for an employee or intern, specifically about onboarding. I see \"HR Support\" as a fitting category since this relates to onboarding processes, even though it seemed like I needed to double-check. The categories include \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights,\" but given the mention of \"starter form internship,\" it leans more toward HR Support. I'll prepare a JSON object to categorize this appropriately!**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nThe system requires me to create a JSON object to categorize the IT ticket, focusing on the field for \"category.\" The instruction is clear: I need to categorize it without adding any extra text. I know the best fit is \u201cHR Support,\u201d especially since it\u2019s about the onboarding process. I considered \u201cAccess\u201d due to the mention of a \"starter form,\" but it seems safe to stick with \"HR Support\" for this context. Let's finalize that JSON!"
