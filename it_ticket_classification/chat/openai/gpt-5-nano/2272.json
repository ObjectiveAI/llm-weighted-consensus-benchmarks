The user is asking for rights to change members, possibly within a system, which could relate to group membership. Looking at the options, it seems like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" would be the most appropriate categories since it involves permissions. Given that it refers clearly to rights concerning changing members, I think \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit.**Creating JSON category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket and provide a JSON-like category object in a specific format. I\u2019m opting for \"Administrative rights\" as the category since it refers to permissions. However, I need to confirm if it has a space in it. Yes, it does read \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nThe output should be a JSON object with the category property set correctly. So I\u2019ll format it as:\n{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} \n\nJust that, no extra text needed!"
