They mention \"NIM\" and \"DRAM,\" but the phrasing is a bit garbled. While they emphasize logging allocation, which usually relates to asset management, the category list doesn't include \"Asset\" or \"Allocation.\" The closest match is \"Purchase\" since it specifically mentions a \"new purchase order.\" \n\nSo, I\u2019ll categorize this IT ticket as \"Purchase.\"**Finalizing the category response**\n\nLooking at the other options like \"Internal Project,\" \"Storage,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Access,\" they don't seem relevant here. So, I'm confident that \"Purchase\" is the right category. \n\nI\u2019ll just respond with the formatted JSON object as the user requested. The safest approach is to keep it straightforward without any extra text, just providing the category. I'll ensure there\u2019s no extraneous whitespace, so the final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
