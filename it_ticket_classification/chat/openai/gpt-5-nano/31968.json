The categories include things like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Access.\" The ticket mentions maternity leave, team listings, and related questions, which mostly leans towards HR support and administrative concerns. Given that it directly relates to maternity leave and listing someone on a team, I think \"HR Support\" is the most suitable category for this ticket.**Formatting output in JSON**\n\nI need to provide the output in JSON format with a category property. The instruction specifies to respond with a category object. So the format I\u2019ll use is: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This matches exactly, including the space. My final response will consist solely of the object required. \n\nI'll deliver the categorized output as:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nSeems straightforward, right? Let's go ahead and respond with that!"
