This could likely fit under \"Access\" since it's about adding group access. Alternatively, \"Administrative rights\" might work if they're asking for admin rights. Let's determine the best category from here!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nIt could be \"Internal Project\" if \"design authority\" refers to a project group, but it feels safer to categorize this under \"Access\" considering the request to \"add groups.\" I'll produce a JSON-like output for the category field, so it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The system format requires a JSON object that aligns with the specified schema, so I\u2019ll make sure my response fits perfectly with that. If there's ambiguity, \"Administrative rights\" might also apply, but \"Access\" seems to be the best fit.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user wants to add groups, which suggests this relates to \"Access\" or possibly \"Administrative rights.\" Since adding groups implies giving membership or access, I'll go with \"Access.\" I need to ensure my response is a valid JSON object as requested, so it should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll keep it concise and avoid extra explanations unless the user asks for more information. Let's produce that response!"
