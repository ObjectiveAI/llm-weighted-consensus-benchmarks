They want me to find a classification among categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. The text includes phrases about issues with submitting time in Oracle, asking for help, and logging in. It looks like the user is experiencing problems with the Oracle Time and Attendance system related to time submission. I should classify it under \"HR Support\" since it\u2019s about submitting work hours and seeking assistance.**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt seems the user is facing login screen issues, but there's no screenshot provided. They mention problems with \"submitting time\" and \"log screen,\" which leads me to think it might be a login issue. I need to find the best category for this. Options include \"Access\" for login issues, or possibly \"HR Support\" since it's about submitting time. However, it could also be \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" if related to software development. Ultimately, it feels like \"Access\" fits best due to the login context.**Choosing the ticket category**\n\nThe phrase \"when try log screen\" suggests the user can reach the login screen but faces some issue. It might fit under \"Access,\" since they can't log in properly. \"Miscellaneous\" could work if the main problem isn't clear, but it seems like the main focus is on login and time submission. Given the context, I'd say \"Access\" is the best choice. Since the user asked me to categorize the IT ticket, I should respond with a JSON-like object that states the chosen category.**Returning the category**\n\nI need to respond with the chosen category in a straightforward way. I'll return it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s best to keep it simple and avoid extra explanations unless the user asks for more details. So, I\u2019ll just provide this clear response and move forward."
