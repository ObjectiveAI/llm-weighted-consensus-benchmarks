It seems they want to add someone as a member related to updated changes in owner member groups and are asking for an investigation about it. The available categories include Access, Administrative rights, or Internal Project. Given the details about group membership and ownership changes, the \u201cAccess\u201d category looks like the best fit, but I should consider \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d too.**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt seems the user is requesting to add someone as a member of a group, which relates to access rights. The most appropriate category for this IT ticket likely is \"Access,\" since it involves group membership. Although \"Administrative rights\" could work if it implies granting admin roles, the phrase \"owner member\" suggests a focus on access and membership updates. So, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Access\" and format my response in a JSON object.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
