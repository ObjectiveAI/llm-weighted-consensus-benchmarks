The user asked, \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" and has provided a long text with various phrases. My task is to go through that text carefully and select the most appropriate category for the ticket. I'm ready to analyze the content and make the best choice!**Analyzing the IT ticket content**\n\nIt looks like the content of this IT ticket mentions creating an email rule related to HR. There are references to a \"Tuesday PM\" and a \"logged starter,\" which seems to indicate it's about onboarding a new employee. There's a lot of phrasing around assistance, tracking progress, and completion of forms related to this HR query. Overall, it appears to fit within the HR Support category. I'm ready to categorize this ticket accordingly!**Determining the appropriate category**\n\nThe ticket mentions terms like \"starter,\" \"form joining,\" and \"administration officer,\" which suggests it's about onboarding rather than administrative rights or system access. The repeated references to HR indicate it fits best under the HR Support category. While \"Internal Project\" could be a consideration, it aligns more with HR process automation. Since the user is asking me to categorize this IT ticket, I\u2019ll confirm that HR Support is the appropriate choice and output it in the required JSON format.**Finalizing the category output**\n\nI need to respond with the category object as specified, which is {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It's important to ensure there\u2019s no extra text, just the output in the correct format. I'll double-check the capitalization to match the required enum exactly. Since my instructions are clear, I\u2019ll proceed to deliver my response without any additional commentary. Let's finalize this!"
