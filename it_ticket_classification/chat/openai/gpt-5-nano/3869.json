It seems like this is HR-related, but it could also relate to access since there\u2019s a mention of \"administrator.\" Given that it\u2019s clearly about onboarding, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"HR Support.\" The output should conform to a JSON format, so it would look like: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"} This makes the most sense for the request.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket is about a new starter, so I\u2019m considering its category. It could fit under \"HR Support\" for onboarding processes, but there\u2019s also a chance it\u2019s related to \"Access\" for providing system access. The mention of Belgrade and dates isn't very helpful, but with \"new starter\" and \"administrator,\" it sounds like it\u2019s more about granting access. \n\nSo, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" for provisioning user accounts. \"Administrative rights\" might apply but isn\u2019t necessarily the best choice here.**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI'm concluding that the safest classification for the IT ticket is \"Access,\" since it relates to onboarding a new starter who joins in December. The phrase \"enclosed hires\" is a bit unclear, but given the context, it's likely asking for access setup for this new employee. The mention of Belgrade further supports this. So I'll categorize it as \"Access,\" and format the response as JSON-like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll keep it concise, just providing the category as instructed."
