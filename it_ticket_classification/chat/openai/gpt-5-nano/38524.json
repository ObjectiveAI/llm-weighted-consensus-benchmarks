It\u2019s important to choose the right category based on the content provided in the ticket. I'll carefully evaluate the details of the ticket to ensure that I select the most appropriate category, making it easier for the team to address the issue effectively. Let's get started!**Analyzing garbled ticket text**\n\nThe ticket text is quite jumbled, mentioning access issues like \"resources\" and connectivity. It seems the user can't access certain resources while connected, especially for watching tutorials, and they're asking for advice on this. Given these details, it's clear that this falls under the category of Access. I need to respond in a JSON-like format that specifies the category as a string. Alright, let's format that response properly!**Formatting the JSON response**\n\nI need to create a JSON-like object with the field \"category\" that fits the given schema. The schema requires it to be formatted as an object with the category being one of specific enumerated strings. Since this ticket is categorized as \"Access,\" I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's crucial to keep it straightforward and ensure there's no extra content. The user specifically asked for the category, so I'll stick to that instruction!**Providing the category response**\n\nI see that I need to respond with just the category for the IT ticket. The specific output should be in JSON format as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s straightforward since the instruction is clear: I only need to provide the category field. So, I\u2019ll make sure to follow that format precisely and just give the required output without any extra information. Alright, let\u2019s go ahead and produce that response!"
