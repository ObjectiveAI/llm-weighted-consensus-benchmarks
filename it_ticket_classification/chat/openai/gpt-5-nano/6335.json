It seems to focus on ASP forecasting and includes phrases like \"pm add pm code officer,\" \"technical programme id canary,\" and \"annual leave.\" Given the context, I think it best fits the \"Internal Project\" category. The mention of forecasting and programming indicates it's related to an internal initiative rather than hardware or HR support. Alright, let's go with \"Internal Project\" for classification!**Classifying project management ticket**\n\nThis ticket seems to relate to project management with mentions of forecasting, adding PM codes, and calendar dates like \"Friday October.\" I'm considering the category it fits into, such as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but those feel off. The ticket is discussing forecasts and project kickoff, which points more toward \"Internal Project.\" That category seems most appropriate, given the focus on a technical program. I'll prepare to output a JSON object with the category set to \"Internal Project.\"{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
