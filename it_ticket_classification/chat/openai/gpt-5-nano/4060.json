The user's message suggests they need it for neck issues, which points to hardware. I'll be leaning towards the \"Hardware\" category since it's specifically about a laptop accessory. While \"Purchase\" could work too, it feels right to classify it as \"Hardware.\" After all, they\u2019re asking for a hardware solution to their neck condition. No need for \"Administrative rights\" here!**Categorizing IT request**\n\nThe user's message is a request for a laptop holder, likely due to a neck condition. This seems to fit into the \"Hardware\" category since it's a hardware request. I can respond with a JSON object in the required format. However, there's also the possibility of \"Purchase\" since they're asking for equipment. It\u2019s important to categorize correctly; it might be either \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" Given it\u2019s a request for a laptop stand, I\u2019ll lean towards \"Hardware\" for clarity.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe user's request for a \"laptop holder\" seems to stem from a neck condition. I believe this fits into the \"Hardware\" category since it involves a hardware accessory. While \"Purchase\" might also apply for procurement requests, this ticket is more about a device request than an issue. I'll go with \"Hardware\" as the category. I\u2019ll format my response correctly as a JSON object with no extra text. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll provide: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
