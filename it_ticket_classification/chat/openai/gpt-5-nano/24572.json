It repeatedly mentions maternity leave, inactive statuses, job details, and various titles. The predefined categories are \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights\". Since it relates to maternity leave, it feels HR-related, but there's also mention of access. I think HR Support is the best fit for this ticket, considering the context.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe appropriate category for this ticket is likely \"HR Support\" since it mentions maternity leave and employee status. I thought about \"Administrative rights,\" but there's no access-related content in the ticket. So, I\u2019ll go with HR Support. I'll respond with the required JSON format, ensuring it's presented correctly. \n\nThe output should look like this:  \n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"} \n\nIt\u2019s important to stick closely to the expected response format while providing the right category!**Finalizing the IT ticket response**\n\nThe schema specifies a \"type\":\"object\" wrapper, but that doesn\u2019t need to be included in my response. The prompt is simply to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" and the main requirement is the category string or JSON object. Since the ticket mentions \"on maternity leave,\" I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support.\" \n\nMy final output will be:  \n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"} \n\nI\u2019ll make sure not to add any extra text or formatting. It's straightforward!"
