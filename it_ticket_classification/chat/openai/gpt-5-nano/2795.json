It could fit into categories like Access, if it\u2019s about receiving submissions, or Administrative rights. It seems like I\u2019ll need to parse the details for clarity since the context isn\u2019t entirely straightforward.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI need to select a category for the IT ticket based on phrases like \"sanction checks done\" and \"old broad street.\" It seems the ticket might deal with \"contracts waiting for sanction checks,\" which connects to \"Purchase\" related to procurement. The mention of a \"commercial adviser\" and \"opp contract\" makes that seem even more likely. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit if it's about permissions, that feels less probable. I might end up classifying this as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
