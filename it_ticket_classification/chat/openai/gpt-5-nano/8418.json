The text mentions an Oracle report and a request to add a column, along with phrases like \"seen by members\" suggesting access control. There's also mention of \"administration officer\" and \"annual leave,\" indicating an HR or administrative issue. So, I'm considering the \"HR Support\" category. However, \"Administrative rights\" might also be relevant due to the access control aspect.**Deciding Category for IT Ticket**\n\nThe user likely requests a feature enhancement with the phrase \u201cplease add column report.\u201d The mention of \"Oracle report\" suggests it's related to an Oracle database, while \u201cseen by members\u201d might indicate an access or visibility concern. This could fit the \"Access\" category if they aim to manage report visibility. However, references to \u201cannual leave administration officer\u201d point towards HR, so I have to balance that with the options in the IT ticket classification. It\u2019s a bit complex, and I need to choose the best fitting category!**Selecting the Appropriate Category**\n\nIt seems like the best fit for this IT ticket is \"Access\" because it relates to who can view the report, and the phrase \"seen by members\" suggests concerns about access permissions. While \"Miscellaneous\" could work if I'm unsure, \"Access\" directly ties to the visibility aspect of the report. I need to respond with a JSON object specifying the category, which would look like this: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. I'll keep it concise since the instruction is simply to categorize the ticket.{\"category\": \"Access\"}"
