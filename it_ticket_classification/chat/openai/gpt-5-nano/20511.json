However, they seem separate in the given categories. The phrase about \"contributing rights\" might suggest something specific, and typical IT classification leans more toward \"Access\" since it\u2019s about general rights.**Choosing the appropriate category**\n\nIf the request is specifically about admin rights, I\u2019d select \"Administrative rights.\" However, the repeated mention of \"wants practices\" is unclear. I think the safest choice is the \"Access\" category, as the user might simply want access to certain practices. The required output format is a JSON object indicating the category as a string. Since I have to stick to this format, I\u2019ll go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nNo extra text, just the cleaner output!"
