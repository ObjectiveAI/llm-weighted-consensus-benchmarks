The categories I can choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \n\nI see terms like \"library,\" \"duplicate,\" and \"issue,\" which are not very coherent. Since it\u2019s unclear, I think \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d might be the best fit, or maybe \u201cInternal Project\u201d if it relates to that. \"Access\" could be an option too. I'll choose and give a brief reason.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out how to categorize an IT ticket based on the prompt, which suggests I should just provide a category in a JSON-like format. The input references terms like \"duplicate\" and \"issue,\" which hint at an IT problem. There\u2019s also \"add to library,\" which could relate to software or media, but it\u2019s vague. Given the unclear context, I think \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d is the best fit. I\u2019ll produce the JSON object as {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
