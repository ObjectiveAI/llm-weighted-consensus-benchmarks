They\u2019re having trouble with the right-click context menu not working for sharing files or folders. This seems related to access or permissions. Given the context of the password change, I think the category should be either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I'll go with \"Access\" for the JSON output now.**Categorizing user issue**\n\nThe user asks for help categorizing an issue related to file sharing difficulties after a password change. The relevant categories could be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" both of which fit the situation. Since the message focuses on problems with the right-click context menu for sharing files or folders, this likely ties to permissions. If it specifically requires admin rights to share, then \"Administrative rights\" would be the right choice, while \"Access\" could work for general access issues.**Choosing the category**\n\nI think I should choose \"Access\" for the category since it's focused on sharing files or folders after a password change, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily involve admin rights. The mention of \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant, but \"Access\" feels more general. Ignoring the unrelated parts about holidays, I\u2019ll go ahead and format my response as a JSON object with the category value set to \"Access.\" It should look like this: {\"category\": \"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
