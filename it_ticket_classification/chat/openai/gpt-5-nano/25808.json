It seems that they're asking about creating a rule for snow notifications in a shared mailbox, which could fit multiple categories. I'm considering options like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since the intent is to create a rule and there's a mention of a shared mailbox, it might lean toward \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll need to parse it carefully!**Analyzing IT ticket details**\n\nI need to break down the user\u2019s text regarding a rule for new snow notifications in a shared mailbox. It looks like they want to create a rule to move emails with the subject \"snow\" into a folder called \"snow.\" They mentioned an \"attached file example\" and \u201cdue error details,\u201d indicating they're trying to fix an issue with a current rule. This ticket seems mainly related to mailbox management, so it likely falls under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"**Determining the right category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket about creating mail rules in a shared mailbox. It seems that it might fit under \"Administrative rights\" since it likely requires permissions to make those modifications. There's also the possibility of \"Access,\" which pertains to mailbox access, and \"Internal Project\" if it\u2019s part of a larger setup. However, since the main focus is on setting up rules, I think \"Administrative rights\" is the most appropriate choice. \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option if the intent isn\u2019t clear.**Choosing the right category format**\n\nIn typical ticket systems, tasks related to email rules usually fall under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" Given that rule creation is more of an administrative task, I'm deciding on \"Administrative rights\" as the appropriate category. The instructions specify that I should respond in a JSON format, so I\u2019ll keep it concise. The output will be structured as {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}, adhering to the defined schema. It\u2019s all about accuracy and following the format!{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
