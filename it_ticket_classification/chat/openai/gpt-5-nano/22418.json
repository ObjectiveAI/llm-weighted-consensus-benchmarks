Since there's a mention of a signature and an approval process, I think \"Access\" fits best, and I'll add notes about the need for a signature and approval for access to Sales & Marketing on Friday PM.**Outputting JSON for IT Ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and the format requires a JSON object. I need to include the category, which will be \"Access\" based on the user's request. The JSON schema I have specifies that the output must contain the property \"category\" as a string. So, I'll output exactly this: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text. It\u2019s important for clarity, and I want to make sure it meets their requirements!"
