Let's see, the phrase \"please bounce starting today\" is unclear. It could refer to bouncing emails or something else entirely. The \"request july pm\" might mean they\u2019re referring to a project manager. Given the ambiguity, I'll assign a category that seems to fit best with IT, likely \"Miscellaneous\".**Choosing an IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights. The phrase \"please bounce starting today\" might relate to bouncing emails or server settings, suggesting it could fall under Access or Administrative rights. The \"request July PM\" part could hint at a project manager, but I'm not completely sure. Given the ambiguity, I think the best category might be \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly even \"Access\" if it relates to permissions.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nIn the IT context, \"bounce\" could mean to re-route messages, and \"bounce starting today\" likely refers to sending bounce messages. Given that the request is vague, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the safest category for this IT ticket. Since the user asked me to categorize it, I should respond with a JSON object format. The required structure is clear, so I\u2019ll prepare to output the category within a JSON object that follows the schema provided.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
