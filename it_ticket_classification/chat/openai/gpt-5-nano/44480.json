I'll consider the details of the ticket to decide which category aligns best, so it can be handled efficiently! This will help streamline the process and improve response times.**Analyzing network issues**\n\nI need to analyze the user\u2019s report about problems with the wireless network in Belgrade. They initially contacted us via phone on Monday, mentioning multiple users having issues connecting. While some problems were reportedly fixed after follow-up, they still can't access the web interface. It seems there may be lingering issues. I'll ensure we gather written confirmation from the responsible team about any updates or changes in recent days. It's important to provide clarity and support for these ongoing concerns!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
