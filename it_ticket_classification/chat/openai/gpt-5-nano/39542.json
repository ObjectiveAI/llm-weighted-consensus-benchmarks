It seems they're dealing with an issue related to closing problems against assignee groups and needing proper permissions. The categories I'm considering include Access and Administrative rights because the content suggests there's a problem with user access or permissions in the ticketing system. Overall, it looks like the user needs help with administrative capabilities related to problem management.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think the \"Administrative rights\" category fits best for this IT ticket. It seems there\u2019s an issue with permissions regarding closing problems, as the message indicates she is unable to do so. Even though \"Access\" is another option, \"Administrative rights\" is more specific and directly related to this situation. It\u2019s clear that they are looking to address the ability to close problems, particularly for TM assignee groups. So, my final answer in JSON format will be: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
