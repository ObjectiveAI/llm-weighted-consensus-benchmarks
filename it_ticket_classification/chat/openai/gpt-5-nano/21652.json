The text mentions a \"new starter in Bucharest\" and includes Romanian phrases. I suspect it\u2019s about onboarding a new employee who might need access to a specialist. I need to pull from our category list: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. It looks like this ticket fits into HR Support since it\u2019s related to a new hire. I'll format it in the JSON-like structure.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket that involves onboarding a new starter, likely a new hire. There are keywords like \"Access\" and \"HR Support.\" Given that it mentions \"specialist\" and includes location details, it could relate to access provisioning or administrative rights. However, since it's focused on onboarding, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit. Still, considering access needs for the specialist role, \"Access\" might also work. I\u2019ll lean towards \"HR Support\" for now.**Clarifying ticket categorization**\n\nIt seems the text doesn't mention \"Access\" directly, but maybe it's about access for the \"specialist.\" I need to categorize this ticket based on its content. The phrase \"new starter\" suggests an HR onboarding task, so I would initially lean toward \"HR Support.\" However, \"Administrative rights\" is a subset of Access, and since the text is quite jumbled, it reinforces that uncertainty. \"HR Support\" is commonly used for onboarding in IT ticket systems. I\u2019ll go with that for now!**Deciding on category classification**\n\nI\u2019m assessing the ticket to determine if it should be categorized under \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\" The mention of \"specialist blvd floor district\" might refer to office setup, indicating the ticket is about onboarding a new starter. The phrase \"new starter\" is significant, leaning towards \"HR Support.\" However, since it\u2019s an IT ticket, the system might expect \"Access.\" Looking at similar cases, they usually classify onboarding requests as \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll go with that conclusion for now!**Finalizing category choice**\n\nI think I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Access,\" since it relates to IT. The phrase \"va ne si va ne la specialist\" might hint at needing access for a specialist. Although I could ask for clarification, the user specifically instructed to categorize the ticket directly. I\u2019ll proceed with the allowed values specified in the schema. I\u2019ll go ahead and format my final output as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"} \n\nThis presents the information clearly, just like it needs to be!"
