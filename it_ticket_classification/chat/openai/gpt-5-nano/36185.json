They mentioned issues with a \"damaged access card.\" Given the provided taxonomy, my best guess is to place it in the \"Access\" category since the ticket is directly related to access card issues. While \"Hardware\" could fit due to it being damaged, \"Access\" is more precise. I'll output a JSON object with the category field accurately representing this categorization. Alright, let's deliver that now!**Finalizing Category Decision**\n\nI need to create a JSON object with the key \"category.\" The system has instructed that valid channels include final outputs. So, I'll go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI briefly considered whether \"HR Support\" could apply due to the mention of interns and forms. However, since the core issue is about a \"damaged access card,\" it\u2019s clear that \"Access\" is the most appropriate category. This ticket is focused on IT, and I\u2019m confident that this is the right choice. Alright, let\u2019s wrap it up!"
