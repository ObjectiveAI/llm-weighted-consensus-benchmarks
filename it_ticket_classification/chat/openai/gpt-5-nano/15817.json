It mentions \"friday pm\" but doesn't clearly fit into categories like \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase.\" The safest bet might be to categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" due to the ambiguity. It could also somehow relate to \"Internal Project\" or \"Access,\" but \"Miscellaneous\" seems the most fitting for unclear issues.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket and provided a text to work with. I need to respond in the required JSON format based on the schema given. Given the ambiguous nature of the text, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the safest category. I think it's best to output the JSON object directly: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. While I could consider \"Access\" for the mention of \"import,\" it\u2019s not clear, so I'll stick with \"Miscellaneous\" for clarity and safety.**Crafting JSON Response**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to respond with a JSON format, specifically with just the category. So, I'll keep it straightforward and provide: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. It's important I don\u2019t add any extra text or explanation, just the JSON object itself. That keeps it clean and in line with what the user expects. Let\u2019s finalize this!"
