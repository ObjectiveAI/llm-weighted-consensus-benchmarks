The content of the ticket is a bit jumbled, but it seems to relate to recurring meetings, issues with an active calendar, and permissions.\n\nIt looks like the user is struggling to cancel these meetings and has mentioned \"Administrative rights,\" which might indicate they want permission to handle this. So, I could categorize it under Access, Administrative rights, or Miscellaneous.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe ticket revolves around calendar permissions, specifically cancellation and access issues. It seems logical to categorize it as \"Access\" since it relates to calendar access and the ability to join or cancel meetings. However, \"Administrative rights\" might be more fitting if higher permissions are required to make these changes.\n\nThe phrase \"visibility way cancelled given permission\" suggests confusion around permissions, emphasizing it could be about the ability to modify the calendar. Overall, this ticket likely falls under Access or Administrative rights, with a strong lean towards Access based on the user's need for calendar modifications.**Analyzing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket discusses an issue with an \"active calendar\" where the user cannot cancel recurring meetings. They specifically mention \"permission,\" which makes me lean toward categorizing it as \"Access,\" since it pertains to permissions regarding the calendar.\n\nBut there are also references to \"recurrent meetings on Wednesday PM\" and some confusion around names. It's unclear if \"Hello\" refers to someone or just a greeting. Additionally, it seems people are having trouble joining these meetings and there's a visibility aspect about who can see the meetings along with cancel permissions.**Finalizing Category Response**\n\nIt\u2019s clear this is a calendar access and permissions issue, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" \n\nI need to respond with a JSON object following the required format. The prompt specifies, \u201cCategory\u201d structured in a JSON format. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll create this JSON object and make sure it includes the category field properly set: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nAlright, I\u2019ll keep it concise and deliver this."
