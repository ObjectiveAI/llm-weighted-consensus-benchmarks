The mention of \"problem accessing two shared Amsterdam\" points towards an Access issue, likely related to shared mailboxes in Amsterdam. Other phrases about \"forwarding mails\" and \"personal insights\" suggest it's about accessing and managing emails. Overall, it seems clear this ticket pertains to access issues with forwarding emails related to various topics in Amsterdam. It's definitely an Access category ticket!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI think this user issue likely revolves around mailbox sharing and forwarding rules. The phrases \"problem accessing\" clearly indicate an Access issue, while \"forwarding mails\" suggests it ties into email forwarding rules. Given that it's specifically about accessing shared mailboxes or resources, I feel Access is the most appropriate category. It could also touch on Administrative rights if they\u2019re requesting changes to those rules. So, I\u2019ll respond with the structured JSON: {\"category\":\"Access\"} as required!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
