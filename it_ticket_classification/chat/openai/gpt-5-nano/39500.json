They've mentioned wanting to delete work hours for a specific period. The categories provided include \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"HR Support.\" I think \"HR Support\" seems most fitting here because it relates to time management. However, it might also involve \"Access\" if they need permission to make those deletions.**Classifying the issue**\n\nIt looks like the ticket is related to an issue with the Oracle application rather than asking for access. I\u2019m thinking the best category might be \"HR Support,\" since it pertains to time entries and hours, which fall under HR management. While \"Miscellaneous\" is an option, it's more generic, and there isn't a specific category for \"Application.\" So, if I had to choose, \"HR Support\" seems most fitting for this ticket.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
