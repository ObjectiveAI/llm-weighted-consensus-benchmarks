However, I\u2019m wondering if it should go under \"Purchase\" too, since it involves a new device request. The other categories don\u2019t apply here. I'll decide between those two based on the context of the ticket.**Classifying the IT request**\n\nThe user text indicates a request for a \"wireless mouse for a new starter,\" repeating phrases related to this. Since this is about providing a mouse, the best category seems to be \"Purchase\" due to it being a request for procurement. It could also fit in \"Hardware\" as it's a physical item. However, since there's a distinct \"Purchase\" category, that's likely the most appropriate. I should format my final output as a JSON object with the category specified as \"Purchase.\"**Formatting the response**\n\nThe content clearly states a \"wireless mouse request for a new starter,\" meaning it's about providing hardware for a new employee. The right category here is \"Purchase\" since it's specifically a request to buy a wireless mouse. I need to respond using JSON format, so my final output should be a proper JSON object with the field set as \"category\" to \"Purchase.\" I'll make sure it looks like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\u2014without any extra text."
