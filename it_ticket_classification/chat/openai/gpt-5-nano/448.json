The ticket text relates to annual leave, timecards, and submission issues. Considering these details, the best fit is HR Support since it involves leave requests and approvals. I'll categorize it as HR Support and respond with a JSON-like object that includes the appropriate category.**Formatting the response**\n\nI need to provide a JSON-like object with \"category\": \"HR Support,\" following the schema that specifies one category from available options. The instruction is clear about the format, so I\u2019ll stick to responding with just that object. I\u2019ll avoid adding explanations or extra text, even though the user might appreciate some context. For the final response, I\u2019ll simply output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.
