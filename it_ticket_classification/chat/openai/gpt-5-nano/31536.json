Let\u2019s categorize this ticket accordingly!**Categorizing the ticket text**\n\nI have a block of unstructured ticket text that includes various phrases about access, permissions, extensions, and specific devices. It seems clear to me that the main theme revolves around requests for access and validation. Given this context, I should categorize it as \"Access.\" This decision feels right since the user is asking for guidance on access needs and related permissions. Let's make sure it gets routed properly!**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this ticket, balancing between \"Access\" and potentially \"Administrative rights.\" It seems focused on access to devices, like the mention of \"devices granted wireless\" and \"permission needed.\" Since the core revolves around access rights and the extension of access periods, I think the best choice is \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object since that\u2019s what the system requires. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
