They\u2019ve mentioned needing a cable for the Danube meeting room to connect a PC to a TV. So, it definitely looks like a hardware issue, which fits the \"Hardware\" category best. Even though it also references an engineer and a meeting, the main request is clearly about the cable. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like category object indicating \"Hardware.\"**Clarifying IT Ticket Format**\n\nI see that I need to categorize the IT ticket according to specific instructions. The required format is a JSON-like object specifying the category as a string. Based on the ticket details, which mention needing a cable for the Danube meeting room to connect a PC to a TV, the most fitting category is \"Hardware.\" It could also be argued as \"Purchase,\" but since it's phrased as \"cable needed,\" I'll confidently stick with \"Hardware\" for the JSON object. So, I will respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Categorizing Cable Request**\n\nThe user has simply requested to find a cable, but I need to classify this as a hardware issue. So, my response will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It\u2019s important to stick to the classification guidelines without revealing any additional analysis or thoughts. I\u2019ll just provide the straightforward answer that fits the required format. Let\u2019s go ahead with that clear response!"
