The ticket seems chaotic but discusses \"new starter hardware allocation\" and various forms and approvals related to an intern. Since it's mainly about accessing systems and software for onboarding, I think it fits best under \"Access.\" Alternatively, \"Administrative rights\" might also be a fit given the context.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis ticket is about \"new starter hardware allocation,\" signed documents, and approval processes for a student intern. It seems to focus on hardware provisioning and related forms. The categories I\u2019m considering are Hardware if it\u2019s mainly about the hardware, or Access for software and system access. Given the emphasis on hardware in the request, I think it fits best under \"Hardware.\" Other categories like Access or Administrative rights could apply, but Hardware is primary here.**Structuring IT Ticket Category**\n\nI see there's a mention of a \"starter form\" to complete, but it doesn't reference accounts directly. However, \"programs installed\" implies software installation, still linked to hardware provisioning and IT onboarding. The user asked to categorize the IT ticket, so I need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category as \"Hardware.\" \n\nConsidering the required format, it should look like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nThis format fits the schema with \u201cHardware\u201d being one of the allowed enumerated values.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
