The user is asking for help related to maternity leave submissions and processes involving direct reports not following up on approvals. \n\nLooking at the categories provided\u2014like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and so on\u2014I think it fits best under \"HR Support\" since it directly relates to maternity leave and employee submissions. Let\u2019s categorize it there!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe content of the IT ticket is related to maternity leave submissions and the process involving direct reports, which definitely falls under HR Support. The category options include HR Support, so I'll respond accordingly. \n\nIt looks like I need to format the response as a JSON object based on the schema provided. So, I should output this as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. While the schema describes the category format, my focus is simply on ensuring this ticket is categorized correctly!**Preparing final JSON output**\n\nIt seems that the required output is simply: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. The schema indicates that the response should be a full JSON object representing the category, and I\u2019ll make sure it matches that exactly. The listed categories confirm \"HR Support\" is appropriate.\n\nWhile I briefly considered if it could fit under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" HR Support definitely fits best based on the context. I'll keep the output clean and straightforward with no extra commentary."
