I\u2019ll format my response in a JSON-like object specifying the \"category\" field accordingly.**Formatting response**\n\nI need to respond with the correct category format for the IT ticket. The right response is simply: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It's important to ensure there\u2019s no extra content\u2014just the category object as requested by the user.
