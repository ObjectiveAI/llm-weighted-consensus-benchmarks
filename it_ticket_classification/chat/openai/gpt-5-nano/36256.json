They're experiencing annoyance when selecting words while editing a field, as it automatically selects the whole field instead. They want me to categorize their IT ticket. I need to choose the right category from the following options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. I\u2019ll select the most appropriate category based on this information!**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the user\u2019s content about a change request related to editing fields and selection issues in an application, possibly ServiceNow. It seems to be a software bug rather than a hardware issue. I\u2019m contemplating categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or even \"Administrative rights,\" but the latter may not fit since it's more about interface issues. Given the context, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the most appropriate category for this ticket.**Crafting JSON category response**\n\nI've determined that \"Snow\" likely refers to ServiceNow since the user is complaining about a selection issue in a change request field, which is part of Change Management. Since the available categories don\u2019t include \"Change Management\" or \"Software,\" I\u2019ll choose \"Miscellaneous\" since it's a software bug affecting editing fields, not hardware or storage. Now, I need to format my response as a JSON object, focusing on providing just the category based on the required schema.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
