The key phrases include \"new project code form undefined,\" \"attached code,\" and \"purchase requests.\" It seems likely that this fits under the \"Purchase\" category due to the explicit mention of purchase requests. There\u2019s a chance it might relate to \"Administrative rights\" due to the confusion around the project code. I'll go with \"Purchase\" since that's the clearest fit.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI might consider \"Internal Project\" for the new project code, but the main focus seems to be on \"purchase requests,\" which fits better under the \"Purchase\" category. The phrase \"attached code\" likely relates to attachments, while \"form undefined\" points to a form issue\u2014definitely a bit confusing! Since it doesn't align with HR, Access, or Hardware/Storage categories, \"Purchase\" remains my best option. I'll format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
