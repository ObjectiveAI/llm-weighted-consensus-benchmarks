It seems to focus on making the \"tell us how we can improve\" button visible on all pages, which points towards a user interface improvement. The reference to \"order perform\" and \"two tickets\" might be secondary details, but they don't seem to relate to access or administrative rights. So maybe I should categorize it under \"Internal Project\"?**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket, and it might fall under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" The user mentions making the \"tell us how we can improve\" button visible on all pages, which seems like an improvement suggestion. While they also refer to \"two tickets,\" it\u2019s unclear what that means. Based on the category schema, I think \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d or \u201cInternal Project\u201d would fit best. Now, I need to output a JSON object with the selected category.**Categorizing Internal Project Feature**\n\nThis ticket seems to be about making the \"tell us how we can improve\" button visible on all pages, which is a UI enhancement. It might fit better as \"Internal Project,\" but it feels more like a feature request than a project within IT. If I had to choose, I\u2019d say \"Miscellaneous\" to stay safe. I notice that I need to provide a JSON object, so I\u2019ll format it with just the category as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the initial category schema, which outlines the required format. While it shows how the category structure should look, I need to provide just the actual category value. The request is clear; I should return JSON that matches the schema. To stay safe, I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous.\" So, I\u2019ll format my response simply as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. It\u2019s important to keep it clean with no extra text, just plain JSON as instructed."
