Let's figure this out!**Analyzing IT Ticket Content**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the content: \"sub door remote alarm original message sent friday march event notification data event sub door remote alarm source sub door details details details.\" \n\nIt seems to relate to a \"sub door remote alarm,\" potentially indicating a security access issue. The mention of \"remote alarm\" suggests it could be a hardware device, while \"event notification data\" might refer to logs. I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it under \"Hardware\" since the main focus is the door alarm, rather than \"Access,\" which pertains to user rights.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe content repeatedly mentions \"sub door,\" indicating it might be about a door alarm. The original message from Friday appears to notify about this alarm. Since the user is asking to categorize the ticket, if it's related to a door alarm device, \"Hardware\" seems like the best choice. It could potentially relate to \"Administrative rights,\" but it lacks any explicit user rights reference. So, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Hardware\" and provide the JSON output.\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
