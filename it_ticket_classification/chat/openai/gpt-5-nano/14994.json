The category options include \"Storage,\" \"Access,\" and others. Since the focus is on mailbox size and storage, I think \"Storage\" is the most fitting category. I should respond with a JSON format indicating this category clearly.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI have a schema to follow for outputting a JSON object. It requires the format: {\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}. However, previous tasks only needed the category value. Yet, the proper response for this IT ticket categorization should still follow the given schema. The category is clearly \"Storage,\" so the output should be {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. It's essential to align with the format specified by the user.**Formulating JSON response**\n\nI think it's clear that the tool expects a specific format, so I'll respond with just {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I feel like adding a brief note about the mailbox quota and storage increase would be helpful, but I should stick to the guidelines. Since the instructions mention, \"Your output may be parsed by code,\" it's best to avoid any extra text. I'll keep it simple and provide just the JSON object as required."
