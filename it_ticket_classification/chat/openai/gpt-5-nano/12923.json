It could also relate to \"Administrative rights\" if they're looking for admin capabilities, or \"HR Support\" if it's about onboarding a new member. Overall, \"Access\" feels like the most fitting category.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"new member july pm member hello please add thank\" seems to indicate a request to add a new member, likely for a mailing list or system access. I'd categorize this as \"Access,\" since it suggests they're asking to add a user. It could also imply \"Administrative rights,\" but without clear specification, \"Access\" feels most appropriate for new user provisioning. I'll respond with the category in a JSON format as instructed. So, it's: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
