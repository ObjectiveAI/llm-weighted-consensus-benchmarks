Phrases like \"access to Tuesday,\" \"please add her,\" and mentions of \"colleagues\" reinforce that this is likely an access request. There's a mention of \"annual survey feedback,\" but that's unrelated to IT. I\u2019ll classify this ticket under the \"Access\" category based on its content.**Categorizing IT ticket request**\n\nThe main request here is about \"access\" and possibly \"Administrative rights.\" Since these are separate categories, I think \"Access\" is the more appropriate classification for this ticket. The ticket mentions adding someone, hinting at a request to grant access, possibly to an employee. Since the content strongly indicates an access request, I'll prepare a JSON object with just the category: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. This aligns with the user's request for a simple output.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
