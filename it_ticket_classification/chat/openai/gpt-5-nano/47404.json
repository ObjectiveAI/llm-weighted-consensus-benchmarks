It mentions \"oracle errors,\" \"submit,\" \"cases,\" and \"attached with errors.\" There\u2019s no clear category for software issues, which makes it tricky. Access might fit since it\u2019s about submission issues, but \"Internal Project\" could also be relevant if it pertains to internal tasks. \"Miscellaneous\" might serve as a fallback if nothing else works. Administrative rights could apply too since that\u2019s connected to submitting cases. I'll decide carefully!**Deciding IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m assessing the best category for this IT ticket. Based on the text, \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" seems appropriate. The user mentions \"cases,\" \"errors,\" and \"submit,\" which suggests they might be requesting assistance. While \"Access\" sounds relevant, there aren\u2019t any explicit mentions of access rights. The content is a bit garbled, making it tricky. Maybe \"Administrative rights\" fits since it relates to submitting forms. I need to choose carefully!**Providing category in JSON**\n\nI need to give a well-formed category output in the required JSON format. Based on the instruction to \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" I'll output just the category. The format should be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra commentary, as the system specifies responding only with the category in this format. While \"Internal Project\" could potentially fit, I'll stick with \"Miscellaneous\" for this case. Here\u2019s the JSON response: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
