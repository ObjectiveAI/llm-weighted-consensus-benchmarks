The keywords suggest it might involve an installation job, a request for a working procedure, and a senior engineer\u2019s input. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous\" since they hint at process-related queries. However, there's a mention of installation, which doesn\u2019t link directly to \"Access.\" I\u2019ll need to choose the most fitting category from the options provided.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe user mentions \"senior engineer,\" which might indicate a need for escalation. With the categories provided, I\u2019m leaning towards classifying this ticket under \"Hardware\" since it seems to relate to an installation. They also request a copy of the working procedure, which doesn\u2019t necessarily imply administrative rights. However, since \"installation\" is emphasized, \"Hardware\" appears to be the best fit. I should respond simply with the category as the user asked for a straightforward classification.**Formatting the IT ticket response**\n\nI need to respond using the required JSON format outlined in the instructions. This will include a \"category\" field with one of the allowed values. Since I'm classifying the ticket as \"Hardware,\" I should respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.\n\nIt's important to ensure accuracy with the spelling of the allowed values. If there's any uncertainty, I can add a brief note in plain language, but the focus should be on the strict JSON requirement. So, I'll output the JSON object as specified!"
