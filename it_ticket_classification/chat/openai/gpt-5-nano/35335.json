The ticket has a long text, and it seems related to a security software rollout, mentioning Bitdefender and AMP solutions. There are terms like deployment, background install, and performance issues, indicating potential conflicts. The user also references contacting an engineer for assistance, which suggests a support need here.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm working on categorizing the IT ticket based on what the user has provided. They mention a laptop, CPU/memory spikes, and slow performance, which could suggest a Hardware issue. However, the main context revolves around a security rollout involving antivirus products like AMP and Bit Defender. Given the details about the rollout process, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the most suitable category, while other options like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" don't quite fit this context."
