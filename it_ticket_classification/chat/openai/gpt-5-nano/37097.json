The user text mentions an issue with a survey link in ServiceNow, specifically referring to Chrome and Internet Explorer compatibility. The ticket discusses user feedback on performance and mentions that it's marked as resolved, awaiting a customer response. Given the context, I\u2019d categorize this as \"Access\" since it involves a problem with accessing a service link.**Analyzing IT ticket categories**\n\nI\u2019m trying to determine the category for this IT ticket. It doesn't involve hardware or HR, and it's about a survey link in ServiceNow that has a problem in Chrome but works in Internet Explorer. This situation seems related to access or authentication issues since it logs you out in Chrome. While \"Access\" might fit, it's also possible to categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" due to the survey context. Ultimately, I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate category here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket because it involves a bug affecting access to a survey due to browser compatibility issues. My best guess is to classify it as \"Access\" since it's about logging in and out. Alternatively, I could consider \"Internal Project\" since it relates to the survey service and feedback. However, to be precise, I should wrap the response in the required JSON format to ensure it's structured correctly. So, my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Finalizing the response**\n\nWe\u2019ve decided to categorize the IT ticket as \"Access\" since it's primarily about a bug that logs the user out when trying to complete a survey. While \"Miscellaneous\" might seem applicable due to the user feedback aspect, the main issue is access-related, making \"Access\" a better fit. I\u2019ll go ahead and return just the JSON response without any extra explanation for clarity: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
