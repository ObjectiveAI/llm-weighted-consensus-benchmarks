They mention that the screen should be closer to eye level to help with the keyboard layout. This request fits best under the \"Hardware\" category since it\u2019s about equipment, but it might also relate to \"Purchase\" since they\u2019re asking for new items. So I'd classify it as \"Hardware\" primarily.**Categorizing IT ticket requests**\n\nI need to classify this IT ticket, which is a request for a laptop stand and keyboard stand. Given that this request focuses on hardware items, I should categorize it as \"Hardware.\" However, since it might also imply a purchase request, I have to think about whether \"Purchase\" should be a consideration. Since \"Hardware\" is the main category available, I'll stick with that, especially since it's about improving ergonomics and reducing mistakes with the keyboard layout.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to provide the final output in a JSON format as specified in the instructions. The task is to categorize the IT ticket, and I see that the best fit is \"Hardware.\" The JSON structure needs to reflect this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It's clear that I shouldn't include any extra text, just the JSON object.\n\nWait a moment though! The ticket mentions requesting hardware items, which has me wondering if it fits as a \"Purchase\" category instead. I'll stick to \"Hardware\" for now, since that\u2019s the most straightforward classification.**Deciding on category**\n\nI see that the text clearly states a \"request laptop stand and keyboard stand,\" which makes it a request to purchase these items. So, the \"Purchase\" category seems more appropriate than \"Hardware.\" The phrasing strongly implies it's about procuring hardware, so I'll go with \"Purchase.\" \n\nFor my final answer, I\u2019ll format it as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} and ensure to output only the JSON without any additional text."
