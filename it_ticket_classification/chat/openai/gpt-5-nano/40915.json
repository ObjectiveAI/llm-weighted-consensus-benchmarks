They mention issues with calls from Germany and difficulties with conference calls, specifically accessing the meeting room. There's a request for the correct contact point for these issues, and it seems some sales personnel have noticed these problems recently. It would be helpful to identify specific issues for someone to investigate further. Clearer communication is definitely needed here!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m trying to decide on the best category for this IT ticket. It\u2019s primarily about access to a meeting room, so \u201cAccess\u201d makes sense. The categories I have are: \u201cHardware,\u201d \u201cHR Support,\u201d \u201cAccess,\u201d \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d \u201cStorage,\u201d \u201cPurchase,\u201d \u201cInternal Project,\u201d and \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d Given that the user's issues revolve around conference call access and meeting room difficulties, I\u2019ll categorize it as \u201cAccess.\u201d I\u2019ll respond in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
