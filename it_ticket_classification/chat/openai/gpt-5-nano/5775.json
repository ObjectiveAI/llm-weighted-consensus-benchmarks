It includes a long string about \"leaver\" forms related to an employee leaving. \n\nI see mentions of dates, locations, mailbox issues, and rights related to various accounts. It looks like it\u2019s detailing the necessary information for processing the employee's departure and ensuring their accounts are managed and updated correctly. There's a lot going on, so I\u2019ll need to break it down into specific categories to address each issue effectively!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis IT ticket focuses on offboarding tasks related to items like mailbox, roaming profiles, and access rights. I need to categorize it into one of the allowed categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights.\n\nThe content points to elements like \"leaver form\" and \"AD rights,\" suggesting it fits under \"Access\" due to its relation to account access and permissions. However, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d is also relevant for managing rights specifically. Since it involves deactivating accounts and revoking access, I lean toward \"Access\" as the main category.**Deciding on Category**\n\nI see that this ticket could fit into \"Access\" for general offboarding tasks or \"HR Support\" if it's more HR-focused. However, since the tasks listed lean toward IT, \"Access\" seems like the best choice because of the references to AD rights, mailboxes, and subscriptions. Although \"Storage\" is mentioned with \"inventory storage,\" that's not the main focus here.\n\nI think I'll categorize it as \"Access\" since it's all about deprovisioning access for a leaver. Then, I'll respond with JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
