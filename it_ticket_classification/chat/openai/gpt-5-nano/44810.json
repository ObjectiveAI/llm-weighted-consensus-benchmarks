There are just eight options to choose from. \"Access\" might seem applicable because it involves calendar presence, but it doesn't quite fit. \"Administrative rights\" implies permissions, which isn't mentioned here. \"Internal Project\" applies to internal tools, and \"Miscellaneous\" works for general IT issues. Since this situation is about status updating and not tied to hardware or direct access, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit.**Outputting JSON for category**\n\nI need to output JSON with a category field using one of the specified types: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019m going to go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}\n\nBut it's crucial that the category matches exactly what's allowed. The instructions state we should categorize an IT ticket, and the system wants a JSON object that specifically includes the category. Since only the category is required, I'll keep it concise and provide just that JSON output, without additional notes."
