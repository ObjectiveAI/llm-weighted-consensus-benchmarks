It\u2019s a bit garbled, but it seems like a request related to access issues or permissions. I'll need to classify it into one of the provided categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given that there\u2019s a mention of access control, this ticket likely fits best under \"Administrative rights.\"**Interpreting IT Ticket**\n\nThe user\u2019s message mentions the \"snipping tool,\" which is a Windows software. It seems they might be asking to remove some permissions, possibly related to admin rights. Phrases like \"remove as PM for Tuesday PM\" could indicate they mean \"remove as admin.\" There\u2019s also a request for help regarding costs and processes, but it\u2019s a bit unclear. Overall, this IT ticket likely revolves around access permissions and the snipping tool.**Identifying Access Issues**\n\nIt seems like the user might be requesting to remove the Snipping Tool from their administrator privileges. There's also mention of issues related to \"reports,\" \"shared folders,\" and \"custom programmes,\" which suggests they may have trouble accessing these resources. Because of this, I think the ticket fits best into the \"Access\" category, as it revolves around permissions and account access. This could also touch upon \"Administrative rights\" or \"Storage,\" given the focus on shared folders.**Evaluating Ticket Categories**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories provided: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \"Access\" seems to be the most suitable category because it relates to permissions, shared folders, and accounts. The user\u2019s request about the Snipping Tool might imply they want to adjust admin rights. While \"Administrative rights\" could apply, the best choice here appears to be \"Access,\" as it broadly covers the relevant aspects of accounts and shared folders.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket includes mentions of \"accounts\" and \"shared folders,\" indicating access-related issues. There\u2019s also a reference to a \"custom programme,\" which might mean access to specific software. Given these clues, I\u2019m deciding to categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" So, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object that fulfills the requirements. I\u2019ll keep it concise and structured, resulting in: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let\u2019s stick to that format without any extra text."
