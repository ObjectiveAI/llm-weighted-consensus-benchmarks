So, I\u2019ll go with \u201cStorage\u201d for this ticket.**Determining the correct category**\n\nI'm considering different categories for the IT ticket. It could be \"Storage\" because restoring a database relates to storage management. However, \"Access\" might fit if it involves database access or potentially \"Internal Project\" if it's related to internal tasks. \"Miscellaneous\" could also apply if it doesn\u2019t clearly fit elsewhere. Ultimately, the best classification appears to be \"Storage\" due to the nature of the database restore request. I'll prepare a JSON object for this!**Preparing the response format**\n\nI need to generate a JSON object containing the category for the IT ticket. Based on the context, it should be structured as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} since the request for a database restore clearly falls under storage management. The instruction emphasizes that only the category object should be provided, so I won't add any extra text. It's good to double-check everything aligns, and I'll stick to the format outlined in the prompt. So, I'll finalize with: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}."
