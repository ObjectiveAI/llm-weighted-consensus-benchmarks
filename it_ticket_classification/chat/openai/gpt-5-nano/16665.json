It mentions calendar functionalities, scheduling, and color-coded entries, which gives me a clear theme. The ticket seems to focus on calendar-related issues and internal project considerations. \n\nThe available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the context, I\u2019ll likely choose \"Internal Project\" as the most fitting category. Let's finalize this!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT ticket. It seems focused on implementing calendar features, so \"Internal Project\" could be a suitable choice. \"Miscellaneous\" is an option too, but that doesn't feel specific enough. \"Administrative rights\" pertains to permissions, while \"Access\" relates to accessing the calendar system. Ultimately, since the request involves a feature requirement regarding a calendar, the best fit is \"Internal Project.\" \n\nSo I\u2019m going to format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
