The content primarily focuses on disk size issues and cleanup on development machines, which suggests it fits best under the \"Storage\" category. I\u2019ll create a JSON output with the appropriate category field for clarity. This should help in organizing the ticket efficiently!**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket that mentions various aspects related to disk size, updates, and cleanup on remote developer machines. The context suggests it pertains to storage or hardware and mainly discusses disk size and files, making \"Storage\" the most relevant category. It doesn\u2019t relate to purchasing hardware, administrative rights, or access issues. I\u2019ll create a JSON output structured properly with the required format, defining the category as \"Storage.\" This should keep everything organized correctly!**Delivering JSON format**\n\nI\u2019m noting the instruction states that I need to create a JSON-like object with the key \"category\" and a string value corresponding to one of the specified categories. They didn't explicitly say to output only the value, but the schema suggests providing a JSON object. So, since we've determined the most relevant category is \"Storage,\" I\u2019ll format it like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I'm ready to deliver this output!"
