The text is about creating project codes for a specific project and seems to relate to the \"discovery phase proof concept.\" It looks like it should fall under \"Internal Project\" since it\u2019s focused on project codes without touching on hardware, HR support, access, storage, or purchasing. I'll go with \"Internal Project\" for this ticket classification!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm interpreting the request, and it seems like the user wants to create project codes. While there could be thoughts about access rights, the text doesn't really indicate that. Since this is primarily about managing internal processes, \"Internal Project\" fits best. I\u2019ll categorize it as such with a brief justification regarding project codes for the discovery phase. Finally, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
