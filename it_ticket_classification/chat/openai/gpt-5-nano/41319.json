I'll make sure to provide just the JSON object without any extra commentary, maintaining the structure outlined. Let's get that done!**Formatting JSON output**\n\nI need to create a JSON object for the category, which is defined as \"HR Support.\" The structure should perfectly match the required format, as stated in the instructions. They want a JSON object containing the category value, and it should be clear and concise without any extra text. I\u2019ll ensure I follow the guidelines accurately, so the output is strictly the JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That's it! Let's go ahead and respond that way."
