Given the details, it seems best to categorize this under \"Hardware\" since it likely relates to hardware failure or driver issues. Clarifying the ticket is essential!**Categorizing IT Issues**\n\nThe user's mention of \"palms staying top\" suggests a possible palm rejection issue with the touchpad. They are trying to disable something and suspect it might be a driver or hardware failure. In the IT ticket categories, \"Hardware\" seems the most fitting since the problem likely involves hardware. While \"Access\" might be tempting due to the term \"disable,\" it's not related to access controls.
