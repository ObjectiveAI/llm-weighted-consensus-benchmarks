Given the details provided, the main issue is hardware-related. While it could touch on Purchase aspects due to warranty questions, the core issue is definitely hardware repair. So, I'll categorize the ticket as \"Hardware\" and maybe give a brief rationale about the necessary screen replacement and installation.**Outputting JSON category**\n\nI need to provide the output as a JSON object based on the specified category format. The user needs it formatted with the necessary properties. Despite some mentions of warranty or purchase, the main focus is the broken phone screen, which clearly categorizes this as \"Hardware.\" \n\nSo, I\u2019ll structure my response accordingly: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI think it\u2019s best to keep it straightforward, without additional explanations since the instructions just ask for the category in that format."
