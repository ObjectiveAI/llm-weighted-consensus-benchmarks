Since the ticket seems related to a technical issue, it likely fits into the \"Hardware\" category due to the mention of low voltage and the installation request. So, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the appropriate category.**Determining the category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket, which mentions \"low voltage,\" \"installation,\" and \"administrator phone.\" \"Low voltage\" suggests it may relate to hardware, while \"installation\" indicates setting something up. The term \"administrative rights\" might imply an access request, but overall, it\u2019s a bit unclear. Given all of this, I think the most fitting category is \"Hardware,\" since it connects with the mention of low voltage and the need for installation.**Finalizing the response**\n\nI\u2019m interpreting the phrase \"low voltage has\" in the context of potential hardware or systems. The mention of a \"screen capture attached\" suggests there's a screenshot involved, but I believe \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category overall. I\u2019ll create the response in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. The instructions specify that the response should include just this JSON object, so I'll make sure to follow that without any extra commentary. Let's proceed with that."
