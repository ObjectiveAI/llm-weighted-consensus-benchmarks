It seems they want to address approval levels and possibly remove a head from a contract. Hm, it feels like this might relate to \"Access\" or possibly \"Administrative rights\" due to the approvals and ticketing context.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket. It concerns contracts and approvals, so \"Purchase\" seems relevant. However, the mention of removing \"head\" could indicate it's more about \"Administrative rights\" if they're discussing changing access levels. \"Access\" also seems valid due to the focus on approval levels and user roles. Since the user asked for this categorization, I should provide a category along with a brief justification and possibly propose a few options for clarity.**Deciding on category format**\n\nI see that we need to respond in a specific JSON format with a \"category\" field, picking from the allowed values like \"Hardware,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" The ticket discusses \"approval levels\" and \"remove head,\" which suggests it's about adjusting some kind of approval workflow. I think \"Administrative rights\" fits well, as they seem to want to modify approval processes so only one person has that authority. I'll format my response accordingly.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nIt looks like this ticket primarily concerns \"approval workflow\" and \"permissions,\" so \"Administrative rights\" seems to be the best fit. While \"Purchase\" might relate due to contract approvals, it centers on IT system approvals, not procurement. \"Internal Project\" isn\u2019t applicable, and \"Miscellaneous\" feels too broad. Since they could be altering who has approval rights, \"Administrative rights\" aligns well. I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
