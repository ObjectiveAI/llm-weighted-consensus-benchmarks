I could also consider \u201cInternal Project\u201d if it's related to internal development, but typically it\u2019s about access issues. It might involve hardware, but the main problem seems to be related to network and guest devices communicating. So, \u201cAccess\u201d it is! I\u2019ll craft a JSON object with the category: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It looks like that captures everything they need.**Outputting category**\n\nThe prompt specifies \"Valid channels\" and requires that I respond with only the category object. So, I\u2019ll keep it simple and go with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It seems straightforward enough, and I\u2019m making sure to follow those instructions exactly. Let\u2019s get this done!"
