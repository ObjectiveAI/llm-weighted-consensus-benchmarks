The phrases \"new starter,\" \"form completed attached,\" and \"please fill enclosed\" indicate this relates to HR onboarding. \n\nI think the most fitting category might be \"HR Support\" since it involves processing a new starter's form, which suggests it may pertain to access rights as well. I\u2019ll confidently go with \"HR Support\" from the provided categories list!**Categorizing Ticket Response**\n\nThe content from the user seems to be a ticket regarding a new starter onboarding form. I need to categorize it, and it could relate to either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" for filling forms. However, considering it's about onboarding, \"HR Support\" fits best.\n\nI see mentions of \"form completed attached\" and \"please fill enclosed,\" which align with HR processes. After analyzing, I'm going to categorize it as \"HR Support\" and respond with a JSON object reflecting that choice.**Formatting IT Ticket Response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that categorizes an IT ticket, as specified by the user\u2019s instructions. The format is clear: it should follow a schema with \"category\" as a string from the enumerated list. \n\nIn this case, \"HR Support\" suits the content regarding onboarding. I\u2019ll ensure the formatting is correct and only provide the necessary JSON output. Here goes: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That's it!"
