This could suggest it's an internal project. While \"administrative rights\" could come to mind, it doesn't quite fit. I think the best fit for the category is \"Internal Project.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThere isn't a calendar category listed. The user seems to be asking to create tasks related to coding, which suggests it's an internal project. I could consider classifying it as \"Miscellaneous\" if it's unclear, but it primarily doesn\u2019t relate to hardware, access, storage, purchases, HR, or admin rights. I believe \"Internal Project\" fits best. I'll respond using the required JSON format the system expects. So, the final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
