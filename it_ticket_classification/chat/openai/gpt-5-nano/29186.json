                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on the user's request: \"new starter thursday starter form ext.\" It seems like this is about onboarding a new employee or perhaps extending a starter form. The available categories include \"Access,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Internal Project,\" among others. Given the context, \"HR Support\" sounds like a suitable choice since it relates to new employee onboarding. I'll categorize it accordingly!**Analyzing the IT ticket category**\n\nThe text is a bit ambiguous about the phrase \"new starter.\" It usually refers to onboarding a new employee, and \"starter form\" likely means an onboarding form. The \"ext\" could refer to \"extension,\" indicating they might want to extend the form on Thursday to collect more information. In IT ticket triage, onboarding typically involves \"Access\" provisioning and possibly \"Administrative rights.\" Given that context, the most appropriate category for this ticket might be \"HR Support\" as it relates to the onboarding process.**Deciding on the IT ticket category**\n\nFor a new starter, IT typically provides \"Access\" for account setups, but the ticket mentions \"starter form ext,\" which probably concerns onboarding. I'm guessing the most fitting category would be \"HR Support\" since \"new starter\" connects to HR onboarding processes. However, the options don\u2019t have a specific \"Onboarding\" category. It could also fit under \"Internal Project\" if it relates to integrating the new starter, but that seems less likely. Overall, \"HR Support\" seems to be the best choice here.**Choosing the right category**\n\nThe phrase \"Thursday starter form ext\" might indicate when the new starter form is due, but \"ext\" could mean extension too. This suggests it's related to the onboarding process. The ticket doesn't specify \"Access,\" but it's usually part of new starter tasks. Given the context, I think \"HR Support\" might be a safer category since it deals with onboarding. The user likely prefers one category, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and respond accordingly.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
