The user is asking for access to a \"maps share folder,\" which suggests it relates to permissions or access rights. Given the options\u2014like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, and so on\u2014it's clear that this falls under the \"Access\" category. I\u2019ll create a JSON-like object to reflect this decision clearly and include the relevant details. It seems a bit convoluted, but I\u2019m getting there!**Determining access category**\n\nThis ticket is all about access rights and shared folders. It could fit into \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or maybe even \"Storage.\" Since it involves granting access to a shared folder, it leans more towards a permissions issue. I think \"Access\" is the most fitting category, especially since the user mentioned \"granting maps share folder.\" So, I\u2019ll stick with \"Access\" and format the answer correctly as a JSON object for clarity. I've got the final output ready!\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
