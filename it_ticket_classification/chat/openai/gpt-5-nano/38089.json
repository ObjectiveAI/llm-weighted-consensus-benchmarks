The user mentions issues with rights to execute contracts and requests similar access for others. The relevant categories to consider are Access and Administrative rights since both involve permissions. I could go with \"Access,\" but since it mentions granting rights specifically, \"Administrative rights\" might be more fitting. It feels like both options could work, but I'll lean towards \"Administrative rights\" for its specificity.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user is looking to grant rights, which suggests they might need \"Administrative rights\" for contract execution. While \"Access\" could work as a more general term, it's best to be specific since there is an \"Administrative rights\" subcategory. I see that I need to respond with a JSON object as specified. So I\u2019ll create: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}, carefully ensuring the spelling is exactly as required. Based on the details, \"Administrative rights\" seems like the best fit.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
