The request mentions changing a cable and something about a door, which could imply either \"Hardware\" due to the cable or \"Access\" if it relates to door access control. However, since it specifically talks about a cable, I\u2019m leaning toward the \"Hardware\" category for this ticket. It\u2019s essential to choose the best fit!**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe request includes \"please change\" multiple times, which seems to focus on either changing a cable or dealing with a door. The \"left closest door\" might suggest positioning or proximity related to the door. I need to decide on a single category that fits best. It seems \"Hardware\" makes the most sense since it mentions cable and physical door hardware. \"Access\" could apply if it discussed permissions, but that's not evident here. Therefore, I\u2019ll classify this ticket as \"Hardware\" and prepare to output it as a JSON object.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI need to format the response as a JSON object. The schema specifies the property should be \"category\" and lists valid categories. The user requested to categorize an IT ticket, and given the garbled content mentions \"cable\" and \"door,\" \"Hardware\" appears to be the right category. So, I\u2019ll prepare the output as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I must ensure that there\u2019s no extra text, and just provide the JSON object in its final form."
