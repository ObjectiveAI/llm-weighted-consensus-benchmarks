They refer to changing a user\u2019s display name and mention \"Friday,\" which might relate to when they want the change to happen. I\u2019m considering how to categorize this ticket. It doesn\u2019t fit \u201cHardware\u201d or \u201cAccess,\u201d and \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could be a stretch. \u201cHR Support\u201d seems like the best fit among the provided categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe user wants to modify a user attribute in Active Directory, which could fall under \u201cAccess,\u201d \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d or \u201cHR Support.\u201d Since it's an admin task, I consider \u201cAccess\u201d for permissions related to the directory. However, given that it\u2019s about changing a display name, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could apply since admin privileges might be needed, but I\u2019m not sure the customer requires them. Overall, \u201cAccess\u201d seems the most fitting category here, but I should also think about \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d**Finalizing the IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe user's request is a bit unclear, but it seems they're asking to correct a name in Active Directory. I\u2019m summarizing it as they want their display name fixed. I need to decide between \u201cAccess\u201d and \u201cAdministrative rights.\u201d I think \u201cAccess\u201d fits best since it involves changing user access details. Now, the output format should be a JSON object stating the category. So, I\u2019ll respond with just: {\"category\":\"Access\"} as instructed, with no extra text."
