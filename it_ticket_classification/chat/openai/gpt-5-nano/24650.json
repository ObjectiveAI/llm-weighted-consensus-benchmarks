They mention \u201ccab infrastructure queue,\u201d which likely relates to Change Advisory Board approvals. Key phrases like \u201cadd cab infrastructure queue members\u201d and \u201ccomplete approvals\u201d suggest it may involve access or administrative rights. Considering the categories provided\u2014like Administrative rights, Internal Project, or Access\u2014I should format my output in JSON, ensuring to select the most fitting category for this request.**Parsing IT Request**\n\nI\u2019m looking to understand this request about the \"CAB infrastructure queue.\" The user seems to want to add members to this queue and might also be asking for permissions related to approvals, specifically for modifying queue membership. This suggests it falls under either Access or Administrative rights. Given the focus on modifying change advisory board membership, I believe the best category for this IT ticket would be Administrative rights, as it involves permissions to add members.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this request about the CAB infrastructure queue. While it could be \"Internal Project,\" the user focuses on approvals and rejections, which relates more to process than hardware or HR Support. I think \"Administrative rights\" fits best here. I need to format this as a JSON object with the category specified. My final output will be: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward, following the requested format."
