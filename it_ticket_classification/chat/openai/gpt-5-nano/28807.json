I need to decide between categorizing this as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The phrase \"cannot conf\" likely means \"configure\" or \"connect,\" and the mention of \"additional rights\" suggests it might be leaning toward needing admin permissions. I think the best choice is \"Administrative rights,\" so I'll categorize the ticket accordingly and prepare a response in JSON format!{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
