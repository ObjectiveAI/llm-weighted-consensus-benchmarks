The mention of \"access remove and add\" suggests it's about user rights. So, I\u2019ll place it in the \"Access\" category. Maybe it's \"Administrative rights\" if it\u2019s specifically about permission changes, but \"Access\" seems right for now.**Parsing IT ticket for categorization**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the ticket: \"customer service now access remove and add Friday,\" which suggests they want to adjust access on Friday. The part about \"license has left replaced by disable\" may indicate something regarding a license. Overall, this ticket is about Access to ServiceNow, so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" \n\nThe response should be in JSON format as instructed. I'll craft it to look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let\u2019s just stick to the required output without extra commentary unless requested!"
