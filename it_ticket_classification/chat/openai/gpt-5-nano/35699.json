The grammar isn't great, but it sounds like they are asking for help with an error they encountered when trying to change their career path. The appropriate categories could be \"Access,\" since they might be having issues, or maybe \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" since it involves a change. I\u2019ll need to clarify their intention for the best fit.**Interpreting User Request**\n\nI'm trying to understand the user's message about an \"Oracle change career.\" It seems they\u2019re facing an error after attempting to change their career twice and want help completing the process. The phrase might actually refer to changing their role or access rights. Based on this context, the most fitting category could be \"Access,\" as it deals with user rights, or \"Administrative rights,\" if they need additional privileges for the change. Clarifying their intention may help narrow it down further.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIn IT ticket classification, \"Access\" is typically used for user permissions and controls, while \"Administrative rights\" pertains to requests for admin privileges. The user's statement about wanting to \"assign his career\" suggests they're seeking permissions, which points to \"Access\" being the most appropriate category. There\u2019s also a chance it might be \"Internal Project,\" but \"Access\" feels more fitting. I\u2019ll respond in the required format, providing a JSON-like object that states: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
