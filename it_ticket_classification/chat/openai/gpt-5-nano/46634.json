The user\u2019s input is kind of messy\u2014it mentions Outlook not opening, possibly related to an issue from Monday. There\u2019s a bit of confusion in the phrasing, but the key problem seems to be that Outlook isn't launching while the user is working remotely. Based on this, \u201cAccess\u201d might fit best, but \"Software\" isn't in the provided categories.**Classifying IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on a provided list. Since it seems like a software issue and there's no \"Software\" category, I think \"Access\" might be the best fit since the user can\u2019t launch the Outlook app while working remotely. Alternatively, I could consider \"Miscellaneous\" or even \"Administrative rights\" if there's something with permissions involved. However, \"Access\" feels the most appropriate due to the access problem. I\u2019d classify it as \"Access\" and respond accordingly.**Outputting JSON response**\n\nI need to respond in the correct format, which is a JSON object. The schema requires a field called \"category,\" and I\u2019ll set its value to \"Access\" since that fits the user\u2019s issue. I'll ensure the output matches the expected format precisely, so it looks like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I won\u2019t add any extra commentary or text to keep it clean and straightforward, just the necessary JSON object as requested."
