It makes sense to categorize any HR-related issues under \"HR Support,\" especially if it deals with candidate profiles or attachments. So, I'll respond with the proper JSON format, which should simply be: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to use the correct formatting and keep it concise!**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nThe system indicates I should output a JSON object for the category, and I think it's straightforward. The instruction says to categorize the IT ticket, so a simple response could be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. Adding extra notes might not be necessary since the required output is just the category. Double-checking, I see that the ticket is about attachments related to candidate profiles, which confirms that \"HR Support\" is the correct category. I'll respond accordingly!"
