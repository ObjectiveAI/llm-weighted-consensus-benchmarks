The message mentions issues with Oracle submission and annual leave, which could fall into various categories like Access, Administrative rights, or HR Support. It looks like it's related to HR Leave management, especially with terms like \"discipline lead.\" I'll need to return a JSON object with the appropriate category based on the content provided. Let's figure out which one fits best!**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nIt looks like the user can\u2019t submit something in Oracle because their task list is empty. This could be an access or permissions issue. The mention of \"cannot submit\" suggests a problem with the system. Since this involves Oracle, it\u2019s likely related to either Access or Administrative rights. Other categories might not fit as well. Therefore, given the connection to leave management and submission issues in Oracle, Access seems to be the most appropriate category.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned \"discipline lead applications,\" which makes me wonder about the right category. It could be \"Access\" since the issue involves not being able to submit because of an empty task list, indicating a system access problem. While \"HR Support\" touches on HR leave, this ticket belongs to IT. As such, \"Access\" seems to be the best fit. Now, I need to create and respond with the JSON correctly formatted: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That's all I need to provide!"
