The issue seems related to access control, so I\u2019m considering \"Access\" or possibly \"Administrative rights\" or \"Security.\" However, given the context, \"Access\" appears to be the most suitable category since it directly relates to the visitor's lost card. I\u2019ll make sure to format my response as a JSON-like object with the \"category\" property set to \"Access.\"**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI see I need to output a JSON object based on a specific format that includes a category. The category options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Since we're dealing with a request to deactivate a card, \"Access\" seems to be the most fitting category, although \"Administrative rights\" could work too. However, keeping it straightforward, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" as my final response, formatted as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll make sure it's valid JSON!"
