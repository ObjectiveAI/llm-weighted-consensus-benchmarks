They mentioned something chaotic about needing a router for meeting rooms during an account visit, but the text is messy. There are repeated mentions of \"router\" and it suggests booking rooms, but I\u2019m not sure. Based on the categories provided, I think it could fit best under \"Hardware\" since it specifically mentions a router, even though \"Access\" crossed my mind briefly.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm trying to figure out the best category for this IT ticket. The user mentions needing a \"router temporarily\" for meeting rooms, which sounds like it could involve booking facilities, but there\u2019s no category for that. \"Internal Project\" might apply if it\u2019s part of something internal, yet it also brings up network infrastructure. Given all the details, I think \"Hardware\" suits best since it specifically references a router, despite some access-related suggestions. I'll prepare a JSON object to return that category.**Choosing category format**\n\nI'm deciding on the most appropriate category, and \"Hardware\" makes the most sense because of the mention of a router. The text about \"meeting rooms for account visit\" is a bit tricky but seems misinterpreted. Still, \"infrastructure reached via cable\" confirms the hardware aspect. So, I\u2019ll craft the final answer as a JSON object with just the category property. \n\nThe format should be simple, like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. No extraneous content needed\u2014just the necessary details."
