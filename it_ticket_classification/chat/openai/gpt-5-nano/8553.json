The wording seems like a request related to creating members and adding an owner, so it could fall under Access or Administrative rights, as it suggests granting ownership privileges. It might also be related to an Internal Project since it mentions the \"oracle team.\" Overall, it sounds like it's about managing team memberships and permissions, which points strongly toward the Administrative rights category.**Analyzing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm evaluating the ambiguity in the phrase: \"add owner.\" It could refer to adding an owner to a ticket or user accounts. It seems the ticket might relate to the \"AM Oracle team,\" so it leans toward an \"Internal Project.\" Given the mentions of creating members and adding an owner, the Access category could fit, especially for onboarding or user accounts. Alternatively, it might fall under Administrative rights if granting ownership privileges is involved.**Deciding the IT ticket category**\n\nIt looks like \"Administrative rights\" would fit the ticket but I\u2019m also considering \u201cInternal Project\u201d related to the \"Oracle team.\" If it's too vague, \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d might work, but I think the safest choice is \"Access.\" Since the request involves creating members and adding owners, it aligns well with user accounts and permissions. Ultimately, \u201cAccess\u201d seems to be the best fit for the category. I\u2019ll format the answer as required in JSON-like style.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
