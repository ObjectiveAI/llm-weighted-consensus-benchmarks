My guess is \"add tudor to thursday pm\" might be about adding Tudor to a shift. However, scheduling isn't an IT category. It seems more like \"Access\" for adding a user to a mailing list, given the context and \"cheers senior developer\" indicates the submitter's role. So, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\"**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI'm interpreting the user's IT ticket, specifically the part about \"added mailing he mailing,\" which I think could refer to an \"added mailing list.\" The mention of \"Thursday PM\" might indicate group or calendar access, suggesting it's about access control. Based on all this, the appropriate category seems to be \"Access.\" However, it could also fall under \"Administrative rights,\" but since it's about adding someone to a group, I'll choose \"Access.\" I'll format it like this: \n\n{\"category\": \"Access\"}"
