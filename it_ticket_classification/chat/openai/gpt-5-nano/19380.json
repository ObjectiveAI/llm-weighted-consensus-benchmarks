The request seems to relate to onboarding, possibly indicating \"HR Support.\" I have a clear list of valid categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. So, I will output a JSON object that specifies the category as \"HR Support,\" since that fits best with the context provided.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the categories available for this IT ticket, and \"HR Support\" is explicitly for HR tasks. The message mentions a new starter in Bucharest and suggests they want to fill out a form. This all points towards onboarding, which makes \"HR Support\" the most fitting category. While \"Access\" could apply if they need account provisioning, it's really about onboarding a new employee. So, I'll go with \"HR Support\" as the best choice here.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe task is clear: I need to categorize this IT ticket. Given that it mentions \"new starter,\" it aligns closely with HR processes. The full phrase suggests they could be asking to fill out workforce forms. With no additional context provided, labeling it \"HR Support\" for onboarding seems appropriate. I'll respond with a JSON object that contains the category: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI\u2019ll keep the formatting straightforward so the app can easily parse it. Let\u2019s proceed with that!"
