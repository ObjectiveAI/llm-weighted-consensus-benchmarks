It mentions redundant notifications, specifically receiving duplicate copies of approval and rejection notices. This seems like an application issue rather than related to hardware, storage, purchase, or HR support. \n\nSo, I'm considering options like \"Miscellaneous,\" which feels a bit generic, or \"Access,\" if it pertains to notifications tied to access approvals. Overall, it seems like \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit here.**Finalizing the IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket issue where the user mentions receiving duplicate notifications for approvals and rejections. It seems related to the system's notification process. Since there isn\u2019t a specific category for \"Software\" or \"Email,\" \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the right choice. \n\nI\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object, simply stating: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. However, I\u2019m also considering that it could potentially relate to access issues since the duplicates are about notifications.**Confirming the Category**\n\nI\u2019m realizing that the ticket isn\u2019t about access rights, but really about the duplication of notifications. Given this, categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" feels safe and appropriate. \n\nNow that I've clarified my understanding of the issue, I\u2019m ready to provide the answer without further complication. This ensures I focus on delivering exactly what\u2019s needed. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and respond with that category."
