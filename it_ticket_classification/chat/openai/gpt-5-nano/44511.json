They mention configurations and rights, which suggests it\u2019s primarily an Access issue. While it could also relate to Storage or Administrative rights, the emphasis on \"sharing folders\" and \"permissions\" strongly indicates Access as the appropriate category. I\u2019ll move forward with tagging it accordingly!**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m deciding between \u201cAccess\u201d and \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d for this ticket. Since it focuses on accessing shared folders and permissions, \u201cAccess\u201d seems to fit best. Although the user mentions changing permissions, it sounds more like they can\u2019t access the folders now, which aligns directly with the access issues. So, I'll categorize it as \u201cAccess.\u201d Now I just need to format the output as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's finalize this!"
