The ticket involves issues related to roles and permissions on reports, including access issues and data leakage from sensitive information. It seems best categorized as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" \"Access\" likely addresses general access problems, while \"Administrative rights\" pertains to admin privileges. Given the details about roles and changes, \"Access\" seems the most fitting.**Categorizing Access Control**\n\nI'm considering the best category for the IT ticket, which is focused on access control and data visibility by country. The choices are \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the explicit mention of roles and permissions, I think \"Administrative rights\" is more precise. While \"Access\" is about general permissions, \"Administrative rights\" targets specific changes to roles. I'll categorize it as \"Administrative rights\" in the required JSON format: {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}. A rationale could be helpful, but I\u2019ll stick to the format for now.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
