The ticket seems a bit messy, but that\u2019s okay; I\u2019ll figure it out! I have to place it into one of these categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll analyze what's in the ticket carefully to make sure it ends up in the right category. Let's get to it!**Analyzing ticket details**\n\nI have a ticket that seems to detail a delivery for Bogota Street. It mentions testing and its status, along with patch panels, cables, and various hardware like cage nuts, screws, washers, and units. There are also references to an organizer and cable ties among other things. I'll need to sift through all this information to ensure I understand the context and requirements. It sounds like I\u2019m dealing with a complex setup, but I\u2019ll handle it!**Categorizing ticket components**\n\nThe ticket highlights various components, mentioning things like \"patch panel shielded ports\" and \"extensions\" alongside hardware like cage nuts, screws, and washers. It also brings up network hardware topics such as \"array controller,\" \"port adapter,\" and installation notes. Additionally, there's a focus on wireless controllers and antennas. With all this, it looks like the ticket relates to the delivery and testing of network hardware and associated equipment. I think it fits best into the \"Hardware\" or \"Internal Project\" category.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering if this ticket fits under \"Internal Project\" since it mentions logging queues and testing equipment, along with various \"pending\" statuses for things like firepower and switches. The reference to \"Bogota St delivery\" adds a specific site context, suggesting this may be a multi-ticket situation. Still, it mainly revolves around hardware installation, so I believe \"Hardware\" is the right category. The ticket requires a response in a JSON format, so I\u2019ll provide: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
