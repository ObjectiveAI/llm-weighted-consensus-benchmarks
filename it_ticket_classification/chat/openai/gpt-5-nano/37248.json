The user input is a jumbled mix of words about a meeting not working and issues with cached cookies. It sounds like someone is trying to report a problem with their meeting client due to cached data. I need to determine the best category for this ticket based on that interpretation.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a ticket that mentions \u201cmeeting,\u201d \u201cclient,\u201d and \u201ccached cookies data,\u201d which likely relates to software issues, possibly a video conferencing tool. I\u2019m not seeing a perfect fit in the category list; \u201cAccessibility\u201d isn\u2019t there, and \u201cInternal Project,\u201d \u201cAdministrative Rights,\u201d \u201cHardware,\u201d \u201cStorage,\u201d and \u201cPurchase\u201d don\u2019t seem relevant either. \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d and \u201cAccess\u201d are the closest options. I think I\u2019ll classify the ticket as \"Miscellaneous\" because it doesn\u2019t explicitly mention a login issue.**Preparing JSON for categorization**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket by outputting a JSON object with the category field. The input mentions issues with a meeting client and cached cookies data. I think the simplest way to categorize this would be as \"Miscellaneous.\" \n\nI\u2019ll ensure that my response is formatted as required. Since the format seems to specify a category object, I will respond with: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. Following this structure helps keep things organized and aligns with the user's request!**Structuring category output**\n\nI need to present the category of the IT ticket in a structured JSON format. The instructions are clear: the response must include a \"category\" field with one of the specified values. \n\nGiven the details I've collected and the input, I plan to respond simply with: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra text or heavy formatting in my output to keep it neat and compliant with the guidelines!"
