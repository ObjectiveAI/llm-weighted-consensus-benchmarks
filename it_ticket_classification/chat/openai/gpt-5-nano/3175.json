I\u2019m considering categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project,\" but it could also relate to \"Access\" if permissions are involved. The phrase \"select minds\" could refer to a specific system or site, which adds to the complexity. So, I'll need to pick the best fitting category.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering several categories for the IT ticket based on phrases like \"downtime\" and \"apply configurations.\" It seems like this might relate to \"Administrative rights,\" especially if applying configurations requires access rights. However, I also think \"Internal Project\" could be a fit since it mentions planning a task and notifying about downtime. I mistakenly thought \"Access\" wasn\u2019t included in the list, but it is. I need to analyze further to choose the best category!**Choosing the right category**\n\nThe user provided \"Administrative rights\" as a category. The ticket mentions things like \"notify about event\" and \"apply configurations which cause downtime.\" While it could fit under \"Administrative rights\" due to configuration changes needing admin access, they didn't explicitly mention rights. \"Internal Project\" seems more appropriate since it references planning a task in November, event notifications, and forms. Based on the categorization instruction, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best choice, so I'll prepare the JSON output!**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI see the system's schema requires a specific JSON format: an object with the \"category\" property. Since we've determined that \"Internal Project\" is the best fit for the IT ticket, I\u2019ll structure the output correctly as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I need to be clear and concise without adding extra commentary this time. So, I'll go ahead and prepare this straightforward output based on the user's request for categorization. Here it is: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
