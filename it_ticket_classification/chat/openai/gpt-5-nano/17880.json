It seems to be related to onboarding a new employee, maybe about access or HR support? \"New starter\" usually suggests the \"Access\" category, but \"HR Support\" is also a possibility. There's no clarity about what \"PM\" stands for either, which complicates things further.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm deciding on the best category for an IT ticket about onboarding a new employee's access rights. \"Access\" seems like the most appropriate choice, unless \"Administrative rights\" is specifically needed. I should respond with the chosen category in the required JSON format. It looks like I need to output it as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I should also consider noting that this relates to onboarding and could have some HR implications, but \"Access\" feels right for now.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m confirming that the IT ticket category should be \"Access\" since it's about granting accounts for the new employee. While I considered \"Internal Project\" as another option, it doesn't fit as well. So, I\u2019m settling on the \"Access\" category. I just need to respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let\u2019s move forward with that!"
