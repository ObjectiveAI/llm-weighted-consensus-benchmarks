The ticket text mentions phrases related to switch installation, purchase orders, and other components. Since the main focus is on switch installation, I need to determine the appropriate category based on this information. Ultimately, I'll output a JSON object that includes the selected category string from the allowed options.**Evaluating IT ticket content**\n\nI\u2019m examining the content of this IT ticket, which mentions \"switch installation,\" \"patch panel,\" and various purchase orders. It\u2019s a bit messy, but I can see that these terms relate to hardware, particularly networking equipment. Given the allowed categories, \"Hardware\" seems like the most appropriate choice for this ticket since it directly relates to physical devices. I\u2019ll use this information to refine the categorization for the JSON object.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
