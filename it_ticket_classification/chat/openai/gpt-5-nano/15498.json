It mentions a few unclear elements like \"ms mobile app,\" \"assigned,\" and \"cpu intel memory added.\" I could think it fits under \"Hardware,\" especially since there's a reference to a CPU and memory upgrade. However, the mention of the mobile app could complicate things. It sounds like a request to assign a person to the app, so I\u2019ll lean toward \"Miscellaneous.\"**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI believe the ticket is primarily about a hardware upgrade, specifically mentioned as \"cpu intel memory added,\" which makes it fit under the \"Hardware\" category. Although there's also a reference to \"annual leave,\" which usually relates to HR, I can't assign multiple categories to this. So, I need to stick with the best fit, which is \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object that simply says: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
