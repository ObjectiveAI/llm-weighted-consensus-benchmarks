It's important to ensure that each ticket is assigned to the correct category for efficient handling. I'll need to consider the various types of issues that might arise, such as software problems, hardware failures, network issues, and user requests. This way, when tickets are sorted correctly, the support team can address them faster and more effectively. Let's make sure we get this right!**Categorizing error messages**\n\nI'm looking at a string filled with phrases about undeliverable notifications and mailbox issues. It mentions things like a full mailbox and messages failing to process, which can be confusing. I need to categorize this with a limited set of options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I must return a JSON object that defines the appropriate category based on this context. Let\u2019s make sure to choose wisely!**Determining the right category**\n\nI'm analyzing an email delivery issue described with phrases like \"mailbox full,\" \"undeliverable notification,\" and \"delivery exception.\" I\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket from the available options. \"Access\" could apply since it relates to mailbox access. However, it\u2019s more about the recipient\u2019s mailbox being full, which directly ties to storage issues. So, I think \"Storage\" is the best fit, as it pertains to the quota problem. Let\u2019s go with \"Storage\"!**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object structured like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. The instructions specify that the category should be formatted as an object with a string property. There shouldn\u2019t be any extra commentary; just the JSON itself. I'll make sure it\u2019s valid with the proper quotes and only include the necessary information. The final output will be solely the JSON, as required by the system. Let's go ahead and deliver that!"
