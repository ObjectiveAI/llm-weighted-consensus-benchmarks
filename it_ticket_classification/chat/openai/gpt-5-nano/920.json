The mention of \"owner\" suggests ownership is key here. I\u2019m weighing \"Access\" as a broader category against \"Administrative rights,\" which is more specific for modifying admin rights.**Categorizing IT Request**\n\nThe user's request to \"add members to list\" and \"leave him owner\" suggests a need for changing group membership and ownership. I\u2019m considering whether to categorize this as \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" If I need just one category, \"Access\" fits since it pertains to list permissions. However, since \"owner\" ties to resource ownership, \"Administrative rights\" seems more accurate. I plan to format my response as a JSON object with the selected category included.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
