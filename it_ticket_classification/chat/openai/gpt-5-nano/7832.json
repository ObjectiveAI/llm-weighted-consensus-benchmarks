It seems to suggest removing admin privileges from a library, potentially indicating an issue with access. Given the content, it's likely related to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, since \"Administrative rights\" is a distinct category, I think the best fit is that. I\u2019ll respond with the category: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize the IT ticket about removing admin rights from a library. \"Access\" might seem fitting, but since it's specifically about administrative rights, I think \"Administrative rights\" is the best choice. The system expects a JSON object for the response. So I need to return a concise output like: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I have to ensure it follows the required schema without additional text. Here we go!"
