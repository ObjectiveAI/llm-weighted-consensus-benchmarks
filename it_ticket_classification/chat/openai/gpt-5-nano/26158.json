However, it could potentially fall under \"Purchase\" if they're requesting to procure the adapter. Given the details, I think \"Hardware\" aligns well but \"Purchase\" could also be more precise if they're asking to buy it. I\u2019ll lean toward \"Hardware.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user mentions \"adapter\" and requests one, which could indicate a procurement process. Since it\u2019s about a physical adapter for connecting screens, it seems to fit best under the \"Hardware\" category. Although some organizations might categorize it as \"Purchase,\" this ticket lacks price details, suggesting it\u2019s more about obtaining hardware. Since I need to provide a response in the required JSON format, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
