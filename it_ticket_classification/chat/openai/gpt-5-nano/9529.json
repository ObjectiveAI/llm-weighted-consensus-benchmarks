The user's message suggests it\u2019s a request to add accounts for multiple new joiners. I\u2019m considering which category fits best from options like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"HR Support.\" Given the context, it leans towards \"Access\" because it involves granting access for the new team members. The word \"added\" hints that more than one account needs to be activated, which further supports that categorization.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI'm considering if this ticket could fall under \"HR Support,\" as it's about newcomers, but the request is specifically to add new joiner user accounts, which is very much an IT task. Therefore, it makes more sense to categorize it as \"Access.\" I need to respond with a JSON object clearly indicating this, formatted correctly as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll keep it concise, providing just the necessary information along with some brief reasoning if required by the system.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to keep it simple and just output the JSON without any extra text. I\u2019ll make sure the quotes are formatted correctly, too. It\u2019s really about clarity and precision here, so the output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThat\u2019s it!"
