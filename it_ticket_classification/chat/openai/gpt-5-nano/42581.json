They've been facing issues for weeks, getting error messages after entering the password. Sometimes, they can remain locked out for over an hour. Interestingly, they managed to log in by using their mobile when plugged into a cable, but they still encounter the same issue even after deleting credential entries. I'll need to gather more details to help resolve this.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm thinking about the user's message and considering what they meant by \"making mobile.\" It might refer to using a mobile hotspot, and when they mention being plugged into a \"cable,\" it could be a LAN cable. They also deleted credential entries, possibly from cached information, yet the issue persists. This seems to fit under an \"Access\" issue based on the system categories. I\u2019ll categorize this accordingly and respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
