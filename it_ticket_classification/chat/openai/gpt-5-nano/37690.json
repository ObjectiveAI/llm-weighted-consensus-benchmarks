It mentions \"referral tool issues,\" uploading a resume, and errors encountered in different browsers. This leans more towards an IT issue but could fall under \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" or possibly \"Internal Project.\" It definitely isn't hardware, storage, or purchase-related, and while it touches on HR, that feels like a stretch given the available category options. I'll need to decide on one.**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nFor this ticket about an internal referral tool error, I\u2019m considering whether it fits best under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it\u2019s a tool used within the company, categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" feels reasonable. \"Administrative rights\" might apply if they need permissions to upload. The user\u2019s issue reflects a possible bug, so I think \"Internal Project\" is the most accurate categorization, given the context surrounding the referral tool\u2019s use in HR.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
