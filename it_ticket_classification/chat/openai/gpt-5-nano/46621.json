The user mentioned several issues related to a SAN (Storage Area Network), highlighting its malfunction and the urgent need for configuration. The mention of a conference room and difficulties calling suggest some context but seems secondary. Given that SAN is related to storage hardware, the most appropriate category would likely be \"Storage.\" It could also potentially fit \"Hardware\" or \"Internal Project\", but \"Storage\" seems best.**Categorizing Ticket Response**\n\nThe valid categories for the IT ticket are \"Storage\" and \"Hardware,\" but since the issue is specifically related to SAN storage, \"Storage\" is the most fitting choice. I need to respond in a JSON-like format as requested. The ticket mentions problems with \"not working SAN\" and \"configure SAN,\" indicating that the primary issue is indeed storage. I\u2019ll keep the output simple. Here\u2019s the response: \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
