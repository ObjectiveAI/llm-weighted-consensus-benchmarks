The user has a ticket for a combo keyboard and mouse. This ticket clearly falls under the \"Hardware\" category since it's requesting a peripheral. However, it could also be classified as \"Purchase\" since it involves a procurement request. Ultimately, it seems best to categorize this as \"Hardware,\" as many IT systems do that for equipment requests.**Determining the IT ticket category**\n\nThe most fitting category for the user\u2019s request for a \"combo keyboard and mouse\" is \"Hardware,\" as it pertains to a hardware device. Even if the request isn\u2019t super clear, \"Hardware\" serves as the main classification. I\u2019ll follow the instruction for a JSON-like output format, so I\u2019ll create a simple JSON object indicating: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. While \"Purchase\" could apply if they want to procure it, I\u2019ll stick with \"Hardware\" as the primary choice."
