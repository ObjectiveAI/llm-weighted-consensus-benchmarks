It could involve \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are needed, but since there's no mention of that, \"Storage\" is the way to go. I'll output the JSON with that category!**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI need to produce a JSON object for an IT ticket categorization as requested. The prompt instructs that the output must include a \"category\" field, and the available categories are well-defined. Since I'm looking to match the specified schema, I\u2019ll create the JSON object accordingly. It seems clear and straightforward: I\u2019ll format my answer like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra commentary, just the JSON object itself!"
