This suggests complications around costs and budgets that might link to HR. The mention of \"cannot control costs\" hints at financial control challenges, while \"time cards\" hints at employee time tracking specifics. I'm considering categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Purchase,\" or \"HR Support.\" It seems fitting to classify this under \"Internal Project\" due to the project management aspect.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI think the IT ticket relates to project management or time card approvals. Given the categories, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit, especially since it\u2019s about cost control. \"Purchase\" could link to purchase orders, but it's less relevant here. The phrase \"cannot control costs\" definitely points toward project cost management. I'll categorize this as \"Internal Project\" and respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, without additional explanations unless asked."
