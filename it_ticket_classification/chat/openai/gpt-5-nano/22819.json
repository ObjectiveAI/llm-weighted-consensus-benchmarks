This seems like a help desk issue that could fit into categories like \"Hardware\" or maybe even \"Purchase.\" I'll have to output a JSON object that specifies the category. Since they\u2019re requesting an adaptor, I think \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate choice. However, I should consider \"Purchase\" too, as it involves acquiring an adaptor. I'd go with \"Hardware\" for simplicity.**Classifying adaptor request**\n\nThe user\u2019s request for an adaptor can be classified under both \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" However, since it specifically mentions needing to connect a monitor, I think \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category. The phrase \"Adaptor request\" suggests it\u2019s really about hardware. There are a few allowed categories, but \"Hardware\" makes the most sense given the context. So, I'll format my final output as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to make sure I'm precise and clear."
