The predefined categories include things like \"Storage\" and \"Hardware.\" Given that the issue relates to mailbox memory, it seems clear that \"Storage\" is the most appropriate category here. \n\nSo, I'll output a JSON object that has \"category\" set to \"Storage.\" This will follow the required format and structure, and I need to ensure it's precise! \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket revolves around the user's request for \"extra memory\" and mentions that the \"mailbox is almost full.\" This indicates a storage issue, particularly related to their email. While \"Hardware\" could be considered, the context points strongly towards \"Storage\" since it's about mailbox capacity. The phrase \"extra memory\" is vague, but the overall implication is that adding more storage is needed. Therefore, I'll clearly set the category to \"Storage\" and output the required JSON object. \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nThe instruction is to categorize the IT ticket correctly, and I need to output the result in JSON format. The only valid category here seems to be \"Storage,\" especially since the user mentioned their mailbox is almost full. While \"Hardware\" might seem relevant due to \"extra memory,\" the main focus on mailbox capacity clearly directs me to choose \"Storage.\" \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond simply with the appropriate JSON object: \n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
