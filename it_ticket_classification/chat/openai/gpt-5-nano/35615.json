It might fit \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or possibly \"Access\" if there\u2019s a request for access rights, but that\u2019s not explicit. Since they seem to be asking for help regarding testing and information, I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous.\"**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI could categorize the ticket as \"Miscellaneous\" since the content is a bit vague. There's also \"Internal Project,\" which might fit because of the mentions of \"catchup work\" and \"catchup info.\" The user definitely seems to be asking for help related to this catch-up work and testing. While I'm contemplating if \"Administrative rights\" might apply, there's no clear request for that. Ultimately, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best choice here.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
