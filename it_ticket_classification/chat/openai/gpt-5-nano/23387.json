There are also tasks like \"documentation,\" \"automation,\" and \"help creating user\" that seem to revolve around setting up a user, possibly indicating access needs. For ticket classification, since creating a user is tied to access rights, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" Other tasks could fit into an Internal Project, but the main focus is on user creation.**Formatting ticket category**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize this IT ticket and respond with the category in JSON format. The user's message lists various tasks, but it seems to center around the idea of \"creating a user\" for a senior tester, which likely relates to access provisioning. So, I\u2019ll format my response as {\"category\":\"Access\"} to keep it consistent. The instruction specifies delivering just the JSON object, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ll provide."
