Reading the text, it seems to be about a time card issue from July not working. The user is requesting help on submitting cards for approval, mentioning maternity leave and other details. They also highlight challenges with the submission process and the importance of taking corrective actions. I\u2019ll need to classify it as HR Support given the context.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis ticket seems focused on the timecard submission and approval workflow, likely involving errors and reconciliations in the internal HR system. I think it best fits under \"HR Support\" since it discusses time cards, approvals, and incident resolutions. The instructions indicate I need to produce a JSON object, specifically formatted as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I want to double-check that it\u2019s valid JSON, so the final output should clearly reflect that requirement.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
