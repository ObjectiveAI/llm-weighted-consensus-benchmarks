The user\u2019s message deals with import errors related to survey data and inconsistencies in a dashboard. This seems to fall under the category of \"Access,\" since it involves overseeing and troubleshooting imported responses and ensuring proper functionality in data handling. I'll have to go with that for categorization.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at this IT ticket regarding daily import errors related to survey responses within a dashboard. The language suggests it could fit into categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Given the focus on an ongoing project involving the dashboard and data import, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best fit. \"Access\" might apply, but there aren't clear access rights issues. \"Administrative rights\" could work, but it's more about resources than specific rights. So, \"Internal Project\" it is!**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nThe user\u2019s message indicates issues with daily import errors concerning a quarterly survey campaign. It emphasizes correctly importing accounts and monitoring a dashboard, which aligns well with the category \"Internal Project.\" This relates to internal processes for managing the survey data. I\u2019ll craft the response in the required JSON format without any extra text. So it will look like this:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nThat\u2019s it! Simple and straightforward."
