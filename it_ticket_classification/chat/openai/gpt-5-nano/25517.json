However, \"Access\" is also relevant. I should choose the most fitting category to ensure accurate classification.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking through the categories: \"Access\" versus \"Administrative rights.\" The user's message references a \"site\" and requests owner rights, so it seems to be about access control. Since they explicitly mention needing owner rights, it definitely aligns more with \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Administrative rights.\" Now, I need to format my response as a JSON object that includes the \"category\" key with my chosen category. So, let's ensure I follow the necessary schema!{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
