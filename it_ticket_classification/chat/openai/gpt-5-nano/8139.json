The user\u2019s message mentions \"Cacti graphs,\" \"links,\" \"capacity,\" and \"report created.\" This sounds related to network monitoring and managing links, possibly indicating a focus on network capacity. While \"Storage\" might seem relevant, it's not the best fit. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative rights\" if it\u2019s about requesting access. I'll choose which category fits best based on the context.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mentions phrases like \"help analyst,\" \"report created,\" and \"update links attached,\" which might suggest it fits \"Miscellaneous.\" However, since it primarily deals with Cacti graphs and decommissioned links, I think \"Internal Project\" might be more appropriate. Unfortunately, there aren't specific options for \"Networking\" or \"Monitoring.\" It also doesn't explicitly reference access or permissions. So, I'll consider \"Internal Project,\" \"Storage,\" or \"Access\" based on the context of updating capacity reporting.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI believe \"Internal Project\" is the most suitable category for this IT ticket. It seems to involve tasks related to updating graphs, managing decommissioned links, and generating reports. The user explicitly asked me to categorize the ticket, so I need to produce a JSON-like output. Since the text mentions \"decommissioned,\" \"updated,\" and \"report created,\" it reinforces the idea of it being an internal project. Therefore, my final output will be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
