There are also references to purchase with \"order requisition.\" So overall, it seems the best fit for this ticket is the \"Hardware\" category.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI think this ticket could be about purchasing or ordering a machine since it mentions terms like \"emergency\" and \"machine order requisition.\" The \"Purchase\" category might apply, but there are also hardware issues like \"booting\" mentioned.\n\nGiven the overall content, including \"laptop change\" and \u201chard drive booting,\u201d it seems best to categorize it under \"Hardware.\" The mention of \"bag\" doesn't add much relevance here. Overall, I'll go with \"Hardware\" since it's clearly related to laptop and machine requisition.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
