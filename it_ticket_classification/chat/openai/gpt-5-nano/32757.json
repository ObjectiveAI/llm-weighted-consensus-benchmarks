The mention of a user guide hints that it might be helping with instructions for those tasks. So, I believe categorizing it as an \"Internal Project\" is appropriate, especially since the text doesn't relate to hardware or access issues. The user seems to be focused on the project's approach and code subtasks.**Formatting category response**\n\nI see that I need to categorize an IT ticket, and the prompt requires a specific JSON-like format. The user is looking for a straightforward response with a \"category\" field, so I should return just that. Based on my reasoning, I've determined \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category. I'll make sure to keep it simple and avoid any extra text. So my final answer will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Sounds good!"
