The ticket mentions a new purchase order (PO) for a keyboard and logging installation while mentioning mandatory receipts. The content is a bit jumbled, but it clearly relates to purchasing hardware. So, I think the two most relevant categories here are \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" Since it's primarily about ordering a keyboard, I'll lean towards classifying it as \"Purchase.\"**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket. It mentions installation and logging, but the main focus seems to be on a purchase order for a keyboard. While \"keyboard\" falls under hardware, the request primarily centers around the procurement process. Since categories like \"Hardware Deployment\" or \"Procurement\" aren't available, I think \"Purchase\" is the most suitable choice. It reflects the content about the new purchase order and receipts in the ticket.**Formatting IT ticket category**\n\nThe instruction asks me to categorize an IT ticket and respond with a JSON object. It looks like they want a structure with a \"category\" key that contains a string matching one of the specific enumerated names. So, I'll produce a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} since that fits best with the focus on the purchase order for a keyboard. Of course, I could consider \"Hardware\" since it\u2019s about a keyboard, but \"Purchase\" seems more accurate overall.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
