The categories are: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" The ticket relates to onboarding, so \"HR Support\" seems most fitting since it addresses a new employee's form. While \"Access\" could apply if access to systems is involved, it looks like HR is the primary focus here for triage.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user has shared a request about a new starter form to fill out. This seems to relate to onboarding, which makes \"HR Support\" a suitable category. However, it could also fall under \"Access\" if there's a need to set up accounts, but the main request isn\u2019t explicitly for access. Since this is an IT ticket asking for categorization, I should respond with a JSON object, and \u201cHR Support\u201d fits best as the selected category.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
