I have a list of categories to consider: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since this involves the SD card as storage hardware, \"Storage\" seems fitting, but \"Hardware\" could also work for the SD card itself. \"Access\" might apply too if the issue is about opening the folder on the PC.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user is asking for help with transferring files from an SD card to a laptop and wants to open the SD folder on their PC. This clearly involves a storage device issue. To classify it, \"Storage\" seems to be the right category since that's part of the primary focus. Some might consider it \"Hardware,\" but here I think \"Storage\" fits best. I'll respond with the required JSON format showing just the category."
