The ticket text is quite messy, mentioning adding a new team member to a communication mail list, along with some details about Confluence and document forms. It looks like it involves access management, so the best categories could be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\". However, the main task is about adding this new member, so I think \"Access\" fits best for this request.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nLooking at the categories, I think \"Access\" is the most fitting for adding a new team member and their mail list setup. However, \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if permissions are involved. The user seems to be asking for a contact assignment, so I\u2019ll stick with \"Access\". I'll format this as a JSON object, ensuring it's correctly capitalized. The final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
