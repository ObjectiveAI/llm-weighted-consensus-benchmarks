I\u2019ll output a JSON object with the category field labeled \"Access.\"I'm focused on providing the correct response format as requested. The system indicates I should respond with a simple JSON object, specifically with the category labeled \"Access.\" I want to keep it clear and straightforward without any unnecessary content. So, I\u2019ll make sure to produce just that object, ensuring it's formatted correctly. The output will look like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That should meet the requirements perfectly!"
