It seems like the main concern here is related to accessing documents, which might fit into the \"Access\" category. I\u2019ll need to extract the key points to make the categorization clearer.**Analyzing IT ticket details**\n\nThis IT ticket is mainly about access issues related to documents on a new web app. Key points include not being able to access documents, the app functioning in Internet Explorer, and a mention of needing assistance. The focus is clearly on the inability to access documents, so I think the best category would be \"Access.\" However, there's also a possibility it could relate to \"Storage,\" but since the main concern is access, \"Access\" seems most appropriate for categorization.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
