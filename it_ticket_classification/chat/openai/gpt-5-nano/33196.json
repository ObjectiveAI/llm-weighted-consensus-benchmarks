The message mentions digital signatures, certificate checking, and certifying authority.\n\nWhile \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" might seem relevant, they might not fully capture what the user is facing. \"Miscellaneous\" could be the right choice for tech issues that don\u2019t neatly fit into a specific category. \n\nUltimately, it feels like \"Miscellaneous\" is a solid option for this somewhat ambiguous situation!**Selecting category for the IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering the best category for an IT ticket regarding digital signatures in Outlook. It could fit under \"Administrative rights\" since it involves certificate usage, but the user isn't asking for rights. \n\nNow, \"Access\" could work too due to certificate-based authentication, but since the message talks about validating certificates without explicitly mentioning permissions, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the safest choice. \n\nI need to respond with a valid JSON object, so I'll structure it as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
