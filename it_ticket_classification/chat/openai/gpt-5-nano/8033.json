If there's a ticket system, \"Administrative rights\" pertain to granting access, while \"Access\" would relate to systems or accounts. For this ticket, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the closest match, given it deals with mobile number verification and subscription status. Overall, it just feels safer to categorize it as such. So, I'll respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
