Given that it primarily focuses on offboarding tasks and access removal, I believe the appropriate category is \"Access.\" There might be some overlap with \"Administrative rights,\" but \"Access\" feels more accurate overall.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI need to output a response in a JSON-like structure. The prompt is asking for the category of an IT ticket based on specific categories provided. The expected output format is a JSON object with a key called \"category.\" According to the schema, I should choose one of the following values: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" So, my output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll make sure there's no extra text and deliver it cleanly!"
