The allowed categories include \"Access,\" separate from \"Administrative rights,\" but the content suggests it might also relate to adjusting capabilities in a spreadsheet context with Oracle views. They mention disabling the \"add\" feature, which could indicate a request regarding permissions. I'm leaning towards \"Access\" being the best fit, even though \"Administrative rights\" might apply since it's about permissions too.**Categorizing access issues**\n\nI'm analyzing whether this should fall under \"Administrative rights,\" which deals with privileges to modify systems. It could relate to enabling or disabling the \"Add\" permission in an Oracle view or spreadsheet. While I initially thought of \"Access,\" the user is specifically asking to disable the \"Add\" functionality. So it seems that \"Administrative rights\" fits better in this context. However, since this is about categorizing for triage, \"Access\" could work as a broader permissions issue.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nI\u2019m looking at typical IT ticket categories, and \u201cAccess\u201d seems the right choice, especially since the user is asking how to disable something, which relates to access control. I\u2019ll go ahead and format my response in JSON as needed. The user specified, and the system requires it to be in a specific format. So, my final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This matches the guidelines, and it\u2019s a straightforward response."
