It appears to refer to onboarding a new starter in Bucharest and mentions equipment and an updated starter form. Since it talks about \"equipment assigned,\" it seems to fall under \"Hardware.\" Alternatively, it could be related to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but those aren't explicit. It feels like \"Hardware\" fits best since it's mainly about hardware provisioning. Let's finalize that!**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nLooking again at the ticket categorization, \"HR Support\" might fit for onboarding too. However, it seems that \"Hardware\" is really the most relevant category here due to the explicit focus on provisioning equipment. While \"Access\" could be another option for setup, nothing specifically mentions account access\u2014only the assigned equipment. Therefore, I\u2019m deciding on \"Hardware\" as the best choice. I need to respond with a JSON object confirming that category. \n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
