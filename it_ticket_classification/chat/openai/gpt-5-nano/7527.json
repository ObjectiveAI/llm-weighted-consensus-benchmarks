The provided categories are somewhat broad, but it seems to fit either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since this ticket involves user access control, \"Access\" might be the best fit. The actions described\u2014removing access and deactivation\u2014clearly relate to managing user access rather than just admin privileges. Let's go with \"Access.\"**Formatting Access Category**\n\nI\u2019m categorizing this IT ticket as \"Access\" due to the focus on access deactivation. I need to respond with a JSON object containing the category field. The instruction specifies a category JSON with a string enum for valid channels, which means I should format it as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nIt\u2019s clear I should provide only this JSON object without any extra text. So, I\u2019ll make sure the response is plain and straightforward, just like that!"
