The user mentions things like \"new pas accesses\" and \"approve level,\" which makes me think it relates to access control. It seems like the best category is \"Access,\" and possibly \"Administrative rights\" if it's discussing access levels. The focus on approvals and running reports based on actual accesses strongly indicates it's about user permissions.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m determining the right category for this IT ticket, and I think \"Access\" is appropriate. The phrasing indicates it's about access levels and approvals, making \"Access\" the broader term. If the user intended to specify \"Administrative rights,\" that's more limited. Given that the ticket discusses who has which level of access, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object, so here it is:  \n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
