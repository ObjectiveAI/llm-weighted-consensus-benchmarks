The possible categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the ticket discusses an external monitor request, it seems most fitting for the Hardware category. However, it could also relate to Purchase if it's about acquiring the monitor. Ultimately, I'd lean towards categorizing it as Hardware, as that aligns with the request's nature.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket, and the prompt indicates that it expects a single category. Given that the request is about an external monitor, I would classify it under Hardware. Other categories like Administrative rights, Access, Internal Project, Storage, and Miscellaneous don't fit. So, my final decision is to categorize it as Hardware. I\u2019ll format my response in JSON to meet the specifications, making sure to output just that: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
