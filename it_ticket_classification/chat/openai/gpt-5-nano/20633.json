The text suggests they need a riser for better neck health, which points to hardware. So, I'll lean towards \"Hardware\" as the main category since it fits best. However, since they might also be asking for help with purchasing it, I could consider \"Purchase\" too. Overall, \"Hardware\" seems like the strongest match here.**Identifying IT ticket category**\n\nThe text indicates the user is asking for a monitor riser to adjust the height for better neck health while using two monitors. This suggests it's primarily a hardware request. While they don't explicitly mention purchasing, the phrase \"please help\" implies they might need assistance setting it up. Given that the focus is on the monitor riser as a piece of equipment, I think the best fit for this ticket would be the \"Hardware\" category, potentially considering \"Purchase\" as well.**Deciding on category**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the categories available for classifying the IT ticket. The user\u2019s request highlights a need for a monitor riser, which seems hardware-related. The format requires me to respond with a JSON object containing the appropriate category. While \"Purchase\" might be relevant due to the equipment request, the primary focus on \"monitor riser\" leans me towards \"Hardware.\" Since they haven't explicitly asked to buy, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" as the main choice and output it accordingly.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
