Out of the options available, \"HR Support\" seems to fit best since it deals with submitting hours and managing free days. I need to output the category in JSON format.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm noticing that there's a mention of needing a code to enable the option for submitting hours, which points to access or permissions. However, the main issue revolves around the hours option and submitting time, which relates to the HR or payroll system. \"HR Support\" seems to be the best category here. I need to format my output as a JSON object that reads {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}, focusing on providing the structured response without any extra text."
