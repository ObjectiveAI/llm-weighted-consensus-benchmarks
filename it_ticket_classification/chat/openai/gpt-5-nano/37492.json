Since the ticket mentions a cloud service issue, it doesn\u2019t fit in Hardware or HR Support. It seems like \"Access\" is the most plausible category if the user is having trouble accessing Oracle Cloud, but \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback.**Categorizing a garbled IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket message is a bit garbled, but it seems to refer to an \"Oracle Cloud issue.\" Given phrases like \"please find attached,\" I think the user might be having login troubles. I believe \"Access\" is the safest category since it relates directly to their ability to access Oracle Cloud. While \"Internal Project\" crossed my mind, it doesn't seem fitting. I'll produce a JSON object with the category as \u201cAccess\u201d: {\"category\":\"Access\"} according to the required format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
