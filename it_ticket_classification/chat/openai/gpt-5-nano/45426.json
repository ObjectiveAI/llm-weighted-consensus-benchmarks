Since this warning deals with the changes in the network setup, the Hardware category appears to be the most fitting choice. Now, I\u2019ll categorize the ticket accordingly.**Categorizing network incident**\n\nThe message is about a \"host topology change,\" indicating a network or hardware issue, possibly due to a disconnected cable. From the available categories, \"Hardware\" seems the most fitting, even though \"Network\" isn't listed. I think \"Hardware\" is the best option.
