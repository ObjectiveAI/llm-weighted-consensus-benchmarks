The user reported an invalid time sheet and difficulties entering tasks after submission. I have a set of categories to choose from, and while this seems related to HR/payroll, it\u2019s clearly an application issue with the Oracle system. Since it's about time sheets, it could fit under \"HR Support,\" but it definitely falls under IT since it's about the application.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI see that \"HR Support\" is the most suitable category for this ticket about the Oracle time sheet issue. While \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" could be options, they're not relevant since this isn\u2019t a login issue. Although \"Miscellaneous\" is possible, it\u2019s better to be specific with \"HR Support\" since it relates to the HR system. So, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} to meet the requirements.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
