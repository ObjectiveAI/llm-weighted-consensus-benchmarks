This is about access control and permissions. I think \"Administrative rights\" fits well since it focuses on permissions and roles. The instruction is clear: I should output a JSON object. So I\u2019ll go with: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"} and present it without any extra text.**Validating JSON output**\n\nI want to ensure that I\u2019m providing valid JSON for the category. Since \"Administrative rights\" is part of the category list, I\u2019ll format it correctly. It looks like I can simply output: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. That seems straightforward! Now I can respond confidently with this JSON. It aligns with the requirements, so let\u2019s do it!"
