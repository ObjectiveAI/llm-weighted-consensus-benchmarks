Now, the next step is to determine which category best fits based on the ticket content. I\u2019ll read the user message carefully to make the right choice. It\u2019s important to categorize correctly to ensure timely support and resolution!**Identifying the ticket issue**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a garbled message regarding HR matters, specifically about notifications related to someone's maternity leave and their timecards. The text mentions disabling notifications and taking action regarding direct reports. It includes several HR-related terms like maternity, timecards, line manager, and absences. Given the content, it definitely seems to fall under HR Support. I\u2019ll need to address the user\u2019s concerns properly to help resolve the issue!**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe message clearly fits into the \"HR Support\" category, focusing on HR processes and line managers. I see terms like \"update person record\" and \"submit their line manager for total days,\" which reinforces that HR context. Now, I need to respond with a simple JSON object that indicates this category. Following the requirements, the output will be straightforward: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no additional text\u2014just the JSON as instructed."
