The ticket mentions \"add to mailboxes,\" which may imply setting up email folders or auto-responders. It seems related to accounts receivable and an account extension. Since it's about access to mailboxes, I'm considering categorizing it under \"Access\" or maybe \"Administrative rights,\" since adding something typically involves permission-related tasks. I need to be clear on the user\u2019s intent!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket is likely related to email access or permissions for Accounts Receivable and an accountant's extension. It mentions adding to mailboxes and includes an unclear request: \"add good morning please add follows.\" This might suggest setting up a distribution list or automatic replies for the \"good morning\" message. Since it revolves around mailbox access, I think the best category is \"Access\" due to the focus on adding permissions to email accounts or extensions. I'd like to be sure about this!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI should consider whether the request involves granting permissions, as \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if that were the case. However, since this ticket appears focused on adding mailboxes rather than granting admin rights, it fits better in the \"Access\" category. I also pondered the possibility of it relating to an \"Internal Project,\" but that doesn't seem to apply. So, I'll respond with the categorization: {\"category\": \"Access\"} to align with the required format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
