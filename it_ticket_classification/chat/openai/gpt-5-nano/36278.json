The text they provided suggests they\u2019re struggling with mailbox storage. So, I\u2019m torn between \"Storage\" and \"Hardware\" categories. It sounds like they want more storage for their mailbox, which fits under \"Storage.\" Yeah, \"_memory increase\" typically relates to storage capacity, so I think \"Storage\" is the correct category for this ticket.**Categorizing Memory Increase Request**\n\nThe user\u2019s phrase \"memory increase\" could refer to RAM or mailbox storage; for mail, it usually means storage quota. Given they mention \"cleaning up,\" it seems they\u2019re trying to extend memory for their mailbox. Therefore, I think \"Storage\" is the right category here. Since the assistant's output needs to be in a specific JSON-like format, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. This fits perfectly, and I want to make sure everything is quoted correctly.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
