Phrases like \"starter form attached\" and \"help by filling out starter form\" suggest it's related to HR onboarding. It seems pretty clear this should fall under \"HR Support.\" However, I\u2019m also considering if it might fit under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access,\" based on details provided. Let\u2019s stick with \"HR Support\" for this ticket.**Categorizing HR Onboarding**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the form that\u2019s meant for onboarding a new starter. It seems that \"HR Support\" fits best because it's specifically about a starter form. While \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" are options, the content focuses more on onboarding assistance with phrases like \"help by filling out starter form.\" So to clarify, I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"HR Support,\" and I'll prepare to respond with a JSON object saying: category: \"HR Support.\"**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object, specifically requiring a \"category\" field for the IT ticket. The correct category is \"HR Support,\" so I\u2019ll format it as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It\u2019s important to stick to the specified format, and the response must be valid JSON without any extra text. Following the structure mentioned, I\u2019ll confidently provide the simple JSON output: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} and make sure it's ready to go!"
