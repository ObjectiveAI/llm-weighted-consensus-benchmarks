The ticket mentions \"Neptune meeting room,\" \"installation,\" and \"purchase requisition.\" I have to fit it into categories like Hardware, HR Support, and Purchase. It seems the main focus is on equipment installation, especially related to the Neptune meeting room and camera setup. Since it includes the request for a purchase requisition, I'll assign that to the Purchase category, and the installation aspect suggests Hardware as well.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI see that the ticket indicates only one category should be chosen, so I need to pick the most appropriate one. There\u2019s a clear request for a purchase requisition in \"please create purchase requisition\" and terms like \"buy fancy,\" so that suggests \"Purchase\" as the main category. However, since it mentions \"installation\" and \"testing,\" which relate to \"Hardware,\" I could consider that too. But given the explicit purchase request, I\u2019ll go with \"Purchase\" and prepare to output the JSON accordingly.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
