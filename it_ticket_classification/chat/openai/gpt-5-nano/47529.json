The user described an issue with \"projects menu access\" in Oracle, specifically about selecting projects to add themselves as a member. Based on the provided categories\u2014like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Internal Project\"\u2014it seems like the most relevant category would be \"Access\" since it directly concerns access rights. I have to prepare a JSON output for the classification with the chosen category.**Analyzing ticket categorization**\n\nI need to determine the right category for this IT ticket. \"Access\" seems more generic, while \"Administrative rights\" is specific to administrative privileges. The text mentions that \"only a manager can add members,\" indicating it's about access control. The user seeks access to add themselves to projects, suggesting \"Access\" is the best fit. I also see some mention of \"manager privileges,\" but the primary issue revolves around project access. So, I'll go with \"Access\" for the category.**Finalizing category response**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to pick \"Access\" as the category for this IT ticket. I'll respond with a concise classification in the required JSON format. It should look like this:\n\n{\"category\": \"Access\"}\n\nI need to ensure it's precisely structured according to the schema provided, which states that the \"category\" property should be a string from the enumerated categories. So the final output is simply:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThat keeps it clear and to the point, without any additional text!"
