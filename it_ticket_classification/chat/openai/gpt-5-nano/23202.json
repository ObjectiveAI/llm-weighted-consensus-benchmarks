The user mentions \"oracle fusion\" and requests to \"create active according to attached form.\" This suggests it relates to internal projects. I\u2019m considering \"Internal Project\" as a category since it\u2019s about creating a new project code. While \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" might fit too, \"Internal Project\" seems the most appropriate given the context.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking through the ticket details to categorize it properly. Since the user is asking about creating a new project code in Oracle Fusion, I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the category. They mention creating an active project code based on an attached form, which fits well here. While \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could also apply since it's about rights, \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best in this context. I will respond with the category in the specified JSON format.**Preparing the JSON output**\n\nI need to create a JSON object that includes a \"category\" field with the value \"Internal Project.\" The tool expects this specific structure, so I won\u2019t include extra commentary in my response. I\u2019ll format the output as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} to adhere to the schema requirements. It's important to keep things concise and valid, so I will respond directly with that JSON without any additional text. Let\u2019s get this delivered!"
