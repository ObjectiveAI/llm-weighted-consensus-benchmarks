The request mentions a computer installation scheduled for a specific time. It seems to fit best under \"Hardware\" since it's likely about installing something on a device. The mention of \"installation\" twice makes it clear that's the focus. While \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option, it's not as suitable based on the context.**Classifying IT tickets**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the categories in the IT ticket system. The phrase \"request installation\" might initially suggest \"Internal Project,\" but it\u2019s more likely a straightforward request for installation help. If the user needs assistance with their computer, the \"Hardware\" category seems the most fitting. I considered \"Administrative rights,\" but that's not mentioned in the request. Categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" don\u2019t apply. I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object specifying the category as \"Hardware.\"{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
