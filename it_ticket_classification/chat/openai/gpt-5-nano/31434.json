The user provided a somewhat jumbled message about a \"starter form\" and an \"internship program.\" It includes keywords suggesting it relates to onboarding for a new employee. I\u2019m thinking the best fit for this ticket could be \"Administrative rights,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or possibly \"Internal Project.\" It's a bit unclear, but it revolves around forms for new starters.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to classify the IT ticket as \"HR Support\" since it involves onboarding forms, which is typically an HR function. However, it also mentions access to systems. The content includes several references to \"starter forms\" and \"internship,\" so it's definitely related to onboarding. The categories I'm working with are Hardware, HR Support, Access, and a few others. Since the ticket discusses onboarding specifically, \"HR Support\" seems like the best fit, but \"Access\" isn't actually listed.**Clarifying ticket categories**\n\nOkay, so I've confirmed that \"Access\" is indeed one of the categories. The full list includes Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The content is primarily about onboarding forms for new starters, so it seems to lean towards \"HR Support.\" However, since there\u2019s mention of filling out forms that could relate to IT access, it complicates things a bit. Ultimately, I think the safest categorization is \"HR Support,\" given its focus on starter forms and internship programs. I\u2019ll prepare to output this in a JSON format.**Formatting the response correctly**\n\nThe task is to provide the category in a specific JSON format. I need to return a \"category\" object with the value \"HR Support.\" I've confirmed that this is one of the valid enumerated values listed in the instructions. The required format looks like: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll make sure there\u2019s no extra commentary or fluff\u2014just the straight JSON output. Here\u2019s the response: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
