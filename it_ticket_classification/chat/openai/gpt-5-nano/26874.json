The content seems to involve issues related to access, specifically regarding physical access to a space and challenges with ID cards not working. It mentions Orion system access and the transfer process but doesn\u2019t clearly fit into categories like Hardware or Purchase. Overall, it looks like this falls under the \"Access\" category due to the mention of physical access and system access issues.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe category \"Access\" seems the most appropriate since the ticket concerns issues related to physical space access and problems with ID cards and the Orion system. Although there are mentions of transfer processes, the primary focus remains on access. I'll provide the response in a JSON-like format as instructed. It looks like this should just be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nThis format matches the required output and ensures I'm following the guidelines correctly!"
