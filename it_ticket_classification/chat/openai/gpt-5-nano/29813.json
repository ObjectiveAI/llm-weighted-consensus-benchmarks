However, since the message mentions a need for procurement, the \"Purchase\" category could work too. It\u2019s clear that the ticket isn\u2019t about access, HR, or administrative rights, focusing more on assistance with hardware.**Categorizing IT ticket request**\n\nThe phrase \"cables needed\" might indicate a request for procurement, but I can't assume that. The assignment of the category seems a bit ambiguous, so I\u2019ll opt for \"Hardware\" as the default for physical device issues. Since the user wants a specific category, I need to provide a response in the required JSON-like format. I should output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. If there's uncertainty, we could think about \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d but it's likely hardware-related. So, I'll stick to that format!"
