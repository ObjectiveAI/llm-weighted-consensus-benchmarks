The ticket appears to involve changing templates and adding dropdown options, which points towards a specific category. Given the nature of the request, it could fit under \"Administrative rights\" if it deals with admin interfaces or \"Internal Project\" if tied to an ongoing initiative. If it's not clearly defined, then \"Miscellaneous\" might be the safest choice. I'll decide on one of those categories for the JSON output.**Choosing the best category**\n\nI need to determine the best category for the ticket. It mentions modifying a template and adding dropdown options, likely related to an internal tool. This isn't about hardware, HR, or direct access issues. While \"Administrative rights\" could seem relevant for template changes needing permissions, the ticket doesn't explicitly ask for access rights. I think \"Internal Project\" aligns best since it involves modifications as part of a project. If that doesn\u2019t fit, \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option.**Determining the category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket. Although \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant since it involves template adjustments, that category primarily focuses on access control. The user isn't asking for access; they're requesting changes. Therefore, \"Internal Project\" might be the safest choice as it relates to an internal tool improvement. The content indicates it's a feature request for modifying templates. I\u2019ll go with \"Internal Project\" and respond with the appropriate JSON format: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
