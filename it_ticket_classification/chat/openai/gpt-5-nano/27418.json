It might be related to a new starter, which could fall under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" However, I\u2019m curious if it could also be linked to \"HR Support.\" Since \"HR Support\" is in the categories, I think that might fit best.**Choosing category labels**\n\nI need to decide on a category for the IT ticket. Given the information, I think \"Access\" is the best fit since a new starter likely needs access rights to systems. It could also be \"Administrative rights,\" especially if there's a request for admin access mentioned. The ticket mentions \"administration officer,\" but without further context, I\u2019d lean towards \"Access\" as the most general and appropriate category. I could consider \"Internal Project,\" but it doesn't seem relevant here.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
