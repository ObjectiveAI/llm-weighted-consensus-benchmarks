Since \"outlet\" could refer to an Ethernet or power outlet in an IT context, I think hardware might be the best fit. However, I\u2019m wondering if I should ask clarifying questions to be sure.**Determining the right category**\n\nI'm looking at the categories for the IT ticket, and \"Hardware\" seems fitting since it involves physical devices like outlets. Although \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" don\u2019t fit, \"Internal Project\" could work if it's part of a project. The idea of \"additional outlet\" suggests they might want a new power outlet installed, which leans towards \"Hardware.\" I should categorize it as \"Hardware\" to be safe. Finally, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object in the required format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
