The user\u2019s ticket text is a bit jumbled, but it mentions \u201cnew purchase PO\u201d and \u201cadding installing device.\u201d \n\nIt looks like the ticket is primarily about a new purchase order and device installation. I\u2019ll lean towards categorizing it under \"Purchase\" since it revolves around purchasing and managing a device.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nIt seems this ticket is related to hardware purchase and installation. The categories of \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase\" both make sense. The text mentions a purchase order, device installation, and subscribing to a service. Since it involves installing a device and includes purchasing, I'm inclined to categorize it under \"Hardware\" because it focuses on the device aspect. While \"Purchase\" relates to procurement, \"Hardware\" better represents the essence of the request, which is about the device itself.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nThe phrase \"purchase PO\" suggests procurement, so I might lean towards categorizing it as \"Purchase,\" but there's also the mention of \"installing device,\" which ties it back to hardware. The user\u2019s message has ambiguity, but it clearly indicates \"installing device\" and adding it under a user\u2019s name. This signals that it involves both hardware and provisioning. Given the focus on the device, I\u2019m settling on \"Hardware\" for the category. I\u2019ll format my answer in JSON: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
