I think the best fit might be \"HR Support,\" but it could also be \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Hardware doesn\u2019t apply here, so I\u2019ll focus on these other options.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket seems HR-related since it mentions a \"new starter\" and a work contract. The category \"HR Support\" could be appropriate as it covers onboarding processes. While \"Access\" relates to account provisioning, this ticket focuses more on completing a starter form. Given it references a starter form and work contract without explicitly discussing access provisioning, I feel \"HR Support\" is the best fit. \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" don't align as well with the request.**Providing JSON response**\n\nThe best category for this ticket is \"HR Support\" since it's about onboarding a new employee. Although \"Internal Project\" could apply to onboarding as a project, that's less likely. I need to respond with a JSON object that follows the required format: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to keep the response minimal with no extra text, as it could interfere with the parsing. So, the final output will be just:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
