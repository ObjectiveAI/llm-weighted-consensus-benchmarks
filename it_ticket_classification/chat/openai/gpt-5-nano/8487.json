They mentioned issues like stuck keys and asked for a new one, which indicates a hardware-related need. Looking at the category options, \"Hardware\" seems like the best fit since it's about the physical keyboard. Some might consider \"Purchase\" due to the procurement aspect, but overall, \"Hardware\" stands out as the appropriate choice for this ticket.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering the best category for the IT ticket request. The user's message clearly indicates it's about a hardware replacement, specifically a new keyboard. Although \"Purchase\" could possibly fit since it involves acquiring new equipment, I think \"Hardware\" is more appropriate given the context. I should provide a JSON response with the selected category. So, here\u2019s my response: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This should meet the user's request without any extra commentary!"
