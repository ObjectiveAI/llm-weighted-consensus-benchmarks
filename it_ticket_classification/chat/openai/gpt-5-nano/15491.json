It's a bit noisy, but it mentions \"new purchase\" and \"purchase order,\" which hints at the category of Purchase. The text also refers to something related to an \"Apple Pro Retina\" keyboard. This is likely the focus, so I'll lean toward classifying it as a Purchase ticket based on that context.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket details, and it looks like it's about logging purchase orders and allocations, as well as mandatory receipts. Phrases like \"please log allocation\" and \"order receive item ordered received two po\" indicate it's related to Purchase. Even though there might be a chance it could fit in other categories, \"Administrative rights\" and \"Internal Project\" don't seem right. So, the best fit is definitely Purchase. I\u2019ll respond with the appropriate JSON format reflecting this.**Clarifying Output Format**\n\nI need to ensure that my output aligns with the given instructions. They want the categorization as a JSON object, specifically with a \"category\" field. Although there's a schema provided, it looks like the required output is simply: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I should avoid any extra text or disclaimers, so it\u2019s important to keep it concise. I\u2019ll finalize the response as just: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. That keeps it clear and direct!"
