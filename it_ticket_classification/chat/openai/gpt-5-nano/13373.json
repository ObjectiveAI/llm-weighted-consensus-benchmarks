Given the mention of installation tickets, this could fall under \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Internal Project,\" since it doesn't clearly match other categories. Let's decide on the best fit!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm weighing the different category options for the IT ticket, including \"Internal Project,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" The mention of \"installation tickets\" strongly suggests it's linked to a project or task. However, \"budget\" and \"phone\" also come into play. Given the context, it likely aligns with \"Internal Project\" since installation tasks are typically internal. I\u2019m also considering \"Administrative rights\" if it\u2019s about requesting access. I need to confidently choose one!**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI\u2019ve been analyzing the ticket and considering mentions of \"voice,\" \"phone,\" and \"administrator.\" I suspect it relates to a phone system installation, so I\u2019m weighing categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since this sounds like setting up installation tickets rather than purchasing equipment, \"Internal Project\" seems the best fit. Now I need to format my response correctly using JSON, like: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} to comply with the required schema. Let's get this wrapped up!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
