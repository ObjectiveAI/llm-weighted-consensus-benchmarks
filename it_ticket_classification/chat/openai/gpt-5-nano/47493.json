The ticket mentions things like \"access to gizmo\" and \"cannot create survey,\" which suggests it's mostly about access. It seems like they\u2019re asking for the right level of access to a tool called SurveyGizmo, now known as Alchemer. Given the content, \"Access\" is probably the best category, while \"Administrative Rights\" could apply if they need special permissions to create surveys.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nThe user is asking to categorize the IT ticket, which involves terms like \"fix please,\" \"right level access,\" and \"admin rights.\" While \"Administrative rights\" seems precise since it's related to permissions for creating surveys, I think \"Access\" encompasses the user's concerns better. It\u2019s broad but covers all the mentions of access restrictions and log-in issues. Since the main focus is on gaining access to the survey tool, I'll go with \"Access\" for the category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
