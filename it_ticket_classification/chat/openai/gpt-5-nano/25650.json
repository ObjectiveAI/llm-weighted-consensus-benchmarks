The ticket content revolves around an annual leave approval process, which suggests it fits under HR Support. It seems to involve notifications and requests related to leave, so I think HR Support is definitely the best choice for this ticket.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket talks about \"annual leave request,\" \"reject,\" \"leave approved stage,\" and other HR-related terms. This indicates it deals with the leave approval workflow, leading me to think it belongs in the \"HR Support\" category. The requirements state I need to output a JSON object with the category structured properly. So, it looks like I should create a JSON object with \"category\" set to \"HR Support\" based on the specified format.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
