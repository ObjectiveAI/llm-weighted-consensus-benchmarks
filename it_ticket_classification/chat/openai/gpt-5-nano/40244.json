It looks like this is related to an access issue regarding the submission of forms. I think the best category for this would be \"Access\" because they're struggling to access the form necessary for their exit process. I'll make sure to format this properly, so it fits a JSON-like structure in the output.**Determining the IT ticket category**\n\nThe user is struggling to access a leaver form and needs help submitting it. Their message indicates issues with a blocker and possibly access problems, which makes me think it should fall under the \"Access\" category. However, since it's specifically related to HR processes, \"HR Support\" could also be relevant. There are several categories to choose from, but based on the context, I\u2019m leaning towards \"Access\" as the most appropriate classification.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThis ticket centers around the user's inability to access a leaver form, which suggests an access issue. While I could consider \"HR Support\" due to it being related to HR, the main focus here is technical access to that form. It seems most appropriate to categorize it as \"Access\" because that's the core problem. I plan to respond to the user with a JSON object that confirms this category and includes a brief note.**Preparing the JSON output**\n\nI need to provide the response in JSON format, specifically {\"category\":\"Access\"} since that's how we're categorizing the ticket. I'll ensure this format is correct because the category field must be one of those predefined strings. Although sometimes there might be a request for additional explanation, the instruction here is to simply categorize the IT ticket. So, I\u2019ll keep it concise and deliver just this category in the output."
