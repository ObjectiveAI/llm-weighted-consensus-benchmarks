The categories I can choose from include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It seems like it could fall under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project,\" but I'm not quite sure which fits best.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe ticket mention of \"duplicate notifications\" and \"ServiceNow\" really suggests it doesn't fall under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access.\" Since the category options are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights, I can rule out hardware and HR. It seems like this could fit into Miscellaneous as it\u2019s a general IT support issue. Maybe it could be considered an \"Internal Project,\" but \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit here. So, I'll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Formulating response**\n\nI need to respond with a simple JSON-like object that includes the category. The prompt is clear: \"Categorize this IT Ticket:\" followed by the provided text. I shouldn\u2019t add any extra content, just the JSON. The instructions specify that there\u2019s a \"category\" object, so I\u2019ll output it as: {\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}. Keeping it straightforward and concise is key here!"
