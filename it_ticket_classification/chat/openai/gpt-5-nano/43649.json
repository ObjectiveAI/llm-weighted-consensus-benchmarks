The content is clearly focused on access control and data security. It seems to fit best in the \"Access\" category because it talks about restricting access. However, it might also relate to \"Administrative rights,\" considering the mention of rights and restrictions. Overall, I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate category here!**Determining the appropriate category**\n\nI'm deciding between the categories \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights\" for this ticket. It mentions issues with unauthorized access and data leakage, particularly concerning salaries. Since the core concern seems to be about who has access to this sensitive information, \"Access\" appears to be the best fit. I need to ensure my output is in the correct JSON format with the required category key. So, I'll craft it as: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. Let's keep it straightforward without extra commentary!**Finalizing category selection**\n\nThe user included \"HR Support\" as a category, but this issue is clearly about IT security rather than HR. So, \"HR Support\" doesn't fit here at all. Given the focus on unauthorized access, \"Access\" is definitely the best category to choose. Now, I\u2019ll prepare the output in the required format. It looks like the final output will be: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. Let's go ahead and return that!"
