The user mentions things like \"new starter access card\" and \"Belgrade,\" which suggests it's about enabling access for new employees. This likely fits into the \"Access\" category since it deals with granting physical access like access cards. While I briefly considered \"Administrative rights,\" it seems more focused on building access for starters, so \"Access\" is the best choice here.**Parsing IT Ticket Request**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the text about enabling access cards for new starters. It mentions \"Belgrade\" and \"Friday PM joiners,\" but the main focus is on enabling access. That points to the \"Access\" category, though I briefly wondered about \"Administrative rights\" since it could involve user accounts. However, the mention of access cards suggests physical access, so \"Access\" makes the most sense. I need to format my response in JSON, which should look like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
