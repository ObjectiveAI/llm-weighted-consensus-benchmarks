The categories I have to choose from include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given it's related to accounts payable and invoices, \"Purchase\" seems like the best fit. Administrative rights and Internal Project don\u2019t apply. So, I'm deciding on \"Purchase\" since it relates closely to invoicing and procurement issues.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket following the specified format, producing a JSON-like object. The category should represent one of the allowed options. Based on the content about Oracle invoice issues, prepayment, and VAT, \u201cPurchase\u201d seems most appropriate, even though \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d could fit too. I\u2019ll ensure my response is just the relevant JSON object that looks like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. This keeps it neat and follows the user's instructions exactly."
