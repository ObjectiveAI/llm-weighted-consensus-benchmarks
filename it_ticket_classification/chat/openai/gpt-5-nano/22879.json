I'll need to determine which category best fits this ticket's content. Let's focus on selecting the most appropriate option!**Analyzing ticket contents**\n\nThe ticket appears to revolve around \"custom reports,\" with several mentions of \"reports stored hub section,\" \"approve,\" and \"leader Friday pm.\" It seems like a request related to scheduling custom reports, possibly regarding decommissioning an old platform. There\u2019s a lot of repetition and detail, including references to the frequency of reports every two weeks and specifics about issues, requests, and ticket descriptions. My goal is to discern the main focus for accurate categorization!**Determining the correct category**\n\nI'm thinking this ticket could fit under \"Internal Project\" since it relates to reports within a project context. However, it might also be considered \"Miscellaneous\" as it doesn't fit neatly into any specific category. I can rule out options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Storage, and Purchase. \"Internal Project\" seems to make the most sense because it's about custom reports as a feature. There\u2019s also mention of fields and data issues which supports this categorization.**Finalizing the category output**\n\nThe content of the ticket indicates it's about \"custom reports\" and scheduling them every two weeks, suggesting it's a feature or configuration request. I feel \"Internal Project\" fits best, or I could use \"Miscellaneous\" if it's not clear. My goal here is to provide a correctly structured JSON response with the category. The required format is a category object containing the category string. So, I'll make sure to output JSON as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} without any extra text or punctuation."
