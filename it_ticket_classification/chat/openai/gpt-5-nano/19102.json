Looking through it, it appears to discuss a new purchase order, installation, and receipts. The repeated mentions of \"purchase PO\" and \"installation\" make me think it belongs in the \"Purchase\" category. While it briefly touches on hardware with the installation aspect, it primarily revolves around purchases, so I\u2019m confident \u201cPurchase\u201d is the right choice here.**Structuring category response**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket based on the provided content and match it to the correct JSON format. The user's content clearly revolves around a purchase order and installation, indicating that \"Purchase\" is the most suitable category. While concepts like \"Hardware\" come to mind with installation, the central focus is on the purchase order itself. So, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object that includes the category \"Purchase\" formatted correctly according to the schema provided.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
