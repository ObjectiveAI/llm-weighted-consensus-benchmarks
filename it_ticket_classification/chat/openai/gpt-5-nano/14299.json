The categories available include hardware options, but since this is about purchasing, it could also fit under \"Purchase.\" My best guess here would be \"Hardware,\" since the request explicitly mentions plugs and sockets, but \"Purchase\" may also be a valid choice considering it's likely about procurement. Let's structure the output in JSON format.**Classifying IT Request**\n\nThe user's text requests extended plug outlets for devices on the floor, indicating it's a hardware request. I\u2019m considering categorizing it as either \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase,\" but the primary focus is on the plugs, which makes \"Hardware\" the best fit since we're dealing with physical items like extension cords. Though there's a mention of \"parental control subscriber rights,\" it seems unrelated. Therefore, I'll structure my response as JSON: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}.**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI recognize that the \"Purchase\" category could imply shopping, but the request isn't strictly about budget. The phrase about \"each order plug devices location floor\" seems to suggest a specific need rather than procurement. Therefore, it makes sense to choose \"Hardware\" to indicate that it\u2019s about providing physical items. Since the instructions specify responding with a JSON format, I'll output simply: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Let's go ahead and deliver that!"
