This ticket seems to involve site decommissioning, migration, and file transfer. It could fit into \"Administrative rights\" due to access rights, but it could also be \"Internal Project\" since it deals with transitioning a site. Other categories like \"Storage\" or \"Miscellaneous\" could apply, but I think the best fit is \"Internal Project\" because of the migration aspect.**Outputting JSON object**\n\nThe main task here is to categorize an internal project involving decommissioning and migration. The user wants me to return a JSON object that specifies the category. Based on the given categories, it seems appropriate to use \"Internal Project.\" \n\nFollowing the required format, I'll output the JSON correctly, which would look like this: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. I need to ensure this aligns with the schema provided while keeping it straightforward. So that's my final response!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
