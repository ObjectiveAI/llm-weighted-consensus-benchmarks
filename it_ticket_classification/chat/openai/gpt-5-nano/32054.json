However, since it's mainly a hardware request, I think \"Hardware\" is the more appropriate category. After reviewing the categorization instructions and the available categories, I\u2019m settling on \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll output the JSON object with that category: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"} to comply with the instructions.
