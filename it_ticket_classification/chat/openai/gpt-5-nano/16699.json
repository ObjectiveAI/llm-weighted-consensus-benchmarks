The categories available are hardware, HR support, access, and others. The ticket includes phrases like \"new project code,\" \"create per template,\" and \"changing name\" repeatedly. Given these elements, it seems related to an internal project tied to creating a project code and possibly administrative tasks surrounding name changes and forms. I need to pick the best fitting category.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the options for categorizing the IT ticket. \"Administrative rights\" might relate to access, but \"Internal Project\" seems the best fit for terms like \"new project code,\" \"templates,\" and \"forms.\" The mention of \"changing name\" could imply an account or project name change, but it doesn't explicitly request access rights. Since the ticket mostly refers to creating a project code, I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\" Now, I'll format it into a JSON-like structure with the chosen category.**Outputting ticket category**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize the IT ticket, and I need to respond using a specific JSON format. Based on my analysis, the category is \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll ensure to provide just the JSON object without any extra text. So my final response will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This format keeps it clean and aligns with the user's instructions. Now, I'm ready to deliver it!"
