It\u2019s a bit messy, but clearly, these topics relate to \u201cStorage\u201d or \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d Given the keywords like \"backup,\" \"snapshot,\" and \"restore,\" it seems most appropriate to categorize it under \"Storage.\" The user is asking for help categorizing this ticket, and I think I've got a solid understanding now. I'll go with \"Storage\" as the best fit!**Formatting category response**\n\nI\u2019m planning to respond with a category object formatted as JSON, likely indicating {\"category\": \"Storage\"}. It's important to follow the system's requirements, which specify a JSON object with a category property. Even though I considered \"Internal Project,\" this ticket clearly focuses on backups, so \"Storage\" is the right choice. I\u2019ll ensure to output it like this: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} without unnecessary explanations since the instructions only ask for the category itself.**Delivering category response**\n\nThe user simply asked me to categorize the IT ticket. I\u2019ll provide just the category in the required format without any additional information. So my final response will be: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. It\u2019s straightforward, and I\u2019m ready to deliver it now!"
