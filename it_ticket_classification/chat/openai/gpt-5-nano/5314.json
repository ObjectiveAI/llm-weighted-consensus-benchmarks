The ticket contains a lot of information about Teams memberships, admin rights, and access permissions. Given that the main focus is on granting and removing admin rights, I think the relevant category should be \"Administrative rights.\" I'll format the response as a JSON object with that category to make it clear and organized.**Confirming output format**\n\nI need to format my response as a JSON object with the required category structure. The instructions say to categorize the IT ticket, focusing on \"Administrative rights.\" So my output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. I noticed the requirement to keep it concise and avoid any extra text, which is great! I'll make sure to follow that and deliver just the JSON object without any unnecessary details."
