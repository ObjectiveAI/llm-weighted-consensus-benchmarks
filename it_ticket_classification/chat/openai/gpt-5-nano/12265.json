The options are hardware, HR support, access, miscellaneous, storage, purchase, internal project, and administrative rights. Given the content\u2014references to expense approver and permission levels\u2014it seems this falls under access management. So, access is likely the best category to fit this ticket. Let's go with that!**Categorizing access rights**\n\nThis ticket is about access rights, so I need to categorize it. It mentions the \"expense approver,\" which implies an approval role in finance and involves granting permissions. Since the theme revolves around user permissions, \"Access\" is the best fit. \"Administrative rights\" could also apply if it\u2019s about privileges. However, given the details, I'll go with \"Access.\" The proper response format should be a JSON object, so I'll structure it like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
