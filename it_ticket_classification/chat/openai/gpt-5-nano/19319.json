I think the most fitting category here would be \"Access,\" since that aligns with the mention of needing assistance for external access. I'll format the output now as {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nIt seems the correct category for this ticket is \"Access,\" given the mention of access and connection. I need to format the output correctly in JSON as specified, so it will be {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The required format is clear: it needs to be just the object without any extra text. I do wonder if \"Administrative rights\" might be relevant given the context, but since \"outside access\" is the key phrase, I'll stick with \"Access.\" Here\u2019s the final output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Confirming category decision**\n\nIt seems clear that the user is looking for help related to connecting as a developer. However, the best category for this scenario remains \"Access.\" So, my final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019m ready to deliver this straightforward solution!"
