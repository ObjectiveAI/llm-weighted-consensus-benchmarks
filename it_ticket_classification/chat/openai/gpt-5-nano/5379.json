It seems to relate to performance issues like high latency and packet loss, and mentions \"switch\" and \"connection.\" While I\u2019d usually consider \u201cNetworking\u201d as a category, it isn't listed here. The closest option might be \"Hardware,\" since a switch is hardware-related. \"Miscellaneous\" could also fit, but nothing else seems appropriate like \u201cAccess,\u201d \u201cInternal Project,\u201d \u201cPurchase,\u201d or \u201cStorage.\u201d**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking the best category here might be \"Hardware,\" as it relates to switch and network hardware issues. However, I also wonder if it should be \"Internal Project\" if this is a change request. Since the text indicates it's about network performance problems caused by high latency and packet loss, \"Hardware\" really seems to fit best. I\u2019ll output in JSON format, ensuring it matches exactly: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"} \n\nSince the user asked to categorize the ticket, I\u2019ll respond with that category only.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
