While \"Administrative rights\" could apply if granting specific admin access, the request suggests they want to add someone, possibly as a substitute, related to colleagues' absences. Since it\u2019s about adding a member, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" Now, I\u2019ll create a JSON-like object with the category field.**Creating the category response**\n\nThe prompt gives a category schema that requires a JSON object with a \"category\" string. I need to format my output like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's crucial that the value matches exactly one of the enumerated options, and \"Access\" fits perfectly! \n\nWhile adding a brief explanation could be nice, the instructions emphasize just providing the category in the specified format. So, I'll stick with the JSON object. Here\u2019s the final output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let\u2019s deliver that!"
