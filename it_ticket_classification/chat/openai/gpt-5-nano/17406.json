The options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Since it mentions a \"starter form,\" it seems to fit best in the \"HR Support\" category. However, if it's also about access provisioning, \"Access\" might apply too. Overall, \u201cHR Support\u201d seems most appropriate.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI see the task involves filling out a starter form for onboarding a new employee. The relevant categories are \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Internal Project.\" Given that the request includes \"new starter\" and \"starter form,\" it fits best into \"HR Support\" since it's related to onboarding paperwork. Though \"Administrative rights\" could be a consideration, it doesn't apply here. I'll structure my response as a JSON object to categorize this ticket accurately. The output should be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
