The ticket discusses removing a forwarder from Martinez's mailbox and mentions offboarding issues. \n\nIt seems related to mailbox permissions and possibly administrative tasks. I think it fits either the \"Access\" category, which involves permissions to the mailbox, or \"Administrative rights.\" Since it concerns configuring an email forwarder, it might lean more towards \"Access.\" So, I'll assign it to either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe request is to remove a forwarder from a user's mailbox, which falls under mailbox access management. It seems that \"Access\" is the most suitable category since it's not about hardware or storage. Yet, it could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" because modifying mailbox settings is an admin task. However, this task feels more like a standard IT admin issue rather than granting access for an internal project. Thus, I'll go with \"Access\" as the best fit for this ticket.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
