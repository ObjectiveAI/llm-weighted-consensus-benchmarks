I see references to \"grade proposals,\" \"assistance,\" and \"approval flows,\" which indicate it's likely about access and HR processes. The terms like \"set approver for some employees\" suggest it could fit into categories like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"HR Support.\" There's a lot of HR language involved, so it's essential to classify it accurately!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe system has specific categories, and I need to select the closest one. The phrases about \"approval flows\" and \"set approver for some employees\" suggest it's related to access rights, which points to \"Access.\" There's also a mention of \"grade proposals\" and a vague request for data, but these seem secondary. Ultimately, since the ticket focuses on approver roles and permissions, I'll categorize it as \"Access\" and format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Access\"}.**Formatting response as JSON**\n\nThe system specifies that my response should be a JSON object with a \"category\" field. It\u2019s clear that I need to adhere to valid channels that require this format. So, I\u2019ll keep it simple and just output: {\"category\": \"Access\"} with no extra text. That way, it aligns perfectly with the requirements. Let's go ahead and do that!"
