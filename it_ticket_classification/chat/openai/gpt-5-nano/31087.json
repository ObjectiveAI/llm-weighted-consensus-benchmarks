This phrase feels a bit jumbled! I'll need to find the most fitting category from options like \"HR Support,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Categorizing IT requests**\n\nIt seems the user is asking about assigning something to the \"Wednesday PM project\" or scheduling a task for Wednesday afternoon. They might want to receive annual leave requests for PM, and \"pm level\" could mean project management level? This sounds like it might relate to scheduling tasks or HR time off requests. Since \"annual leave requests\" pertains to HR, the best category appears to be \"HR Support,\" even though it's in an IT system.**Deciding ticket category**\n\nI'm thinking about the user\u2019s ticket and whether \"Administrative rights\" relates to granting permissions for leave requests, but that doesn\u2019t fit. \"Internal Project\" could be for \"project Wednesday PM,\" yet it feels uncertain. The user asks us to categorize the IT ticket, so I\u2019ll need to output a structured JSON object that specifies the category. Based on the content mentioning \"annual leave requests,\" it seems clear that \"HR Support\" is the right choice. I'll finalize it as:  \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
