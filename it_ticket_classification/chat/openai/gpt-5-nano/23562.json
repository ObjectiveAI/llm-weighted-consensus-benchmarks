It seems to touch on aspects like servers, resources, storage, and access, so I'm considering multiple categories. The mention of \"remote rights user capability\" could suggest it's about access, and \"administrative rights\" is noted too. Overall, the ticket seems to fit into categories like Access, Internal Project, or even Hardware. Let\u2019s figure out the best fit!**Selecting the right category**\n\nI need to choose the best category for this ticket focused on provisioning testing environments, which involves hardware, virtual machines, and related aspects like \u201cphysical machines\u201d and \u201cremote rights.\u201d It mentions storage costs, so it might fit the Storage category, but the core is about Internal Projects related to client testing. While \u201cremote rights user capability\u201d is mentioned, it doesn\u2019t seem to lean towards Access. It looks like Internal Project is the most fitting option here!**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions \"remote rights user capability,\" but it doesn't explicitly request admin rights. It focuses on setting up resources for \"physical machines\" and environments, which suggests it fits best under Internal Project due to the reference to \"client portal testing environments.\" I\u2019ll provide a JSON-like output as required. The correct format is {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, and I\u2019ll ensure proper capitalization matches. So, I\u2019ll respond with that one-liner JSON output."
