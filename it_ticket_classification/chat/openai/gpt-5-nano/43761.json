The categories available include \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights.\" The content suggests it relates to approval workflows, possibly falling under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it's about permissions. Given the focus on approval lists and contracts needing approval, it seems most fitting to categorize it as \"Access.\"**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe message highlights issues like \"approval list not working\" and \"contracts need approval.\" This suggests it's related to workflow permissions and audit processes. I think it's best to categorize this as \"Access\" since it deals with access control or approval workflows. It could be \"Internal Project\", but \"Access\" feels safer. I'll format the output as JSON, specifically: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Even though explaining isn't necessary, I'll keep it simple and stick to providing just the JSON. Let's finalize that!"
