It mentions things like \"rejected,\" \"approved,\" and \"leave approval process.\" This seems clearly related to HR, so I\u2019m thinking it falls under \"HR Support.\" \n\nWhile \"Administrative rights\" might pertain to permissions, the content leans more towards HR-related issues. Overall, this ticket is about leave requests and should be classified as HR Support.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
