The user reported issues with tests returning blank outputs, which might suggest it's related to software testing. The ticket could fit under \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but not \"Hardware.\" Since they're testers and the issue concerns test results, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. I'll output the category in JSON format now.**Evaluating Ticket Category**\n\nI'm looking at the category options, and \"Internal Project\" seems to fit well since this ticket is about a bug in an internal project. While \"Miscellaneous\" is another option if things aren't clear, the phrase \"issue ... when trying to execute any tests obtain blank\" indicates a problem during test execution. There\u2019s no \"Software\" category, but since this is about testing, I think \"Internal Project\" is the most plausible choice here.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the category for this IT ticket, thinking that \"Internal Project\" fits issues within a specific project. However, the mention of colleagues having the same issue indicates it might be a project-wide problem. \"Miscellaneous\" could suit if things are unclear. Since the user just asked to categorize it, I think it's safer to go with \"Miscellaneous,\" as the problem is about tests being blank, not hardware or access-related. So, I\u2019ll respond with JSON: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
