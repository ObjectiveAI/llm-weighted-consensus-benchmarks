Since the key terms revolve around errors encountered when trying to sign in, I'm leaning toward categorizing this ticket as \"Access.\" It seems to fit best with the details provided.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI have available categories to choose from. The user's description hints at a login or access issue, particularly with the \"sign button\" error, suggesting there's a problem with authentication. It could relate to access or permissions, and the mention of \"oracle\" might refer to an Oracle product or database. Since this sounds like a recurring issue, I believe categorizing this ticket as \"Access\" would be the most appropriate choice based on the information provided.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nThe user is asking for a category for the ticket, and I need to respond with a JSON object that matches the specified format. The correct category based on the description is \"Access,\" given the mention of the \"sign button\" implying an authentication issue. I need to ensure I include the top-level structure as specified, which should be an object containing the \"category\" field. So, I\u2019ll respond with:\n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":\"Access\"}}.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI realize the user just wants me to categorize the IT ticket, so I need to provide the appropriate JSON output. The correct response is simply {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It's essential that I only give the category without any extra text, as the user specifically requested the categorization. So, I'll make sure my output is clear and concise, sticking to the required format! Here goes: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
