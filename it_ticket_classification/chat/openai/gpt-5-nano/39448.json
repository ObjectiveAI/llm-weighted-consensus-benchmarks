The user mentioned an issue with Oracle regarding maintaining absence records, specifically about annual leave and approval notifications from a line manager.\n\nIt looks like there are problems with notifications not being sent and past requests being approved but the latest one is not. Since it\u2019s related to HR leave management, the closest category is \"HR Support,\" as it covers HR processes like absence records and leave approvals.**Defining JSON Response**\n\nI'm working on categorizing this ticket. \"Access\" could relate to notification access, but the main issue is with the Oracle software for absence records. So, I\u2019m deciding on \"HR Support\" for the category.\n\nNow, I see that I need to respond with a JSON object, using the schema provided. It looks like I should just include the category as a field. This means I\u2019d return: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It seems best to stick with just that to meet the prompt's requirements.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
