The text mentions \"special leave\" and \"HR,\" which suggests it's about leave policies. Specifically, I'll select \"HR Support\" as the category since it best fits the content and doesn't relate to hardware or the other categories. I need to format my response as a JSON object with the \"category\" field indicating this choice. Let's proceed with that!**Choosing Category Format**\n\nI see that the system specifies a schema for a category JSON object, which includes options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and more. Since the ticket relates to leave and has HR elements, I need to respond with \"HR Support.\" \n\nI realize that it\u2019s important to follow the instruction strictly and only include the category. So, I'll format my response correctly: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. No extra text is necessary. Let's keep it clear and concise!"
