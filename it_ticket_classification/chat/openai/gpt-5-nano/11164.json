The user is asking me to classify it, and it mentions SSL/TLS certificate management, server certificate details, and SAN entries. However, the available categories don\u2019t directly include relevant terms like \"Networking\" or \"Security.\" The most fitting options seem to be \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or possibly \"Purchase,\" since it involves procuring a certificate. I'll lean towards \"Purchase\" if it\u2019s about acquiring the certificate.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm piecing together the meaning of the phrasing \"please order raised.\" It seems like it indicates that an order was placed, which leads me to think the ticket is about obtaining a certificate. The \"Purchase\" category looks like the best fit here. I also considered \"Internal Project\" due to infrastructure changes, but since that category might focus more on internal tasks, I'll lean toward \"Purchase.\" Though \"Miscellaneous\" could apply, \"Purchase\" feels like the most accurate choice. I\u2019ll categorize it accordingly in JSON format.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object like {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. However, I've also been thinking about whether \"Internal Project\" might be a more fitting category due to its focus on certificate installation across multiple hosts. The user specifically asked for a categorization, and while the case could be made for \"Internal Project,\" the ticket clearly suggests procurement with the phrase \"please order raised.\" Given this, I'll stick with \"Purchase\" as the most straightforward option for now.**Evaluating category choice**\n\nI've been thinking that \"Internal Project\" might be more appropriate since this ticket relates to an internal infrastructure update for certificates. While the phrase \"please order raised\" suggests procurement, the ticket details things like SAN entries and wildcard certificates, which point toward a technical task. Considering the allowed values, \"Internal Project\" still feels like the best fit, but I can't ignore that \"Purchase\" aligns closely with the ordering aspect. I need to weigh which option reflects the ticket's essence more accurately.**Finalizing the JSON response**\n\nThe ticket clearly revolves around obtaining a new certificate, and the phrase \"order raised\" implies a procurement step, which leads me to consider the \"Purchase\" category. The user mentioning \"order raised\" suggests an existing order, which could complicate things, but I think it's pretty clear that it aligns with procurement. Given this, I'll format my response as a JSON object with {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} to fit the system's requirements. There's no need for extra text; just the category output."
