It seems to involve IT systems and meeting room scheduling, possibly falling under \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Access.\" I'll need to decide which category fits best!**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI see that \"Internal Project\" could really fit since the ticket is about system integration and testing, rather than hardware failure. It mentions devices, tablets, and meeting room issues related to calendar and sound. It could potentially fall under \"Miscellaneous\" too, but given the focus on integration, I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project.\" Even though there's mention of calendars and invites, it doesn't seem like access control is the main concern. So, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best choice here!**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI'm looking at the other categories now. \"Administrative rights\" and \"Storage\" don't seem relevant. \"Purchase\" is off the table, too. While \"Hardware\" could apply since there are devices involved, the ticket really focuses on integration and calendar issues more than hardware failure. \"Miscellaneous\" is an option for anything else, but I think \"Internal Project\" fits best since it relates to system integration. I can respond with a JSON object specifying \"category\": \"Internal Project.\"{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
