The text has phrases like \"new starter\" and \"starter form,\" which suggests it relates to employee onboarding. I\u2019m considering categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The mention of a form being attached points strongly toward \"HR Support,\" as it seems specifically about onboarding a new employee. Overall, I'll likely categorize it as \"HR Support\" since that fits best.**Defining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering the categories for the IT ticket: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The mention of an onboarding form suggests it fits best within \"HR Support.\" While it could relate to access rights, there's no clear request for that, just a form to fill out. Therefore, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"HR Support\" and prepare to respond with a JSON object saying: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. That's the response I'll provide!**Ensuring Proper Format**\n\nI need to make sure that the case matches perfectly for \"HR Support\" since it\u2019s one of the enumerated values. It must include the space and formatting exactly as defined. So, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I won't include any extra text, just the required output. Keeping things clear and precise is important here! That's my final response."
