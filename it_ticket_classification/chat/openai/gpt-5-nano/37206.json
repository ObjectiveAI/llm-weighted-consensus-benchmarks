It looks like the user is experiencing an access issue. Among the options like \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and \"Internal Project,\" I think \"Access\" is the best fit. It doesn't seem related to hardware or storage, so categorizing it as \"Access\" seems most appropriate. I\u2019ll format my response in JSON with the category field accordingly.**Formatting response in JSON**\n\nI need to provide a JSON object with the category based on the user's ticket about an access issue. The format dictates that I include \"category\" as a string. Given the ticket text, which mentions a problem accessing \"hi since yesterday,\" it appears to center around an access issue. While there is a mention of \"Administrative rights,\" the text doesn't specify those rights, so I feel \u201cAccess\u201d is the best choice. I\u2019ll format it as {\"category\":\"Access\"} and deliver it."
