Given the mention of \"codes\" and an attachment, I think \"Internal Project\" makes the most sense since it relates to programming codes. Other categories like \"Administrative rights\" don't seem to apply.**Parsing ticket categories**\n\nLet\u2019s go through the categories for this IT ticket: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket message is quite ambiguous, mentioning codes and an attachment. It doesn\u2019t indicate anything related to hardware, storage, or purchase. While \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if it's about needing permissions, it doesn't seem to fit well. I'll categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it relates to code creation. Now, I need to format my output correctly.**Providing category in JSON**\n\nI see that I need to provide a category in a specific JSON format. The schema indicates that the response should have a \"category\" property with values from a given list. Based on the ticket content, it seems that \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category given the references to codes and the user\u2019s role. I\u2019ll format my output simply as: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} without any additional text or formatting, as instructed. Let's do that!"
