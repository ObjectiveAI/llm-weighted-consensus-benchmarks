The closest match from the list is \"HR Support,\" despite \"HR\" not being explicitly mentioned. I should respond with a JSON object that includes the category as \"HR Support.\" So, I\u2019ll ensure to format it correctly as instructed.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the schema provided and confirming that I need to output a JSON object. The required format specifies including the category as a string. I\u2019m leaning towards \"HR Support\" because it relates to the content about probation notifications. Although \"Access\" could be a consideration due to the mention of reminders, it doesn't directly fit. So, I\u2019ll finalize the JSON output as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} with no extra text."
