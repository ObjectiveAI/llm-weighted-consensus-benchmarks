I should format my output as JSON, ensuring it includes the correct \u201ccategory\u201d string enum. Let\u2019s go with that and get it ready for the system!**Responding with JSON**\n\nI need to respond with the JSON format indicating the category as \"Access.\" The ticket asks for access to Confluence, so it\u2019s definitely an access request. The required output is a JSON object, and I want to make this clear and straightforward. The schema for the response specifies the structure, but ultimately, I should stick to providing just the category. So I'll keep it simple and respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Delivering IT Ticket Response**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, so I just need to provide the category. In this case, it\u2019s clear that the category is \"Access.\" Therefore, I'll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Keeping it straightforward ensures clarity for the user.
