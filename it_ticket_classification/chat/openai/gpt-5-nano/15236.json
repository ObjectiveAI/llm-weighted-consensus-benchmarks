The user included a lot about \"initiative shaping,\" budgeting, and project management details, which points to an internal project management task. It looks like it primarily fits into the \"Internal Project\" category. Although there\u2019s mention of \"setup form\" that might tempt me to consider \"Administrative rights,\" it\u2019s still centered on project management elements like \"proposal\" and \"backlog.\" I'll go with \"Internal Project.\"**Formatting Output**\n\nThe prompt specifies valid channels: analysis and final, along with a category field that uses a string enum. I just need to provide the JSON object in the correct format. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It\u2019s clear that this is the required JSON structure, and I\u2019ll stick to just providing that without any extra commentary. Let\u2019s keep it simple and precise!"
