The phrasing in the request is a bit unclear, but it suggests modifying user access. I will see if it fits under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" for ticket categorization. The next step is to output a JSON object that includes the appropriate category. It sounds like it definitely involves user access modifications.**Selecting category for IT ticket**\n\nI need to select a fitting category for an IT ticket regarding removing users, which involves managing access rights. \"Administrative rights\" seems appropriate but might be too specific compared to \"Access,\" which focuses on access control tasks. The phrase about modifying addresses suggests user departures, potentially hinting at \"HR Support.\" However, since it's an IT task for offboarding, categorizing it as \"Access\" makes sense. So, I'll respond with a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Outputting JSON for IT ticket**\n\nI see that the specific phrasing \"remove four team members from four members\" isn't crucial here. My main focus should be on generating the necessary JSON response without adding any extra text. I\u2019ll keep it simple and direct, ensuring clarity and precision. So, I\u2019ll provide the JSON as is, following the task requirements. Let's finalize that response without any fluff!"
