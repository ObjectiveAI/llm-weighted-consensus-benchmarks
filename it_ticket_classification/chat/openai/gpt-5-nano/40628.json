It seems like a request for investigation regarding a problem with their leave data entry. The main focus is on HR-related issues, so it looks like this could fit under \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" I\u2019m leaning towards \"HR Support\" since it deals with leave data in Oracle.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket as \"HR Support\" since it's related to absence leave data in Oracle. The issue seems to be with incorrect leave hours that need investigation. Since \"HR Support\" is one of the allowed categories, it fits perfectly. I'll make sure to respond with the exact JSON format required: the category property has to be a string from the specified options. So, I will output:  \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
