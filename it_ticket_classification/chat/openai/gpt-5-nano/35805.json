Initially, I considered \"Administrative rights\" but it seems more related to upgrading systems. It might fit as \"Internal Project\" since it's about an update process. However, it could also potentially relate to \"Storage.\" I'll lean towards \"Internal Project\" for categorization.**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nThis ticket is about the forced upgrade process that automatically starts on workstations, indicating an IT deployment project. I consider categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" since that aligns best, though \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it involves admin permissions. Ultimately, I\u2019ll choose \"Internal Project\" as the category. The final JSON object follows the provided schema exactly, so it will be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I'll ensure there's no extra commentary in the output."
