The options include categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Miscellaneous.\" Given that it's about cables connecting a computer and a TV, it likely falls under \"Hardware.\" However, if it's more about guidance rather than a hardware issue, \"Miscellaneous\" could work too. Ultimately, \"Hardware\" seems to be the best fit for this ticket.**Categorizing IT ticket request**\n\nThis ticket involves the removal of cables in a meeting room. The user mentions \"meeting room cable removal\" and that the cables connect a computer and TV, which seems confusing. Since the request is likely about hardware, I should categorize it accordingly. The required format is a JSON object. I\u2019ll classify it under \"Hardware,\" but I could see \"Miscellaneous\" being suitable if it\u2019s not strictly about hardware management. So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Categorizing IT ticket request**\n\nThe message indicates a request to remove or organize cables in a meeting room connecting a computer and TV. This sounds like a hardware issue, so \"Hardware\" seems to be the appropriate category. I need to respond with a JSON object specifically for the category field, following the prompt. I'll keep it concise with no extra text and ensure there's no unnecessary whitespace. The final output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
