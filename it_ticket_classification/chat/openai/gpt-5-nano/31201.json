The ticket talks about vacation visibility, leave approvals, and absence schedules, which seems HR-related. It fits best under \"HR Support\" since it involves vacation management. While \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" might apply if it were about restricted system access, it\u2019s more about HR systems. So, I'll classify it under \"HR Support,\" which is indeed listed.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
