The user mentioned ordering a numeric keyboard, so the most fitting categories from the list are \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" Since the focus is on ordering, it leans more towards \"Purchase.\" In general IT helpdesk taxonomy, a hardware request usually falls under purchase as well. The ticket definitely falls into the \"Purchase\" category because it\u2019s specifically about ordering the hardware.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm trying to categorize an IT ticket about a request for a numeric keyboard. The instructions specify I should output a JSON object with a \"category\" field. The ticket content is a bit unclear, but it boils down to a request for ordering a numeric keypad. Given the context of ordering equipment, I should select \"Purchase\" since that aligns with procurement. \"Hardware\" could work too, but since \"Purchase\" is available, it seems like the best choice.**Finalizing IT ticket response**\n\nThe line \"by ordering numeric keyboard\" makes it clear this is about procurement. In typical IT ticket taxonomy, I categorize \"Hardware\" for equipment requests and \"Purchase\" for ordering. Since this request is for ordering, I should definitely choose \"Purchase.\" \n\nMy final response will be concise and formatted correctly: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll keep it simple and straightforward, just as the system expects with no extra commentary. Let\u2019s deliver this!"
