The phrase \"Administrative rights\" likely refers to permissions associated with sharing the doc. From what I'm gathering, it\u2019s about coordinating feedback on Tuesday and asking everyone to either accept or decline, so I'll categorize this as \"Access,\" given the context of granting access rights.**Delivering a concise response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that categorizes this IT ticket. The category is straightforward: \"Access.\" Based on the instruction, I should keep the response concise and follow the JSON schema provided. It seems the best approach is to output just the category without additional explanations, as the instructions don't ask for that. So, I'll deliver: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That's clear and to the point!"
