It could be \"Access\" since it involves access rights. There\u2019s also \"Administrative rights,\" but since the user is asking to \"add all to security\" and wants to keep other details the same, it leans more towards \"Access\" related to access control. The phrase is a bit ambiguous, though. But since it focuses on user access, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" I need to ensure the output fits in a JSON format.**Preparing category response**\n\nThe system indicates that I should provide a JSON object for the category classification. The valid categories are specified. Since the ticket fits best under \"Access,\" I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s essential to ensure that the formatting matches the schema exactly, so I'll maintain minimal text in the response, just giving the category output. So, I'll go ahead and present the output as follows: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
