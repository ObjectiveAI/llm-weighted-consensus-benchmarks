The user's text is a bit jumbled but mentions creating a data analysis team, modifying client ownership, and infrastructure changes. It seems to focus on internal processes and adjustments regarding team and client management. Given these elements, I think the most fitting category would be \"Internal Project\" since it relates to team organization and infrastructure management.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m seeing that the ticket is primarily about administrative rights and ownership changes, which could fit into the \"Administrative rights\" category. It discusses modifying client ownership and adding owners, suggesting it deals with access control. Both \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" could work, but \"Administrative rights\" seems more precise for this case since it directly relates to rights regarding ownership. So, let\u2019s go with \"Administrative rights\" for clarity.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
