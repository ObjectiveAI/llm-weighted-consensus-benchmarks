The ticket contains a long, messy text mentioning a \"critical peer session down\" and refers to routers and network issues. It talks about a primary router problem and includes specific details on the device and potential causes. Given this content, I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Hardware\" or possibly \"Networking.\"**Confirming category output**\n\nThe allowed categories for this IT ticket are limited to Hardware, HR Support, Access, and a few others. Since this is a networking issue involving routers, the appropriate category is likely \"Hardware.\" I need to output a JSON object specifying this. The instruction shows the required format, so I will confirm that I provide only the necessary JSON response without any extra text. \n\nHere\u2019s the formatted output: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}."
