The user mentions multiple issues, making it clear that this relates to network connectivity and potentially hardware or access problems. The best fitting categories could be \u201cHardware,\u201d \u201cAccess,\u201d or \u201cMiscellaneous.\u201d Since it primarily deals with the server not showing on the network, I think \u201cHardware\u201d seems like the most appropriate choice.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm assessing the best category for this IT ticket. Given that it describes a server issue related to connectivity after an outage, \"Hardware\" seems most fitting as it deals with physical server problems. While \"Internal Project\" might apply if it's part of a project, this ticket focuses on network discovery, so \"Hardware\" feels right. The response should be a simple JSON object stating: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, without any extra text, ensuring it\u2019s valid JSON.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about whether \"Access\" might fit better, since it\u2019s about network presence. However, the main issue seems to stem from the server not appearing on the network, likely due to a hardware outage. The ticket clearly states that the \"test server does not appear on the network after an electrical outage,\" suggesting it's a hardware-related problem and not just a network discovery issue. So, I think \"Hardware\" is definitely the most appropriate category. Time to respond!"
