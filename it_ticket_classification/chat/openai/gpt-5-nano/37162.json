I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Storage\" and prepare the category object accordingly.**Outputting JSON Format**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object for categorizing the IT ticket. The prompt clearly asks for a specific format with a \"category\" field, so my response should be straightforward, like {\"category\":\"Storage\"}.\n\nThere's a bit of a dilemma since it could also relate to \"Purchase\" due to the mention of needing an extra drive, but the core issue is definitely storage. The storage category seems to cover it best, so I'll stick with that for clarity.**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nI need to pick the most precise category for the IT ticket. The prompt clearly indicates to categorize the issue, and \"Storage\" seems like the best fit. Since I have to choose one category, I\u2019ll go with \"Storage.\" \n\nTo respond properly, I'll format it correctly and say: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. That should provide a clear answer! Let\u2019s finalize it."
