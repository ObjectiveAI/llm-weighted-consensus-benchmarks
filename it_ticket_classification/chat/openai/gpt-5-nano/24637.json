The available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The ticket text seems to indicate a password reset request, possibly involving changing the PC password. Given the high importance mentioned, it seems most like an Access issue because it centers around accessing an account. However, it could fit in Administrative Rights if admin privileges are needed. Overall, Access seems the most plausible category.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI'll categorize the ticket as \"Access.\" The prompt specifically asks to respond with a JSON object for the category. So, that means I need to ensure the format is correct. I think the correct response should be `{\"category\":\"Access\"}` because it focuses on password reset rather than administrative rights, which is less relevant here. I'll omit any additional notes since the output should strictly follow the format requested. Let's go ahead and finalize this response!"
