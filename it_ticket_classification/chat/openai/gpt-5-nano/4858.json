I should decide on the category soon!**Assessing IT ticket categories**\n\nIn triaging this IT ticket, \"terminal\" could refer to either software or hardware. The message suggests a request to add a terminal, with \"technical tester\" possibly indicating a role involved. I could categorize this as \"Internal Project,\" as it seems project-related. However, if it's about granting access, it might fit \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since there's no explicit mention of access privileges, \"Internal Project\" feels like the safest choice, or even \"Miscellaneous\" if it's too unclear.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nI need to respond with a categorized answer in a specific format, like a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. The request is to categorize the IT ticket. I should ensure the output aligns with system instructions, which list allowed values. However, if the ticket concerns adding terminal access, \"Administrative rights\" might fit better. The phrase \"terminal technical tester\" suggests it's about providing access for a technical tester. It could relate to a device or software terminal as well. I'll decide soon!**Parsing IT ticket request**\n\nLet's take a closer look at this request: \"add terminal to add terminal hello received terminal please add other old ones terminal technical tester.\" It seems they want to add a terminal, possibly to a list for testing. There\u2019s no mention of access or admin rights, making \"Internal Project\" a fitting category for this task. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Internal Project\" and respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I might also consider adding a brief note, but the main focus is on delivering the JSON."
