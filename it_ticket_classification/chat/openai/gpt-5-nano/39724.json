It mentions employees who started work but might not be reflected as active. The user seems to be asking for investigation, indicating this relates to access or HR support. The issue doesn\u2019t fall under hardware or purchase categories. Based on the context, it looks like this ticket fits best under \u201cAccess.\u201d I\u2019ll output the category in JSON format.**Identifying Access Issue**\n\nI'm tackling the issue of new starters not being active in the system, which likely relates to account activation or access provisioning. The mention of \"planning officer ext\" suggests a request for investigation related to this access issue. Therefore, I believe the appropriate category is \u201cAccess.\u201d I need to return the answer in JSON format with just the category. The expected output should be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Keeping it simple and precise is the best approach here.**Delivering Access Category**\n\nI\u2019m following the instruction to provide a JSON output, specifically {\"category\":\"Access\"}, since it fits the context of new starter accounts not being active, likely related to EEL as a system. It\u2019s important that I stick to the requirements and avoid any extra commentary. By keeping it concise and precise, I can ensure clarity. So, I\u2019m ready to deliver just the JSON output as instructed!"
