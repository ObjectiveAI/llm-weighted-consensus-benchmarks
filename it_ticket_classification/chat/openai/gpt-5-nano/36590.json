It looks like it primarily concerns access or permissions, as they're unable to assign tasks during a change process. Given the available categories, I think it fits best under either \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" I\u2019ll need to decide which category more accurately fits the user's problem.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe issue is about assigning tasks to a user when creating a change, which falls under permissions management. I\u2019m thinking that \"Access\" is the most suitable category, as it directly relates to user access rights. While \"Administrative rights\" pertains to system privileges, it feels broader. The user requested a JSON object for this categorization, so I\u2019ll need to ensure the output matches the required format with minimal trailing spaces. I\u2019ll respond with: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`."
