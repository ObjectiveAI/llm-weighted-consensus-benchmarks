It sounds like an IT access deprovision for an employee leaving. \n\nConsidering the content is about account rights being removed, the best fit is \"Access.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, \"Access\" is more specific to this case. I'll ensure to output in the specified JSON format.**Generating JSON Output**\n\nThe required output format is a JSON-like object containing a \"category\" field. Based on the prompt, I need to return a JSON object with \"category\": \"Access\" as the most suitable option. I have to ensure it matches the specified enum string. \n\nTherefore, I will return: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to avoid adding any extra text and ensure it\u2019s valid JSON, so the top-level remains an object with just the category property. Let's keep it simple and direct!"
