The category object must have a type and be in the right format. So, I need to output a JSON object using the \u201ccategory\u201d property, ensuring it matches what they provided. The final response should be concise, focusing on what they asked for. I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nI notice some might be concerned about classifying terms like \"rd party,\" \"endpoint,\" or \"screen error\" \u2014 those could fit into categories like \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" However, after considering all options, I think \"Access\" is indeed the most fitting category. So I\u2019m ready to finalize my choice and go ahead with that. Keeping it clear and straightforward is key here!"
