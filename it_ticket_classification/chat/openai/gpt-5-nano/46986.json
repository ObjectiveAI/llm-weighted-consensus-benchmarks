The ticket describes a problem with an expense report not being viewable by the line manager, indicating an access issue. I'll consider the categories available: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given that it specifically mentions the line manager's inability to view the report for approval, the most fitting category is \"Access.\" That seems to cover it well!**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nI realize it could also fit under \"Administrative rights\" if they require higher privileges to view or approve the report. However, the ticket is primarily about the line manager being unable to view the expense report, making \"Access\" the most appropriate category. The instructions indicate that I should respond with a JSON object. So, I need to format it properly as {\"category\":\"Access\"} and ensure there's no extra text. I'll finalize that now!"
