I'll think through what the ticket is about and see which category it aligns with best. Alright, let's get started on categorizing appropriately!**Analyzing messy ticket text**\n\nI have a long and somewhat convoluted ticket discussing a root cause for multiple polls being down on a specific Tuesday in December. Key points include a physical machine restart, remote control issues, and the need for investigation. It's messy, but at its core, it's about troubleshooting a significant issue involving multiple assets. I need to distill this down to the main concerns for proper categorization and ensure the right team addresses it. Let's tackle this!**Determining ticket category**\n\nThis ticket doesn't seem to clearly fit into hardware installation or procurement. The mention of a \"physical machine restart\" hints at hardware, but it\u2019s more about incident management regarding down polls. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and potentially \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights\" due to remote control aspects. Since the ticket is centered on an IT issue with multiple assets, I'll need to categorize it effectively. I should aim to create a JSON-like structure with clear category values. Let\u2019s figure this out!**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nI think I should output the category as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, since it includes a \"physical machine restart.\" However, there\u2019s a possibility for \"Internal Project\" or even \"Administrative rights\" due to the remote control aspect. Yet, there's no clear indication of permissions. The main issue revolves around \"multiple polls down,\" which hints at system failure. It\u2019s a bit ambiguous, though! Maybe \"Miscellaneous\" would be safer for uncertain cases. I\u2019ll stick with \"Hardware\" for now!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
