The phrases \"pre sales code\" and \"please ensure codes related assigned him\" suggest it might involve access or permissions for a person. I think the best category is \"Access,\" although it could also fit under \"Administrative rights.\"**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nI'm analyzing a sentence that mentions changing a \"PM,\" which likely refers to a project manager. The phrasing suggests that the assembly team has handed over codes to someone, implying we need to ensure these codes are assigned to him. This indicates an access management issue, pointing me toward the \"Access\" category. Alternatively, it could fit under \"Internal Project\" if it relates to an internal project. But due to the context, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
