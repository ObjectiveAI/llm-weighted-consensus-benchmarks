The potential categories are \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and a few others. The mention of \"disk space needed\" and \"require storage\" suggests it's related to storage issues, but since hard drives are hardware, it could fit in that category too. However, the focus seems more on storage needs, so I'm leaning towards \"Storage\" as the appropriate choice.The content clearly indicates a focus on storage space requirements rather than hardware purchases. The phrase \"transferred hard drive amount\" may refer to the number of hard drives moved, but it\u2019s still appropriate to categorize this ticket as \"Storage.\" I need to follow the request to respond in JSON format, specifically {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. It\u2019s essential to present it exactly as specified without adding any extra text."
