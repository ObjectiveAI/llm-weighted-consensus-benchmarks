It might be best categorized as \"Miscellaneous\" since everything feels a bit unclear. The \"Administrative rights\" category could fit if there were discussions about access rights, but I'm not so sure about that. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object clarifying the category as \"Miscellaneous.\u201d I\u2019ll format it correctly to follow the required schema.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
