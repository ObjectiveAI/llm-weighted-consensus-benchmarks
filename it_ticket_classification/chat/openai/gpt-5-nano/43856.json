I'll choose a category from options like Hardware, HR Support, and Access. The ticket mentions issues connecting, needing keys, and updated credentials. It seems like this is primarily about access and connectivity. So, my best guess is that the appropriate category is Access. I don't think it's a Hardware issue since it relates more to login and credentials.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
