They mentioned a monitor and adapter, which seems related to hardware. The available categories include \"Hardware,\" \"Purchase,\" and others. Since the request involves a monitor and equipment, my best guess is that \"Hardware\" fits well. However, if they\u2019re requesting the adapter specifically, \"Purchase\" could also be relevant. I'll stick with \"Hardware\" to be safe and structure the output as a JSON object accordingly.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe message indicates that the user found a monitor and wants an adapter, pointing to a hardware issue and potentially a purchase request. \"Hardware\" seems like the most fitting category since it relates directly to the monitor and adapter. Options like \"Internal Project\" and \"Administrative rights\" don\u2019t apply here. I need to produce a JSON object with the category specified. The required format will be {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, adhering to the provided schema and keeping the response plain.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
