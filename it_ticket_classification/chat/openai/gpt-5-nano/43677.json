Therefore, I'll categorize this ticket under \"Hardware.\" \n\nNow, I need to respond with a JSON object containing this category.  The format will be: {\"category\": \"Hardware\"}. That should work perfectly!**Finalizing the response**\n\nI need to output the category for the IT ticket as a JSON object. The appropriate category is \"Hardware.\" The user may expect not just the JSON but also a textual confirmation. However, the instruction emphasizes responding with just the category in the specified format. \n\nI'll deliver the response to ensure clarity.
