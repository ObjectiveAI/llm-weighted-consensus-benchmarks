The categories to choose from include \"Hardware,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given that this pertains to a server issue, I\u2019m thinking \"Hardware\" may be the best fit since it refers to a physical server. However, it also could be something related to service or software. I\u2019ll aim to decide on the most suitable category for this ticket.**Finalizing the category selection**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize an IT ticket and whether to label it as \"Internal Project\" or \"Hardware.\" Since the user mentioned a server issue and \"restart,\" this leans more towards \"Hardware,\" as server problems typically relate to hardware infrastructure. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too vague. I'll respond using the required JSON format specifically for the \"Hardware\" category, keeping it simple and clear, since that seems to be the best fit for this situation.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI see that I need to respond with a JSON object that includes a \"category\" field. Based on my earlier evaluation, the best category for this ticket is \"Hardware.\" So, I'll format my response as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. The instructions are clear that this should be the only output, so no extra text needs to be added. I\u2019ll finalize it just like that!"
