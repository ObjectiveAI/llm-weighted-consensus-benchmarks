However, I should consider if \"Administrative rights\" would be more specific. Ultimately, I'll choose \"Access\" for a clear response.**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nThe instructions specify that I need to output a JSON object following a particular schema. The category needs to be one of the listed options. I\u2019m thinking I should respond with {\"category\":\"Access\"} since that fits well based on our earlier analysis. I need to make sure the formatting is precise, as that's crucial. While I could ask clarifying questions, the user is clearly asking for categorization, so I\u2019ll keep it concise and just provide the JSON object as expected."
