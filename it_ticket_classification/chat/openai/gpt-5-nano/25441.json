They mentioned a \"temporary external hard drive,\" a test on a virtual machine, and a return date. This primarily relates to hardware, so I\u2019m considering either \"Hardware\" or \"Storage.\" Since it focuses on the external hard drive as a storage device, I think it fits best under \"Storage.\" However, it also involves testing, which makes it a bit tricky. I'll go with \"Storage\" for clarity!**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to categorize this IT ticket. It clearly relates to storage since the user is mentioning a \"temporary external hard drive\" intended for an experiment. While I could consider \"Hardware\" because it involves a physical device, \"Storage\" seems more accurate since it\u2019s about the functionality and use of that device. Since the ticket requests a hard drive for running tests on a virtual machine, I\u2019m deciding to categorize it as \"Storage\" and will output that in the required format.**Delivering JSON object**\n\nI\u2019m focused on categorizing the ticket based on crucial keywords like \"external hard drive,\" \"test,\" \"virtual machine,\" \"duration,\" and \"return.\" Since it\u2019s clearly about a hardware asset used for testing, the best category is \"Storage.\" I need to respond with a JSON object in the required format. I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra text and deliver it as simply as: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. Let\u2019s keep it straightforward and precise!"
