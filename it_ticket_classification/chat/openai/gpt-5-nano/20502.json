The \"Storage\" category seems to fit well since it deals with file loss or storage issues. There could also be elements of \"Access\" if there\u2019s a problem accessing the file or link. However, since the user has emphasized the lost file's high importance, I\u2019ll lean toward \"Storage\" as the best fit for this situation.**Categorizing file issues for IT support**\n\nIt looks like the user is referring to an invoicing file from December, possibly for IT support regarding a lost file. They mention something about receiving help with a similar problem before, and I think that might not be essential information. I\u2019m deciding to categorize this under \"Storage\" since it deals with file loss. Now, I'll format the response as a JSON object as required, which should clearly indicate the category as \"Storage.\"{\"category\":\"Storage\"}{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
