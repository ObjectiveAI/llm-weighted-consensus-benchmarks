The user reports opportunities are marked as waiting for approval but only shows \"won\" when opened. They want to clean up these statuses. There's no specific category for CRM, so I\u2019m thinking it could fit under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access,\" but it might also resonate with \"Administrative rights\" if permissions are involved. However, it seems more like a general cleanup issue.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIt looks like this is a bug related to the opportunities approval process in Salesforce. I\u2019m considering categorizing it under \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Access\" or \"Internal Project.\" \"Internal Project\" might work if it involves internal tools, but the user didn't clarify that. So \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d feels like the safest bet. Since the prompt asks to categorize the IT ticket, I should output a JSON response with the selected category. I'll go with:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}  \n\nBut I wonder if \"Access\" might suit better if editors are involved.**Finalizing IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nThe user wants to clean up, possibly by deleting or resetting something, but it doesn\u2019t seem related to permissions. So, \"Miscellaneous\" feels like the right choice. I think it\u2019s good to stick to what the prompt specifies, which is to only provide the category. I\u2019ll definitely follow that instruction and just respond with the category object. Here\u2019s the final output:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}  \n\nI\u2019ll skip adding suggestions since the instructions only require the category."
