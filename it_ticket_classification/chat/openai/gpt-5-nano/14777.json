It could fit into \"Storage\" since it's related to restoring data, but \"Access\" might be relevant if it's about access issues. The situation feels urgent, especially with the mention of high impact and many daily tickets. I should carefully inspect the category list to see if \"Storage\" aligns better, as it's about data restore. However, \"Access\" also concerns profile access rights.**Categorizing profile issues**\n\nThe text discusses \"profile data restore\" and \"recurring profile issues,\" without mentioning login or access denial. This points towards a user profile problem, so it aligns with data storage. Therefore, I'll categorize it under \"Storage.\" \n\nThe prompt specifies returning a JSON object, and that's straightforward. It seems best to return just that object: {\"category\": \"Storage\"}. I could possibly add a brief justification about the decision, but the instructions seem to emphasize only the category. I'll make sure to format it correctly!**Preparing the JSON output**\n\nAlright, I'm set to output: {\"category\": \"Storage\"}. However, I need to ensure it meets the schema requirements, which specifies \"type\": \"object\" and includes \"properties.\" The user's prompt earlier mentioned the schema header, so I want to keep that in mind.\n\nThe instruction clearly states to respond with a JSON object containing just the category value. I\u2019ll format my answer as {\"category\": \"Storage\"} based on the allowed categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Let\u2019s keep it concise!"
