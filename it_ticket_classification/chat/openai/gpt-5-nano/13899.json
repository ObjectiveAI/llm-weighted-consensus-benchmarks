Given the focus on \"new mouse,\" the most fitting category should be \"Hardware,\" though \u201cPurchase\u201d could also apply if they're requesting one.**Outputting category object**\n\nI need to categorize the ticket as \"Hardware.\" The prompt indicates that I should respond with a JSON-like category object. It specifies a schema for the response, with the \"category\" field required to be one of the enumerated values. \n\nWhile I see examples of simply outputting {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, the schema suggests it should adhere to a specific format as an object. So, I\u2019ll ensure to follow the instructions properly while focusing on the \"Hardware\" classification.**Validating category JSON**\n\nThe prompt provides a schema for the output, indicating a required format for the category JSON. It specifies that I should create an object with a \"category\" key, and the chosen value should be a string from the enumerated options.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I\u2019ll keep my response simple and adhere to the schema, which means I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This way, I comply with the requirements without unnecessary explanations, ensuring a valid JSON object."
