The mention of \"organization administrator\" could be tied to \"Administrative rights,\" but since the ticket focuses more on retention, \"Storage\" makes the most sense. I need to output this as a JSON object, using the schema provided, so it should look like this: {\"category\": \"Storage\"}.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
