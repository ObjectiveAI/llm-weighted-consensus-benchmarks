They\u2019re asking why a report shows as submitted even though it might not have been submitted. They mention a holiday last week and a submit button still being available, so it's clear they're concerned about the submission status of a report. Given the context, I should classify this ticket under \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d since it's related to report submission and system behavior.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT ticket. The options include \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d \u201cAccess,\u201d or \u201cInternal Project.\u201d It seems to be an issue with reporting system behavior rather than hardware or HR support. While \u201cAccess\u201d might apply due to the mention of a submit button, it\u2019s really about a UI bug. I think the best fit for this situation is \u201cMiscellaneous,\u201d so I\u2019ll output the category as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.**Following output format**\n\nI need to ensure I follow the required format for the category, which specifies how to structure my response. The system expects a JSON-like object, and it includes properties and a category enum. But wait, I think I might need to clarify what I actually need to return. In previous tasks, I've only given the category value directly. \n\nFor this request, the output should simply be: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} while considering the overall schema. I'll stick with the necessary structure to match what\u2019s being asked!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
