The ticket involves taking snapshots of Confluence servers, preserving databases for future upgrades, and logging assignments. This seems to fit into the Storage category due to its focus on backups. However, it could also be considered an Internal Project since it relates to a specific project task. The Administrative rights category might be applicable, but it\u2019s not essential here.**Outputting category in JSON**\n\nThe request is to categorize an IT Ticket with the need for a JSON output containing a category field. The valid categories include options like Hardware, HR Support, and Storage. Based on the information given, the best fit is \u201cStorage\u201d since the ticket talks about taking snapshots of Confluence servers and preserving the application database. I\u2019ll respond strictly with the required JSON object:\n\n{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
