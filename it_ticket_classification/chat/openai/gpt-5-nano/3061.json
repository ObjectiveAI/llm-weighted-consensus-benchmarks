They sent me a fragmented message mentioning a project involving \"Oracle Fusion\" and highlighting urgency. The specific terms like \"create both today,\" \"high priority,\" and \"linked subtype\" suggest this is related to an internal project. \n\nSo, after analyzing the content, I think the most fitting category from the list is \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll format this into a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m processing key phrases from the user\u2019s ticket, which include mentions of a \"new project code\" and \"Oracle Fusion.\" The urgency and requests for project setup suggest this is an \"Internal Project\" related to enterprise resource planning. While it could be a \"Purchase\" if related to costs, the project creation context signals that \"Internal Project\" fits best. There's no indication of hardware, HR, or other categories. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll respond with the category formatted like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket. Based on the analysis, I\u2019m confirming that the correct category is \"Internal Project.\" \n\nI need to make sure the JSON format is correct, following the provided instructions. The output should be a JSON object containing the category field as a string. \n\nSo, I will produce the response exactly like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. No extra commentary needed; just the clean output!"
