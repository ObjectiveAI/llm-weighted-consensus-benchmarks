So, it's safe to classify this under \"HR Support.\" I'll note that the ticket concerns timesheets, maternity leave, and personnel updates to justify my choice.**Creating JSON output**\n\nI need to deliver the output in the required JSON format. The category to return is \"HR Support.\" The prompt asked me to categorize the IT ticket, so I'll create a JSON object containing the category property. It looks like this: \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}\n\nI'll make sure to stick to the specified format without adding any extra content, just focusing on providing the category as requested. Let's get this done!"
