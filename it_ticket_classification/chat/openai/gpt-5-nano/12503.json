The string mentions a \"new purchase,\" specifically a \"purchased tv,\" which suggests it's a hardware item. There are also terms like \"log allocation\" and \"receipts section,\" indicating it's related to a purchase process. So, I see two viable categories: \"Purchase,\" since it's about purchasing, and \"Hardware,\" because it's about a TV. I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Purchase.\"**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket is about a new purchase order for a TV, which means I should categorize it under \"Purchase.\" While it does relate to hardware, as it's a TV, the categories are exclusive, and \"Hardware\" applies more to technical issues or asset management. The content mentions aspects like \"mandatory receipts section,\" indicating procurement and logging of items. So, I\u2019ll stick with \"Purchase\" as the best fit and output it in the required JSON format as {\"category\":\"Purchase.\"}{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
