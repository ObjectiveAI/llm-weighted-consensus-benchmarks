The possible categories include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" The ticket seems related to software testing, so it might fit under \"Internal Project.\" However, if it's a non-standard request, \"Miscellaneous\" could also work. I need to decide which category is the best fit.**Outputting IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize an IT ticket. Since it involves test statuses in Zephyr, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best choice. I want to ensure I format the response correctly as a JSON object. It should include the category key, looking like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll also note that the output needs to follow a specific schema as required by the instructions, which specify the format as well.**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nThe user instructed me to categorize an IT ticket, so I need to output a JSON object that identifies the category. I'll go with {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}, as it fits the context. While I could offer a brief justification, the main focus should be on keeping the output strictly as the object. The instructions allow for some leeway regarding additional info, but the primary requirement is the JSON format. So, I\u2019ll deliver that now!"
