The options I have are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Reading through the ticket, it seems to deal with procurement contracts and mapping. \"Purchase\" looks like the best fit due to its focus on procurement. However, I might also consider \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous\" if it fits better.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering the categories for this IT ticket. \"Administrative rights\" is about access, which doesn't fit here, and \"Internal Project\" isn\u2019t quite right either. \"Miscellaneous\" could work if it's unclear, but since the issue revolves around \"committed spend,\" the best option seems to be \"Purchase.\" There's no \"Procurement\" category, so I'll go with \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll formulate the response in JSON format as: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. That should be appropriate!**Delivering IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize the IT ticket, not to solve any issues. I want to keep it minimal, so I\u2019ll stick to just providing the category. However, I should note that it's related to procurement and contract mapping, even though the main focus is on categorization. Following the instructions, the final output will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019m ready to deliver that!"
