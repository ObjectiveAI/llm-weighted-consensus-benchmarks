This clearly falls under the \u201cHardware\u201d category. Since it\u2019s not related to any project or administrative rights, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object formatted correctly: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket. Based on the schema, I'll provide only the category in a JSON format. Since the issue is about a non-working phone in the conference room in Belgrade, it clearly falls under \"Hardware.\" So, I\u2019ll create the JSON object as {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It seems no additional explanations are needed because the app will likely handle the parsing. I'll finalize this output now!"
