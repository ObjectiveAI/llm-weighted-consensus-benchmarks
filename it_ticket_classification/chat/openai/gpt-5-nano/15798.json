I must ensure my output is valid JSON to match the required schema. So, I\u2019ll format my response accordingly.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket text points to a \"new purchase\" and contains terms related to purchase orders and log allocation, highlighting that it's focused on purchases. While I briefly consider other categories, like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\", they don't seem to fit as well.
