The part about \u201ckeep bouncing back senders\u201d is a bit unclear, so I might need to clarify that. Overall, it seems like a straightforward request to manage email distribution.**Mapping ticket categories**\n\nI've got a list of ticket categories, including \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. For the user's request about removing someone from a distribution list, it likely falls under \"Access\" since it involves managing access while on maternity leave. The mention of \"head id\" might refer to a Help desk ID, and \u201csenders\u201d could relate to sender IDs. So, I think the appropriate category is \"Access.\" I'll format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\": \"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
