Since the ticket specifically mentions Outlook issues on a Surface, it seems to fit best under the \"Hardware\" category, as it implies problems with the software on a Microsoft Surface device. I\u2019ll format the output as a JSON object, including the appropriate category field as specified in the prompt.**Determining the Best Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket. It could possibly fit in \"Hardware\" because it mentions a Surface device, but since the issue is really about Outlook, it feels more like a software issue. However, \"Software\" isn't a category we have. \"Access\" might apply if it were a login issue, but it isn't specified here. Given the options available, I think the best fit is \"Miscellaneous,\" as the ticket doesn't fall neatly into any specific category.**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nI could consider \"Hardware\" since the ticket mentions Surface, but the real issue is with Outlook, not hardware. So, the safest default is to go with \"Miscellaneous.\" I need to format the output as a JSON object, specifically following the required schema. It looks like I should output something like {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"} since the text doesn't discuss access issues for Outlook. It will just be a straightforward response as a JSON object."
