It contains a garbled message mentioning a \"new project code,\" \"attached code form,\" and \"planned holiday return.\" I'm thinking that it might relate to \"Access\" because of the codes and forms, and it could also fit under \"Administrative rights.\" However, since there's a clear focus on projects, maybe \"Internal Project\" is the best fit due to those project mentions. Let\u2019s make sure to categorize it properly!**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI see that \"Administrative rights\" might apply here since there could be a need for access rights to the project. However, the text is not clear enough to make a definitive choice. I think the best guess is \"Internal Project\" since it mentions a new project code. Still, \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could also work. Since we need to respond with a JSON object, I'll go with \"Internal Project\" for simplicity and clarity. Here\u2019s the response:  \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
