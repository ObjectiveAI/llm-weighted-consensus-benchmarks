It mentions slow connection speeds and issues with something called \"meter.\" This suggests it might be related to hardware or a network issue. The phrase \"always red even when plug\" further hints at a problem with a device's status indicator. Given these details, I think the best fit for this ticket is the \"Hardware\" category.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nIt seems this ticket deals with network connectivity, but I\u2019m debating whether to classify it under \u201cHardware\u201d or \u201cAccess.\u201d The mention of a device's status LED being red suggests a hardware issue. However, \"slow connection speeds when calling via meter\" raises questions\u2014especially what \"meter\" refers to. It might mean something like a monitoring device or even a telephony tool. Still, since the core issue is a slow connection, \u201cHardware\u201d feels like the most appropriate category to choose.**Outputting IT ticket category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to present this in a specific JSON format. The category options include \"Hardware,\" among others. I should keep my response straightforward and only include the required category without any extra explanation. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll output this as a JSON object with the exact format that matches the allowed values perfectly. The final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
