They mention \"end project setup\" and \"attached form,\" indicating a request to proceed with something. It\u2019s a bit unclear, but I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing this ticket as an \"Internal Project\" since it concerns project setup forms and related processes.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm trying to categorize an IT ticket based on the user's phrasing about forms for \"oracle\" and \"PAS.\" It could be \"Access\" if it relates to access rights or \"Administrative rights\" if it involves granting access. However, it seems more fitting for \"Internal Project\" since it concerns the \"end project setup.\" The mention of \"code per attached form\" suggests they want to process something, but \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback if it's unclear. I think \"Internal Project\" is the best choice here.**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe ticket doesn\u2019t explicitly mention access rights or logins, but the term \"setup form\" implies a procedural use, likely for a project setup. I think it fits best under the \"Internal Project\" category since other options like hardware, storage, purchase, and HR don't align. According to the instruction, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object that looks like this: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"} to adhere to the required format without adding extra text. Let\u2019s keep it clean and straightforward!"
