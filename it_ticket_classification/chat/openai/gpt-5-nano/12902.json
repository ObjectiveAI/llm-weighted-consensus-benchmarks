They mentioned \"oracle approvals\" and \"old holiday requests,\" suggesting it involves some kind of approval process. I'm thinking it could fit under \"Access\" since it\u2019s about permissions or administrative rights. The ticket hints at needing help with finding old approvals, possibly in the Oracle E-Business Suite. Also, HR is involved with holiday approvals, so \"Administrative rights\" could be another appropriate category.**Selecting IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize the IT ticket. It mentions \"Oracle approvals,\" which hints at software-related approvals but also connects to holiday requests. While it might seem like it fits under \"HR Support,\" the focus on locating approvals and accessing permissions suggests \"Access\" could be more accurate. The user is looking for pointers to find old approvals. Therefore, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access\" since it's mainly about accessing the approval workflow in Oracle.**Finalizing JSON output**\n\nI'm reevaluating the category for the IT ticket. While \"HR Support\" and \"Internal Project\" could have fit, it's really about permissions in Oracle, so \"Access\" is the most appropriate choice. Now, I need to format this as JSON. The schema is clear: it should be in a specific structure. I'll prepare the output as {\"category\":\"Access\"} to match the requirements, ensuring that it's formatted correctly with no extra text. Let's stick to that!"
