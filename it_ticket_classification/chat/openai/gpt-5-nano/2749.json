The phrase \"please provide monitor relocated tower\" suggests it's a request related to hardware. Given this context, the most appropriate category would be \"Hardware,\" as it directly pertains to a hardware device like a monitor. However, the wording is a bit ambiguous.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the IT ticket, and while it could also fit under \"Purchase\" if they want to obtain a monitor, the phrase \"provide monitor relocated tower\" suggests it\u2019s more about moving a monitor. \"Relocated tower\" implies a need to relocate the monitor to another tower, maybe in a server room. But since it\u2019s definitely hardware-related, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" It looks like the final output should be in JSON format. So, I\u2019ll respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
