Since there aren't any hardware or access details, I\u2019m thinking it could fall under \"Administrative rights,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or maybe even \"Internal Project.\" I'll need to decide on the most fitting category.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the IT ticket category. The user\u2019s message doesn't specifically mention access privileges or admin rights, so it might not fit those categories. Since it talks about \"working days\" and possibly requests a calculation of working days within a specific timeframe, I'm leaning toward categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous.\" This makes sense for unclear requests. I'll respond with a JSON object containing the category \"Miscellaneous.\" That should cover it!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
