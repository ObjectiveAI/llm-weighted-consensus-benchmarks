The ticket talks about a \"new starter\" and mentions a \"starter form\" that needs filling. The options might be \"HR Support\" since it relates to onboarding, or \"Access\" if it pertains to access rights. However, it primarily seems to be about the form for a new employee, leaning towards \"HR Support.\" That's going to be my choice!**Assigning HR Support Category**\n\nI think the best category for this ticket is \"HR Support,\" since it revolves around HR onboarding documentation explicitly mentioned in the list. While \"Access\" could be a possibility since it's about a form being filled, it doesn\u2019t clearly specify access rights. The phrase about \"accounts receivable lead\" seems off-topic, hinting at a miscommunication. Overall, I'll finalize it as \"HR Support\" and produce the JSON format with the category field. Here\u2019s how it looks:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
