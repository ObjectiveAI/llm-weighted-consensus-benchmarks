It appears they're requesting to move a folder and all its content, as indicated by phrases like \"move a folder and all content on one com.\" The mention of files being deleted and references to \"library link\" suggest this may involve file storage and access, along with the \"resources folder.\" Based on the details, I might categorize it under \"Storage\" or \"Access.\"**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the IT ticket to determine the right category. It seems to deal with moving folders and content, likely related to files deleted by a library link, suggesting this is a file management issue. I think \"Storage\" fits well since it involves moving folders and files. While \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if permissions are needed, that\u2019s not explicitly stated. I'll categorize it as \"Storage\" and provide a brief explanation of the ticket's context.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nI need to output JSON with the category set to \"Storage\" for the IT ticket. Following the required format, I\u2019ll prepare it as: {\"category\": \"Storage\"}. The instructions are clear: I should ensure the response is strictly JSON without any extra text. The system expects a JSON payload structured with the \"category\" key as outlined. So, I'll just deliver the required JSON object neatly and accurately. Here we go: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}."
