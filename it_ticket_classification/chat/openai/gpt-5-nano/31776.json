It sounds like the main focus is adding an owner and members. I\u2019m leaning towards \"Administrative rights\" since creating this mailing list requires permissions. There\u2019s also a chance it could fit under \"Access\" if we consider it user access management. The \"Internal Project\" category seems less fitting, but it\u2019s still a possibility.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m still figuring out the best category for the IT ticket regarding the user's request about creating a mailing list. The \"Access\" category could apply since it involves adding owners and members, which relates to permissions. However, \"Administrative rights\" seems more appropriate for managing the resource. The user's text suggests it's more about creating and managing the mailing list rather than a project, so I think I'll go with \"Administrative rights\" as the best choice.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
