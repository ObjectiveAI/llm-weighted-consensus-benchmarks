The ticket discusses changing ownership and mentions terms like \"approve\" and \"add heads.\" I think it might fit into one of several categories: Access, Administrative rights, or Internal Project based on its content. It's essential to map it accurately, so I\u2019ll consider those categories carefully to ensure it\u2019s placed correctly.**Classifying ownership change**\n\nIt looks like the ticket is about changing ownership\u2014possibly of a system or account. The phrase \"ownership change\" might relate to \"COM,\" and it seems there\u2019s a request for approval and to add approvers. In terms of IT ticket categories, this aligns with either \u201cAccess\u201d for permissions or \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d for elevated permissions. Given that ownership change involves access control, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d feels like the right choice since it specifically pertains to modifying user rights. I'm weighing my options!**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the ticket taxonomy and seeing that the \u201cAccess\u201d category covers general access requests, like granting access or resetting passwords. However, \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d is specifically for elevating privileges. The request to \u201cchange ownership\u201d likely refers to the ownership of a service rather than strictly admin rights, but it does involve someone wanting approvals. If I had to choose, I\u2019d go with \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d as the most accurate category. I\u2019ll structure my response as a JSON object!{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
