The ticket content is a bit jumbled, mentioning \"approval oracle february pm\" and phrases about needing to \"help setting rights.\" It seems that the request is related to access rights or permissions, leading me to consider categorizing it as either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\"**Categorizing IT Ticket Request**\n\nIt seems like the \"Administrative rights\" category is intended for requests involving admin-level privileges. The phrase \"setting rights\" suggests a request for permission levels, which could just mean general access rights. If the system designates \"Access\" for user access grants, I'm leaning towards using that category. The mention of an \"approval oracle\" suggests some workflow, possibly for someone on leave needing access. I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and format it as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Adding a short justification could be helpful too!**Outputting IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe prompt is straightforward: \"Categorize this IT Ticket.\" I just need to provide the category as a JSON object without any additional text. The schema requires a specific format, so I\u2019ll simply output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That seems like the best approach to meet the requirements efficiently!"
