The user's text seems quite messy, but it relates to \"new starter\" forms and the onboarding process. It could fit under \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" Key phrases like \"administration officer\" and \"file link attachments\" stand out, along with mentions of protecting against viruses and handling attachments. I\u2019ll pick a suitable category based on these clues!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the IT ticket and its main focus on onboarding a new starter and the associated starter form. While it could involve security policy for attachments, the central theme aligns more with HR support. I think HR Support is the best fit since there's no explicit access request, even though \"administration officer\" and handling attachments hint at security measures. I\u2019ll go ahead and respond with a JSON object categorizing it as HR Support: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.**Finalizing IT ticket response**\n\nI want to be sure I'm following the format correctly since it calls for just the category response without extra commentary. The ticket discusses terms like \"new starter,\" \"forms,\" and \"onboarding,\" which all point towards HR support. Since I\u2019ve confirmed this perspective, I\u2019ll provide the response in the specified JSON format. So, my answer will simply be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. That seems like the right choice!"
