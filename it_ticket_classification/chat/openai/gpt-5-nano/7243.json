It seems to have various categories like \"sow,\" likely referring to a statement of work. This ticket might fit best under \"Internal Project\" based on its content and context.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe user wants to reflect executed contracts in the dashboard, suggesting a software or dashboard issue. I see possible categories: \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" This revolves around data from the dashboard regarding contract execution, so \"Internal Project\" seems most fitting since it relates to fixing a dashboard issue. \"Administrative rights\" pertains to permissions, which isn\u2019t relevant here. I should concisely categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project\" since that aligns closely with their request.**Formatting the response**\n\nI see that I need to respond with the category object in a specific JSON format. The instruction outlines how to structure the response clearly, with the category set to match one of the specified values exactly. \n\nSo, based on my analysis, I'll go with \"Internal Project\" as the answer. The goal is to ensure the format is neat and adheres strictly to the instruction, so I\u2019ll provide only the JSON object: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}\n\nI won't add any extra lines or commentary."
