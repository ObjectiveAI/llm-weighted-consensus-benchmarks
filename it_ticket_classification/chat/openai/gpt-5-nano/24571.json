The ticket seems to discuss multiple approvals and mentions things like \"all approved at once\" and \"limit per extended.\" This leads me to think it might relate to \"Access\" since it's about permissions in Oracle. However, it could also fall under \"Administrative rights\" or \"Purchase.\" I need to carefully evaluate the best fit for this ticket.**Determining ticket category**\n\nIt seems the ticket is about the approval process in Oracle, possibly related to automation. The user mentions needing all approvals at once and the issues that arise from multiple pages, which could indeed waste time. This leads me to consider my categories: \"Administrative rights\" might be a good fit if it\u2019s about permissions, while \"Access\" could apply too, as it deals with who can approve. Still, neither fully captures the ticket's essence, as it may also suggest process improvement.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe message seems to indicate that the user wants all Oracle access approved at once, along with logging and advising teams, which points to access control and approval processes. I\u2019m considering if it could relate to an \"Internal Project\" due to potential workflow changes as well. However, \"Administrative rights\" appears to fit best since it deals with approvals and admin tasks. Therefore, I'll respond with the required JSON format, ensuring it's precise and straightforward.**Creating the JSON response**\n\nI see that the expected structure for the category response includes a \"type\" wrapper and follows a specific schema. The category key must align with the allowed options, and I've confirmed it's correctly set to \"Administrative rights.\" There's no need for a lengthy explanation, so I\u2019ll ensure the spelling is exact and then produce the necessary JSON object. It's all about keeping it simple and accurate!"
