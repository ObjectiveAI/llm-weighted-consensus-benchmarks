The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket seems focused on issues regarding RAM being full, status downtimes, and the need for increased memory allocation due to high usage. This brings it best into the category of Hardware since it's related to RAM, which is a hardware resource rather than storage.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI consider whether the ticket could fit under \"Internal Project,\" especially if it's related to a specific project. However, the best match remains \"Hardware.\" I realize I need to respond with a JSON object that perfectly aligns with the category schema. So, my final answer will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This matches the required structure without any extra text or formatting. I'll make sure to keep it clear and focused on just delivering that JSON object."
