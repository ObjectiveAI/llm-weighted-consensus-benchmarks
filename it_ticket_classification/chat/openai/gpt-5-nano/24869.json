It might fit under \"Storage\" since it discusses folder deletion, but it could also fall under \"Administrative rights\" if they're asking for permission to delete the folder. Alternatively, if this is part of a transition for an internal project, I might consider \"Internal Project\" as a category too.**Determining the right ticket category**\n\nIt seems the user\u2019s request is focused on storage maintenance, specifically about deleting a folder referred to as the \"Thursday December folder.\" They also mention logging an assignment retroactively, which suggests some level of organization or tracking. While \"Administrative rights\" could be necessary for deletion, the ticket doesn't state that explicitly. I think the best fit for this request might be \"Storage,\" as it covers folder management and deletion, while \"Access\" could relate to permissions as well.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe user wants to delete a folder, and I think the \"Storage\" category is the most fitting. It's not about \"Purchase\" or \"Internal Project,\" and while \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if permissions are needed, that's not explicitly stated. The mention of \"please log assign retroactively\" suggests they want to track an assignment somehow. I need to respond with a simple JSON object categorizing this ticket. So, I\u2019ll specify the category as \"Storage\" for clarity and accuracy.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
