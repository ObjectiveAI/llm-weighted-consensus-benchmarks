The user wants to \"remove admin from admin ad,\" and it seems like they want to delete an admin from the Active Directory (AD) group due to not working there anymore. The message is a bit garbled but hints at removing the admin account from the admin AD group. They also mention \"accounts groups ad pool ad confirmation,\" which adds to the confusion.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize an IT ticket that involves removing admin rights. I see options like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but since the request specifically deals with admin rights, \"Administrative rights\" is the most relevant category. I need to format my response as a JSON object, ensuring I follow the required structure with proper capitalization. The final output will be: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. This fits the criteria perfectly!**Formatting the IT ticket response**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the format for categorizing the IT ticket. It says to respond with a JSON object, specifically: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. The user needs a straightforward output, but I\u2019m noticing instructions mention natural language. However, since the system specifically requests a JSON format for the category, I\u2019ll make sure to keep it brief and clean, with no trailing spaces. So, I\u2019ll stick to the structured output: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}. Let\u2019s go!"
