However, since it also mentions \"change name intern,\" I wonder if it fits \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Ultimately, \"Access\" seems most appropriate since the request is about changing the card's name, which feels more administrative than hardware-related.**Classifying the IT request**\n\nThe phrase \"name change access card\" suggests they're asking to change the name on an access card. It appears this may involve an intern, which hints at possible HR involvement. Still, I\u2019m thinking that among the categories\u2014HR Support, Access, Administrative rights, and Internal Project\u2014the best fit is \"Access,\" since it concerns an access card specifically. I\u2019ll prepare the response in JSON format like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and maybe include a brief note to clarify the decision.**Preparing the JSON response**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to respond with just the category for this IT ticket. The request is about \"name change access card,\" so I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access.\" I must make sure to keep it simple and only present the JSON object without any extra text. So, the final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It looks like I\u2019m all set!"
