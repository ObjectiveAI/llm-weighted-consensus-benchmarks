The available categories include Hardware, Purchase, and others. Given that the ticket refers specifically to a hardware device, the best fit is \"Hardware.\" However, it could also relate to \"Purchase\" since it's about a new mouse. But ultimately, \"Hardware\" feels most appropriate since this seems to be a hardware issue.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe phrase \"new mouse\" could suggest they're requesting a purchase, but it seems more likely they're describing an issue with their new mouse being temperamental yet functioning. Based on this, I believe \"Hardware\" is the best category. I should also consider adding a brief note about it being a hardware issue and ask clarifying questions if needed. The output needs to be a JSON-like object with \"category\" set to \"Hardware,\" following the specified format.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
