The mention of \"new purchase,\" \"purchase order,\" and \"allocation device\" points towards either the \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware\" categories. There\u2019s also text regarding confidentiality, which makes me think about \"Administrative rights,\" but that seems less relevant. Given the strong connection to purchasing, I'll categorize it as \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll likely output this as a JSON category object since that seems appropriate.**Delivering JSON Category**\n\nI see that the prompt is requesting a JSON-like category schema for an IT ticket. I need to respond directly with the selected category, which is \"Purchase.\" There's no need for any extra text, just the formatted JSON object. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and present this clearly as:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nThis keeps everything neat and simple while following the instructions correctly. Alright, let's wrap it up!"
