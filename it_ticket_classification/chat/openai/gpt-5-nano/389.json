It mentions a \"new purchase order\" and includes various terms like \"purchased pro retina intel plus graphics\" and \"mandatory receipts.\" Overall, it feels related to procurement, asset allocation, and item logging.\n\nLooking at the available categories\u2014Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights\u2014I think this ticket best fits under \"Purchase.\" It clearly relates to purchasing and asset management.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm leaning towards classifying this ticket as \"Purchase\" since it involves a new purchase order, receipt, and item allocation. While it does mention \"Pro Retina Intel Plus graphics,\" which might suggest hardware, the primary focus seems to be on the purchasing process. The various phrases like \"log allocation\" and \"mandatory receipts\" reinforce this.\n\nSo, I'd choose \"Purchase\" as the category. Now to format my answer in the required JSON structure.{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
