The text is a bit unclear but mentioning \"create graduates\" suggests it could relate to creating user accounts. \n\nI think it might fit under \"Internal Project\" or \"HR Support,\" but \"Administrative rights\" could also work if they want admin access for these graduates. There\u2019s a lot to consider, but I\u2019ll map to the best option.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket text is pretty vague, making it a bit tricky. I\u2019m considering \"Access\" if it's about creating access for graduates, but there\u2019s no clear mention of that. It talks about \"creating graduates,\" which might imply creating accounts starting in July for different cohorts like AM and PM. I lean towards \"Internal Project\" because it involves a project related to these graduates. Alternatively, \"HR Support\" could fit if it's about new hires. I\u2019ll go with the safer choice: \"Internal Project.\"**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nIt seems like the ticket isn\u2019t really about HR processes, and \"Administrative rights\" doesn\u2019t fit either. I\u2019m considering the categories available: \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and \"Access.\" \"Access\" could work if it were about creating accounts, but they say \"please create graduates,\" which isn\u2019t explicit enough. \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit because it mentions a project. \n\nI\u2019ll output the JSON format required: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. This looks good and follows the instructions!"
