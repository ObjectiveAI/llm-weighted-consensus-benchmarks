It seems most relevant as an \"Internal Project\" since it involves board design and permissions. But there are mentions of \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access,\" making it a bit tricky. Ultimately, \"Internal Project\" sounds like the best fit!**Cross-checking categories**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the ticket categories, and \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit since it involves creating a project board and working on infrastructure. However, \"Access\" could also apply with all the site permissions mentioned. The ticket covers both access and infrastructure aspects, but typically only one category is assigned. While \"Storage\" is mentioned, it's a smaller part of the ticket. Given the focus on board creation and permissions, I'd confidently categorize it as \"Internal Project.\"**Categorizing board design**\n\nThe request covers board design, promoted links, redirects, and application integration, which makes it quite multi-topic. \"Miscellaneous\" could fit, but given the options, \"Internal Project\" seems more appropriate. I need to respond in the required JSON format, specifying the category based on the provided schema. So the output will be a simple JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward without any extra commentary."
