If the request is due to physical problems, it might fit into \"Purchase\" for acquiring a new one or \"Hardware\" for hardware additions. There are categories like HR Support and Access, but focusing on the text about \"add computer due to physical problems,\" it seems fitting to categorize it under \"Purchase.\" However, it\u2019s a bit unclear.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI'm focusing on the request to \"add computer,\" which indicates it could fit under \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" If they're mentioning \"due to physical problems,\" that leans more toward a hardware issue. The safe bet is to categorize it as either \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" Since it involves adding a computer, I\u2019ll likely respond with a JSON object that specifies \"Purchase.\" I think that's the best fit considering the context of ordering a new computer.**Finalizing category selection**\n\nThe text mentions \"order work\" and \"please add computer,\" which suggests they want to procure a new computer. I think that clearly aligns with the \"Purchase\" category. The other options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Miscellaneous\" don\u2019t seem relevant here. I'll stick with \"Purchase.\" Now, I need to format my response properly as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. No extra commentary\u2014just the category!"
