The message hints that it's primarily about HR onboarding concerns. Given the categories available, I think \"HR Support\" fits best since the user is clearly addressing a new starter needing help with the related forms. So, I'll go ahead and select \"HR Support\" as the category.**Categorizing IT ticket with JSON response**\n\nThe content mentions phrases like \"please find completed form attached,\" \"new starter,\" and \"off sick,\" so it's clearly about onboarding a contractor. It seems related to HR onboarding, so I\u2019ll categorize this under \"HR Support.\" \n\nNow I need to provide a JSON-like response in the required format. The final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to follow the instructions closely without adding extra commentary."
