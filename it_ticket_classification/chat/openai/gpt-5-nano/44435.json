The ticket mentions slow computer performance, so I'm thinking it fits best under \"Hardware.\" While \"Miscellaneous\" could work, \"Hardware\" is more suitable since it's specific to this issue. I\u2019ll finalize my answer, formatting it in the required JSON format, indicating the category clearly. So, the output will reflect \"category: Hardware\" within the specified structure. Let's make sure I do it right!**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI'm working on formatting the response correctly in JSON. The schema outlines that I need a top-level object with a \"category\" field whose value is a string. Based on the schema, it looks like it should just be {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I need to make sure I follow the guidelines precisely and avoid any extra text or confusion. Keeping everything clear, I'll present my final answer with proper formatting. Let's go with that!"
