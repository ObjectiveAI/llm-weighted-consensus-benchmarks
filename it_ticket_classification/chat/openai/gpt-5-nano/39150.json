It seems urgent since the sprint starts today. I'm thinking this could relate to \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access,\" but I'm not entirely sure which fits best.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThis ticket seems related to project management tool automation, where sub-tasks should inherit time tracking features, particularly the \"original estimate\" field. It appears to be about a specific project, so I\u2019m leaning toward categorizing it as \"Internal Project.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant if permissions were needed, this is more about configuring settings. It doesn't fit \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" or \"Hardware.\" Therefore, \"Internal Project\" seems like the best category to use. I'll format that in JSON.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nThe user provided a JSON-like schema for categorizing the IT ticket. I need to respond with a JSON object that includes just the category string from the options available. Given the analysis, I'll select \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category. \n\nMy final output will be concise with no extra text, ensuring it meets the requested format:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
