It seems to involve a request related to candidate processing and interviews. Based on this context, I think \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category since it discusses candidate counts and interviews. This fits into typical IT ticket categories like Hardware, Access, or Miscellaneous, but HR Support stands out as the best match given the details provided.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nThe text references elements like \"obi report,\" \"candidates,\" and \"interview,\" suggesting it involves generating a report on candidates over time. This indicates it's related to HR processes. I notice the category options provided include \"HR Support,\" which fits perfectly for this context. The instruction is clear: I need to categorize this IT ticket. I'll go ahead and prepare a JSON object specifying the category as \"HR Support.\" Here it is: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
