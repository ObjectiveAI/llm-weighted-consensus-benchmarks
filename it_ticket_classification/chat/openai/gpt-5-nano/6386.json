The categories available are: [\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", \"Administrative rights\"]. The text mentions important factors like access, a scheduled outage, and tasks for an intern. It seems to primarily relate to access or administrative rights. Since it's about access issues, I'll choose the \"Access\" category and prepare the output in JSON format.**Deciding on category**\n\nThe ticket details focus on access issues and mention a scheduled outage. Given phrases like \"access hello testing\" and \"requires part perform,\" it seems to fit best under \"Access.\" While \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, it feels too specific. The mention of outage and planning might imply an internal project, but without clear ties to a specific project. I'll choose \"Access\" and prepare the JSON output accordingly. The final response should be concise, so I won\u2019t add extra text\u2014just the category JSON."
