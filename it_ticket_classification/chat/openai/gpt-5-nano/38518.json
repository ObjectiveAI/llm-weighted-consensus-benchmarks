It seems they\u2019re having trouble submitting something and can't find the project code, indicating a high priority issue. The text is somewhat garbled, but I suspect it relates to the Oracle database not being able to locate the project code. Considering the categories available, it might fit into \"Access\" or \"Storage\" depending on the specific issue.**Analyzing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket appears to involve an issue with IT system access or an application problem connected to Oracle and code submission. The user mentioned trying to submit something related to project codes but seems unable to access it. This suggests it might fall under the \"Access\" category since they're having trouble with project code retrieval. However, the message isn't entirely clear. The phrase \"thank you officer\" could indicate the user is addressing someone in authority, but I'll focus on categorizing the issue effectively. \"Miscellaneous\" could also be a possibility.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI think we should categorize this ticket as \"Internal Project\" since it mentions \"project code,\" \"submit,\" and \"Oracle,\" which indicate it's related to internal projects. While \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could also be options, there's no clear mention of authentication issues. Given the user's request to categorize the ticket, I\u2019ll provide a JSON object with the selected category. The most fitting choice seems to be \"Internal Project,\" and I might consider adding a brief note to clarify my reasoning.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
