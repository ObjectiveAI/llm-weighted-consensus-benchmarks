The ticket discusses bad audio devices in meeting rooms, troubleshooting tests, replacing options, logs, and engineers working on the issue. It\u2019s definitely related to hardware, specifically audio devices and phones. I should categorize this ticket under Hardware based on the tickets\u2019 language. I\u2019ll prepare the output as JSON with the appropriate category property.**Formatting JSON category**\n\nI need to make sure I format the category as specified. The schema outlines that it must be an object with a property called \u201ccategory\u201d that\u2019s a string and fits within certain enumerations. I\u2019ll output it as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It\u2019s important to match the JSON structure exactly according to the schema they provided. Since I\u2019ve done this before, I can just respond succinctly without adding any extra content."
