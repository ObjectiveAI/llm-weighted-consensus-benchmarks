They mention \"addresses for web interviewers\" and a request for the administrator to add interviewers as members. While the content is a bit garbled, it seems to relate to access control and responsibilities. It could fit into the \"Access\" category, but I\u2019m also considering \"Administrative rights\" since it involves granting those rights.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe content mentioning \"please make administrator add interviewers members\" suggests a request for access management to add interviewers as users. While it could potentially relate to \"Internal Project,\" the focus seems to be more on user access. The repeated references to \"interviewers\" imply that the user wants to add them to a system. So, I\u2019m categorizing this ticket as \"Access.\" I'll prepare a JSON response with the category field set to \"Access.\"**Preparing JSON response**\n\nIt looks like I need to respond in JSON format as per the provided schema. The category I have determined is \"Access,\" so I will create a JSON object that looks like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. The instructions are clear\u2014I should provide this object without additional explanations. I just need to ensure it follows the required format exactly. Let\u2019s go ahead and deliver this simple JSON response."
