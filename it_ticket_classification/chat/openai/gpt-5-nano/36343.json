Other categories like \"Access\" or \"Hardware\" don\u2019t fit at all. So, I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project.\"**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering that \"Miscellaneous\" is quite generic for IT issues. The ticket is about a sheet problem related to code, which might indicate a software issue. The options don\u2019t include \"Software/Development,\" but \"Internal Project\" fits for project-related tasks. The ticket mentions \"codes hours\" and likely concerns a spreadsheet (like Excel or Google Sheets). \n\nAfter weighing the details, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best fit. I\u2019ll structure the response as a JSON object with the category field set to \"Internal Project.\"**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that \"sheet\" likely refers to a spreadsheet issue in a project context. While I could go with \"Miscellaneous\" for a generic IT issue, the instruction specifies allowed categories, making \"Internal Project\" a more accurate choice since it relates to a project. \n\nThe user is a senior software developer, and they've mentioned issues with a spreadsheet rather than hardware or access. So, I\u2019ll settle on \"Internal Project\" and provide it in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
