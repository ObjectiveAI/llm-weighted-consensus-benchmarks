The predefined categories include Access and Administrative rights, both of which seem applicable. The ticket talks about account provisioning and configuration for accessing Outlook, hinting at an access management request. \"Access\" feels like the right choice here, even though \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it's about elevated privileges. But overall, Access seems the most appropriate category.**Selecting IT ticket category**\n\nThis ticket focuses on access and configuration, so the best fit is \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object to meet the requirements. The prompt specifically states to categorize the ticket in that way. Therefore, my response will simply be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI see it's important to keep it concise and just return the JSON without additional content. While I could add a brief justification, the key requirement is to provide the category object, so I\u2019ll stick to that."
