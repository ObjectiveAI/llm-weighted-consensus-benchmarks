The categories available are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The text mentions requisition approval and hardware issues like damaged ports and a flickering screen. Given all this, it seems to involve purchasing a hardware device, so the appropriate categories would likely be \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" I\u2019ll choose accordingly!**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the available categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket involves requisition approval and mentions hardware issues like damaged ports and a flickering screen. It seems to fit either \"Purchase\" for the requisition aspect or \"Hardware\" for the technical issues. Since the ticket strongly emphasizes requisition approval, leaning towards \"Purchase\" feels safer. However, I need to keep it straightforward and categorize the ticket appropriately in the end!**Formatting JSON Output**\n\nI think the UI expects a straightforward category string in a JSON format. The required output seems to be an object with a \"category\" field. Given the ticket's repeated mentions of approving requisitions and references to Intel assets, it's clear that \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category. I\u2019ll make sure to craft the final answer as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I just need to be careful and ensure I only provide the JSON without any extra text."
