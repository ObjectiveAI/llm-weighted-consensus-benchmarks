The ticket mentions \"urgent connection\" and issues with \"neither wired connection working,\" which suggests a network connectivity problem. I need to determine which category best fits this issue. I\u2019m considering \"Hardware\" or \"Access,\" but \"Miscellaneous\" might also apply. Since it involves network connectivity, \"Hardware\" seems most suitable because it's about physical connections not working. Let's go with \"Hardware\" for this ticket.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m trying to finalize the category for the user's IT ticket about a network issue. Given that there's no specific \"Infrastructure\" or \"Network\" category, I think \"Hardware\" is the best fit since it involves equipment. The user requests an \"urgent connection\" check and mentions issues with both wired and wireless connections. This indicates a network problem, so I'll categorize it as \"Hardware.\" I need to format the response in JSON, saying: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
