It seems to focus on onboarding, specifically regarding the \"starter form.\" Given that it mentions filling out the form, it aligns most with \"HR Support.\" However, it could also relate to \"Access\" since new employees often need access to systems. I think my clear choice for this ticket is \"HR Support\" due to the context of onboarding.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the text regarding a starter form, which seems connected to new employee onboarding. The references to times like \"friday pm\" and \"thursday pm\" suggest scheduling updates. The mention of \"analyst ext hub\" may hint at internal processes. I\u2019m torn between categorizing it as \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights.\" While HR Support covers general onboarding, there might be elements of \"Access,\" especially if it involves provisioning accounts or hardware. I think I'll lean towards \"HR Support.\"**Determining best category**\n\nI\u2019m debating the best category for this IT ticket regarding the starter form for a new employee. While \"Administrative rights\" might fit because it often involves permissions, the ticket primarily focuses on onboarding\u2014making \"HR Support\" a better choice. It seems like the ticket is centered on HR processes, given the mention of the starter form. I could consider \"Miscellaneous\" if I'm uncertain, but I think \"HR Support\" is the most fitting designation here.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
