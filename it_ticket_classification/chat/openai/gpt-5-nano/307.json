The user provided information about a charts tool license recommendation, mentioning aspects like licensing costs and user-defined metrics. The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Since the request is primarily about purchasing a license for a software tool, the \"Purchase\" category appears to be the most relevant fit for this ticket.**Deciding on the category**\n\nI\u2019m narrowing down the best category for this IT ticket. It\u2019s not about hardware or access, and although it mentions internal teams, \"Purchase\" seems the most accurate since it focuses on a software license. I need to respond with a formatted JSON object that indicates this category. The final output will simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to present it clearly without extra commentary since that wasn't requested. Let's provide this final answer!"
