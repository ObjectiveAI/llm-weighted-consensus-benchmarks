It sounds like this relates to onboarding, but the rest of the sentence is unclear. I need to pick from categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" among others. It's essential to choose the right category based on the information available, even though it\u2019s a bit messy and tricky.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe text talks about a \"new starter\" and mentions account activation, which likely relates to \"Access.\" It hints at user access set up by an administrator, and the phrase \"instantly active\" suggests a quick activation. The details about Belgrade and onboarding timeline also play a role, but it seems clear that this relates primarily to access rather than HR processes. Therefore, I think I should categorize it as \"Access\" and respond in a JSON format for clarity.**Responding with JSON**\n\nThe instruction indicates I need to output a JSON object specifying a category. The allowed categories include \"Access,\" which fits the situation about user account activation for a new starter. Although \"Administrative rights\" seems relevant due to the mention of an administrator, it implies granting more permissions than what is described. Therefore, since it's really about basic access provisioning, I think the right category is \"Access.\" I'll respond with the clean JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
