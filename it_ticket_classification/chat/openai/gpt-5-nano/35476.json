The available categories are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The ticket mentions that the user can't access Snow and is getting redirected to a self-service portal. Previous incidents were closed, but the issue is ongoing. Since this is clearly an access issue, I'll categorize it under Access. Now I\u2019ll prepare to output this in the needed JSON-like format.**Formatting response in JSON**\n\nI see the prompt asks me to categorize an IT ticket and provides specific categories. I need to respond with a JSON object that matches the required schema for the category field. Based on the information provided, I'll categorize this ticket as \"Access.\" I'll make sure my response is valid JSON and doesn't include any extra text since the system expects only the JSON object. So, the final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
