They've provided a rather messy message about OneNote not syncing, mentioning an error with the feature being disabled by their administrator due to a password request. \n\nIt seems like this falls under issues with access or administrative rights. I'll lean towards \"Access\" as the category since the user is facing login and password issues. It\u2019s about accessing OneNote across multiple devices.**Categorizing IT tickets into JSON**\n\nI see that \"Administrative rights\" is a proper category, especially since the message mentions \"feature disabled by your administrator.\" This clearly relates to admin rights issues. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll categorize the ticket as \"Administrative rights\" and prepare to output it in a JSON format. I believe I should also include a note about the OneNote sync being blocked by admin and needing policy changes for multi-device access. \n\nSo the final output will be: {\"category\": \"Administrative rights\"}.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
