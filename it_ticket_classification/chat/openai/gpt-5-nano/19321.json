The request mentions a \"notifications template to be amended\" and includes details about who raised it and accounts involved. This indicates it's likely about template amendments for internal IT support. I should consider options like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Internal Project\" since it focuses on template issues and account applications. Overall, I think it fits best under \"Administrative rights.\"**Analyzing ticket categories**\n\nI'm looking at the categories available: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. \"Administrative rights\" pertains to permissions for making changes, while \"Access\" relates to system permissions. The user\u2019s text mentions including a name, but it\u2019s a bit unclear. They also refer to amending a \"notifications template,\" which might involve ServiceNow. It seems they want to update the template to incorporate the name of the person who raised the ticket and possibly address account-related actions too.**Categorizing ServiceNow request**\n\nI'm considering the user's request about modifying a \"notifications template\" in ServiceNow. Since this involves making technical changes, it likely doesn't fall under \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Storage.\" It may also not fit \"Purchase\" or \"Internal Project.\" I'm thinking it could be categorized as \"Miscellaneous\" if it's a general request. However, if they need permissions to edit the templates, it might fit under \"Administrative rights.\" I need to determine which category aligns best with their request.**Clarifying ticket categories**\n\nThe user\u2019s request includes modifying the notification template by adding the name of the person who raised the ticket. This leans towards \"Access\" if it pertains to permissions for viewing the template. It could also fit \"Miscellaneous\" since it's a generic modification. If it's part of a specific project for the SNOW templates, it might go under \"Internal Project.\" Given the ambiguity, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a safe choice, but \"Access\" might be appropriate if it relates to user permissions associated with account creation.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
