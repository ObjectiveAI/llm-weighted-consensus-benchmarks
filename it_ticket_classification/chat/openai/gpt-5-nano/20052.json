It might fit under \"Internal Project\" because it involves updating those extensions in AD and Exchange. The user\u2019s request to \"initiate update\" and \"audit amend\" suggests it\u2019s an important task. It could also involve \"Administrative rights\" if updates require those. Overall, it looks like it\u2019s primarily focused on an internal IT project related to meeting room resources and access.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket. I\u2019m considering that \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best here. I need to respond with the correct JSON format specified earlier, which is simply: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I want to keep it direct and avoid adding unnecessary text. I think I\u2019ve got everything straightened out after verifying the required format, so I\u2019ll just output that JSON object now."
