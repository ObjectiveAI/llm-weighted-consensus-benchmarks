The closest options seem to be \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" Given that it's about a bug and fix, and since there's no \"Software\" category, \"Miscellaneous\" may be the best fit. There's a laptop swap involved, but the user still experiences issues. They want a remote fix today. I wonder if \"Access\" could apply, but it feels more about syncing than access. So, \"Miscellaneous\" makes the most sense.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
