I'm considering whether to categorize it under \"Hardware\" for physical equipment like switches and routers, or \"Access\" for network rights. Since it involves investigating and installing additional ports, it fits well under \"Hardware.\" There are also confidentiality disclaimers in the ticket. I\u2019m planning to prepare a JSON object with the category clearly marked as \"Hardware.\" Let\u2019s ensure that format is correct!**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe user\u2019s prompt is straightforward: I need to categorize the IT ticket and respond in a JSON format. The response should reflect the requested category using the format provided. I\u2019ll ensure it's simply: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. I\u2019ve noticed there's a schema mentioned which defines the structure I should follow. The user wants the category field only, so I\u2019ll keep it concise and straightforward without extra text. Let\u2019s confirm that I deliver this correctly!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
