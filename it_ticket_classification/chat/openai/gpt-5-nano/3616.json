It seems to involve a technical issue that could fit into several categories, like \"Internal Project,\" \"Access,\" or perhaps \"Miscellaneous.\" Considering the content, \"Access\" might be most relevant since it mentions SSH keys, but it could also relate to \"Internal Projects.\"**Evaluating ticket categorization**\n\nThe user mentioned \"known hosts\" and \"hello key added,\" suggesting they might need help with an issue related to migration from git and build machines. The request to \"please assign\" indicates they want someone assigned to this task. I\u2019m considering categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Internal Project\" appears to be the best fit since it concerns configurations related to migration. However, \"Access\" is another option due to the mention of SSH keys, though the phrasing is a bit unclear.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nThe user's ticket might involve SSH keys for git access and connections to build machines or mobile devices. This could suggest an \"Access\" ticket, but there\u2019s also a category for \"Administrative rights\" which involves elevated privileges, though it's not clear in this case. \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"HR Support\" don\u2019t fit at all. Given the context, \"Internal Project\" seems to be the best choice since it's about configurations for a migration. I need to output a JSON object with the category value.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
