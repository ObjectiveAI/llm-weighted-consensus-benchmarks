The categories available include HR Support, Access, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the mention of a provisional joining and the automation tester role, it seems \"HR Support\" fits best, although \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" might also apply if they require specific permissions. It's a bit of a puzzle!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nThe user mentions a \"new starter\" needing help with a completion form due by Thursday, which suggests it's an onboarding form. This indicates the need for access, so the best categories seem to be \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" Since it's about onboarding, \"HR Support\" feels relevant, but given that it might involve provisioning access, \"Access\" could fit too. The ambiguity makes selecting tricky, but since it's an IT ticket, I think \"Access\" may be the most appropriate choice.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
