The available categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I wonder if it fits into Access or Administrative rights, since it involves services and certificates. However, it's more about an outage than access credentials. Ultimately, it feels like it could fit into Administrative rights since it might need admin action to resolve.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe user's request is to categorize an IT ticket that mentions a high-priority problem regarding availability and access due to expired certificates. The details imply that users are experiencing access issues. Given that, the Access category seems most appropriate. I need to respond with a JSON object that fits the required format, specifying the category as \"Access.\" I\u2019ll make sure it complies exactly with the category schema provided.
