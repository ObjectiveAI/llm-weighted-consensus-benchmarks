They mention something about a \"tuesday november update,\" which is a bit unclear, but it seems they\u2019re asking how to add these developers, likely related to permissions or access. Given that, the appropriate category might be either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" since they are asking about adding developers and how to manage their access to the system.**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to categorize this IT ticket. It seems to involve users, specifically adding developers, which relates to access management. While \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could be an option if they\u2019re asking for admin permissions, the question seems more general, focusing on the process of adding developers. Therefore, the safer choice would be \"Access.\" I\u2019ll prepare the response in the required JSON format, labeling it appropriately.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
