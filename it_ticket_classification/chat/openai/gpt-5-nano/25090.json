Given all these factors, the most appropriate category appears to be \"Access,\" since it mainly addresses user access and related rights, although \"Hardware\" could also be relevant due to the mention of a tower.**Clarifying ticket categorization**\n\nI'm looking at the IT ticket, and although \"Administrative rights\" exists, the focus seems to be on revoking access rights for a leaver. This should fall under the \"Access\" category. While \"Administrative rights\" refers to a subset of access, the main goal here is deprovisioning. The ticket mentions terms like \"leaver ad rights\" and \"token,\" indicating that \"Access\" is the right choice. The response needs to be in JSON format, stating just the category: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.**Finalizing ticket category**\n\nThe user needs to categorize the ticket, and I want to keep it simple by providing a JSON object that matches the category property. I'll go with {\"category\":\"Access\"} as it fits best, even though I considered \"Miscellaneous\" or \"HR Support\" because of the leaver process. But I keep coming back to \"Access\" as the right choice. So, I will just return the final response: {\"category\":\"Access\"} without any extra text."
