However, there's also the term \"Administrative rights,\" which could imply a more specific requirement. If this request is particularly about admin privileges, then \"Administrative rights\" would be the more accurate choice. I'll settle on \"Access\" for now, but I'm curious if it might need further clarification.**Finalizing ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering the phrase \"add builds.\" It could potentially relate to build pipelines, but I'm not entirely sure. For simplicity, I'm leaning toward categorizing the ticket as \"Access.\" The user's request clearly states we need to output a JSON object with the category. So, I\u2019ll format it as {\"category\":\"Access\"} to match the required schema and ensure the case is correct. No extra commentary needed; I\u2019ll just keep it straightforward. Let's go with that!"
