The text covers topics like change management, task numbers, and approvers, which makes it a bit tricky. It could fit into \"Internal Project,\" which is for software tasks, \"Administrative rights\" regarding permissions, or perhaps \"Miscellaneous\" for more generic inquiries. Since it seems to deal primarily with internal processes, \"Internal Project\" might be the best fit, though \"Miscellaneous\" is also a possibility.**Categorizing IT ticket content**\n\nThe ticket content emphasizes operations related to change management within IT service management (ITSM). Given the limited categories\u2014Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights\u2014I see that it involves elements like \"add approvers\" and \"change task.\" It sounds like it\u2019s related to a change request workflow. \n\nWhile \"Internal Project\" seems fitting since it discusses change tasks, the wording is confusing. Ultimately, I need to pick one category, prioritizing clarity.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
