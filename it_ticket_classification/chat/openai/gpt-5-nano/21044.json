Since it's about obtaining a license for software, it most likely falls under Purchase. I need to determine the best fit, but it seems clear the ticket is primarily about procurement.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI have to decide whether the category is \"Purchase\" or \"Access.\" Since \"Access\" typically relates to user access systems, the mention of a license suggests it's more about software, which makes \"Purchase\" seem more fitting. Also, the phrase \"February pm license\" might indicate a license for Project Management software. Since the ticket seems common for a license request, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Purchase.\" Now, I'll format it as JSON as instructed: \n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
