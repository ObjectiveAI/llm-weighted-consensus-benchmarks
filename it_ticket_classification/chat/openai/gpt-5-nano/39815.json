The directive emphasizes that only the category should be included, so I'll stick to that format without adding any extra notes.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user has requested that I categorize the IT ticket, which mentions leave balances. To respond accurately, I\u2019ll classify it under HR Support since that\u2019s the appropriate category for this kind of inquiry. It's essential I make sure the answer reflects that categorization clearly. So, I\u2019ll simply return the category as HR Support in a structured format. This way, I'm ensuring clarity and relevance in my response!"
