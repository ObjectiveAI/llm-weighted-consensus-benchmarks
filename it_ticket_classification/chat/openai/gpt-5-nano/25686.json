Categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" makes sense because it directly relates to these tasks. I'll craft the JSON category object accordingly: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. The format aligns with the requirements since the prompt asks for a specific JSON-like output, focusing on this internal category without any extra text."
