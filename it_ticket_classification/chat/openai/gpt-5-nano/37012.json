It discusses machines that failed to start for several days, and there are mentions of disruptive behavior and tests. Given the context, this seems related to hardware issues, so I\u2019ll classify it under the \"Hardware\" category. The request is definitely on the technical side, focusing on machines not functioning properly, and I could see it fitting into the specifications provided.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThis issue revolves around machines having hardware booting problems, so I think the best category is \"Hardware.\" While it could fit into \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Hardware\" seems most appropriate. The task indicates that the output format should be a JSON object specifying the category. I\u2019ll return just the JSON response with this field, ensuring there are no extra words or formatting issues. It should simply be:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}**Finalizing categorization**\n\nThe text mentions \"disruptive behavior,\" but I think it still points towards a hardware issue. It's important to stay focused on that aspect. So, I'll go ahead and confirm the categorization as \"Hardware.\" I want to ensure that I'm clear and accurate in my response. Delivering this correctly will help the user understand the situation better. Let's finalize the output as planned!"
