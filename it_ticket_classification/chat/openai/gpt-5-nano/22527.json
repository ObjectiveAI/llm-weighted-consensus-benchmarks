It could be under \"Internal Project\" since it involves Confluence, but \"Miscellaneous\" seems too vague.\n\nIt looks like the user might plan to insert reports into Confluence on Wednesday PM. This seems related to permission issues about creating and inserting resolution reports, specifically with the acting test lead in mind.**Categorizing Confluence access issues**\n\nI'm trying to determine the right category for this IT ticket. It likely falls under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" since it concerns permissions in Confluence. \"Access\" covers general permission queries, while \"Administrative rights\" is more specific to admin privileges. \n\nThere\u2019s also mention of the \"acting test lead,\" hinting at a user role. Since this is related to a project, \"Internal Project\" might also fit. Overall, I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"Access\" or \"Internal Project.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
