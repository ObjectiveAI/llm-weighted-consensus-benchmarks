The text includes phrases like \"intern testing\" and references a \"compliance officer,\" which adds to the context. I'm leaning towards categorizing this into \"Hardware,\" since it primarily discusses hardware allocation for a new employee. However, I also consider the \"Access\" category just in case it aligns better.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this IT ticket based on the content. It could suggest \"Access\" if it's about provisioning for the new employee, but the main focus seems to be on \"hardware allocation,\" which points to \"Hardware.\" I pondered \"Internal Project\" and \"Administrative rights\" as well, but those are more about permissions than hardware. Since the user only wants one category, I conclude it's best to go with \"Hardware.\" I'll respond in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
