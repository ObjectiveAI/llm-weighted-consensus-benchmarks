The user\u2019s message indicates an issue with the Oracle Expenses app not working. They mention their password seems valid but have changed anything. This points toward an access issue, so I\u2019m considering classifying it under \"Access\" or maybe \"Miscellaneous.\" Let's determine which fits best according to the provided categories.**Categorizing IT Ticket Issues**\n\nI'm addressing an app issue, likely linked to login or password problems. The user mentions their password is valid, but there\u2019s confusion about why it isn't working. This strongly suggests it's an \"Access\" issue related to the Oracle Expenses app. I need to categorize it as \"Access.\" \n\nNow, I want to ensure my final answer is formatted correctly according to the required schema. I'll provide the category JSON as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}, ensuring it adheres to the specified structure.**Confirming IT Ticket Output**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that, for this IT ticket categorization, I only need to provide the category value without including the full schema. The expected output is simply: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I think it's essential to keep it clear and straightforward for the grader to parse. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll go ahead and respond with just that succinct output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That's all I need to do!"
