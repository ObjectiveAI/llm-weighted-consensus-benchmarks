It all revolves around new starters and accessing accounts, which leads me to think this should fall under either Access or HR Support categories. Since it specifically concerns credentials for a new starter, it seems most appropriate to categorize it under Access.**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI see there's also an \"Administrative rights\" category for admin accounts, but this ticket seems more focused on creating user credentials from the attached form. It falls under both \"HR Support\" for onboarding and \"Access\" for user accounts. However, since it specifically addresses account creation and credentials for a new starter, it fits best in the \"Access\" category. Thus, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object confirming \u201cAccess\u201d as the chosen category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
