The options are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \n\nThe ticket mentions \"connection set up,\" which suggests it could relate to network connections or office connectivity. This could mean either \"Access\" if it's about system access or \"Hardware\" if it involves setting up actual hardware. I\u2019ll need to pick the most fitting category.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the phrase \"connection set up,\" which could refer to a network connection, possibly a VPN. The mention of \"work out offices\" might imply remote access to those offices. The best-fitting category seems to be \"Access\" because it's focused on connection setup and access rights. Alternatively, it could fit \"Administrative rights,\" but \u201cAccess\u201d is more general. \n\nSo, I need to output this as a JSON object with the category field defined correctly according to the schema.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
