The user has options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. Since it involves urgent file recovery and access issues, \"Storage\" seems relevant because the files are missing. However, \"Access\" is also a possibility due to profile links. \"HR Support\" could apply since it\u2019s about a recent leaver. I'll weigh these options carefully.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket to choose a category for the file recovery request. The options exclude \"Removal of access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" \"Storage\" is a good fit for data recovery since the text mentions missing files from a laptop. Although \"Access\" could relate due to the profile issue, the main focus is on file storage. I'll categorize it as \"Storage,\" and then I need to respond structured as a JSON object with that category, along with a brief note.{\"category\":\"Storage\"}"
