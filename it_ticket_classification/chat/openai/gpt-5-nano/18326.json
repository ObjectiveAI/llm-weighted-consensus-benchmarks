The mention of a \"new starter,\" \"starter form date,\" and \"assist completion\" suggests it pertains to onboarding.\n\nThis ticket could fall under \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" Since it involves onboarding a new employee and potentially creating user accounts or access rights, \"HR Support\" feels like the best fit here, as it directly relates to employee onboarding processes.**Deciding the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out how to categorize this IT ticket. The phrases \"assist completion attached starter form\" and \"new starter\" suggest it\u2019s about HR processes. There aren't any clear hardware issues, so I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" for onboarding tasks, especially since it mentions completing a starter form.\n\nWhile \"Access\" could fit for granting system access, nothing explicitly indicates that\u2019s needed. Since it's primarily about a new starter, I think \"HR Support\" is the most suitable category here.**Finalizing the ticket category**\n\nI'm concluding that \"HR Support\" is the best category for this ticket since it focuses on a new starter form. The content includes phrases like \"assist completion attached starter form,\" which relates to HR processes. While it could potentially involve \"Administrative rights\" for access provision, that's not explicitly stated. Since it emphasizes onboarding and collecting information, categorizing it as \"HR Support\" feels most fitting. I'll prepare the final answer as a JSON object with \"category\": \"HR Support.\"**Preparing the JSON output**\n\nI need to deliver the output as a JSON object that includes the category field. Following the specified format, the schema requires a property named \"category\" with a string value. Since I've determined \"HR Support\" is the right category, I\u2019ll format my answer strictly according to the schema.\n\nMy final output will be:  \n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}  \n\nNice and concise, just as required!"
