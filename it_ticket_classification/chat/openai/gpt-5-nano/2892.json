The two main possibilities are \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase.\" While it's a physical item related to hardware, the \"Purchase\" category seems more directly aligned since it's specifically requesting to buy one. So I should categorize this request as \"Purchase.\"**Deciding ticket categorization**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket that's a request for a laptop backpack. It doesn't ask for permission but requests to provide one, indicating it's a procurement or purchase request. While \"Hardware\" could apply as it relates to physical assets, \"Purchase\" is more specific for procurement requests. The message itself makes it clear they want a backpack. Therefore, I should format the output as required JSON: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} and ensure it meets the necessary structure."
