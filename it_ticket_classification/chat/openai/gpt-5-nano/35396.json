This situation is urgent and impacts production. It seems to be an internal project due to the technical nature of the problem, so I think categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" makes sense.**Deciding on categorization**\n\nI\u2019m considering the categorization of this IT ticket. Even though it might be related to access, the main issue revolves around connection problems, making \u201cInternal Project\u201d the best fit. It requires planning and collaboration to address the urgent connection issues with Oracle database servers that affect production. I'll prepare the response as a JSON object with the \"category\" field formatted correctly as \"Internal Project,\" along with a rationale for clarity.**Formatting the response**\n\nThe final output should look like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I need to ensure proper formatting, using only the JSON object as instructed. The user requested the category for this IT ticket, so I should stick to providing that specific category field. It's clear that the response should be strictly the JSON object without any additional text. So I\u2019ll prepare to respond simply with {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} as per the instructions."
