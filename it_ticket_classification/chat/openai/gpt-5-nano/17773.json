The options include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The message mentions changes to lists, digital experiences, and possibly an email alias. It might fit into Internal Project or Miscellaneous, but it could also involve Administrative Rights. There's a mention of escalating this to the Chief Digital Officer, which gives me more context. I need to assign a category.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nWithout additional context, it seems the best fit for this ticket could be \"Internal Project\" since it relates to digital experiences and lists. However, if the request touches on permissions for an alias or changes to notes, it might fit into \"Administrative Rights\" or \"Access.\" The mention of \"alias\" indicates it could involve email or user aliases. Given the user's intent to inform the Chief Digital Officer, I'll lean towards categorizing this as \"Internal Project.\"**Finalizing Ticket Classification**\n\nThe user's wording isn't straightforward, lacking clear phrases like \"reset password\" or \"grant access.\" Instead, it hints at escalation with \"please let chief digital officer.\" The request seems to involve making two changes to lists related to the \"digital experience.\" Given that the focus is on digital experience and aliases, I\u2019m leaning towards classifying this as \"Internal Project.\" Now, I\u2019ll respond in the required JSON-like format, ensuring I include \"Internal Project\" as the category value.**Formatting the Response**\n\nThe system needs me to categorize the IT ticket, as the user explicitly requested. Since I've determined the appropriate category is \"Internal Project,\" I\u2019ll format the response correctly. I'll produce just the necessary JSON structure that includes the category. Yes, it\u2019s straightforward: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Now I\u2019m ready to respond with that formatted output!"
