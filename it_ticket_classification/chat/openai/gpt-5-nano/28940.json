This sounds like it relates to access or permissions management, so I think the best category would be either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I'll likely go with \"Access.\"**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nSome workflows need \"Administrative rights\" to grant permissions. The user's request to \"make powwow add developers\" seems like they're asking to grant access rights for developers to Powwow. I think the best category is \"Access,\" as it relates to permissions. We need to respond with a JSON object that includes this category. The structure should look like this: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit as well, \"Access\" seems more appropriate for this request.**Confirming JSON format**\n\nThe required format for the response is a JSON object specifying the category. I need to provide it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"} and ensure I'm capitalizing it correctly to match the enumerated list. It's important to avoid any extra content since the API expects a clean output. The user specifically asked to categorize, so I\u2019ll stick to the straightforward response of just the category. Now, I am ready to proceed."
