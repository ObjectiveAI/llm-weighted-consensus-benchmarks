The potential categories include Internal Project or Miscellaneous, but it seems like this is a feature request primarily related to reporting. The user is essentially asking for a \"grade\" column to be added, which aligns more with reporting or analytics than with administrative rights or access issues.**Choosing the Right Category**\n\nI\u2019m examining the categories given: \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Access,\" and \"Hardware.\" Notably, there\u2019s no specific \"HR Support\", despite the ticket mentioning recruiters' performance and a grade column. The best fit seems to be either \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Given that this appears to be a feature request related to reporting, I think \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category. I'll format my response as a JSON object for clarity.**Deciding on the Category**\n\nI'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" since the request is about adding a column to a report, which feels like a feature request within an internal context. I need to ensure that the format matches the enum values, which include \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and so on, formatted correctly. The output should clearly be a JSON object stating the category. In this case, I'll go with {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} to keep it aligned with the schema!"
