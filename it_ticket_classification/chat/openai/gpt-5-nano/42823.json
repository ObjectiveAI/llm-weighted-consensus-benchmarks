The ticket's content focuses on issues with the absence calendar, such as allowed days and booked holidays. Since it's about the HR/absence system, the \"HR Support\" category seems to fit best. Although there are hints of access issues, the content is primarily related to HR, confirming that \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category here.**Finalizing category response**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize this IT ticket as \"Administrative rights,\" but it\u2019s more related to calendar display, not access rights. So, I'll respond with a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. The instructions are clear: only provide the category, and it aligns with the required format for a category object. Therefore, I\u2019ll deliver just that JSON response without additional information, matching the schema exactly: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}."
