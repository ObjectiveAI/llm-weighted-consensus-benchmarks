The ticket mentions Windows installation, PC issues, and some proxy problems, among other things. It seems to focus on software-related challenges, but \"Software\" isn't one of the allowed categories. Based on the content, I think the best fit could be \"Hardware\" due to the installation aspect, but \"Miscellaneous\" might also apply given the variety of issues mentioned. I'll go with \"Miscellaneous\" to cover all bases.**Choosing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm trying to figure out the best category for an IT ticket that discusses Windows installation and PC issues. There's a possibility of \"Hardware\" for physical components, but the mention of Windows installation leans towards software. \"Access\" could relate to login issues, and other categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Miscellaneous\" might apply too. However, since the ticket mainly addresses installation and PC problems, I'll lean towards \"Hardware,\" despite the ambiguity. It seems to be the best fit based on the content provided.{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
