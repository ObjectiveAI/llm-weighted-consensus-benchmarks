It seems to be hardware-related, which leads me to think \"Hardware\" is a suitable category. However, if this request involves purchasing a new monitor, it could also fit under \"Purchase.\" Since the user specifically asked for a category, \"Hardware\" appears to be the best choice since it's about a hardware item. I'll go with that!**Outputting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI see the lines mention \"automation process\" and \"tester,\" which suggests this is about requesting a second monitor for testing purposes. It\u2019s definitely hardware-related, so I plan to categorize it under \"Hardware.\" The instruction is clear: I need to create a JSON object with the category set to \"Hardware.\" \n\nTo ensure accuracy, I'll format it exactly as required: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. No extra text, just the straightforward JSON response. Let's do this!"
