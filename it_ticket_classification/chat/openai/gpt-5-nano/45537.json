Given the content focuses on document sharing permissions, I\u2019m torn between categorizing it as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" However, \"Access\" seems more fitting since it directly relates to editing rights for that specific document.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nFor the IT ticket categorization, \"Access\" seems like the most fitting option, though \"Administrative rights\" could work too. The instruction is clear: I need to choose one category. I'm going to go with \"Access.\" I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object using the specified schema, ensuring I include the category properly. So, the final output will look like this: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. This should meet the platform's requirements perfectly!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
