The phrase \"please log high priority feature\" indicates a feature request, possibly for an internal project. The mention of \u201caffected clients\u201d suggests it might relate to access control, but without a clear request for access elevation. \"Shared infra\" could imply Microsoft shared infrastructure, though I'm not entirely sure.**Categorizing internal project requests**\n\nI'm thinking this could fit under \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Parsing the details, it seems like they might be missing affected clients in the Microsoft Shared Infrastructure Project Manager. The repeated phrase \"affected clients\" stands out. The mention of \"logging\" reflects a feature request, and they've indicated some amendments were made but still lack affected clients. So, they want to log a high-priority feature request, clearly tying it to an internal infrastructure project. I'll categorize this as \"Internal Project.\"**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to create a JSON object to categorize according to the prompt instructions. The format shows that I should include a \"category\" property, and it can have several allowed values. Given the context, I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. I could consider \"Miscellaneous\" if I'm uncertain, but I\u2019m leaning towards \"Internal Project.\" So, I\u2019m keeping it concise and will respond with: \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
