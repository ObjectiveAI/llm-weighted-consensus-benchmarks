Since extension cords are hardware, that makes sense. But it could also be related to purchasing something as a prize in December. The idea of \"december prize\" might suggest it\u2019s for an Internal Project, but that feels unlikely. Overall, Hardware or Purchase seem most fitting.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIn the task of categorizing an IT ticket, \"extension cord\" clearly falls under hardware. The term \"prize\" could suggest it's a reward, but as an IT request, maybe it\u2019s a request for an extension cord to be used as a prize? It could fit into the \"Purchase\" or \"Internal Project\" categories too, but honestly, \"Hardware\" seems the most straightforward choice. Therefore, I'll present the category in the required JSON format without any extra text. Here\u2019s the response:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
