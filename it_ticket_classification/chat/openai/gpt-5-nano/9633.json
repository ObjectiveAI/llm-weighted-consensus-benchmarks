The categories to choose from are \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights.\" This ticket might fit under \"Administrative rights,\" as it could require permissions to change information in the system. However, it could also be considered \"Miscellaneous\" due to its sparse content. I'm wondering if they mean to change the name to \"Titans.\"**Deciding on ticket categorization**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize the ticket about changing the mailing name and address. I wonder if \"Administrative rights\" applies since it seems more about permissions. \"Miscellaneous\" might be a safer choice since the request isn\u2019t clearly tied to hardware, storage, purchase, HR support, or an internal project. \"Access\" could be relevant if it involves updating the directory, but that doesn't strictly relate to access control. Overall, I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit here.**Choosing the right category**\n\nI\u2019m deciding on the safest category for the ticket about changing the mailing name and address. The content suggests it\u2019s about updating records, but \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d usually pertains to tasks needing admin access, which isn\u2019t requested here. Since it feels more like a general request, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like the best fit. I\u2019ll suggest tagging it with \"Mailing address/name change\" and propose some clarifying questions. Finally, I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object with the chosen category."
