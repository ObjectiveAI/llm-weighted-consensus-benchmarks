It seems a bit messy but mentions integration, embedding code for pages, and streaming sessions. The category options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. After looking through the details, it appears most aligned with an \"Internal Project\" as it involves software development tasks like embedding pages and broadcasting. So, I'll choose \"Internal Project\" as the most suitable category.**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nThis task involves categorizing an IT ticket with a focus on \"integration\" and \"embed meetings pages.\" The user needs a specific JSON format with a category field. Based on the details, I'll confirm that the category is \"Internal Project.\" The response should be concise and comply with the required structure. I\u2019ll format it as: `{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}` to meet the platform's expectations for a plain text JSON object. Let's ensure the output is correct!"
