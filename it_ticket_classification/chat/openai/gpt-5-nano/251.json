The user seems to be requesting help with re-licensing and ensuring there's compliance across possibly hundreds of users. I need to clarify these details to assist properly.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user is referencing \"AD,\" which likely stands for Active Directory, and discussing the format of user names as \"name surname.\" They're possibly asking about reallocating licenses or something similar. Given these details, I need to categorize this IT ticket accurately. Based on the content, I think the appropriate category is \"Access,\" since it relates to user accounts and license distribution.
