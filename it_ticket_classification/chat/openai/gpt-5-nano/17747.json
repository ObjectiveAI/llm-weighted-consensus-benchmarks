The message seems to involve allocating someone named Maxim for Thursday PM as part of a contractual agreement. It's also hinting that a few people have recently left. \n\nFrom the available categories, it looks like this might fit under \"HR Support\" since it\u2019s about personnel and assignments. I'll go with that for classification.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI think the user might be requesting to allocate staff for onboarding due to a contract, mentioning phrases like \"per contractual agreement\" and \"assigned work.\" This makes it sound like it relates to staffing or access. \n\nAmong the categories available, I'm considering \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" or possibly \"Administrative rights.\" Since the user is asking for categorization, I need to output this as a JSON object reflecting the appropriate category based on the message context.**Deciding on category**\n\nThe content hints at wanting to \"allocate\" someone joining due to a \"contractual agreement,\" which makes me think it could relate to HR support or access. Onboarding typically involves granting access to systems, so \"Access\" might apply here. However, since it also mentions people leaving, it might relate to reallocating resources. \n\nIn the context of IT ticket categorization, I lean towards classifying this as \"HR Support\" or \"Access,\" since those fit with onboarding and staff changes.**Choosing category for access**\n\nThe text mentions \"per contractual agreement assigned work,\" which might indicate onboarding someone, possibly named Maxim, for Thursday PM. It seems like the request is to allocate Maxim to join, possibly due to staff changes. \n\nSince this includes granting user permissions, it could fit within \"Administrative rights.\" However, because it's about provisioning access for a new joiner, I think \"Access\" is the more appropriate category to choose. I'll go ahead with \"Access\" as the category for this IT ticket.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
