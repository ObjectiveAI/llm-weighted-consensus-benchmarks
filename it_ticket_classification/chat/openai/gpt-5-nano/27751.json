Since none of the other specific categories work, I\u2019ll go with \"Miscellaneous\" as the safest option for this general inspection task. This fits the requirement and keeps it flexible enough for varied contexts.**Formatting the category response**\n\nI need to respond with a category object that specifies the category of the IT ticket. The ticket describes a manager wanting to log a weekly visual inspection focused on safety and hazards, which isn't strictly IT but still relates to support. The best fit here is \"Miscellaneous\" since it's not strictly hardware or storage. Following the required format, I'll present the response as: {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}. This aligns perfectly with the provided schema for categorization!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
