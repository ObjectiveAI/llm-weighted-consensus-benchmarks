The focus is on items like projectors, audio mixers, and microphones. This seems to be all about purchasing hardware, so \"Purchase\" looks like the most fitting category. While \"Hardware\" could also apply, the emphasis on sourcing quotes suggests it's primarily a procurement issue. I'll choose \"Purchase\" and prepare a JSON-like category object."
