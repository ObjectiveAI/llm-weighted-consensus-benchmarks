The content refers to \"HR Support,\" which seems like a fitting category. There's mention of an \"administration officer,\" suggesting a point of contact for administrative processes. I think I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"HR Support,\" but I also consider \"Administrative rights\" if it's about user rights. The ticket details are somewhat unclear, but \"new starter\" definitely points to HR.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering that the user might need access provisioning for a new starter, which is part of onboarding. But since the prompt tells me to categorize the IT ticket, \"HR Support\" is the best fit given the mention of a \"new starter.\" So, I'll go ahead and categorize it as \"HR Support.\" I should respond with a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}, which clearly fits the required format and is concise."
