There are categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. The content highlights issues with wireless networks, guest passwords, changing passwords, and stored files that contain passwords, which points toward \"Access.\" Although \"Security\" is relevant, it isn't a category, so \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" would be the best fit for this ticket.**Determining the Category**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that the best category for this IT ticket is \"Access,\" since the main concerns are about accessing wireless networks, guest passwords, and password management. It could be seen as \"Administrative rights,\" but that's typically for elevated privileges, which doesn't fit here. Since this ticket primarily deals with access, I'll respond with a JSON object in the requested format, strictly providing the category as specified. Here\u2019s what that looks like: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
