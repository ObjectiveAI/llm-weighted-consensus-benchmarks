Given the categories available, \u201cHardware\u201d seems to be the best fit for this situation!**Formatting IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for the IT ticket. \"Administrative rights\"? Nope. \"Internal Project\"? No. \"Access\"? Not really. \"Miscellaneous\"? Too broad. It's definitely more about hardware. So, I\u2019ll go with \"Hardware\" as the category.\n\nThe user specifically asked to categorize the ticket and I need to follow the exact JSON format specified. The formatted response will be as follows:\n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}\n\nI just need to ensure I adhere to the formatting requirements and deliver it as plain text!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
