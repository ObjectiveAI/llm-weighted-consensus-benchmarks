Given our category options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights,\" it seems to fit best under either \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\" Typically, onboarding involves providing system access, which leans towards \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I'll pick the most relevant category to ensure proper handling.**Analyzing IT ticket details**\n\nThe phrase \"new starter on July Wednesday\" seems to refer to onboarding a new employee, possibly in Los Angeles or Singapore. The categories available don\u2019t have \"HR\" alone, but there is an \"HR Support\" option. Onboarding typically falls under HR, yet the IT aspect suggests it may still relate to \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I need to decide which of these categories fits best, considering the user's request to categorize this ticket.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe content refers to a \"new starter,\" indicating the potential need for provisioning access. The timing is unclear, but I believe \"Access\" is the most relevant category, as it pertains to enabling system access for the new employee. Although \"Administrative rights\" could be applicable if specific admin access is needed, there's also a case for \"HR Support\" due to onboarding processes. Since the user asked for categorization for triage, I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" and format the output as a JSON object.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
