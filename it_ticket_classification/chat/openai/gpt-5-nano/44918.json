It seems to describe an issue with Outlook calendar availability not showing information, specifically regarding seeing availability for colleagues. The user also mentions adding meeting invites and provides a snapshot. Since the content relates to calendar access, it likely falls under \"Access\" or perhaps \"Administrative rights.\" There's also a hint that \"Software\" might be relevant, though it's not in the provided categories. Let's categorize this correctly.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe user wants to categorize an IT ticket and has provided specific categories to choose from. The issue seems to relate to Outlook calendar availability, which could fit under either \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Since it deals with seeing others' calendar availability, \"Access\" makes the most sense, as it often covers issues related to permissions and access to systems. However, \"Administrative rights\" might be relevant if the user needs to modify permissions. The mention of \"no information on availability\" suggests it ties back to calendar sharing.**Responding with JSON Category**\n\nI need to respond to the user by providing a JSON object that includes the appropriate category for the IT ticket. It looks like \"Access\" is the best fit since the issue revolves around visibility and permissions related to calendar availability. While \"Miscellaneous\" could be an option for a more general issue, I'll stick with \"Access\" because it aligns better with the problem. I'll format my response according to the specified schema, ensuring there's no extra text outside the JSON. Here\u2019s the response: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
