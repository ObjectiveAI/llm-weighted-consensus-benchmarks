The ticket mentions \"approval access\" and \"approve opportunities contracts,\" which is a bit unclear. Since the user wants to categorize this IT ticket and produce a JSON object, I\u2019m interpreting it as seeking \"Access\" approval for opportunities or contracts. However, it might also fit under \"Administrative rights\" if they\u2019re requesting admin permissions.**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe phrases \"approval access\" and \"approve opportunities contracts\" suggest that the user is seeking approval for accessing or approving those contracts or opportunities. It could also relate to granting access for someone at \"Old Broad Street.\" Given the context, I'll classify the ticket under \"Access\" as the safest option. According to the instruction, I need to respond with just the JSON object formatted as follows: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll make sure to deliver only that."
