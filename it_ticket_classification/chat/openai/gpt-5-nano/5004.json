The available categories are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The user's request mentions reports, automatic templates, and patching clients. \n\nHmm, it could fit under \"Internal Project\" or maybe \"Miscellaneous.\" \"Administrative rights\" doesn't apply here since it\u2019s about permissions. I think \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit for this situation.**Selecting IT ticket category**\n\nI'm reviewing the IT ticket and noting that it doesn't relate to hardware, storage, HR, or purchases. It's more about patching clients, which refers to software updates, and reporting status. The categories I might consider are \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\"\n\nGiven that the user mentioned an \"automatic template\" for monthly reporting, it leans towards being an automation task. I believe categorizing it as \"Internal Project\" makes the most sense since it focuses on streamlining the reporting process.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe user is asking me to categorize an IT ticket, which means I need to format my response as a small JSON object. The category should follow the schema provided, which specifies that it can only include specific categories like \"Internal Project.\" \n\nSince the content mentions patching clients, logs, and reports but doesn\u2019t indicate a request for access, I'm confident that \"Internal Project\" is the best choice. So, I\u2019ll respond with the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}."
