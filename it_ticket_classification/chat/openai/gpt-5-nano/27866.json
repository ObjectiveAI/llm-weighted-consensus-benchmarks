Although \"Hardware\" could apply, it feels more about networking configuration. The main focus appears to be on connecting circuits and cables, which leans more towards \"Internal Project\" as it fits the task description well.**Classifying IT tickets**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the existing categories: Hardware, Storage, Purchase, Administrative rights, Access, HR Support, Internal Project, and Miscellaneous. For something like \"setup backup link and secondary circuit,\" it seems to fit under \"Internal Project\" given the focus on network setup. If I need to categorize this IT ticket, I should follow the schema provided and return a JSON object. Based on my assessment, the right category would be {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
