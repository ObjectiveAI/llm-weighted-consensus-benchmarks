It mentions things like endpoints protected by a license key and extending the subscription. This seems related to licensing or subscription issues, which doesn't perfectly fit under hardware. It could relate to Purchase for license subscriptions, but \"Licensing\" or \"Software\" isn't in the allowed categories. I should choose the best option.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI believe the closest category for the IT ticket is \"Purchase\" since it ties to extending a subscription and acquiring more licenses. Other possible options could be \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Purchase\" feels like the best fit. I need to respond in JSON format as per instructions. The category must match exactly, and I can't forget to produce it as a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. I\u2019ll keep it concise and follow the format!{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
