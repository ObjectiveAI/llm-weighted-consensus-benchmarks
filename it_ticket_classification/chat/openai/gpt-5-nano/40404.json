The ticket indicates a wired connection issue, so it seems related to hardware. While \"Internal Project\" isn\u2019t applicable, and \"Access\" doesn\u2019t fit either, I\u2019m considering \"Miscellaneous\" as a general option, but it feels too vague. It appears the closest fit for this ticket is \"Hardware,\" particularly since the problem may involve the physical network interface card or cable. So, I'll categorize it as Hardware.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe user has asked me to categorize the IT ticket, and I'm considering my options. I think \"Miscellaneous\" is a fallback if nothing fits precisely, but \"Hardware\" seems to be the best fit since it's a hardware or network issue. I need to format the response as a proper JSON object based on the provided schema. Since \"Hardware\" is my chosen category, I\u2019ll present it as: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This is concise and to the point, which I believe is what the user needs."
