It could fit into various categories, such as \"HR Support,\" since it relates directly to employee departure procedures, or \"Access\" for managing account access. Given the context, my best bet would be to classify it under \"HR Support.\"**Classifying an IT Ticket**\n\nThe content primarily discusses a \"leaver form\" and the submission process related to contractor offboarding, indicating it might deal with account access removal. While \"HR Support\" seems to be the most fitting category due to the focus on offboarding, \"Access\" could also apply since it pertains to access revocation, and \"Administrative rights\" might be relevant if it's about rights management. Given all this, I'll classify it as \"HR Support\" and prepare to respond with a JSON object for categorization.**Formatting the Response**\n\nThe instruction specifies a schema for the response, so I need to provide a JSON object. The ticket relates to a \"leaver contractor\" and mentions a \"leaver form,\" indicating it's HR-related. Thus, the appropriate category is \"HR Support.\" \n\nI\u2019ll structure the response as: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} with valid JSON formatting and ensure I\u2019m not adding unnecessary explanations since the instruction only asks for categorization. Let\u2019s keep it straightforward!"
