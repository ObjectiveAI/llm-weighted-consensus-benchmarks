It could fit under \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"please provide report\" indicates it\u2019s likely not about hardware or storage. The text is pretty sparse, making it tough to classify. Still, the mention of \"infrastructure\" hints that it might be more aligned with an \"Internal Project\" since it's about reporting within a project context. Although, given the vagueness, \"Miscellaneous\" might be safer. I\u2019ll weigh both options carefully.**Choosing the ticket category**\n\nWe need to categorize the ticket, and my instinct is to go with \"Internal Project\" since it's related to infrastructure and involves a report request. \"Miscellaneous\" might be a safer option, given some ambiguity in the ticket's content, but it seems less fitting. I'll aim to output a simple JSON object that states the category, leaning towards \"Internal Project.\" The mention of \"infrastructure\" strongly indicates this is the right path. The category schema is clear on what to include, so I\u2019ll keep it concise.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
