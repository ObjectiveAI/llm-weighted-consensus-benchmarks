The ticket mentions making fields on candidate profiles mandatory and involves editing profiles for existing candidates. It likely relates to HR processes. HR Support seems to fit this ticket best, but there might also be elements of Administrative rights due to permissions and system configurations. Internal Project could apply too, but \"HR Support\" is my best guess for categorization right now.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m trying to categorize this ticket, but it doesn\u2019t seem to fit hardware, storage, purchase, or access. The mention of making fields mandatory relates more to HR processes. The request is quite messy: they want to log about editing candidate profiles and making certain fields mandatory while allowing later information addition. This suggests it's about HR recruitment profile configuration. I'll likely categorize it as \u201cHR Support,\u201d but \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could also apply due to the user permissions aspect.**Finalizing Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm concluding that \"HR Support\" is the closest category for this ticket. I want to create a JSON object for clarity, which should just have the \"category\" property. The proper response format is: `{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}`. \n\nSince the prompt clearly asks for an IT ticket categorization, I think it would be best to present this simply as a JSON object. It fits since the ticket is about candidate profile fields. So that\u2019s my final response!"
