This text is quite disjointed, but it mentions \u201cforwarding for leaver,\u201d which suggests it relates to email forwarding for employees leaving.\n\nIt seems linked to access or possibly administrative rights. Given the context, my best guess would be to categorize it as \"Access\". I'll format this in JSON.**Determining the ticket category**\n\nI have a few options for categorizing this ticket. \"Access\" deals with system access rights, while \"Administrative rights\" refers to admin privileges, and \"HR Support\" involves HR processes. The phrase \"forwarding for leaver\" hints at setting up email forwarding for someone who left, possibly involving both configuring forwarding and removing access. \n\nIt seems to lean towards \"Administrative rights\" because it involves modifying user accounts. However, given that it's about email management, \"Access\" also fits for deprovisioning. I'll go with \"Access\" for this ticket.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
