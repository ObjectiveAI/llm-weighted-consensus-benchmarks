The ticket content is messy, mentioning project code updates, unpaid leave, and absence issues in the schedule calendar. It seems to revolve around HR Support regarding unpaid leave, but since it's an IT ticket, it mainly fits into \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" I need to ensure I clarify to categorize it correctly based on these points.**Classifying IT ticket details**\n\nThis IT ticket is about system updates like adding codes, reflecting leave in the calendar, and managing absence schedules. Looking at the categories, it could fit under \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access.\" The ticket mentions adding project codes and updating unpaid leave, which relates to the HR system. There's also a reference to calendar integration, making it likely that we should classify it as \"HR Support\" due to its focus on unpaid leave and absence management.**Identifying IT ticket category**\n\nThis IT ticket involves updating the system to reflect unpaid leave in the calendar, which falls under HR processes. The most fitting category is \"HR Support,\" as it directly pertains to HR-related issues. Although \"Administrative rights\" exists, it's not relevant here, and \"Internal Project\" could apply if it involved updating a project code. The primary focus is on unpaid leave and absence scheduling, so I should categorize this ticket as \"HR Support\" and prepare a JSON response accordingly.**Preparing JSON response**\n\nThe prompt instructs me to categorize an IT ticket and output only the category in the specified JSON format. I should provide it as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} since that's the correct category. I need to ensure I quote the category string exactly as it's mentioned, without any extra explanations since the instruction is clear. The platform may expect plain text, but I\u2019ll stick to the provided schema and deliver the JSON response as required."
