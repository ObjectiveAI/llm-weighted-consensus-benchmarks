The phrases \u201caccess to March PM\u201d or \u201cPM March\u201d suggest this is about permissions. Given the context, the best categories to choose from are \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll lean toward \"Access\" since it seems to focus on a request for access rights.**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've realized that \"module\" clearly refers to something specific. The mention of \"administrative rights\" is likely about access permissions related to a module. Given the limited details, it makes the most sense to categorize it under \"Access,\" as it's broader. The request does touch on \"access,\" \"module,\" and maybe interpreting \"leader\" as a manager.\n\nI need to make sure I follow the correct JSON format for the response. I\u2019ll structure the output as instructed: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's confirm that I'm providing exactly what\u2019s required!**Delivering Category Format**\n\nI see that the response format specifies returning a JSON object. It should strictly contain the \"category\" key with the value \"Access.\" I need to ensure there\u2019s no extraneous type wrapper since the task just requires the category itself, which should look like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.\n\nWhile I thought about adding a note, it seems the instruction is clear about not including any extra text. So I\u2019ll focus on just delivering the category in the proper format. Let\u2019s go with that!"
