The key items include terms like \"service recovery test,\" \"disaster recovery,\" and \"restore.\" \n\nSo, I need to look at the categories I have: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. With this context, it seems most closely related to the \"Miscellaneous\" category due to its focus on documentation and disaster recovery tests. I'll prepare a JSON output with that category indicated.**Categorizing ticket as Internal Project**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize this ticket related to a disaster recovery test program. It might fit under \"Internal Project\" because it mentions ongoing tasks like \"annual service recovery test\" and \"documentation.\" While \"Miscellaneous\" is a safe choice, \"Internal Project\" feels more specific and accurate. The ticket involves templates, tests, and detailed documentation. I\u2019m going to prepare my output as a JSON object to show the category as \"Internal Project.\" Here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}**Formatting output as JSON**\n\nThe instructions are clear: I need to provide the final answer in a specific JSON format with a \"category\" field. It seems they were looking for just the JSON object without any additional justification or explanations. Since they didn\u2019t request a lengthy response, I will keep it concise and straightforward. The content type should be \"application/json,\" but I\u2019ll focus on delivering just the text output. Here it is in the required format:\n\n{\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}"
