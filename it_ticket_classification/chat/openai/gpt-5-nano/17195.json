Given the context, the most fitting category appears to be \"Access\" since it involves credentials. While \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, \"Access\" captures the essence of the request better, as the main focus is on getting credentials for this new starter.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe message mentions a new starter in Bucharest who needs help with credentials, along with an attached form. This seems to indicate it's about onboarding, which makes \"Access\" the best fit since it relates to credentials. I\u2019ll create a JSON-like category object with just the necessary information. According to the instructions, it should simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I\u2019ll ensure the formatting is correct and avoid any extra text. Let's deliver that!"
