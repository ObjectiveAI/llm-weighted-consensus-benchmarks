The mention of \"tools reports shared custom ledger\" is a bit unclear, but \"activate\" seems to point to needing access or permission. So, I'm thinking the best fit for this ticket would likely be the \"Access\" category.**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m parsing the message, which is a bit of a jumble but includes \"activate him.\" This likely points to user access, making \"Access\" the fitting category. It could potentially be \"Administrative rights,\" but \"activate\" clearly indicates access needs. So, I\u2019ll prepare to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category as \"Access.\" Keeping it concise, I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra text. I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
