The categories available are \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The request is specifically about editing rights, which suggests it falls under \"Administrative rights.\" However, since \"Access\" is a more general term for permissions, I'd say it could also work. But ultimately, I think categorizing it as \"Administrative rights\" makes more sense given the user's specific request.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nIn IT ticket taxonomy, the \"Access\" category typically refers to requests for system or data access, while \"Administrative rights\" specifically grants privileges to modify systems. The user\u2019s request is for editing rights to a folder, which falls under either category. I think \"Administrative rights\" is ultimately more precise since it clearly relates to editing privileges. However, the mention of \"access Wednesday\" has me wondering if time is a factor too. Still, I\u2019d lean towards \"Administrative rights\" for this ticket.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
