Although \"Administrative rights\" could apply if there's a policy issue, \"Access\" seems like the best fit.**Crafting JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m getting ready to create a JSON response for the user\u2019s IT ticket categorization. The format requires me to provide a JSON object with a \"category\" property. Based on the context, I\u2019ll use \"Access\" as the category, since it fits the issue described.\n\nMy final response should be straightforward and look like this: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I need to keep it clean, without any extra text, just to avoid any potential confusion. So, let's output this now!"
