The mention of \"multiple addresses\" suggests the user might want to manage aliases for convenience. Given that the user asked to categorize this IT ticket, I\u2019m considering \u201cAccess\u201d as the best fit since it relates to account permissions and management rights. I could propose this category and maybe ask a clarifying question if needed.**Categorizing access request**\n\nI\u2019m considering that if the user mentions enabling releases and deleting after days, it could be about \"Administrative rights\" related to admin privileges. The ticket refers to a \"new quarantine account,\" managing quarantined items, and aliases, which makes me think this ties into security and access control. Since it pertains to user accounts and privileges, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Access\" and provide a justification. Finally, I'll output a JSON object reflecting that category.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
