It mentions \"line management,\" \"oracle,\" \"change,\" and \"resource,\" which is pretty unclear. It could relate to \"Access\" to Oracle or possibly \"Administrative rights\" for changing permissions. There's a chance it aligns with \"HR Support\" because of the mention of \"line management.\" However, the context fits more with access rights, so I think it should be categorized under \"Administrative rights.\"**Interpreting ticket details**\n\nI think the mention of \"oracle\" likely refers to the Oracle database. The phrase \"wrong line management oracle thursday november\" might indicate the user wants to change a line manager in the Oracle HR system. When I parse through the message, it suggests updating the line manager for a specific resource in Oracle. Since this request leans towards changing HR details, it feels most appropriate to categorize it under \"HR Support\" or maybe \"Administrative rights,\" which are both relevant here.**Categorizing request**\n\nI\u2019m considering the terms \u201cchange\u201d and \u201cresource.\u201d They might relate to \"change management,\" but with \"line management,\" it seems more linked to HR. The user is likely looking to change the line manager for a resource in Oracle, making \"HR Support\" the right category. Their phrase could be interpreted as a request to change the line manager, reinforcing my choice. Although \u201cInternal Project\u201d is a possibility, it doesn't fit this context. I need to provide the output in a proper JSON format.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
