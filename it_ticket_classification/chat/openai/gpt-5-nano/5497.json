The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I need to think about the details of the ticket to figure out which category fits best. It's important that I choose the right category to ensure that the ticket gets handled properly. Let's consider the specifics so I can decide!**Identifying the ticket category**\n\nThe ticket text refers to a \"maternity leaver inventory update\" and repeatedly asks for help with the maternity leaver form. It seems clear this is related to an HR process for maternity leave. Given the context, it sounds like it should fit best under the \"HR Support\" category. I want to ensure that the ticket is categorized correctly to facilitate a prompt response. Let's go ahead and label it as HR Support!**Categorizing the IT ticket correctly**\n\nI see that \"HR Support\" is an appropriate category for this ticket regarding a maternity leaver form. While there are other categories like \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access,\" the content indicates internal communication related to HR processes. It\u2019s important I categorize it accurately to facilitate the right support. I\u2019ll output a JSON object in the required format with the category set to \"HR Support.\" So, let\u2019s respond with:\n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}**Preparing the final output**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to respond with the category in the specified JSON format. I want to make sure I get this right, so I'll craft the final response carefully. I\u2019ll keep it simple and straight to the point\u2014no extra text. The finished output will just be the JSON object reflecting the category. Here goes:  \n\n{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
