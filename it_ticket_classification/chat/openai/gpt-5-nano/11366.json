The ticket in question is asking to restrict access to a secure tower area, indicating high importance and that it should be done by the close of business. This seems to fit into either the \"Access\" category or \"Administrative rights\" since it involves permissions and controlling access to resources. I'll likely categorize it under \"Access.\"**Categorizing IT ticket access**\n\nIn categorizing IT tickets, modifications related to access control could fit into the \"Access\" category. However, there's only one category field available. Since the ticket focuses on \"restrict access\" to a specific area, choosing \"Access\" is most appropriate. While \"Administrative rights\" could be relevant for privileges, this request is more about general access control rather than admin rights. I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object with the category set to \"Access.\"{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
