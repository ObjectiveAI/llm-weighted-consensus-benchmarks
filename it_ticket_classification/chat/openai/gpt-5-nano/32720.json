The instructions I have suggest that I should classify this under the \"Access\" category. So my response will be a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It clearly fits into that category.**Determining the Right Category**\n\nI\u2019m thinking it might also fit under \"HR Support\" since it mentions a starter application, but it really relates to enabling access for the new starter, which leans more towards IT. The categories do include \"Access,\" which is specifically about provisioning, so that seems like the best choice. The output format asks for just the category in JSON, so I'll go with {\"category\":\"Access\"} while ensuring the capitalization matches exactly as required. Let's get that delivered!"
