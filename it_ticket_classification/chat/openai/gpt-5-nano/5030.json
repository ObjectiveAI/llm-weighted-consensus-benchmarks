The ticket discusses an intern leaving in October and their accounts being canceled after receiving a job offer. I can choose from categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" It seems fitting to label this ticket under \"HR Support\" since it relates to the intern's departure and the associated processes. I'll prepare a JSON object with the correct category value to fit the schema.**Choosing the right category**\n\nThe user mentions \"leaver form intern\" and \"accounts canceled,\" indicating that IT needs to close accounts due to the intern leaving. \"Access\" seems like the most fitting category since it's about account cancellation. While \"HR Support\" could also apply, this ticket is primarily IT-focused. I\u2019ll go with \"Access\" and prepare the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Even though a note might be useful, I'll stick to the instruction and keep the output focused on the category only."
