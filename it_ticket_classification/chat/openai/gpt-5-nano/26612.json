The ticket text is quite confusing: \"new pas oracle duplicated person november pm duplicated person hi please both believe duplication his name please ensure remaining same second also confusing display name done avoid future help thanks officer.\" \n\nIt's really garbled, and I need to clarify it to sort it correctly.**Interpreting IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket mentions: \"new pas oracle duplicated person,\" which I interpret to mean \"new password\" and possibly refers to a user reporting duplicate entries in Oracle. The repetition of \"duplicated person\" signals confusion, particularly with \"display name\" and ensuring it remains the same. This seems to be a request for assistance regarding duplicate user accounts and display name issues. I consider categorizing this under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" given the context of permissions and login issues.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket is about user duplication and a confusing display name, likely relating to account duplicates in Oracle, a software system. This seems to impact user access and identity, so it fits well in the \"Access\" category, rather than \"Administrative rights,\" which is more about managing user accounts. Based on this understanding, I think the best categorization would indeed be \"Access.\" I\u2019ll respond with the category in the specified JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. No additional text needed."
