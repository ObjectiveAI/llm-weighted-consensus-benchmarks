Since they didn't mention needing admin rights, it seems they're just asking for regular access. So, \"Access\" is the right category. I'll format my response as a JSON object according to the schema: it needs to include \"category\" with the value \"Access.\" \n\nSo the final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}**Clarifying access category**\n\nI want to make sure I correctly interpret that the request falls under the \"Access\" category. This is because it involves granting a new recruit access to both a shared mailbox and folder storage. It\u2019s clear, so I\u2019ll keep my response focused on just that and ensure it\u2019s formatted properly. This clarity in categorization helps avoid confusion later, right? So, I\u2019ll deliver that information straightforwardly."
