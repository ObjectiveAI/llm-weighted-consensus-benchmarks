The categories include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. Since this is about submitting leaves, it's mainly an HR function. However, it could also involve Access or Administrative Rights if it's about permissions or login issues. I think the best fit is HR Support, given the context.**Categorizing IT Ticket for JSON Output**\n\nThe user mentioned \"cannot submit annual leave,\" which clearly indicates an HR issue, so I should categorize this as \"HR Support.\" Since the user specifically asked me to categorize the IT ticket, I need to format my response as a JSON object according to the provided schema. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. This ensures I meet the requirements without adding any extra text. I\u2019ll ensure the punctuation is correct and deliver the valid JSON output!**Deciding on Output Format**\n\nThe instructions clearly indicate that I should focus solely on the categorization. While I could potentially add some extra text, it seems safer to stick to just providing the JSON output. Since the system may parse this response with code, it's best to keep it as straightforward as possible. I\u2019ll just deliver the JSON object for clarity and avoid any confusion. So, I\u2019ll make sure to respond efficiently with just the necessary information!"
