The user describes intermittent connectivity, saying other sites work and that they require access to client resources. Given this context, it seems to fit best in the \"Access\" category since the problems center around accessing the site, making it a networking or web access issue.**Evaluating IT Ticket Category**\n\nI think the \"Access\" category fits this ticket best, given the user's description. They mention \"site cannot be reached\" and that issues began after an update. The phrasing feels a bit inconsistent, like \"site can be reached,\" but core points suggest the need for client resources, and that sites work during connectivity. It's possible the problem relates to VPN or remote access, but leaning towards \"Access\" due to the focus on site availability is likely most accurate.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
