The user provided a rather messy ticket text that mentions several things, like Oracle time estimation, entering calendar dates, and database issues. The user is looking for help with data input and solving the problem. Considering the context, this likely fits into HR Support or Miscellaneous, focusing on the confusion regarding leave and data entry.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm trying to categorize a data entry issue related to an Oracle database. Initially, I thought it might fit \"Administrative rights,\" but that doesn't seem right. \"Internal Project\" feels relevant because it mentions a senior consultant. Since it's about accessing and entering data, \"Access\" could work too, though it's primarily about data input.\n\nHowever, since it covers various aspects, I think \"Miscellaneous\" might be the safest bet if nothing fits perfectly, but \"Internal Project\" really seems to align with the context.{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
