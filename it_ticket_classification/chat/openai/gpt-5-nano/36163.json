The description suggests it's likely a hardware problem, possibly related to the cable. The best fit is the \"Hardware\" category, even though \"Miscellaneous\" could also work. I'll format the response as a JSON object with the category property. The final output should simply be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I might also consider proposing a subcategory.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nThe instruction is clear: \"Categorize this IT Ticket,\" and for similar tasks, I should output just the category. That will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I need to make sure the formatting is correct, including the newline. The user's text about the monitor seems repetitive but still points to a hardware issue. Yes, \"Hardware\" is definitely the best category here. So, I\u2019ll stick with that decision and provide the response neatly."
