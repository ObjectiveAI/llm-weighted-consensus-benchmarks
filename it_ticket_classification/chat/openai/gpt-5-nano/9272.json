Since the request includes \"extension cords,\" it seems to fit best under \"Hardware\" or possibly \"Purchase.\" Given that it's about hardware items, I think \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate category. I'll respond with a JSON object containing this chosen category.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI've determined that the appropriate category for the ticket is \"Hardware.\" While \"Purchase\" could fit since the user is requesting extension cords, \"Hardware\" is more suitable because it's focused on hardware-related requests. They mention needing to log something, possibly for inventory, but the main request centers on the extension cords. To follow the format strictly, I'll respond with this JSON object: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Let's keep it clear and concise as specified!**Confirming the category output**\n\nThe final output needs to be a JSON object with the \"category\" property specified as a string. So, I\u2019ll go ahead and respond with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This keeps everything straightforward and matches the instructions perfectly. I feel good about this decision, as it aligns with the information we have. Yes, this looks right! Let's ensure we stick to the required format with no extra words."
