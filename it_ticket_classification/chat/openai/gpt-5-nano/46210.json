Since it revolves around project scripts, it seems \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category. It's clearly connected to server management and project work.**Assessing category for IT ticket**\n\nIt doesn't seem like a hardware failure issue since the user mentions that \"servers keep turning off\" and references \"shutdown scripts.\" This points more towards operations or scripting. The possible categories include \"Administrative rights,\" which might apply if they need permissions to modify scripts; \"Access,\" but that's about login rights, which isn't the case. \"Internal Project\" could fit well as this involves server project scripts. Alternatively, I could consider \"Miscellaneous\" for a more generic IT ticket. I need to pick the most appropriate category.**Interpreting the IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket includes a series of messages about server project scripts, mentioning issues like \"action failed\" and servers turning off. It seems related to adjusting shutdown scripts due to daylight changes, clearly fitting within a specific project context. Based on this information, \"Internal Project\" definitely appears to be the right category for this issue. So, I should respond with the JSON format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"} and ensure I'm following the instruction to categorize the IT ticket properly."
