The user seems to want access for a planning review meeting scheduled for Friday afternoon in February. The key ideas here are access, timing, and member participation, suggesting it relates to an access issue for the meeting. Based on the categories provided, it looks like \u201cAccess\u201d is the most fitting category, considering their request.**Determining the category**\n\nIt looks like I should categorize this ticket as \"Access\" since it relates to gaining access for a planning review. However, it could also fit under \"Internal Project\" if it's specifically for an internal planning review. The line about wanting members to come onto the meeting and accept or decline implies they're managing attendance and RSVPs. Since the emphasis is on access rights, \"Access\" seems to be the best category, overshadowing the others.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
