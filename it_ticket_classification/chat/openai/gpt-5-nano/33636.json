The list includes categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others. The user mentions \"purchase request,\" \"approved,\" and \"log installation,\" which tips me towards the \"Purchase\" category since it's related to procurement. Installation also suggests software or hardware, but I'd stick with \"Purchase\" as the best fit. Now, I\u2019ll prepare a JSON response including the category field.**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that categorizes the IT Ticket. The chosen category is \"Purchase,\" and I want to make sure the format is consistent with what the system expects. So, my response will be: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It's important to confirm that no extra content is needed, as the instructions specify to only deliver this category object. I\u2019ll now proceed to send the response as outlined."
