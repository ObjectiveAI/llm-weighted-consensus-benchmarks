The categories available are Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. It seems the ticket involves issues related to sending something or errors reported by a frontend developer. It could fit under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" Access could also be relevant if there are access issues. Since the user didn't ask clarifying questions, I'll choose a category for them.**Determining category for ticket**\n\nI think I should propose a category for the IT ticket based on the user's request. They likely want a single category, so I could suggest either \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" Given that this involves a Front End Developer and mentions \"errors on sent Wednesday,\" it suggests issues with internal project communications, maybe even email sending problems. \"Internal Project\" fits best since it relates specifically to a project rather than general IT issues. So I'll categorize it as \"Internal Project.\"**Formatting category output**\n\nI\u2019m preparing to provide the category in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. It's important to ensure the output matches the specified structure. The instruction clearly states that I need to respond with the category string, so I'll stick to just that without adding any extra notes. The \"category\" field must be \"Internal Project,\" which is valid. To keep it straightforward, I'll finalize the output as {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let's deliver that!"
