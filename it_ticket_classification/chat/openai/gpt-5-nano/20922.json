The user's ticket is a bit jumbled, mentioning \"zone awards,\" \"location drop-down,\" and asking \"how done.\" This seems to be a request related to adding a location drop-down for zone awards, likely in an internal system. Since it involves adding functionality, it could fall under \"Administrative rights,\" which might require admin access to implement.**Categorizing IT requests**\n\nIt seems like this user is asking for help with enabling a drop-down field in a system, which could fit into several categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Access.\" The user, being a Managing Director, is asking \"how done\" for adding the zone awards location drop-down. While it might involve admin rights, it also seems like a configuration task. So, I should pick either \"Administrative rights\" or \"Internal Project\" for the category to classify this IT ticket appropriately.**Choosing the category**\n\nI need to format the output as a JSON-like object with a category. \"Internal Project\" seems like a good fit since it involves adding a UI drop-down for the \"zone awards location,\" which might be part of an internal application. However, the user didn't specifically mention a project, and \"Access\" could work if it relates to allowing the drop-down, but they didn't mention access rights either. Given the ambiguity, \"Miscellaneous\" might be a safe option. It feels tricky, but I'll classify it accordingly.**Deciding on the category**\n\nThe content of the user's request revolves around a UI drop-down for the \"zone awards\" tool. This looks like a feature request or configuration task rather than something related to hardware, storage, or purchasing. I think \"Internal Project\" fits best since it involves implementing a feature in an internal system. So, I\u2019ll go with that. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object to finalize it: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let\u2019s do this!"
