Given the context, I think this request fits best into the \"Access\" category since it primarily deals with user permissions and account accessibility. I want to make sure I\u2019m precise since categorization is important for efficiently addressing the user's needs. I\u2019ll confirm the categorization.**Deciding on category**\n\nI need to figure out the right category for this content. It mentions a password reset for an external user, expiration details, and high importance. The mention of \"ctrl alt delete\" implies computer access. \n\nI think the best fit is \"Access,\" as it deals with user permissions and password resets. It might also touch on \"Administrative rights\" due to the nature of the request regarding potential changes or privileges. Overall, \"Access\" feels like the strongest option!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
