The focus seems to be on hardware related to servers. I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" or maybe \"Internal Project,\" but \"Administrative rights\" doesn't fit. \"Miscellaneous\" could also work, but the mention of decommission makes me hesitate. It's tricky!**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering how to categorize an IT ticket about servers with a focus on prolongation and decommissioning timelines. It could fit under \"Internal Project\" since it suggests a project around decommissioning servers, or \"Hardware\" since it's about hardware lifecycle. The grammar is a bit odd, but it feels like it's referencing hardware. Since this is about the physical servers being decommissioned, I think \"Hardware\" makes the most sense for classification.**Finalizing category response**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket text where \"servers prolongation\" and \"estimated decommission date\" suggest we're discussing a schedule for server decommissioning. There's a hint at virtual machines with \"instances prolonged,\" but it's primarily a chat snippet regarding delays. After considering options, \"Administrative rights\" doesn't fit, and \"Storage\" isn't quite right either. I conclude that \"Hardware\" is most suitable. \n\nSo, I'll respond with the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Keeping it straightforward, no extra text needed!"
