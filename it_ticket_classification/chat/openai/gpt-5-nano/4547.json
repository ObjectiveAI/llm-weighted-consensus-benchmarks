This falls under user access provisioning and permissions. I\u2019m considering two categories: \u201cAccess\u201d seems broad enough, while \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could also apply since it directly relates to permissions. I think \"Access\" fits best overall.**Deciding on IT ticket category**\n\nI'm pondering whether to categorize the IT ticket as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The user's message suggests they're requesting access with \"same permissions\" as someone else. It doesn't clearly indicate a need for admin rights, so it's likely just a standard access request. I think \"Access\" fits best for this situation. I'll format my response as a JSON object with \"category\" set to \"Access\" to meet the required structure. Here it is: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
