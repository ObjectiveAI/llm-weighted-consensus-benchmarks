However, it could also be an \"Internal Project\" since it refers to \"project friday.\" \n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"Hardware\" due to the installation aspect. The user seems to be looking for a link to find more information for the PC installation.**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nIt seems the user may want instructions or a download link related to their request. Since this involves PC installation, I'm leaning towards categorizing it as \"Hardware.\" Other options like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" don't fit well here. \n\nI'll respond with a JSON object specifying \"Hardware\" as the category. I\u2019ll make sure to keep it straightforward and ensure the format is correct: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. This captures the essence of their request clearly!"
