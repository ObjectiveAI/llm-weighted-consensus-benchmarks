The ticket text is quite messy, mentioning \u201curgent procurement preparer role\u201d and \u201cenable same role,\u201d suggesting it deals with access rights for user roles. It could fit under Access due to the role permissions but also possibly under Purchase because it involves procurement and purchase requisitions. I'll need to clarify its primary focus to pick the best category.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIt seems the ticket is about granting access to a role named \"procurement preparer,\" which deals with purchase requisitions. This likely fits into either the \"Access\" or \"Purchase\" categories. Given that it\u2019s focused on user roles and permissions, \"Access\" feels more appropriate here. However, since it mentions \"purchase requisitions,\" it has a purchasing element. Still, for categorization, I'll choose \"Access\" and provide a brief justification that it\u2019s primarily about permissions. \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
