The ticket requests installation tasks and involves logging work, so I'll output a JSON object with the category defined as \"Hardware.\" It seems straightforward enough!**Returning JSON Object**\n\nI need to categorize this IT ticket based on the system's expected output format. The allowed response is a JSON object with a specific structure, and I must choose a category from the provided list. Since the situation involves hardware, I'll respond with `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. It's essential to keep it concise with no extra text and ensure it's valid JSON without trailing spaces.
