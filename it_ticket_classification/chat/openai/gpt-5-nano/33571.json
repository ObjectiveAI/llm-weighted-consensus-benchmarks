The available categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and \"Access\" don\u2019t directly mention deployment. Given the context, the best fits are \"Internal Project\" for development tasks or \"Miscellaneous\" as a catch-all. It seems like it relates more to deployment or environment management but lacks a specific category for it.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nIt looks like \"Internal Project\" is the best category for this ticket. The user hasn't explicitly asked for permissions, so \"Administrative rights\" likely doesn\u2019t apply here. The phrase about copying the environment suggests testing or duplication related to deployment. Since the focus is on a development project, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON object formatted correctly as required. I need to remember to keep it concise and stick to the \"Internal Project\" category. \n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
