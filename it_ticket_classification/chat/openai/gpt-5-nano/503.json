The user's message about \"folder restriction\" and \"backup users\" suggests it's related to access permissions. It seems they want to restrict write permissions for certain backup users. Given this context, I think the best category would be either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" So, I\u2019ll choose one of those based on whether it fits more with general access restrictions or administrative rights enforcement. It\u2019s a bit tricky for sure!**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m looking at this request about restricting write access, which likely fits under \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Since the focus seems to be on controlling who can write to folders, it feels more related to access control than elevated permissions. Therefore, \"Access\" is the more appropriate choice here. I need to format my answer properly in JSON, so I'll prepare it as {\"category\":\"Access\"} and respond with that exactly!**Formatting the response**\n\nThe schema requires me to respond with a JSON object that includes a category. For this IT ticket, I've determined that \"Access\" is the correct category. So, following the schema, I'll construct my output as {\"category\":\"Access\"}. It\u2019s pretty straightforward! I'll respond with just this JSON object to make sure I stay aligned with the requested format. That's what I\u2019ll deliver!"
