Looking at the options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights,\" it feels like \"Hardware\" fits best since it's specifically about a cable extension. Although it could also fit in \"Miscellaneous,\" the context leans more towards hardware. The message itself is a bit unclear, but \"Hardware\" definitely seems appropriate for the ticket.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to provide a JSON object as per the format specified. The instructions clearly indicate that the \"category\" field must have allowed values. Therefore, I'll respond with {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It seems concise and aligns with what the user asked for in terms of categorization. I\u2019ll ensure there\u2019s no extra text in the response and just keep it focused on the category. Alright, let's finalize this output!"
