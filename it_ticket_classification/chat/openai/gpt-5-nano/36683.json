The categories available include Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The user mentioned an issue with video not working on \"floor san\" and needing equipment urgently for important meetings. It seems like a hardware issue, so I\u2019ll categorize it under Hardware. It\u2019s clear the need for a quick resolution is a priority here!**Finalizing IT ticket category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for the IT ticket. Initially, I thought \"Purchase\" could fit since they need equipment, but it seems more focused on hardware failure. So, \"Hardware\" seems like the best fit. I also noted the importance of following the specified JSON format for the category. The category schema requires me to output a JSON object with the category specified. So my final answer will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}, ensuring it aligns with the requirements!{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}"
