The available categories include various options, but because this clearly relates to tape library storage, I'm leaning toward \"Storage.\" While it could also fit under \"Hardware,\" it seems more appropriate to use \"Storage\" as it directly aligns with the details provided. I\u2019ll format the answer in JSON with the category field set to \"Storage.\"**Formatting IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe instructions indicate I need to respond with a JSON-like object that only includes the category value based on the schema provided. They specify a category format with options including \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. Since the user\u2019s ticket relates to tape library issues, I\u2019ll categorize it as \"Storage.\" It appears the best approach is to simply output: {\"category\":\"Storage\"} without any extra commentary. I'll double-check the details to ensure that aligns perfectly with the ticket description.**Determining the Category**\n\nIt's clear that the category should be \"Storage.\" I considered if it could fit under \"Hardware\" since a tape library is indeed hardware. However, since the taxonomy includes both options, \"Storage\" seems more precise for the issue at hand, focusing on storage systems. Given that many IT ticket systems categorize this type of issue under \"Storage,\" it feels appropriate to go with that. I\u2019ll respond solely with the JSON object now."
