The categories include \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" which specifically relate to permissions. The leaver's status means I need to stop their email, cancel subscriptions, and possibly assign tasks. The user mentions stopping mail, which suggests that the most suitable categories might be \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" for handling the cancellation of their access.**Categorizing IT tickets**\n\nThe mention of cancelled notifications and deactivating access for a leaver clearly indicates that this is about stopping their access. The phrase about \"tango mails\" suggests halting emails related to this situation as well. Given this context, I believe the appropriate category for this IT ticket would be \"Access\" since it concerns revoking access for a departing employee. I need to respond with a JSON object, ensuring the format matches the schema, like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
