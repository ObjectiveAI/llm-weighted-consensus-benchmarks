The ticket text is quite messy, mentioning terms like \"leaver,\" \"to be updated,\" and \"incomplete sheets.\" \n\nIt looks like this could fall under HR support or possibly Access, given the references to someone leaving the company and needing updates. I want to be careful to choose the right category!**Deciding on IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe system has categories like \"HR Support\" and \"Access,\" which seem fitting for this ticket. It\u2019s about updating leaver statuses, leaves, and mentions incomplete sheets. I\u2019m considering \"Administrative rights\" too, but it doesn\u2019t have a technical issue. \n\nTypically, IT tickets concerning leavers and access fall under \"Access,\" particularly around de-provisioning. Since it emphasizes updating leaver details and statuses, I feel confident categorizing it as \"Access\" to cover the HR and user access updates needed!**Formatting JSON Response**\n\nI need to output a JSON response with the category field. The prompt indicates it should have a \"category\" property within an object, and \"Access\" fits here. \n\nSo, the response will be: `{\"category\":\"Access\"}`. I'll make sure the format is correct since the instructions specify it should be wrapped in a category key.\n\nNo extra text is needed since the user requested a straightforward categorization. Let\u2019s proceed with just that!"
