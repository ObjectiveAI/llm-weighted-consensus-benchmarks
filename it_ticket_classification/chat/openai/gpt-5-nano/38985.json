I think the best fit for this ticket is \"Hardware.\" Other categories like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" seem less relevant, and \"Miscellaneous\" could work if I'm unsure.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing typical IT ticket categories like hardware, software, network, and access. The provided categories don\u2019t include \"Software,\" but \"Administrative rights\" might refer to admin privileges, while \"Internal Project\" is also available. The phrase \"meeting room\" suggests a physical space, and \"not working\" indicates a device issue. I believe the best fit for this ticket is \"Hardware\" since it likely concerns conference room equipment. However, if I'm unsure, categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous\" could work too. I should respond in a JSON-like format.**Formatting IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m focused on categorizing this IT ticket according to the specified format. The prompt clearly asks for a JSON object with a \"category\" key, and the options provided include \"Hardware,\" among others. I think the best fit here is \"Hardware,\" as it aligns with the context of the meeting room issue. \n\nWhile I consider if \"Miscellaneous\" could be appropriate due to ambiguity, it\u2019s more accurate to stick with \"Hardware.\" So, I\u2019ll output: \n\n{\"category\":\"Hardware\"} \n\nNo extra text needed."
