The ticket mentions things like a \"new purchase po,\" \"received items,\" and \"installing device.\" It seems noisy, but it points towards procurement and receipts. \n\nThe \"Purchase\" category appears to fit best due to references to purchase orders and receipts. But \"Hardware\" could also apply since it involves devices and installation.**Finalizing Ticket Categorization**\n\nIt seems the ticket is focused on procurement and administrative aspects, like receipts and purchase orders. Categories like \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Storage\" aren\u2019t relevant here. \n\nThe \"Purchase\" category is the best fit, so I'll respond with a JSON object using that category. Based on the instructions, I just need to output the category in JSON format without any extra text. Here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Purchase\"}"
