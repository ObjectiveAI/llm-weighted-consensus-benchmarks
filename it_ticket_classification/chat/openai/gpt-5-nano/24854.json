Given that there's an \"Administrative rights\" category, it seems most appropriate to classify this ticket under that.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm looking at a ticket that deals with removing an approver, which suggests it involves user access rights and approval workflows. It might fit into \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The mention of \"maternity leave\" could indicate who should take over as the approver during that time. I'll consider the best fit to be \"Access,\" as it's more of a general request for user access, whereas \"Administrative rights\" is more specific. I need to return a category object in JSON format.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
