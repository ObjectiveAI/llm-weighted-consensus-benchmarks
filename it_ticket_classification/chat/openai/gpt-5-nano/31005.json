The user mentions access requests related to library links, management settings, and HOD reports, indicating it's about access or permissions to a library system. The most fitting category seems to be \"Access,\" but it could also be \"Administrative rights\" since they mention managing settings. Overall, since the primary focus is access, I think \"Access\" is the more appropriate choice for this ticket.**Determining category**\n\nI need to decide how to categorize this IT ticket. The text mentions \"access request\" and \"library manage setting,\" which hints at admin rights, but the primary action seems to be an access request. The phrase involving \"library HOD reports\" suggests it\u2019s specifically related to library content. So, I'll categorize it as \"Access.\" To keep things concise, I\u2019ll present it in the required JSON format: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I'll make sure it\u2019s valid JSON before sending.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
