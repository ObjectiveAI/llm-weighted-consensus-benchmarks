The text mentions survey errors, an app outage for US accounts, and issues with accessing the app. It's clear that engineers are currently investigating intermittent errors and the source of the problems. \n\nGiven the system categories\u2014like Access, Miscellaneous, or Administrative rights\u2014I think this ticket best fits under \"Access\" since the user is experiencing difficulties accessing the app.**Categorizing Access Issues**\n\nThis is definitely about access issues and an app outage related to accounts. I think \"Access\" is the best category fit since it's about login and access problems. While \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Administrative rights\" could work, they don't quite capture the situation.\n\nSince the instruction calls for a JSON object format, I\u2019ll prepare the output as: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI\u2019ll keep it straightforward and ensure there\u2019s no extra text."
