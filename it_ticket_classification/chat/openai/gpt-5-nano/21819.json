The key details include the need for a single shared folder or multiple separate folders. This aligns best with the \u201cStorage\u201d category since it\u2019s focused on managing and storing digital content. So, I'll go ahead and categorize it under Storage.**Determining storage category**\n\nThe user wants to estimate storage for a shared folder, deciding between one single folder or multiple separate ones. This clearly relates to the \u201cStorage\u201d category. There\u2019s also a potential link to \u201cAccess,\u201d since the shared folder is intended for an event and likely needs permissions for collaborators. However, since the focus is on storage estimation, I'll classify it primarily as \u201cStorage.\u201d I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object that specifies the category as \"Storage\" in the required format.**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m clarifying that the response for the IT ticket should be formatted as JSON according to the provided schema. It seems I need to output the category as a JSON object instead of just plain text. The required format is simple: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. While the schema details the structure, I\u2019ll stick with the object format that fits the specification. I'll keep it concise and just deliver the specified JSON to meet the user's needs.**Crafting the JSON response**\n\nI\u2019m going to create the JSON response as instructed. It will simply be {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. While I could include brief clarifications, the instruction only asks for the category itself, so I\u2019ll stick to that. There's no need for explanations here, just the direct response. I\u2019ll go ahead and respond with the category as specified, keeping it clear and straightforward."
