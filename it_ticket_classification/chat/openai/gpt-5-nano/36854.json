However, since the problem focuses on the physical display, I'll go with \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category. The response will be formatted as a JSON object, just like instructed. I\u2019ll make sure to stick to the format!**Clarifying JSON output**\n\nI need to ensure the response format is correct for categorizing the IT ticket. The schema specifies that the response should be a top-level object with the key \"category\" and its value as a string from a specific list. I confirm that my output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. It\u2019s essential to keep it simple: brightness control relates to hardware issues, though I consider whether it could be a software problem as well. However, I\u2019ll stick with \"Hardware\" as the best category."
