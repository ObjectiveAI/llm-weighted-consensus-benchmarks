For the \"contract variation button,\" it seems related to administrative rights, maybe a UI feature that needs those privileges to implement. The phrase \"leave till ext\" could suggest extending leave, possibly indicating the person is not in the office. Given that their request seems to revolve around implementing a feature, I think \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category for this request. We should respond with this in JSON format!**Determining ticket categorization**\n\nThe prompt asks me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to follow a specific JSON format to respond. The part about the \"contract variation button\" suggests it could be a feature request within a software system. \"Internal Project\" seems to fit best as that's about implementing features. \n\nThere are other categories like \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access,\" but those don\u2019t match as closely. Since I'm confident, I'll go with \"Internal Project\" for the category in my response.**Confirming internal project categorization**\n\nIt seems there are no specific access rights needed based on the request. Since they\u2019re asking for the \"contract variation button\" rather than administrative rights, the best category remains \"Internal Project.\" I want to keep the response straightforward, sticking to what was asked. So, I\u2019ll output the required JSON object for \"Internal Project\" without adding any extra commentary or information. Let's get that done!"
