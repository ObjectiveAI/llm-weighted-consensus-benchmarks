I see there's a JSON snippet structure that outlines this, but my output must be parsed or displayed in an app, so I should keep it simple and straightforward. The user asked to categorize an IT ticket, so I believe I should provide the category value directly. \n\nTo be on the safe side, I'll go with a JSON structure that clearly shows the category, like {\"category\":\"Access\"}. This seems like the best way to comply with the requirements!**Formatting the final output**\n\nTo ensure everything is compatible, I'm going to provide the output as a JSON object with just the category. The guidelines suggest I should focus on being clear and concise, since the user specifically asked for the category of the IT ticket. Given that, my response will just be the JSON format without any extra text.\n\nSo, I'll go with: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That seems straightforward and meets the requirements perfectly!"
