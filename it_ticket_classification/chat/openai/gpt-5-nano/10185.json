The user\u2019s request about \"rack diagrams\" likely pertains to hardware or infrastructure. Since it\u2019s about sharing diagrams for installed rack infrastructure, it probably fits best under the \"Hardware\" category. However, if it were related to a specific project, \"Internal Project\" could also apply. Ultimately, I'll go ahead and assign it to \"Hardware.\" My output will be: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.**Delivering category response**\n\nAccording to the system, I need to provide the final answer as a category object in a specific JSON format, focusing solely on the \"category\" field. I\u2019ll be outputting: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}.\n\nWhile it could also be \"Internal Project\" since it's about sharing rack diagrams, the simplest and most relevant choice is definitely \"Hardware\" because the ticket is clearly about rack diagrams. Others like \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" don't apply here. So, I'll finalize it with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. Let's deliver this!"
