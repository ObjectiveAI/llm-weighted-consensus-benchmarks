The category could fit as \"Internal Project\" since it involves development work. Other options like \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights\" could be considered, but \"Internal Project\" feels like the best match for this task.**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm considering the best category for the IT ticket based on the user's description. \"Miscellaneous\" could work if it's unclear, while \"Administrative rights\" isn't relevant since permissions aren't mentioned. \"Access\" would apply if it were a request for access, and \"Purchase\" or \"Storage\" don't fit either. So, I'll go with \"Internal Project\" for this case. I need to respond in a specific JSON format, so I'll provide: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Keeping it concise is key!{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
