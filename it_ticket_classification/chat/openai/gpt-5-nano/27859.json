I see mentions of Oracle Fusion rules, scheduling, documentation, and meetings. The text seems to focus on technical aspects and introducing elements related to this. It doesn't seem to fit the categories of hardware, HR support, access, storage, or purchase. Given these details, it looks like this ticket is best categorized under \"Internal Project\" due to its focus on documentation and meetings.**Confirming ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m concluding that this ticket should be categorized as \"Internal Project\" since it discusses internal tasks like documentation, scheduling meetings, and technical introductions. I also want to be careful not to classify it as \"Administrative rights,\" since access issues weren't specifically mentioned. It does reference Oracle Fusion, a software application, but that solidifies the \"Internal Project\" category. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I\u2019m ready to submit this!**Formatting JSON response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that follows the specified schema: {\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[...]}}. Given the categories, I\u2019ve determined that \"Internal Project\" is the right fit for this ticket. I have to make sure the formatting is correct, with quotes and structure being exactly as needed for JSON. So the final output will simply be: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. I won\u2019t add any extra text, just the JSON!"
