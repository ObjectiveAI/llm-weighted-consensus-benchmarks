The user mentions adding missing time into Oracle for a former employee, which suggests an HR-related issue. The reference to \"Oracle\" likely points to a time entry system linked to HR. While \"Access\" could apply, it mainly centers on time entry. Since it touches on payroll and time management, I think it's best categorized as HR Support.**Classifying IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering how to classify this IT ticket, which discusses adding time entries for a former employee. The reference to \"disabled his name\" might indicate an account issue, possibly needing deactivation. The phrases hint at time entry and payroll, linking it to HR Support. It could also suggest Administrative rights if they're requesting access. Given all this, classifying the ticket as HR Support seems the most fitting based on the context of missing time entries.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI\u2019ve realized this ticket is focused on time entry rather than access issues. With the user asking to \"add missing time into Oracle,\" it clearly pertains to HR and payroll. The mention of a \"former employee\" suggests offboarding, but since that category isn't available, HR Support feels like the right fit. I should respond with a JSON object to reflect this, confirming that HR Support is the appropriate category for this IT ticket.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
