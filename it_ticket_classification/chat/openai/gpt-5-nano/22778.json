It mentions adding a link, \"policies library,\" and how to make certain files visible. This seems to fit into an IT-related task focused on document management and permissions. Based on the provided categories, it appears to fall under \"Access\" as it relates to permissions and library functionality.**Determining the Category**\n\nI'm trying to categorize the ticket based on its content. It seems to be primarily about \"Access,\" focusing on permissions and visibility related to a document library. While \"Internal Project\" and \"Storage\" don't fit as well, there's a possibility it connects to \"Administrative rights\" if creating links involves admin access. However, I think \"Access\" is the most appropriate category overall. I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object that specifies this. Let's finalize it as: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
