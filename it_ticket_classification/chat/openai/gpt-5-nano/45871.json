The content includes errors related to submission and required receipts. It seems most fitting for \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" with \"Miscellaneous\" being the best option if it doesn\u2019t clearly match the others. Given it concerns system access and submissions but doesn\u2019t fall into categories like hardware, HR, or purchases, that seems like the path to take!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket regarding expense report submissions. \"Administrative rights\" could apply if rights are needed to submit, but \"Miscellaneous\" seems fitting for issues that don\u2019t quite match other categories. Based on the list, \"Access\" is also a possibility if there's an issue with system access. Since the user mentions problems with the submission button but doesn't mention login issues, \"Miscellaneous\" might be the safest bet. I'll aim to provide a clear response format too!**Selecting the JSON category**\n\nI see that I need to provide a JSON object with a \"category\" field based on the user's issue with expense report submissions. Given the schema, my response should follow that structure. The options include categories like \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" While the issue could relate to permissions or access, it most likely fits better under \"Miscellaneous,\" as it deals with the expense reporting system itself. So, I'll aim to produce that JSON object with the chosen category!{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
