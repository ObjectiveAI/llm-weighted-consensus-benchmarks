I think the ticket primarily involves enabling access to reports, which fits into the \"Access\" category. I\u2019m wondering if \"Administrative rights\" could also work, but \"Access\" seems more appropriate because of the focus on permissions management. The final output should be exactly {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I might add a brief justification if it's needed!**Formulating JSON response**\n\nThe user has asked me to focus solely on categorizing, so I need to respond with just that JSON object, without any extra commentary. So, I'll create the JSON object with the category \"Access.\" It's essential to keep it straightforward, so the final output will be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. Let's proceed with that!"
