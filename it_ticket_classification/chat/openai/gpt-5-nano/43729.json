The ticket mentions \"permission\" often and references \"admins\" as well. Since it discusses resetting passwords, access control seems relevant too. There\u2019s also a mention of \u201cAdministrative rights,\u201d which could apply if it specifically relates to elevated permissions. Given all this, I believe \"Access\" is the most suitable classification for this issue, though \"Administrative rights\" could apply based on context. The mention of \"domain ped\" needs clarification.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
