There\u2019s a chance it could be \"Purchase\" if they\u2019re requesting a charger, but since they\u2019re asking to log a ticket for a charger already received, I'll stick with \"Hardware.\" Now I'll format it as a JSON-like category object.**Formatting JSON output**\n\nThe instructions specify that I need to output a JSON object for the category. It's clear that the required format is {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. While I might feel tempted to add a brief explanation, the guidelines indicate I should stick to the JSON format alone since it may need to be parsed by code. So, I'll confidently go with just the JSON output: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. There's no need for extra commentary; let's keep it clean and simple!"
