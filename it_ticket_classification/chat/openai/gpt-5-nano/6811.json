The ticket refers to off-boarding tasks like revoking access and deactivating accounts, which aligns with \"Access.\" It makes sense to choose that category for this ticket and respond with a structured object as instructed.**Preparing JSON Response**\n\nI need to provide a JSON object according to the specified format. The \"category\" field should be set to one of the listed strings: like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and so on. I\u2019ll keep it simple and just respond with the essential JSON representation. So, I will output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That confirms the correct format while ensuring no extra analysis is included. Just a straightforward response is needed here!"
