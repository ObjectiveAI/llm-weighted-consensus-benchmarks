The appropriate category appears to be \"Hardware\" since it's about hardware allocation for new interns. While \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\" might also be relevant due to the form, the main focus is clearly on hardware. So, I\u2019m going to assign the category as \"Hardware\" in a response format.**Formatting IT ticket response**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket and output a JSON-like object with the category set to \"Hardware.\" Since this category is valid and specifically mentioned in the allowed list, my response should simply be: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. I\u2019ll ensure that I\u2019m using the correct channel for this response and only include the JSON object with no extra words. That's the essential part of my task!"
