I'll analyze the terms: \"access net\" suggests it's related to network access, while \"providing hosting\" points towards a hosting service. Overall, the most fitting categories appear to be \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" due to the context. I'll choose \"Access\" as the safer option.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nIt seems that \"Administrative rights\" could be an option, but the ticket doesn\u2019t clearly ask for that. Instead, it mostly revolves around \"provide hosting\" and mentions \"AD,\" likely referring to Active Directory. Since the primary focus seems to be on access to network resources and AD hosting, I think \"Access\" is the best category. I should format my response in the required JSON-like structure. So, I\u2019ll output: {\"category\":\"Access\"}.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
