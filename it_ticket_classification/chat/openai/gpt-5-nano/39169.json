They've noted a performance issue with their PC, specifically when opening multiple Excel files, and requested more memory. Since this is clearly related to the performance of the hardware, I believe it fits into the \"Hardware\" category, as it's about a memory upgrade for the PC. I'll organize this into a JSON format for clarity.**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this IT helpdesk ticket. The primary issue relates to a performance problem due to memory. While \u201cPurchase\u201d could apply since the request is about buying more memory, I think it makes the most sense to categorize it as \u201cHardware.\u201d The user specifically mentions needing more RAM, which leads me to believe that the core issue is hardware-related. If pressed, I'd confidently choose \"Hardware\" for routing purposes.**Crafting JSON Output**\n\nThe user wants me to categorize an IT ticket focused on a \"PC performance issue\" connected to memory. According to the required format, I need to respond with a JSON object. So, I will create this string: `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}` since it fits the category schema perfectly. No additional commentary is necessary\u2014just the clean JSON format. I\u2019ll ensure everything matches the expected structure without adding any extra text."
