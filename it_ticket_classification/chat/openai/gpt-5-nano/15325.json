It\u2019s a straightforward task, but it's crucial to get the category right for clarity!**Outputting JSON Object**\n\nI need to output a JSON-like object that identifies the category as \"Access.\" The format specifies that it should adhere to a certain schema, which clearly includes a field named \"category.\" Since the user only needs the category, I'll keep my response simple and direct. The exact output will be: \n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI\u2019m making sure it fits the schema requirements without any unnecessary commentary! It's all about being concise and delivering what the user asked for."
