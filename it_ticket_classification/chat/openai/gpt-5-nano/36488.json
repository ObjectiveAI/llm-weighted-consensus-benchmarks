They\u2019re talking about disk space, partitions, and deleting unused files, which points clearly to storage management. So, I think \"Storage\" fits best, maybe \"Hardware\" too, but the main focus is on managing disk space. I'll categorize it as \"Storage\" and respond using the JSON schema provided. That should work!I need to respond with JSON that specifies the category as \"Storage.\" The instructions indicate that the main goal is to categorize this IT ticket, so I probably won't need to add extra notes unless absolutely necessary. I'll format the response as a JSON object: {\"category\":\"Storage\"}. This fits the required properties, and \"Storage\" is indeed one of the enumerated values. I\u2019ll keep it simple and provide the final output!"
