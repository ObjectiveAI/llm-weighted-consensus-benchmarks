The prompt gives me a set of phrases, and I must choose the best fitting category from the options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" I\u2019ll carefully consider what the issue is and select the most appropriate category to ensure it gets handled efficiently!**Categorizing Purchase Order**\n\nThe text is a bit tangled, but it contains many phrases related to \"purchase order requisition,\" \"supplier,\" \"assignee,\" \"cost center,\" and \"attachments.\" These clues suggest that this ticket is about procurement, specifically dealing with purchase orders. Given the context, it seems appropriate to categorize it under \"Purchase.\" I'll go ahead and classify it that way so that it can be addressed correctly!**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nI want to ensure I'm categorizing correctly, so I'm considering whether \"Administrative rights,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Hardware\" might fit. However, since the primary context is about the purchase order requisition, it really seems to point to \"Purchase.\" \n\nI need to stick to the specified JSON format, which looks like this: {\"category\": \"<one of the allowed strings>\"}.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll produce: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} and make sure it's exactly as required, without any extra explanation. Let's do this!"
