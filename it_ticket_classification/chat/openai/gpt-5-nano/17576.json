Given the context, I would categorize this request as \"Hardware.\" However, I\u2019ll keep in mind that it might also touch on procurement for the monitor. It's all about ensuring clarity!**Outputting IT ticket category**\n\nThe ticket is clearly about providing a second monitor, which I recognize as a hardware request. So, I'll categorize it as \"Hardware\" since that's the most fitting option. \n\nI need to make sure I respond with valid JSON format.
