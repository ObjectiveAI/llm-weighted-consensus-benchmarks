It's important to be precise here, so I\u2019ll carefully evaluate the ticket text to pick the most appropriate category. Let's get this sorted out correctly!**Identifying an IT ticket**\n\nThe user pasted a string of phrases that seems to involve multiple requests, particularly around password resets and expiration days. Phrases like \"password reset,\" \"expire days,\" and \"change PC\" stand out. It really looks like an IT ticket with a request for assistance, especially since it mentions the urgency to reset passwords. The mention of needing to \"press ctrl alt delete\" indicates a direct action suggestion for the user, which reinforces that it's an IT issue.**Determining ticket category**\n\nThe phrases I see include \"application architect\" and \"password reset,\" alongside instructions for changing a PC and pressing \"ctrl alt delete.\" There's also a confidentiality notice that suggests this belongs to a formal process. Given the context, this ticket seems to fit best in the \"Access\" category since it focuses on logging in and password resets. I should prepare to respond with the appropriate JSON format without any extra commentary to keep it clear. I\u2019ll go with:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}**Formatting JSON output**\n\nThe prompt asks for the IT ticket to be categorized, and the output needs to be in a specific JSON format with a \"category\" field. The valid categories are listed, and since I determined that \"Access\" is the most appropriate, I should format my response as follows:\n\n{\"category\":\"Access\"}\n\nI won\u2019t add any extra text; I'll just deliver the message directly as per the requirements!"
