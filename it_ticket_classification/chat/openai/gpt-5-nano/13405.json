The text is a bit garbled, but it seems to be about contracts, procurement, and purchasing. We have categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and more. It mentions terms related to contracts, signed documents, and application management, so I\u2019m thinking \"Purchase\" fits best since it involves contracts. \"Internal Project\" might work too, but it's less about project management and more focused on contract management.**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI need to categorize an IT ticket based on available categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative Rights. The content mentions terms like \"contracts,\" \"decommission,\" and \"order book,\" suggesting it's related to purchasing. Therefore, \"Purchase\" seems like the right choice. Now, I need to ensure I provide the response in the correct format, which should be a JSON object that looks like this: {\"category\": \"Purchase\"}. Let's finalize that!"
