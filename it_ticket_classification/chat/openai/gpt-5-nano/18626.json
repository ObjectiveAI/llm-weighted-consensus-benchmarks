They've mentioned a temporary replacement laptop due to travel and high importance, which sounds hardware-related. This request doesn't seem to fit HR, access, storage, or purchase categories. But it could possibly fall under \"Hardware\" since it's about a laptop replacement. However, there\u2019s also a chance it could be categorized as \"Purchase\" if it requires buying a new laptop.**Finalizing category for IT ticket**\n\nI'm deciding how to categorize a request for a temporary laptop replacement. It clearly falls under \"Hardware.\" So, I\u2019ll respond with a JSON-like structure saying `{\"category\":\"Hardware\"}`. We want to keep it concise, as per the instructions. I did briefly consider if it could fit \"Administrative rights\" because of the mention of regulations, but that doesn't apply here. It's definitely \"Hardware.\" Let's stick to that precise format for the response."
