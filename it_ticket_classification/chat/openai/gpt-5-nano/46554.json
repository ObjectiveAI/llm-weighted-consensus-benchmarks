The message is a bit difficult to decipher but mentions issues with submitting something, alongside terms like \"bench\" and \"July.\" It seems like it could relate to a submission error. There are several categories I could use, like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" if it's about permissions. If it\u2019s not a clear fit, I might consider \"Miscellaneous\" as the safest option. I\u2019ll sort it out!**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe user mentioned \"bench,\" likely referring to employees who are unassigned at work. They want to save time spent on the bench and mentioned receiving reminders about submission errors. This suggests it's related to submitting timesheets or weekly submissions. I\u2019m thinking it falls under \"Access\" if there are permission issues or \"Administrative rights\" for permissions to submit. There\u2019s also the possibility of it being a bug, but \"Access\" seems like the best fit based on the context.**Choosing ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to categorize the IT ticket as \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The user mentioned \"time spent on bench,\" which might suggest HR involvement, but this ticket is IT-related, making \"HR Support\" inappropriate. So I\u2019m leaning toward either \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The mention of \"when try submit\" indicates a submission error, likely needing access permissions. Without further context, \"Access\" fits best. I need to provide the category in the required JSON format as instructed!{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
