The request mentions urgency and specifics about timing. Looking at the options provided, it definitely seems to fit under \"Hardware\" since it concerns a monitor. I\u2019ll prepare a JSON object that reflects this category clearly, as instructed. So, I\u2019ll format my response accordingly to just provide the necessary JSON output.**Determining ticket category**\n\nI'm figuring out how to categorize this ticket. It seems to be about a monitor request, which first makes me think of either \"Purchase\" or \"Hardware.\" \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" don't fit based on the context. The mention of the \"senior developer\" implies a request for a monitor, likely for hardware allocation. Considering the phrasing, it leans more towards \"Hardware.\" So, I\u2019ll conclude that the best category for this ticket is \"Hardware\" and proceed to respond accordingly.**Preparing JSON output**\n\nI need to output a JSON object with the category specified. It should look like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. I\u2019ll make sure to format it correctly according to the requirements. While I think it might help to ask clarifying questions in some cases, the instruction is clear that I just need to categorize this IT ticket. Therefore, I\u2019ll stick to delivering only the required JSON output without any extra commentary. Let's go ahead with that!"
