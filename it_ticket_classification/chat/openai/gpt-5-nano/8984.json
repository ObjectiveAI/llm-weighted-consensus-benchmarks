I\u2019m considering whether it should fall under \"Access,\" since it involves access provisioning, or \"HR Support,\" given it pertains to interns and their forms.**Categorizing IT Ticket Details**\n\nI\u2019m looking at categories like \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights.\" This IT ticket seems to relate to bulk starter and leaver forms, which are HR processes. Since the user is asking me to categorize, I think the best fit is \"HR Support.\" The ticket mentions \"end bulk leaver form for interns,\" and \"assist completion\" suggests it's important for onboarding or leaving.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll format my response as a JSON object with the category labeled as \"HR Support.\"**Preparing JSON Output**\n\nThe prompt is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket using the provided categories. The final output should adhere to the JSON schema format specified, such as: \n\n{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"category\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"enum\":[\"Hardware\",\"HR Support\",\"Access\",\"Miscellaneous\",\"Storage\",\"Purchase\",\"Internal Project\",\"Administrative rights\"]}}}\n\nI\u2019ll just output the category object as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} with the proper quotes, no extra text needed.
