The sentence mentions adding and amending a computer, along with disabled states and administrator rights. Those keywords suggest it\u2019s linked to access control or permissions. I need to find the best fitting category from our schema: it seems most aligned with \"Access\" since it revolves around admin rights and enabling a computer. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll go with!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m weighing the options for categorizing this IT ticket. It might be \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" or even \"Hardware\" if it concerns adding a computer. The phrase \"add a computer to a\" sounds like it could refer to a group or domain, but it's tough to interpret. The mention of \"administrator rights\" strongly suggests it's about granting access. So, I'll go with \"Administrative rights\" as the best fit. The user only asked for a category, not to resolve the issue, so I'll format my response accordingly!**Formatting category response**\n\nI need to respond with a JSON object that specifies the category. The allowed categories include \"Administrative rights,\" which seems the most fitting based on the IT ticket details. I\u2019ll make sure \"Administrative rights\" is spelled exactly as required. While the user might also consider \"Access,\" I see that \"Administrative rights\" stands alone in the list, making it the clearer choice. So, I\u2019ll keep it concise and return just the JSON object: {\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}."
