They\u2019re mentioning changes related to assignments and visibility over tasks. This seems to imply issues around access or permissions, so it might fit best in the \"Administrative rights\" category. However, it could also potentially fit under \"Access\" since visibility over tasks hints at access control. \"Internal Project\" doesn\u2019t seem applicable here.**Categorizing IT requests**\n\nI\u2019m interpreting the user's message about \"service now changes assignment\" as a request for altering permissions related to the assignment service. It appears they're asking for changes to who can see or assign tasks, which leans towards \"Administrative rights\" but also fits the \"Access\" category since it\u2019s about visibility. The phrase reflects a need to modify access for assignments. While \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d could work if I'm unsure, \"Access\" seems more appropriate considering the context. I\u2019ll go with \"Access.\"**Categorizing IT ticket in JSON**\n\nThe instruction is clear: I need to categorize the IT ticket by providing a JSON-like object with the selected category. The options are hardware, HR support, access, miscellaneous, storage, purchase, internal project, and administrative rights. Based on the user's request regarding visibility over tasks, \"Access\" seems the most appropriate choice. So, my response will simply be: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I don't need to offer a lengthy explanation since the instruction focuses on the classification itself."
