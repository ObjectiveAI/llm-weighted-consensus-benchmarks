The ticket focuses on issues with annual leave visibility and submitting leave requests\u2014definitely something related to HR. It seems more aligned with \"HR Support\", although \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could also fit if it's about access issues. Overall, it looks like this involves the HR/Leave management system, so \"HR Support\" seems the best choice.**Categorizing HR ticket**\n\nThe content highlights issues like \"annual leave days visible\" and \"cannot be seen,\" which points to a system problem in HR/Absence management. It seems like \"HR Support\" would be the best category. While \"Access\" might apply if it involved login issues, this is more about visibility. There's mention of profiles and engineers investigating, so categorizing it as \"HR Support\" fits best. I'll structure the output as {\"category\":\"HR Support\"} and focus on the required format.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
