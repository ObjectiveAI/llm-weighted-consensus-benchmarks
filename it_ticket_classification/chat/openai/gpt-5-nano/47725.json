The list of categories I can choose from includes things like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others. Since the request pertains to approvals and management, it likely fits under \"HR Support.\" I\u2019ll produce a JSON object indicating that category for clarity and proper organization.**Interpreting Approval Ticket**\n\nI need to interpret the ticket related to Oracle approvals, which mentions duplicates and issues with a line manager's replacement during their absence. It seems the user is receiving duplicate approval requests, possibly wanting to cancel these. The mention of \"regards specialist en\" might imply something about their role as a specialist in English or relate to Outlook. Since this involves workflows and permissions, it most likely fits under the \u201cAccess\u201d category for classification.**Categorizing Approval Issues**\n\nI\u2019m considering the best category for this IT ticket, which relates to Oracle approval duplicates and a line manager's replacement. While \"HR Support\" seems suitable due to the line manager context, it feels more like an IT issue. I'm leaning towards \"Access\" since it deals with user access and approvals granting rights. However, given the mention of duplicates, \"Administrative rights\" could apply if it involves who has the authority to approve. Ultimately, \"Access\" feels most fitting in this scenario.**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nThe user is experiencing issues with approvals being duplicated, likely due to a replacement line manager. Since this relates to access rights and permissions in Oracle, I'm deciding on the category. Given the nature of the problem, it fits best under \"Access.\" I\u2019ll respond with just the necessary JSON object for clarity, as the instruction specifies to provide the category in that exact format. Here\u2019s what I'll submit: {\"category\":\"Access\"}."
