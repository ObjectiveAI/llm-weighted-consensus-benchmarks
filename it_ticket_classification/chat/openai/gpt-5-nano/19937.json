There's mention of \"individual tickets for each monitor,\" which adds some confusion in parsing it. Overall, my best guess is to categorize this ticket under \"Hardware,\" since it deals with a physical item, but there could be other interpretations too!**Determining IT ticket category**\n\nIt seems like the user is asking for help with the \"monitors assigned\" and possibly requesting a \"monitor raiser stand,\" which is a hardware accessory. This makes \"Hardware\" a fitting category since it relates to physical equipment. Even though it could be a purchase request, the emphasis is on the hardware item itself. To fulfill the requirement, I\u2019ll respond with the category formatted as a JSON object like this: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}."
