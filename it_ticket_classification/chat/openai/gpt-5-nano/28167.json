I need to sort it into one of the categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. The mention of \"edit access\" and \"rights\" makes me think it fits best in the Access or Administrative rights category, since it seems to be about gaining rights to a site.**Determining access category**\n\nThe user\u2019s request for \"edit access\" on a site is really a request for access to resources. \"Administrative rights\" is a specific type of access that gives permission to edit. I need to decide whether to categorize this as \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" While \"Access\" is broader, \"Administrative rights\" is more precise since they specifically want editing permissions. The phrase suggests they want \"new edit access\" starting in October. I need to make a clear classification here.{\"category\":\"Administrative rights\"}"
