It talks about assigning a \"PM\" for Wednesday afternoon, probably referring to a project manager. There\u2019s mention of \"annual leave leaders approved,\" but the rest is unclear. I\u2019m tasked to place this ticket into one of the given categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. I\u2019ll output a JSON object with the chosen category.**Categorizing the ticket**\n\nThe content focuses on assigning someone as PM for Wednesday afternoon, indicating it\u2019s probably not a technical issue but more of a scheduling request. The potential categories from the user are internal project-related, administrative rights, or HR support. \"Internal Project\" seems fitting given the focus on assignment, but \"Administrative rights\" could apply if there\u2019s mention of access. With the unclear phrasing, particularly around \"he joining\" and \"ca,\" it's challenging, but it's basically about a person joining as PM for that time.**Finalizing the category response**\n\nI\u2019ve decided to categorize this IT ticket as \"Internal Project.\" To provide the response, I\u2019ll format it as a JSON object, which is just what the instructions require. It\u2019s important to stick to the exact formatting without any extra text or analysis. So, I\u2019ll output the simple JSON object like this: {\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}. That keeps everything clear and straightforward, following the guidelines perfectly!"
