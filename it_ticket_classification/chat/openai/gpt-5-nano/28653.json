The message mentions filling an attachment, likely related to access setup or administrative tasks. So, I should consider options like \"Access,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Administrative rights\" as the most fitting categories for this ticket.**Categorizing onboarding tickets**\n\nIf this IT ticket is about onboarding a new employee, I would consider assigning it to either \"Access\" for account provisioning or \"HR Support\" for HR-related tasks. The categories provided show that \"HR Support\" is suitable, especially for new staff onboarding. Since the user asked me to categorize this ticket and the details mention a new starter, I\u2019ll need to output a JSON-like object with the most appropriate category based on the options given.**Choosing the category for IT tickets**\n\nThis could be categorized as \"HR Support\" if it involves onboarding tasks, but \"Access\" also seems like a strong contender since it relates to provisioning accounts for a new starter. While \"Administrative rights\" isn't relevant here, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the most fitting choice for this IT ticket. Since the instructions say to output a JSON-like object with the category, I'll respond with {\"category\": \"Access\"}. It\u2019s best to keep it simple!**Delivering the category**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize the ticket, but they didn't ask for justification, so I just need to provide the category itself. I\u2019ll respond with only the JSON object to ensure it's easily parsable. Minimal text is fine here, and plain text is acceptable, so I'll keep it straightforward. Let\u2019s just go ahead and provide the required object without any extra details."
