The details like \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"date Wednesday\" stand out. It seems to be connected to onboarding someone new, which might fit under \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Then there's the mention of \"ext,\" likely indicating an extension. From the provided categories, I can lean towards categorizing it as HR Support, but access or Administrative rights might also be relevant. Let's make sure to choose the most accurate category.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI'm considering that \"ext\" likely refers to an extension number for a consultant. The message seems related to an HR onboarding form for a new starter, possibly involving scheduling with a consultant. It\u2019s clear I need to categorize this appropriately. \"HR Support\" feels like the best fit because it involves a starter form for onboarding. While \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" could apply if access were mentioned, this content focuses solely on the starter form and not access needs.**Deciding on ticket category**\n\nI'm thinking \"HR Support\" is the right category for this IT ticket. The term \"new starter\" often relates to provisioning accounts and hardware, but the \"starter form\" likely refers to the HR document for new employees. Since the content mentions a new starter and the starter form, HR Support is my best bet. Although \"Administrative rights\" could be another possibility, there's no indication of access needs mentioned. I'll respond with a JSON-like object: {\"category\":\"HR Support\"}. It's straightforward!{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
