The categories to choose from include \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative Rights\". \n\nThe content mentions \"annual leave,\" \"submitted,\" and issues with submissions, suggesting it relates to submitting leave requests or the leaver process. It seems like it could fit into \"HR Support,\" \"Administrative Rights,\" or \"Access.\"**Classifying IT tickets**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket details that mention \"submit before leaving\" and issues with saving or submitting for annual leave. It seems focused on accessing the system for leave submissions, which places it in the HR domain. \n\nThe most appropriate category would be \"HR Support\" since it's about annual leave submission and the leaver process. I should prepare a final output as a JSON object with the category field set to \"HR Support\" according to the prompt's format.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
