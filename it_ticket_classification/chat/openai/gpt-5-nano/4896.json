This looks like a request for hardware, so I'll choose \"Hardware.\"**Determining the correct category**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to categorize this ticket about a monitor request. It could fit under \"Purchase,\" since they seem to be asking to acquire a monitor. However, it could also be \"Hardware,\" as it's about a hardware item. The phrase \"monitor request\" suggests they want a monitor for a workstation, which leans me toward categorizing it as \"Purchase.\" I\u2019ll format my response in JSON as {\"category\":\"Purchase\"} without any extra text."
