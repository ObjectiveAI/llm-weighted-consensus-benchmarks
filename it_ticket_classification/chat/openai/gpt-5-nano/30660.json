I think the best-fit category could be \"Administrative rights,\" \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or perhaps \"Miscellaneous,\" depending on the exact context of the request.**Deciding on a Ticket Category**\n\nI see parts of the ticket mention \"add members,\" \"names,\" and \"change,\" which suggest it could relate to access management or membership. The phrase \u201ccreate new Wednesday change please\u201d hints at a scheduled change, and adding members likely involves resource access. Since \"Access\" fits best for adding or removing users, I think I\u2019ll categorize this ticket as \"Access\" if that category is listed. The output should be in JSON format with the category specified.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
