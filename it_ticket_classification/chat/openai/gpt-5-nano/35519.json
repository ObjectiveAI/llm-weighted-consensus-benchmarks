It doesn\u2019t match hardware or storage, but I wonder if it could be \"Access\" since it mentions issues with accessing something. It could also fit under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" given the software aspect. It's quite unclear!**Classifying the IT ticket**\n\nI\u2019m considering the categories used in the IT service desk: \"Administrative rights\" might apply if admin privileges are needed, but there's no mention of that. The \"Oracle problem status error\" points to \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Internal Project,\" or possibly \"Access.\" There isn\u2019t a specific \"Software\" category. The user's statement about \u201cremoving hours/days\u201d suggests a software bug. If I have to classify it, \"Internal Project\" seems most fitting for internal software development issues, while \"Administrative rights\" isn\u2019t relevant here.{\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}"
