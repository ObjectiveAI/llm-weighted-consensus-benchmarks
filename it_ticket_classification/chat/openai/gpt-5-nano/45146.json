It mentions issues with Outlook connecting to a server, colleagues experiencing the same problem on Macs, and suggests using a web interface as an alternative. The categories I have are limited, but this issue seems to fit best under \"Access\" due to it being about connectivity. I'm wondering if \"Dear\" refers to a specific system, possibly an ERP system.**Responding with category**\n\nIt's clear the ticket is about connectivity issues with the mail server, specifically related to Outlook. The category that fits best is \"Access.\" Since the user is asking for a categorization of the IT ticket, the appropriate response is to provide a JSON object with just the relevant category. I should ensure there's no extra commentary. So, the output I need is simply: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. That way I'm complying with the required format.{\"category\":\"Access\"}"
