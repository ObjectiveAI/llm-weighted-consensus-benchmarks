Given it\u2019s about an internal ticketing system, \"Internal Project\" feels like the best fit. I need to ensure I categorize it in a way that makes sense!**Categorizing a development task**\n\nThis text feels like a user story or requirements outline for a ticket form, asking to add a \"view other description\" with a mandatory free-text field. Since this task is about internal development, it fits under the category of \"Internal Project.\" I need to output a JSON response with the category specified. The expected format should be simple, just listing the category as \"Internal Project\" so it looks like this: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}. Let's deliver that!"
