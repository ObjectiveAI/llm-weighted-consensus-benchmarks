It seems to mention timecard submission and annual leave alongside processes that need to be followed weekly. The user is requesting action and indicating a breakdown in following procedures. The categories I have are \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the focus on timecards and leave, \"HR Support\" seems like the most fitting category for this ticket.**Deciding on the ticket category**\n\nThe ticket talks about timecard submission and annual leave, which relates to HR or payroll processes. The closest category here is \"HR Support,\" which is actually on the list! I see the options include \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Since \"HR Support\" is valid, I need to categorize the ticket that way. I'll format the response as a JSON object with the category specified correctly.{\"category\":\"HR Support\"}"
