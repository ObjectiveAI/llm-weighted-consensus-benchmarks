It's a bit messy, but I\u2019ll figure it out!**Deciding on categorization**\n\nThe phrase \"oracle queries turning the notifications on\" hints at an issue with Oracle queries and notifications, possibly related to infrastructure or access. \"Content assign\" might indicate a task involving content assignment, and \"cannot fixed please turn back\" suggests wanting to revert a change.  \n\nConsidering all these elements, I think \"Infrastructure\" is the best fit since it aligns with the Oracle queries. However, \"Administrative rights\" could also apply, and \"Miscellaneous\" might be a fallback if it feels too convoluted. Let\u2019s categorize!**Choosing the right category**\n\nI need to select the best category from the allowed options. The ticket could fit \"Internal Project,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" or \"Access.\" It talks about \"oracle queries turning the notifications on,\" which seems to hint at \"Access\" since it relates to notification settings and permissions, but I'm not entirely sure.  \n\nThere's also the mention of \"content assign\" and \"please turn back,\" and it might touch on \"Administrative rights\" if it involves admin access. Given the overall confusion, \"Miscellaneous\" appears to be the safest choice since it fits ambiguous requests well."
