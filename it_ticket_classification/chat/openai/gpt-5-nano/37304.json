The options for categorization include things like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Access.\" Given that it's specifically about deactivating a stolen access badge, the category \"Access\" seems appropriate. While \"Administrative rights\" could fit, it's more about security-related access issue than admin rights since the user didn\u2019t mention those.**Responding with JSON**\n\nI\u2019m confirming the category as \"Access\" for the IT ticket. Now, I need to respond in the required JSON format, which specifies that I provide an object with a \"category\" property. So, I\u2019ll create a response like this: {\"category\":\"Access\"}. I need to make sure there's no extra commentary or content beyond this. It just has to be a clean, straightforward JSON object, aligning with the instruction to keep it simple."
