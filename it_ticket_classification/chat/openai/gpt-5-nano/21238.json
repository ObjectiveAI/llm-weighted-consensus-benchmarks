It seems to mention missing time reports, submissions, and someone on maternity leave. I\u2019ll focus on key phrases about weekly timesheets, updating records, and report cascading. Given these themes, it most likely fits in the \u201cHR Support\u201d category since it relates to time reporting and user records. I\u2019ll make sure to assign it correctly for efficient follow-up!**Deciding on Category Assignment**\n\nI need to categorize the IT ticket, and \u201cHR Support\u201d fits perfectly since the content revolves around time reports, submitting weekly timesheets, maternity leave, and updating user records. Although \u201cAdministrative rights\u201d could have been a consideration if it were about access, the main focus is HR processes. So, I\u2019m settling on \u201cHR Support\u201d as the category.
