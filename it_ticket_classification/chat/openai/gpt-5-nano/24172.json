The \"pm\" could refer to \"project manager\" or \"personal message,\" while \"ext\" might mean \"extension.\" Given these clues, the best fit for this ticket appears to be \"HR Support,\" as it relates to the onboarding process for a new starter.**Deciding on the ticket category**\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards categorizing this IT ticket under \"HR Support\" since it relates to onboarding a new starter. The user\u2019s phrase\u2014\"new starter December pm starter form ext\"\u2014suggests an HR context. While \"Access\" could apply if they need access provisioning, the phrase feels more aligned with onboarding. The minimal text is tricky, but since \"HR Support\" is on the list and matches the context, I\u2019ll format the answer in JSON: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}.**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nThe user asked me to categorize an IT ticket, and I need to respond with a JSON object that reflects the appropriate category. Based on the text provided, I think \"HR Support\" fits well since it relates to onboarding a new starter. However, I also consider whether \"Access\" might apply, depending on whether they need system access. That said, the context strongly leans towards \"HR Support.\" Therefore, my final output should be: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}.**Choosing the ticket category**\n\nIn IT ticketing, the term \"new starter\" often involves both HR and IT responsibilities, but if I have to choose just one category, I think \"HR Support\" is the best fit since it relates primarily to onboarding. The mention of \"starter form\" suggests an HR process, and I\u2019ll keep it simple. I\u2019ll stick with \"HR Support\" for clarity. So, I\u2019ll respond with: {\"category\": \"HR Support\"}. That's all I need to provide!"
