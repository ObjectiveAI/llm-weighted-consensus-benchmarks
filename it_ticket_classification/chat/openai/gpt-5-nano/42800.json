It could possibly fit under \"Internal Project,\" \"Administrative rights,\" or \"Access,\" but doesn't seem related to hardware or storage. Leaning towards \"Internal Project\" feels right since it involves a shared infrastructure change request.**Finalizing IT ticket categorization**\n\nI see phrases like \"peer review tasks invalidated,\" \"check flow for non-shared infra,\" and \"log ticket assign for fixing,\" which suggest this is a project task related to fixing the change request flow in shared infrastructure. \"Internal Project\" seems like the best fit. Alternatively, if it involves approvals, I might consider \"Administrative rights.\" \n\n\"Miscellaneous\" could be an option if nothing fits, but it\u2019s best to select one. I'll present my answer in the required JSON-like format as follows: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.**Confirming JSON schema for categorization**\n\nI see the schema requires a JSON object with a \"category\" key that holds one of the specified values. It doesn't explicitly say that we need the \"type\": \"object\" fields in the response, so to play it safe, I'll simply output: {\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}.\n\nLooking at the ticket, it mentions \"shared infra CR flow fix,\" indicating it's related to a change request flow within shared infrastructure, which definitely fits under \"Internal Project.\" I\u2019ll keep my response concise and straight to the point."
