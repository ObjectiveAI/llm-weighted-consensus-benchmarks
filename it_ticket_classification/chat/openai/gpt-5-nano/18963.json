The available categories are fairly broad: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" and others. It looks like \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit given there isn't a specific category for phone issues. \"Access\" could be relevant if it pertains to access control, but it might not be the main focus here. So I\u2019m leaning towards categorizing it as \"Miscellaneous.\"**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI see keywords like \"unwanted calls\" and \"caller looking,\" which hints at possible harassment or spoofing. It could fit under \"HR Support\" if it were about harassment, but since it\u2019s specifically about unwanted calls during work, that's not quite right. I think \"Miscellaneous\" is the most fitting category for this ambiguous issue. For the output, I should format it as a JSON object with \"category\" set to \"Miscellaneous.\"**Categorizing the IT ticket**\n\nI should definitely keep in mind the instruction to \"Categorize this IT Ticket.\" The final output needs to fit the schema without unnecessary explanations. The allowed category is a JSON object, so it should simply be {\"category\":\"Miscellaneous\"}.\n\nWhile I briefly considered \"HR Support\" due to the harassment angle, it really doesn't address employee issues, so \"Miscellaneous\" feels safer and more accurate. I'll go ahead and confirm that category in the output."
