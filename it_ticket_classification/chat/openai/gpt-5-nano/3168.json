For the Azure subscription request, it fits best under \"Purchase\" since it's about acquiring a service. The request phrase suggests they're looking for a new subscription, which is definitely a purchase situation. So, I\u2019ll format the response as a JSON object with \"category\": \"Purchase\" as specified, ensuring no extra text is included."
