It looks like there's an issue regarding the approve/reject actions, leading to pending statuses in an application. This is related to the approvals workflow in an IT context. I think \"Administrative rights\" might not be pertinent here, but \"Access\" could refer to notifications. Based on this, I\u2019d categorize it as an \"Internal Project\" since it involves application functionality.**Determining category for IT ticket**\n\nI think the best category for the user's request is \"Internal Project.\" If there's any uncertainty, \"Miscellaneous\" could work too. However, I should choose one. I need to craft a concise answer using the JSON format specified by the system, which requires an object with a \"category\" string. The user asked for this IT ticket to be categorized, so I\u2019ll keep it minimal and directly respond with proper JSON formatting. Here it is:\n\n{\"category\":\"Internal Project\"}"
