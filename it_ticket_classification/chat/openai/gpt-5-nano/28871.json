Since there's no specific category for \"Networking,\" I\u2019ll consider \"Hardware\" for this task as it's likely hardware-related. \"Access\" could be another option, but \"Administrative rights\" doesn't apply here.**Categorizing IT ticket**\n\nThe ticket states: \"connect floor port into switch.\" It seems the user may have made some typos, but the request clearly indicates they want to connect a floor port, which is likely an Ethernet jack, to a switch. This is definitely a hardware-related task, so I\u2019ll categorize it under \"Hardware.\" The required format is a JSON object with the category, so I'll respond simply with: {\"category\":\"Hardware\"}. A clean and concise answer!"
