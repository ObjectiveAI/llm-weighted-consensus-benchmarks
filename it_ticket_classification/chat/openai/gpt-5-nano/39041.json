After analyzing it, I see mentions of purchase requisitions, Oracle, and delays. It appears to be primarily about getting approvals and addressing costs related to responsibilities. Given all of this, the most fitting category seems to be \"Purchase\" since it focuses on that aspect. I'll select \"Purchase\" as the category for this ticket.**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI see that the content could potentially fit the \"Internal Project\" category, but given the clear mentions of \"approval for purchase requisitions,\" \"Oracle,\" and \"delays,\" \"Purchase\" seems more appropriate. The user asked me to categorize this IT ticket, which should be in JSON format. After confirming the correct structure, I'll deliver the following: {\"category\":\"Purchase\"}. It\u2019s within the enumerated values, and I\u2019ll make sure to keep it concise. Maybe I\u2019ll add a brief note along with the JSON object!"
