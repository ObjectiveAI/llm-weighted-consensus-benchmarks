I'm taking the provided ticket description and comparing it against the list: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\". My initial analysis involves keyword extraction and pattern matching to identify the most relevant category. I'm exploring different algorithms for optimal accuracy.\n\n\n**Evaluating Ticket Details**\n\nI've been examining the provided ticket descriptions, searching for the best category. Based on the phrases, \"installing secondary monitor\" and \"other monitor install\", I'm leaning toward \"Hardware.\" The remote user elements also suggest Remote support, but Hardware seems more directly related to the action needed. I'm considering the weight of those keywords.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Focus**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase\" categories based on the ticket details. While the user's focus on installing a secondary monitor is central, there's also an indication of potential hardware replacement or ordering. I'm weighing the relevance of these elements to pinpoint the most accurate classification. My analysis leans toward \"Hardware\" given the installation need, but I'm considering \"Purchase\" as a supplementary detail.\n\n\n**Selecting the Best Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's keywords. Phrases like \"installing secondary monitor\" and \"replacement\" strongly point towards hardware. \"Remote user\" is mentioned, however, the direct issue is a hardware task. I am leaning towards categorizing the ticket as \"Hardware,\" focusing on the user's primary need. I've ruled out \"Purchase\" as the core issue is the installation itself, even though a potential hardware order may be implied.\n\n\n"
