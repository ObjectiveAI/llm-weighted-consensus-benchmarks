My analysis points strongly towards a \"Storage\" issue due to recurring mentions of \"out of space\" and \"server disk,\" which directly impacts functionality and deployments.\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the ticket text, identifying key indicators like \"out of space\" and \"server disk,\" which solidified my categorization as \"Storage.\" The remaining phrases appear to be context about the impact on deployments.\n\n"
