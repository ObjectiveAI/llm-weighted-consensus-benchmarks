I'm carefully evaluating the nuances of each term and their implications.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nNow, I've refined my initial assessment. While \"Access\" was a contender, the phrases \"role rights\" and \"implement possible feature\" solidify \"Administrative rights\" as the best fit. I'm confident in this choice, as the context points towards managing or configuring system features and permissions, which aligns perfectly with administrative privileges.\n\n\n**Refining Category Determination**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's keywords, especially \"report assignments linked eel tool\" and \"planning officer,\" and they still point strongly toward \"Administrative rights.\"  The phrase \"awaiting updates\" also doesn't change my determination. The focus is on the *management* or *implementation* aspect of \"eel features\" and the related system privileges, and I believe \"Administrative rights\" remains the most accurate fit.\n\n\n"
