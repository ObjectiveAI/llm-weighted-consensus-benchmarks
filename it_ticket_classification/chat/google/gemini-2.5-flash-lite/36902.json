Based on \"social is unusable unusable hello please raise with owner for\", I'm leaning toward either \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The lack of specific technical details makes it tricky. I need to make the right selection, and I'm still weighing my options.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Problem**\n\nI've examined the ticket text, and the phrases point toward an HR-related issue: recruiting efforts, resume uploading, and recommending candidates.  \"HR Support\" seems like the most fitting category, as it aligns with the user's struggle with a recruiting tool. The other categories don't quite fit the description.\n\n\n**Identifying the Category**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the text of the IT ticket and considered the available categories. \"HR Support\" appears to be the most accurate fit. It clearly addresses the issues surrounding the recruiting tool, uploading resumes, and recommendations, all central to HR functions. This decision is based on a close match between the problem described and the purpose of the HR support category.\n\n\n"
