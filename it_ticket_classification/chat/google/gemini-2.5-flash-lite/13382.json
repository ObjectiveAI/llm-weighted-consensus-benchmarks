Based on the initial text \"new project for seal operator pm seal,\" I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project.\" This seems the most fitting category given the project-related phrasing. However, I will remain vigilant for any hidden cues that might shift the categorization, or require a more specific category.\n\n\n**Revising Category Scope**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the initial \"Internal Project\" categorization. While still a strong contender, the request for \"setup\" and \"tracking screens\" has prompted me to consider if \"Access\" is a more precise fit. Although it doesn't specify system access, the core requirement is setting something up, potentially involving access grants. However, \"Internal Project\" encompasses a wider range of setup activities. I'm leaning back towards \"Internal Project\" as the more comprehensive choice, but I'll continue to weigh the finer points.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Decision**\n\nI've been meticulously reviewing the ticket's text, and my current thinking remains firmly rooted in \"Internal Project.\" The \"new project\" phrasing is a solid indicator. While \"Access\" is a possibility given the setup and screen requirements, \"Internal Project\" offers a more holistic view. I believe the setup tasks are integral to the project's launch, not an isolated access grant. The form attachment further strengthens this project-based classification.\n\n\n"
