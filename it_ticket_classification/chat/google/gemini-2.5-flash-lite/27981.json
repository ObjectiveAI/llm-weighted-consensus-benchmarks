The phrase's context, specifically the keywords, are driving this classification process. Further refinement could involve examining the context surrounding the request, if any more information is available.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've examined the ticket text: \"maternity leave access card,\" focusing on keyword analysis and context. The recurring terms, such as \"maternity leave,\" \"form,\" and \"access card,\" initially suggested \"Access.\" However, after comparing with the available categories, I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the primary concern is the maternity leave process. The \"access card\" is ancillary to the HR-related form completion.\n\n\n"
