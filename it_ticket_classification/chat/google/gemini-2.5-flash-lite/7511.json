While \"approvals\" and \"waiting\" were initially considered for \"Access,\" I now see they could also relate to purchasing processes or even administrative rights. I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" given the ambiguity.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the IT ticket's content, particularly the recurring themes of \"approvals\" and \"waiting.\" While the mention of \"Oracle approvals\" hints at a specific system, the core issue seems to be a stalled workflow. Without further context to definitively link it to \"Access,\" \"Purchase,\" or \"Administrative rights,\" I'm inclined to classify it under \"Miscellaneous\" for now.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the IT ticket's classification. The recurring \"approvals\" and \"waiting\" keywords, especially in relation to \"Oracle,\" strongly suggest a workflow bottleneck. Given the ambiguity and lack of clear indicators for specific categories like \"Access\" or \"Purchase,\" I'm leaning towards the \"Miscellaneous\" category.\n\n"
