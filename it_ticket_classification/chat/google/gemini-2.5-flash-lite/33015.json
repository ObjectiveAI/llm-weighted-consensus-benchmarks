I'm focusing on keywords and phrases within the provided text to decide on the most accurate classification from the given options. I'm leaning toward eliminating some categories based on the lack of clear indicators.\n\n\n**Focusing on Relevance**\n\nI've honed in on the HR Support category as the most fitting, given the prominence of terms like \"career maps,\" \"grades,\" and \"job titles.\" The repeated mention of \"maps\" might represent visualizations or organizational charts used in HR functions. Additionally, the phrases \"find forms\" and \"information maps\" are strongly suggestive of an HR-related information management process. I'm now fairly confident this falls squarely within the HR domain.\n\n\n**Categorizing with Certainty**\n\nI've reviewed the provided text thoroughly and am now quite certain that the ticket falls under \"HR Support.\" The phrases like \"career maps,\" \"grades,\" and \"job titles\" are explicitly indicative of HR-related functions. The repeated mention of \"maps,\" \"find forms,\" and \"information maps\" aligns with information management tasks commonly associated with the HR domain, solidifying my categorization.\n\n\n"
