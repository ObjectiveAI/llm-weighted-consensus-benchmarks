After careful consideration of the keywords like \"new starter\", \"added location workstation\", and \"intern\", I'm leaning towards a specific selection. I'm cross-referencing this information with the provided list of potential categories to ensure a precise fit.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Focus**\n\nMy current thinking is zeroing in on \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate category. The strong presence of \"new starter\" and \"intern\" in the ticket description led me to prioritize this selection. I've re-examined the other options to ensure \"HR Support\" genuinely captures the core issue, especially considering the \"added location workstation\" detail. I want to be certain this selection is the most accurate.\n\n\n**Revisiting Ticket Details**\n\nI am now reviewing the ticket details once again, focusing on the potential implications of \"added location workstation.\" While the primary indicators still point to HR support, I'm analyzing whether a secondary category might be necessary. I'm exploring the nuances of \"new starter\" and \"intern\" in relation to hardware provisioning, ensuring I haven't overlooked any crucial aspects. My goal is to ensure the categorization comprehensively addresses the request.\n\n\n"
