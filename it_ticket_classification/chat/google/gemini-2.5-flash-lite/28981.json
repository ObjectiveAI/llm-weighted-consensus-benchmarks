Currently, I'm focusing on keywords and phrases within the provided text, like \"new starter\". My goal is to determine if it relates to \"HR Support\", \"Access\", or possibly a more general category. I'll need to consider the context of the words to make an informed decision.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Focus**\n\nI've determined that the \"new starter\" phrase, combined with mentions of forms and forwarding to other teams, strongly indicates a need for \"HR Support\" over other options. While \"Access\" could be relevant, \"HR Support\" encompasses the broader context of onboarding a new employee. I'm confident in this categorization now.\n\n\n**Defining the Priority**\n\nI've examined the ticket text and it points strongly to \"HR Support\" as the main category. While \"Access\" is a possibility, the context of onboarding the new employee makes \"HR Support\" the more encompassing option. I'm prioritizing this as the best fit and will keep that in mind.\n\n\n"
