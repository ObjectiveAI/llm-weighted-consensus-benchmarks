I'm still weighing it against \"Miscellaneous\", but the specifics lean toward HR.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nMy assessment is now complete. The ticket's content, specifically regarding \"annual leave\" and \"off days,\" clearly indicates an HR-related issue. Categorizing it as \"HR Support\" is the most accurate and appropriate choice.\n\n\n"
