From the ticket description, the user wants access to book meeting rooms on Thursday afternoons. I need to figure out which category this request falls under. Is it related to access, internal projects, or something else entirely? The brevity is challenging, but I'm leaning toward \"Access\" for now.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Needs**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's core request: granting permission to book meeting rooms on Thursdays. \"Access\" still feels like the strongest fit, as it directly addresses who is \"allowed\" to perform this action. The other categories, like \"HR Support\" or \"Internal Project,\" seem less precise in capturing this permission-based request. Focusing on \"Access\" will help in assigning the correct priority and resource to address the user's need.\n\n\n"
