The text indicates an \"internal audit\" and \"visitor cards review.\" My initial thought is to categorize this under \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Administrative rights,\" as it involves an internal process and may relate to access control. I will consider if this requires some other type of access, and then make a decision.\n\n\n**Assessing Access Requirements**\n\nI've refined my thinking and believe the primary focus is access control. The ticket's emphasis on \"visitor cards,\"  \"information control,\" and \"liaising\" strongly suggests this. While an \"internal audit\" aspect exists, the underlying activity is managing and reviewing access. I am leaning towards \"Access,\" but I'll double-check it isn't an \"Internal Project\" first.\n\n\n**Refining Access Categorization**\n\nI've carefully re-examined the ticket content and considered all options. The phrase \"visitor cards\" immediately brought \"Access\" to mind. After analyzing the full text (\"internal audit,\" \"information control,\" \"spreadsheet accuracy,\" and \"liaise OMS\"), my initial choice has been validated. This is not a hardware, HR, storage, purchase, administrative rights or a miscellaneous request. It is about actively managing access. I am now certain this falls squarely under the \"Access\" category, as it pertains to the management and auditing of visitor access control.\n\n\n"
