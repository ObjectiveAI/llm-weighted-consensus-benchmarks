                    "reasoning": "**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for the IT ticket. After careful consideration of the text, \"implement feedback survey for snow\", I'm leaning heavily towards \"Internal Project.\" This seems to accurately reflect the nature of the request, which appears to be a distinct undertaking within the organization. The word \"implement\" further supports this conclusion.\n\n\n**Analyzing Survey Implementation**\n\nI've been meticulously examining the IT ticket's text, especially the phrase \"implement feedback survey snow.\" My focus is squarely on the action of *implementation*.  I've cross-referenced this against the available categories. \"Internal Project\" still seems to be the most fitting label, as this request encapsulates more than a simple task. My reasoning is that the scope includes setup, rules, and testing \u2013 all hallmarks of a defined internal endeavor.\n\n\n**Evaluating Implementation Details**\n\nNow I'm diving deeper into the nuances of implementation. The request encompasses setting up a random survey system with pre-defined rules, aiming for data collection. This is more than a simple configuration change and is more of an undertaking, which is the crux of internal projects. Still leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the most precise descriptor, but I'm keeping an eye open for how much effort would be considered reasonable.\n\n\n\n**Assessing Project Scope**\n\nI'm now determining if this constitutes a full \"Internal Project\" or simply a configuration task. Based on \"setting rules\" and \"testing\", it appears more involved than a simple change, but less involved than a full product development. I'm focusing on \"snow\" to evaluate the integration effort. The scope continues to lean toward \"Internal Project,\" though slight nuance exists.\n\n\n**Categorizing Implementation Effort**\n\nI'm now weighing whether the \"implement feedback survey\" task is a \"project\" or a more straightforward configuration change. The phrase \"same feedback survey rules\" leans towards configuration. However, \"implement\" suggests a broader undertaking, including setup and possible integration testing. \"Internal Project\" continues to be the best fit for this scope, though I'm keeping a nuanced perspective on the granularity.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Decision**\n\nI've been meticulously examining the request to see if it is still a \"Internal Project\". The \"same feedback survey rules\" implies an existing survey module within \"snow,\" perhaps requiring configuration, which narrows the scope from building a new system to more of a configuration effort. This leads me to reconsider whether this could fall under \"Miscellaneous\" if the effort is minor. I need further context to ascertain the exact level of effort involved.\n\n**Prioritizing Implementation Type**\n\nI've been analyzing the nature of the \"implement feedback survey snow\" request. The key is now to determine if this is a minor configuration change within a system like \"snow\", potentially making \"Miscellaneous\" a valid choice. Alternatively, the \"implement\" action and the \"setting rules\" element could indicate a more significant undertaking, solidifying \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category.\n\n\n**Analyzing Implementation Context**\n\nI'm now evaluating whether \"snow\" refers to a platform like ServiceNow. If it does, the IT ticket likely represents an \"Internal Project,\" as implementing surveys often entails configuration or development work within such systems. Considering \"snow\" as a system clarifies the categorization, solidifying my decision.\n\n\n"
