                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing Ticket Text**\n\nI'm currently focused on categorizing the provided IT ticket text: \"wireless networks scan thursday re wireless networks hi please create assign thanks\".  My analysis indicates this likely falls under the \"Access\" category due to the mention of \"wireless networks\" and \"assign.\"\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Scope**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the provided IT ticket text, now expanded with additional details, to refine the categorization. The key focus remains on the \"wireless networks\" aspect, along with associated tasks like scanning and addressing \"rogue wireless networks\". My earlier assumption of \"Access\" now seems less precise. I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the closest fit, though \"Miscellaneous\" is also under consideration because of the broad scope. The inclusion of a defined \"procedure\" further points toward an internal operational task.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Classification**\n\nMy focus is now on refining the categorization of this IT ticket text. I've eliminated \"Hardware\" as the primary category, since it's too general for this task. After careful review, I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. While it could be considered routine maintenance, the explicit mention of a defined \"procedure\" implies a more structured, internal undertaking.  \"Miscellaneous\" still seems overly broad, despite not perfectly aligning with a known category such as \"Network Operations\".\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nMy ongoing assessment of the IT ticket has narrowed the classification further. While \"Hardware\" remains a viable option, I'm now exploring the nuances of \"Internal Project\" more deeply. Given the explicit procedure mentioned, it suggests a structured, potentially recurring task. The repeated mentions of \"wireless networks\", \"scan\", and \"rogue wireless networks\" strongly indicate the ticket concerns the network infrastructure. Although this could be considered 'network support', neither 'Network Operations' nor 'Network Support' are explicit categories. I'm leaning toward selecting \"Hardware\" as the closest match for the network infrastructure element, but \"Internal Project\" is also a strong contender.\n\n\n**Analyzing Network Operations**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the provided IT ticket, focusing on refining the categorization based on the expanded context. The repeated mentions of \"wireless networks,\" \"scan,\" and \"rogue wireless networks,\" coupled with the explicit \"procedure,\" strongly indicate an operational task related to network infrastructure. Although \"Hardware\" remains a viable option, I'm now leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the closest fit due to the structured nature of the described task and procedure. This feels more accurate than the \"Hardware\" assumption.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nThe current focus is on selecting the most appropriate category for the provided IT ticket. After careful re-evaluation of the text and available categories, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Internal Project\". The repeated emphasis on \"wireless networks\", \"scan\", and \"rogue wireless networks\" combined with a defined \"procedure\" strongly suggests a structured initiative, not just routine hardware maintenance. Although \"Hardware\" remains a possibility, the systematic nature of the task makes \"Internal Project\" a better fit.\n\n\n**Categorizing Network Operations**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"Internal Project\" category, as the IT ticket describes a structured task with a defined procedure, involving scanning for and addressing \"rogue wireless networks\". The structured approach of the \"create assign\" and \"perform...by attached procedure\" aligns well with this category. Although hardware is involved, the focus is on a network-related operational project.\n\n\n**Refining Ticket Category**\n\nMy analysis of the ticket has narrowed, with the \"Internal Project\" category gaining traction. The task details, including scanning and addressing \"rogue wireless networks\" through a defined \"procedure,\" points to an organized, planned activity. This feels more accurate than the broad \"Hardware\" category.\n\n\n"
