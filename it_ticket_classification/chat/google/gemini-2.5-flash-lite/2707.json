The repeated emphasis on \"leaver,\" \"leaving date,\" and associated account management tasks like \"ad forwarder\" and \"leaver mailbox\" directly points to access control and provisioning actions stemming from employee departures.\n\n**Refining Access Control**\n\nI'm now refining my categorization to \"Access.\" The extensive references to account management for departing employees\u2014like revoking rights, forwarding mail, and disabling tokens\u2014solidify this as the most accurate classification for the IT ticket's core actions.\n\n"
