Phrases like \"annual leave\" and \"days balance\" are strong indicators. I'm also considering \"Access\" due to the \"deleted card\" mention.  I'm now determining the primary category, factoring in that \"awaiting approval\" could be relevant to multiple options.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the text of the IT ticket and believe it clearly falls under \"HR Support.\" Phrases like \"annual leave\" and \"days balance\" are definitive. While \"deleted card\" introduced a slight ambiguity, considering the context of leave management, it further points towards HR. I'm confident in classifying this ticket accordingly.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Context**\n\nAfter re-evaluating the ticket content, I've confirmed that \"HR Support\" remains the most suitable category. The phrases \"annual leave\" and \"days balance\" are too dominant to ignore. Although \"deleted card\" introduced a slight ambiguity, it seems linked to the leave management process within an HR context, which solidifies the categorization. I'm now certain this is an HR-related issue.\n\n\n"
