The ticket mentions \"hard drive,\" which strongly suggests a \"Hardware\" classification.\n\n**Selecting IT Ticket Categories**\n\nMy current task involves selecting the most appropriate category for an IT ticket. Given the mention of \"hard drive\" and \"RAM,\" I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" as it encompasses both components. I'm evaluating if \"Storage\" is a better fit due to the \"hard drive\" aspect, but RAM's inclusion solidifies \"Hardware\" as the primary choice.\n\n**Processing Ticket Keywords**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the IT ticket text. The terms \"hard drive\" and \"RAM update request,\" along with \"upgrade,\" strongly indicate a \"Hardware\" classification. I'm also noting mentions of \"storage\" and \"second hard drive,\" but \"Hardware\" seems the most encompassing category for the combined hardware components.\n\n**Updating Ticket Categories**\n\nI'm currently refining the categorization for an IT ticket. My recent analysis strongly favors \"Hardware\" as the primary classification, given explicit mentions of both \"hard drive\" and \"RAM\" updates. While \"Storage\" is relevant due to the hard drive component, the inclusion of RAM makes \"Hardware\" the most comprehensive choice.\n\n"
