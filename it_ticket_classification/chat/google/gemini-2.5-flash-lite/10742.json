So far, the context points away from things like hardware and storage, but it isn't clear enough yet to be sure. I'm considering HR-related categories or perhaps access, depending on the role of the person leaving. I'll need to further parse the text to be sure.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text and the provided keywords to determine the most accurate category. While \"leaver service\" indicates an HR process, I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the primary focus since the ticket heavily involves managing accounts, mailboxes, and rights upon an employee's departure. However, the connection to HR is also significant, as the leaver form is an HR-related process that triggers the other procedures.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nMy focus has shifted. I'm now inclined toward \"HR Support\" as the primary category, despite the substantial access-related components. The \"leaver form\" signals this process originates within HR. The keywords \"mailbox,\" \"ad rights,\" and \"ad forwarder\" are still relevant. I'm taking a more holistic view. The ticket's essence revolves around the HR-initiated leaver process, and subsequent actions are triggered from that initial point.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Focus**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"HR Support\" as the primary category, considering the encompassing nature of \"leaver\" tasks. The ticket's emphasis on the \"leaver form\" underscores that this is an HR-initiated process, even if the work primarily focuses on access rights and system modifications. My thinking now centers on the ticket's roots in the employee offboarding, which is a key HR responsibility.\n\n\n"
