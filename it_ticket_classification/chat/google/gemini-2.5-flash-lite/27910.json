Keywords like \"macs,\" \"add addresses,\" and \"machines\" suggest a hardware or access issue. \"Discipline lead\" might point to an internal project. However, the request seems to be about adding new devices, which leans more towards hardware. I'm leaning towards \"Hardware,\" but I need to ensure it isn't an administrative right request and is truly just related to adding the new devices.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Focus: Progressing**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. Based on the ticket details, it's about setting up new computers. While \"Access\" could apply, the core request involves the hardware. Keywords like \"new macs\" and \"machines\" solidified the \"Hardware\" angle. \"Add addresses\" feels more like network setup than an access right, in this context. While \"purchase\" is unlikely, I must ensure it is not an Administrative rights request.\n\n\n**Identifying Final Category: Focused**\n\nI've examined the ticket text again. Focusing on keywords, the request for \"new macs\" and \"machines\" strongly suggests a \"Hardware\" issue. While \"add addresses\" initially raised a potential for \"Access,\" contextually, it's about network configuration for the new devices. I am confident that \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category, as it directly addresses the user's primary concern.\n\n\n"
