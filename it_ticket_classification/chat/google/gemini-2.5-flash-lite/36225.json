The client's description seems to indicate an issue with Oracle client access and potentially some problems with project codes within the Fusion system. It sounds like there's a disconnect between the client's expectations and what's actually visible, possibly stemming from project code assignment or visibility.\n\n\n**Defining the Problem**\n\nI've determined the issue revolves around access. The user is missing Oracle client access, needs project codes created, and is experiencing visibility problems within Fusion. It seems the problem has been previously encountered. Therefore, I will categorize this ticket as \"Access\".\n\n\n**Confirming Access Issues**\n\nI'm now fully confident that the ticket falls squarely under \"Access.\" The user's description explicitly highlights missing Oracle client access, a request for new project codes within Fusion, and visibility problems. The recurring nature of the problem, as mentioned by the user, further solidifies the access-related nature of the issue. Therefore, the \"Access\" category seems the perfect fit.\n\n\n"
