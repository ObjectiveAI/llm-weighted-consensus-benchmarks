My analysis will decide how to categorize this ticket.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Determination**\n\nI've re-examined the keywords in detail, especially \"purchase order\" and \"requisition,\" as well as \"supplier,\" and \"tax.\" While \"computer supplier\" and \"installation\" were briefly considered, the request is clearly about the ordering process. I've confirmed that \"Purchase\" is the best fit, as the core of the request concerns acquiring goods and the intricacies of the order.\n\n\n"
