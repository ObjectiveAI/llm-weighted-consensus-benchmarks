While \"Hardware\" was an initial thought, the description emphasizes user access and root cause investigation, suggesting \"Miscellaneous\" may be more appropriate given the lack of a direct \"Application Support\" category.\n\n**Choosing Application Category**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the IT ticket description to pinpoint the most suitable category.
