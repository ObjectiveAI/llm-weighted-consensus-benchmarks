I've noted \"new starter,\" which immediately points toward either HR Support or Access. More investigation is required to precisely pinpoint the correct classification. The next steps will determine whether this is an issue of access provisioning or a broader HR inquiry. I'm focusing on the keywords.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket's Focus**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the keywords \"new starter\", \"joining\", and \"completed form.\" These strongly point towards a core HR Support need, not hardware or immediate access provisioning. The \"Friday PM\" and location context are secondary details. \"Compliance officer\" and the confidentiality note add context, reinforcing an onboarding/HR process. I believe the ticket clearly falls under \"HR Support\".\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been drilling down on the phrases and I'm currently leaning towards \"HR Support.\" The context suggests a new employee joining, with reference to onboarding forms. Although access and potentially hardware setup are implied, the foundational request stems from HR's processes for new hires. The location and time are less critical in defining the category.\n\n\n"
