The repeated mention of \"abandoned devices\" is significant, steering me towards potential categories like Hardware, potentially Storage. I'm carefully weighing this alongside the given options, and considering if the ticket could be a combination of those or something completely different. It also reminds me of asset tracking/management solutions, which may have implications for classification.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the primary category, driven by the repeated references to \"abandoned devices,\" which strongly indicates a focus on physical assets. While \"Storage\" is also a possibility, the emphasis is on the devices themselves, not their storage location. I'm excluding the other options, like HR, Access, and Purchase, as they seem irrelevant to the core issue. I'm solidifying \"Hardware\" as my top pick.\n\n\n"
