I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" because the text mentions \"new starter\" and \"starter form\", but other categories like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" are still being considered in case of an access request or similar. I'm focusing on the context clues.\n\n\n**Focusing On HR Onboarding**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"HR Support\" as the most suitable ticket category. The text consistently points toward the \"starter form,\" which is a clear indicator of HR's involvement in the onboarding process. While \"Access\" could be relevant, the emphasis is on the initial paperwork. Further, \"Hardware\" and \"Administrative Rights\" are considered secondary to the primary \"starter form\" issue.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe \"HR Support\" category continues to be the most fitting. The \"starter form\" central to the text clearly designates a need for the HR team's involvement in a new employee's onboarding, which falls under their process. While other categories might be secondarily relevant, such as \"Access,\" or even \"Hardware\" in the long run, the starting issue directly involves HR administration.\n\n\n"
