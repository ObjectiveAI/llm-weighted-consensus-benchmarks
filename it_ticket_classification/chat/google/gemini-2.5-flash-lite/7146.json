The key here is applying the correct schema:  Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. Analyzing the text, I'm working to decipher the relevant keywords.\n\n\n**Assessing Access Requirements**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the specific access needs and deprovisioning steps implied in the text.  The \"leaver\" scenario involves more than just HR processes; it necessitates careful review of AD rights, mailbox access, and storage, which are critical for system security and compliance. My focus is now the correct category.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text, identifying keywords related to employee departure and system access. My analysis indicates a strong emphasis on the \"leaver\" process, including deprovisioning tasks and data management. Given this, and after reviewing the provided schema, I've concluded that \"HR Support\" best fits the ticket's nature. This is due to its focus on the employee offboarding, access revocation and HR-centric data management.\n\n\n"
