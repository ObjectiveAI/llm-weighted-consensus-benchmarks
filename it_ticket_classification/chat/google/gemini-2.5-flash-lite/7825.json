I've broken down the provided text, keying in on terms like \"OBI report improvements\". Based on my analysis, this feels like an **Internal Project** related issue. I'm exploring the implications further to confirm.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket's Scope**\n\nI'm deep-diving into the ticket details. The \"OBI report improvements\" initially leans toward **Internal Project**, but the more I analyze the text, the stronger the HR data reporting aspect becomes. The candidate status and requisition mentions are compelling. This could be a complex blend of issues.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text, and the focus is crystallizing. While \"OBI report improvements\" initially suggested an internal project, the content strongly revolves around refining HR-specific reports.  The candidate data, requisition details, and status updates point me to the HR Support category.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe evidence is clear; \"HR Support\" is the right pick. While the improvements touch reporting, the *target* is HR processes. The ticket description screams HR data management (candidates, requisitions, status changes). I am confident that \"HR Support\" accurately encapsulates the essence of this request.\n\n\n"
