My primary objective is to match the identified issues, specifically those related to conference access and expired certificates, with the available classification options to ensure accurate categorization.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm actively refining the categorization of the IT ticket. My current focus is on the impact of expired certificates, which is directly hindering users' ability to access and join conference calls, aligning it with the \"Access\" category.\n\n**Confirming Access Issues**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's details, focusing on keywords like \"unable to join\" and \"cannot access\" along with \"expired certificates\" as the root cause. This strongly indicates the problem falls under the \"Access\" category, as the core issue is about users being blocked from a service.\n\n"
