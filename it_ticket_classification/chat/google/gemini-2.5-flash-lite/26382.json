I'm exploring how different contexts influence its categorization, to improve the accuracy of assigning tickets to the right category. I'm focusing on \"new starter\" entries, trying to account for nuance, since it isn't always HR.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket: Access**\n\nMy current focus is crystalizing the ticket categorization. The recent keywords solidify \"Access\" as the primary category, while accounting for a potential tie-in to HR. I've broken down keywords like \"new starter\", \"credentials\", and \"basic groups\", weighing their contribution to the appropriate JSON output. I am focusing on the \"new starter\" term, as it is key to the overall context.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI'm now fully confident in the \"Access\" categorization. The repeated phrases like \"credentials,\" \"log user,\" and \"basic groups,\" coupled with the keyword \"assigned,\" overwhelmingly support this choice. I've ruled out other categories, considering their specific definitions and the lack of related keywords. The context strongly indicates an IT request for user access provisioning rather than HR processes. The term \"new starter\" is relevant, yet its function here points to access tasks.\n\n\n"
