It's becoming increasingly clear this is an access-related issue.  I'm leaning towards the \"Access\" category, but I need to ensure there isn't an overlap with administrative rights or internal projects.  My next step is to perform a more thorough keyword analysis to further solidify this initial assessment.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've got a clearer picture now. The \"git\" and \"access\" mentions are the lynchpins.  It's all about granting or fixing access to Git. The proxy detail is a definite access clue. There's no doubt the ticket's a classic \"Access\" case. I am confident that the category is \"Access\".\n\n\n"
