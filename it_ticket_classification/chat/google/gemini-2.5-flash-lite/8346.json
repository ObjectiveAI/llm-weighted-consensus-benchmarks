I'm carefully reviewing the provided list of categories to ensure the most accurate classification.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and available categories. \"Accounts swap,\" \"delete mailbox,\" and \"migrate files folders\" are key phrases. I'm leaning towards \"Storage\" as the primary category, given the emphasis on data management. However, I'm also considering \"Access\" due to the account-related aspects. Ultimately, \"Storage\" seems to best encompass the core actions, while \"Access\" could be a secondary consideration.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket text, focusing on the actions needing technical intervention. \"Migrate files/folders\" and \"delete mailbox\" clearly point to storage management. \"Accounts swap\" is also related to data migration and mailbox management. Thus, \"Storage\" remains the most accurate primary category, although \"Access\" could be a secondary consideration, depending on the system's architecture.\n\n\n"
