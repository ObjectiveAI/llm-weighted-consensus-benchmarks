The schema I'm working with has eight categories, which I'm actively comparing the provided text against. Currently, I am analyzing how to process an \"unable to\" phrase into a more relevant category, and also determining how to accurately process a phrase like \"reset password\".\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Issues**\n\nI've honed in on the central \"Access\" category for these tickets. After dissecting phrases like \"wants access,\" \"restore access,\" and \"full ownership,\" the pattern became clear. The requests are fundamentally about permissions. Even though terms like \"owner\" and \"site collection\" provide context, they underscore the need for access. While \"administrative rights\" could be tangentially related, the core issue is immediate access, solidifying the categorization.\n\n\n**Refining Access Criteria**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on defining the precise criteria for \"Access\" tickets. After reviewing requests for \"site owner\" and \"full ownership,\" the critical factor is authorization. It doesn't matter *what* permissions are requested, at the core, it's about establishing, re-establishing, or adjusting them. The focus is to determine where the core request lies when assessing such tickets.\n\n\n"
