I'm carefully weighing those two options now.\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Request**\n\nI've refined my thinking and I'm quite certain \"Access\" is the right fit. The phrase \"wants to share with everyone\" is a key indicator. It suggests the need for broader permissions or access to a resource, more so than requiring storage or administrative actions. I've ruled out other categories since they don't capture the intent of access or permission granting as clearly as this does.\n\n\n"
