Based on keywords like \"purchase order requisition,\" I'm leaning towards categorizing it under \"Purchase.\" I'll confirm this against the provided options.\n\n**Classifying the Request**\n\nI've analyzed the keywords and their proximity to action verbs. The terms \"document purchase order requisition,\" \"purchased requested by items,\" and \"purchase order requisition\" overwhelmingly indicate a transactional procurement. Thus, I'm confident in classifying this as a \"Purchase\" category ticket.\n\n"
