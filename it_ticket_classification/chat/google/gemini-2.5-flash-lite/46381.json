Currently, I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" due to the \"project resources\" reference. The \"access\" mention warrants a double-check, but the focus appears to be resource allocation within a project context.  I'm also considering the \"change settings\" aspect.\n\n\n**Shifting Focus: Access Control**\n\nI'm reconsidering the previous categorization. While \"Internal Project\" seemed initially relevant, the deeper analysis reveals the core issue is *access* to resources. The ticket details point toward managing team permissions and making related adjustments. The \"change settings\" and \"notification\" aspects are secondary to the central theme of controlling who gets access to what within the project. Therefore, I believe \"Access\" is the most accurate classification.\n\n\n"
