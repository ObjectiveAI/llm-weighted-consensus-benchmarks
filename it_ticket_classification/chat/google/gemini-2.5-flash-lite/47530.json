This poses a potential security risk, so I'm analyzing the provided text to pinpoint the most accurate category from the list.  My initial assessment leans towards a security or access-related categorization, but I'm refining my understanding before making a final determination.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Problem**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the correct category for this ticket.  I've reviewed the issue description, noting the continued visibility of a terminated employee's mail and AD entries.  While HR support could play a role, the core problem is clearly an access and deprovisioning issue. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" as the most accurate classification given the security implications of the lingering account.\n\n\n**Refining the Classification**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's details regarding the lingering access of a terminated employee. Initially leaning toward \"Access,\" my analysis strongly reinforces this categorization. The core issue revolves around a lack of proper deprovisioning, meaning the individual's ability to access company resources (mail, directory) remains active and poses a security risk. This is a clear case of Access control needing a resolution, not just HR related, thus this classification stands correct.\n\n\n"
