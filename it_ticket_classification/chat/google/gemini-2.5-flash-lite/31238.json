Based on the text \"projects should be going to and pm issues good morning unfortunately\", I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" due to the mention of \"projects\" and \"pm issues\". However, I'm carefully considering other options to ensure the most accurate classification.\n\n\n**Focusing on Login Issues**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"Access\" category. The text, particularly \"cannot log credentials,\" points directly to a login problem. While \"projects\" and \"approvals report\" provided context, the fundamental IT issue is access related. I'm now certain this is the primary concern and will recommend \"Access\" as the best categorization.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nNow, I'm reconsidering my initial \"Access\" selection. \"Projects should be going to and pm issues\" makes me think \"Internal Project\" could be relevant, especially with PM involved. I'm weighing the \"access\" keywords against the broader context, unsure of the ticket's primary focus. Perhaps it is a project that needs a login, or an ongoing problem with logging in to do project-related work. I will try to decide which issue takes precedence.\n\n\n"
