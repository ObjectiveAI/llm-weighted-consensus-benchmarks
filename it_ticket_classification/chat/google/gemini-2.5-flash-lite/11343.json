I'll need to consider this further to ensure accuracy.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI've re-evaluated the IT ticket and refined my categorization. Now, after analyzing the keywords (\"meeting setup,\" \"kitchen,\" and \"equipment connected\"), I'm strongly leaning toward \"Hardware.\" The focus on setup and equipment strongly suggests this, making it a more precise fit than the initial thought of \"Miscellaneous.\" I've considered all the options, and this seems the most accurate choice.\n\n\n"
