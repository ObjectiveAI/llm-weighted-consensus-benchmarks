Now I need to determine if it is an issue specific to Yammer or a broader access concern that is impacting the user. This will influence how I categorize the ticket.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Root Cause**\n\nI've narrowed down the ticket's focus. The user can sign in, so it isn't an authentication problem. Yammer access is the sticking point. After eliminating hardware, HR, storage, purchase, and internal project options, it's clear the core issue is 'access'. Though admin rights might be involved in access issues, the core problem presented is explicitly an access issue, meaning \"Access\" is the best categorization.\n\n\n"
