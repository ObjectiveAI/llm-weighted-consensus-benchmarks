I've got to determine which category best fits. \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" seem like potential fits right now, but I need to consider the scope of the problem. Is this a system-wide issue, or isolated? I'm leaning toward an access issue related to meeting software.\n\n\n**Defining Problem Category**\n\nI've examined the ticket text and it's definitely pointing towards an access issue, specifically concerning meeting platforms. The phrasing \"unable to join\" and mentions of expired certificates clearly indicate a lack of proper access to the system. While the issue could be caused by multiple factors, access seems to be the most relevant category.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nHaving assessed the ticket text, I've confirmed my initial leaning towards \"Access.\" The persistent inability to join meetings, coupled with the \"expired certificates\" detail, solidified this choice. Though \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility, the issue appears more directly related to service access. The repeated mentions of joining and accessing highlight the core problem, making \"Access\" the most accurate categorization for this ticket.\n\n\n"
