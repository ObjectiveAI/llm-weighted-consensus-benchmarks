The current text seems quite brief, making it challenging to pinpoint a definitive category. I am considering the context and the potential meanings of the phrases to make a determination.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and the available categories. \"New starter\" and the emphasis on a \"process\" strongly suggest \"Access\" is the most fitting category. While HR is involved in onboarding, this ticket seems specifically about the IT steps involved in granting access. I'm focusing on the technical steps of this process.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Request**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text with the available categories in mind. While HR might play a role in the broader onboarding, the emphasis on IT procedures, and on filling \"tickets\" points strongly towards \"Access\" as the most suitable category. The ticket text's focus is clearly on the technical steps needed for a new employee. I'm prioritizing the technical aspects.\n\n\n"
