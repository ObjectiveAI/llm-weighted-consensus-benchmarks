The initial text mentions reporting, employees, a leader, and an extension, which doesn't clearly point to any of the provided categories like hardware or access. My evaluation is that it is still not a fit into any of the available categories.\n\n\n**Revising Category: HR Support**\n\nI've revised the category to \"HR Support\". The original text, though vague, includes \"active employees\" and a \"report,\" which strongly suggests an HR-related query. While other categories were considered, the specific mention of employees makes this a more logical choice.\n\n\n**Finalizing Classification: HR Support**\n\nI've made the final categorization, selecting \"HR Support.\" The initial ambiguity has been resolved by focusing on \"active employees\" and the mention of a \"report.\" While the context remains broad, the strong link to employee data makes this category the most precise. All other categories seem less applicable given the information available.\n\n\n"
