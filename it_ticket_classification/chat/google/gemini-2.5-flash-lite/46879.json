It mentions a specific outlet and its location, suggesting a hardware or network problem. My current thoughts are leaning towards \"Hardware\" or potentially \"Access\" depending on the root cause. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact nature of the problem before a definitive categorization.\n\n\n**Determining the Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's description of a non-functional network outlet. The provided categories were evaluated, and \"Hardware\" clearly emerged as the most fitting. While access might indirectly be affected, the core problem lies with the physical connection point. Therefore, the issue has been definitively categorized as a \"Hardware\" problem.\n\n\n"
