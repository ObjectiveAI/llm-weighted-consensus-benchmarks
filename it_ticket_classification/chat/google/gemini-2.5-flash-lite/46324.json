My current effort is concentrated on identifying keywords and the overall context to differentiate between Hardware, HR Support, Access, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative Rights, and Miscellaneous.\n\n**Identifying Process-Related Issues**\n\nI've analyzed the text and identified that the core problem revolves around direct reports failing to follow established weekly submission processes. This suggests a procedural breakdown rather than a technical one, leading me to lean towards HR Support as the most appropriate category.\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Submission Issues**\n\nI've refined my understanding based on the ticket's content, specifically identifying that the central problem lies with direct reports failing to adhere to weekly submission processes. This procedural lapse, rather than a technical malfunction, strongly indicates that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category.\n\n"
