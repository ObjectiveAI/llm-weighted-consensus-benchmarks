The ticket text \"oracle no notifications for annual leave\" suggests it's likely related to either \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access\" if it involves access to leave information within Oracle. I'm leaning toward HR Support, but need to confirm.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on the best category: \"HR Support\" seems like the strongest contender. The ticket's text, especially the phrase \"annual leave,\" strongly points to an HR-related issue. The fact that the process is in Oracle is an implementation detail, but the root problem pertains to leave management. The \"Access\" category doesn't quite fit, and neither do any of the other options. While administrative rights issues *could* be involved, HR Support addresses the functionality most directly.\n\n\n**Revising Ticket Classification**\n\nMy assessment now strongly favors \"HR Support\" as the definitive category. The ticket describes staff's inability to manage annual leave approvals, clearly an HR function. While Oracle is involved, it's the HR process within that system that's malfunctioning, making \"HR Support\" the most accurate classification. I've reevaluated the other categories, and none fit as precisely.\n\n\n"
