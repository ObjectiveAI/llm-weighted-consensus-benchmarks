This clearly points towards an HR-related issue, so I'm assigning it to \"HR Support.\"\n\n**Determining the Category**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket's details, specifically the mention of work hours and public holidays, to pinpoint the most fitting classification from the available options. It seems to align closely with employee time tracking concerns.\n\n"
