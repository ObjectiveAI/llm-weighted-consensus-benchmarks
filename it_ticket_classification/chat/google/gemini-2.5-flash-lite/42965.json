I'm leaning toward either \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but need to decide if the Slack issue points specifically to network access.\n\n\n**Defining Key Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's description, focusing on the connection and authentication aspects. After weighing the options, \"Access\" seems to be the most appropriate. The core problem appears to stem from connectivity and authentication issues, aligning directly with this category. I've ruled out \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others as irrelevant. While \"Miscellaneous\" is a possibility, \"Access\" is more precise. The user's prompt further reinforced this decision.\n\n\n"
