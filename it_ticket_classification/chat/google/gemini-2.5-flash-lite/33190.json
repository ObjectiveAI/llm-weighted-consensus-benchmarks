My focus is on keywords like \"CPU usage\" and \"uptime\" to identify potential hardware-related issues. I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the primary classification.\n\n**Identifying System Issues**\n\nI'm processing the IT ticket text, noticing recurring terms like \"CPU usage,\" \"uptime,\" and \"swap virtual.\" These strongly indicate a focus on system performance and resource utilization, leading me to categorize this as a hardware-related issue.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm refining my categorization process, focusing on the recurring terms \"cpu usage,\" \"uptime,\" and \"swap virtual.\" These strongly suggest system resource and performance issues, leading me to solidify \"Hardware\" as the most fitting category.\n\n**Analyzing System Performance Metrics**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the provided IT ticket text, which repeatedly mentions \"cpu usage,\" \"uptime,\" and \"swap virtual.\" These terms strongly suggest issues related to system resource utilization and performance. My current assessment leans towards categorizing this as a \"Hardware\" issue, as these metrics are fundamental to system operational health.\n\n**Identifying System Performance Issues**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket text, noting the repeated focus on \"cpu usage,\" \"uptime,\" and \"swap virtual.\" These terms strongly suggest performance and resource utilization problems within the system. I am currently leaning towards classifying this as a \"Hardware\" issue, as these metrics are fundamental to assessing system operational health and resource allocation.\n\n**Categorizing System Metrics**\n\nI'm refining my categorization of the IT ticket text, focusing on the keywords \"cpu usage,\" \"uptime,\" and \"swap virtual.\" These strongly indicate a need to assess system resource utilization and performance, reinforcing my inclination to classify this as a \"Hardware\" issue.\n\n**Focusing on System Resources**\n\nI'm continuing to analyze the IT ticket text, paying close attention to terms like \"cpu usage,\" \"uptime,\" and \"swap virtual.\" These metrics consistently point towards issues with system resource utilization and performance. My current assessment strongly favors classifying this as a \"Hardware\" related issue due to the fundamental nature of these system components.\n\n**Assessing System Resource Performance**\n\nI'm continuing to analyze the IT ticket text, focusing on terms like \"cpu usage,\" \"uptime,\" and \"swap virtual.\" These metrics consistently point towards issues with system resource utilization and performance.

My current assessment leans towards classifying this as a \"Hardware\" related problem.\n\n**Focusing on System Metrics**\n\nI'm currently processing the IT ticket text, and the phrase \"report polls suspended\" suggests an issue with the monitoring system's ability to gather data on key performance indicators. This points towards a problem with the reporting mechanism itself, rather than a specific hardware failure, leading me to categorize it as \"Miscellaneous.\"\n\n**Categorizing System Performance Metrics**\n\nI'm currently processing the IT ticket text, focusing on the recurring terms \"cpu usage,\" \"uptime,\" and \"swap virtual.\" These terms strongly indicate that the core of the issue lies in system resource utilization and performance.
