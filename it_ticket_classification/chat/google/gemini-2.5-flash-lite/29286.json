Based on the provided text, I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Miscellaneous.\"  The words \"project manager change\" suggest some kind of internal undertaking, while the brevity of the ticket makes a precise classification challenging. I'm carefully reviewing the options to refine my selection.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's text, and now I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access.\" The phrase \"add except code\" seems directly related to modifying permissions or access rights within a system. While \"Internal Project\" still holds some relevance given the \"project manager change,\" the core request appears to be an access-related modification. The other categories seem less relevant based on the available information.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now considering the best category, focusing on \"Internal Project\" and \"Access.\" The ticket's reference to \"add except code\" is prompting me to rethink my initial categorization. While \"project manager change\" could imply internal projects, the code addition strongly suggests an access modification. However, the exact nature of the change and the system involved remains unclear, so both options are still under evaluation. I will carefully consider the relationship between the project manager change and the \"except code\" request.\n\n\n**Confirming the Scope**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. I've analyzed the ticket's components, focusing on \"project manager change\" and \"add except code\". The \"project manager change\" suggests an internal project context, and \"add except code\" describes a modification within that project. While \"Access\" was a contender, the overall emphasis points to a system modification that's part of an internal project involving a project manager. The additional information confirms this.\n\n\n**Confirming Project Context**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Internal Project.\" The phrase \"project manager change\" strongly indicates an internal project element, and the requested code addition is part of a system within the project's scope. The other categories don't align with the ticket's core meaning. I'll output the category in the correct schema.\n```json\n{\"category\": \"Internal Project\"}\n```\n\n"
