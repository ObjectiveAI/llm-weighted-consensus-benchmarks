The mention of \"oracle\" is a key piece of information I'm evaluating.\n\n**Processing IT Ticket Data**\n\nI'm processing the IT ticket text, focusing on keywords like \"time submission,\" \"weekly basis,\" and \"process.\" My analysis suggests this falls under \"HR Support\" due to its connection with time tracking and employee procedures, rather than hardware or access issues.\n\n**Categorizing Time Submission**\n\nI'm currently reviewing the IT ticket content, specifically the phrases \"oracle time submission not necessary\" and \"submit his weekly basis.\" My analysis points towards \"HR Support\" as the most fitting category given the context of employee time tracking and procedural requirements.\n\n"
