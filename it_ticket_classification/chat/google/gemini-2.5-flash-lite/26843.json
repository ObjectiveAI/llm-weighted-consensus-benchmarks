The repeated mentions of \"expense reimbursement,\" \"invoices,\" and the need for \"itemized receipts\" strongly suggest this falls under HR Support, specifically related to employee benefits and administrative processes.\n\n**Determining Reimbursement Category**\n\nI've analyzed the provided text, noting the strong emphasis on \"expense reimbursement,\" \"invoices,\" \"auditing,\" and \"IRS requirements.\" My current thought process is confirming that these elements align most closely with the \"HR Support\" category, as it pertains to employee benefits and administrative processes, rather than hardware, access, or purchases.\n\n"
