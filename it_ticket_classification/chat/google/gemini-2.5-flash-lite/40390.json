My initial thought is it relates to a physical space issue. \"Meeting room\" is a key phrase. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" or potentially \"Access\" depending on the exact nature of the problem, so I'll review these two options and see which is the best fit.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Hardware Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Hardware\" as the most likely category. The phrase \"meeting room not working\" strongly suggests a malfunction of equipment within the room. While there's no explicit mention of specific hardware, the context implies a physical issue with the room's functionality. The additional details about \"meeting room working\" don't negate this initial impression; they simply elaborate on the situation. I'll stick with Hardware.\n\n\n**Defining Final Category**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the ticket content again. The phrase \"meeting room not working\" is central and strongly implies a hardware-related issue. The additional context clarifies the situation but doesn't change the core problem. While \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback, \"Hardware\" is the most direct and accurate category given the options. The core issue is equipment malfunctioning in a meeting room, confirming my previous assessment.\n\n\n"
