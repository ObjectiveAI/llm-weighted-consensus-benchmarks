Based on the phrasing, \"projects menu access\" and \"not possible to choose projects\" are critical hints. I need to figure out which category encompasses access issues. My primary concern at the moment is selecting the most accurate label from the predefined set.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Issues**\n\nI've determined \"Access\" is the most fitting category. Key phrases like \"projects menu access\" and \"request be granted access\" are definitive. While \"Administrative rights\" is a potential, \"Access\" is more precise. The user's inability to add themselves underscores the need for permission.\n\n\n**Selecting \"Access\" Category**\n\nNow, I'm confident \"Access\" is the perfect fit. The user's explicit mentions of \"projects menu access\" and needing to \"add [themself] as a member\" leave no doubt. I've ruled out \"Administrative rights,\" as the issue is getting *initial* access, not necessarily assuming administrative roles. \"Access\" is precise.\n\n\n"
