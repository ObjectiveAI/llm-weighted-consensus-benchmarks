The user is experiencing a recurring error post-reinstallation, described as \"cannot start cannot start when try start get reinstalled delete everything but again same error br\". My immediate task is to map this issue to one of the following categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, or Miscellaneous.\n\n**Classifying Software Glitch**\n\nI'm currently working to categorize an IT ticket detailing a persistent \"cannot start\" error that reappears even after a full reinstallation. My focus is on determining if this issue falls under Hardware, Access, or Miscellaneous, given the software-centric nature of the description.\n\n**Investigating Startup Failures**\n\nI'm continuing to analyze the IT ticket, which describes a persistent \"cannot start\" error that reappears after reinstallation. My current focus is on mapping this to the most appropriate category: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights, considering the persistence despite a clean install.\n\n**Categorizing System Startup**\n\nI'm currently assessing an IT ticket where the user reports a persistent \"cannot start\" error that reappears even after a full system reinstallation. My primary task is to assign this issue to the most appropriate category, weighing whether it points towards Hardware, Storage, or falls under Miscellaneous.\n\n**Determining Hardware Failure**\n\nI'm currently categorizing an IT ticket where the user reports a persistent \"cannot start\" error that reappears even after a complete reinstallation. Given the persistence of the issue despite a fresh system setup, I'm leaning towards classifying this as a Hardware problem.\n\n"
