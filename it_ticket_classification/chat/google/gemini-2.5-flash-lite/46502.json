                    "reasoning": "**Determining the Ticket Type**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided text to pinpoint the relevant IT ticket category. My focus is on identifying key phrases and keywords to classify this ticket accurately. Based on the repetition of \"cannot run report\" and \"unable run report,\" I'm leaning toward an issue related to access or potentially administrative rights, or, if the report software is not functioning properly, a storage issue. Currently, I am leaning toward the ticket being an **Access** issue.\n\n\n**Investigating Root Cause**\n\nI'm now diving deeper into the \"unable to run report\" problem. I've ruled out hardware and HR support. The issue definitely seems connected to either access permissions or a storage problem. Since the report worked previously, it's less likely to be a storage issue.  I am thinking this is most likely an **Access** issue, where the user might not have adequate rights to access data or execute the reporting function.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Problem**\n\nI'm now narrowing down the ticket's classification. \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" are the top contenders for this reporting issue. The sudden failure points toward a permissions change. The error suggests missing rights to execute or access necessary data. \"Administrative rights\" sounds most likely. I'm moving forward with that categorization.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Root Cause**\n\nI'm now determining the most accurate ticket categorization. The report worked flawlessly previously, so storage is unlikely. Based on recent changes, either a lack of correct access or administrative rights are most probable. I have classified this as a problem with administrative rights.\n\n\n**Defining the Issue's Scope**\n\nI'm now identifying the most suitable IT ticket classification. After a thorough review, I'm leaning toward \"Administrative rights.\" The key is a reporting problem with no hardware, HR, purchase, or storage concerns. I'm focusing on the recent \"perfectly fine until yesterday\" factor.\n\n\n\n**Identifying the Root Problem**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. Considering \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" I've noticed the importance of distinguishing between *can the user get in* (Access) vs. *can the user do the necessary operations* (Administrative rights). The report's recent failure suggests a permissions change, making \"Administrative rights\" the most accurate classification. I'm focusing on why, from yesterday to now, the report won't function.\n\n\n**Classifying the Reporting Issue**\n\nGiven the provided text, I'm now leaning toward \"Administrative rights\" as the root cause. My assessment is that this ticket is an issue of the user not having proper administrative rights. The sudden failure, the reporting tool's functionality, and the recent permissions change all point to this specific categorization.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Root Cause**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories. Considering the ticket, I now think \"Administrative rights\" is the most likely culprit. The phrase \"worked perfectly fine until yesterday\" is the key. The issue is a reporting tool function breaking down suddenly. The best fit is a permission or configuration change. My analysis focuses on the change in functionality.\n\n\n\n"
