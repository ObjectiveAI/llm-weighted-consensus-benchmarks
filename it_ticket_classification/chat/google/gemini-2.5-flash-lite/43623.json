Considering the options provided, I believe this ticket best fits the \"Access\" category.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've examined the ticket details again. The focus remains on deactivating an access card following an employee's departure. While queue assignment is mentioned, it's secondary to the core access management task. Therefore, the \"Access\" category is the best fit, as it directly addresses the primary function described. I'm certain this is the correct categorization now.\n\n\n"
