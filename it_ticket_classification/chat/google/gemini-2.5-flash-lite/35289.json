My immediate goal is to pinpoint keywords related to \"security\" to guide the selection from the available categories.\n\n**Filtering Relevant Keywords**\n\nI'm zeroing in on the specific wording within the ticket. My current task involves extracting terms like \"security,\" \"anti,\" and \"protected\" to ascertain its relevance to access control and system integrity categories.\n\n**Deploying New Software**\n\nMy current focus is on interpreting the detailed ticket text. I've identified key phrases like \"replace our current solution with anti\" and \"installation automatically start,\" suggesting a significant software deployment, specifically security-related. This leads me to consider \"Internal Project\" as the most fitting category.\n\n**Classifying Security Initiative**\n\nMy focus is on categorizing the current ticket. I've analyzed the text to identify it as a company-wide security software rollout, involving a replacement of existing solutions and user instructions. Based on these details, \"Internal Project\" is the most accurate classification.\n\n"
