The ticket describes the return of equipment, which seems straightforward. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" because it directly mentions keyboards, headphones, and cables. This is looking like the most fitting classification at the moment.\n\n\n**Confirming Hardware Choice**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, focusing on keywords like \"keyboards,\" \"headphones,\" and \"cables.\" The focus on returning physical IT components definitively points towards \"Hardware.\" Although HR could potentially be involved, the text doesn't mention employee status changes, thus minimizing this aspect. \"Hardware\" is the strongest fit.\n\n\n"
