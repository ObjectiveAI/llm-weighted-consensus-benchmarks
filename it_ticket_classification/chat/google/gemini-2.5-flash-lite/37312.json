My approach involves analyzing the ticket's text to identify the most relevant category.  At this stage, I am working with the provided schema to ensure an accurate mapping of the ticket's content to the available categories.\n\n\n**Identifying the Key Issue**\n\nI've been working on classifying this IT ticket. After careful analysis of the ticket content, the keywords \"timecard,\" \"annual leave,\" and \"HR Support\" consistently point towards an HR-related issue.  It looks like the user is facing errors while submitting a timecard, likely stemming from inaccurate leave entries. My current assessment strongly suggests \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category.\n\n\n"
