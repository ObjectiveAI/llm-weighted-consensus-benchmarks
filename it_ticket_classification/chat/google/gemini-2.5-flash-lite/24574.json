Initial analysis points to \"Hardware\" due to the mention of \"monitor installation\".  Further refinement is underway to ensure no other aspects of the provided text influence the selection.  I'm weighing the possibility of a secondary category, but at this stage, hardware seems most fitting.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content, focusing on keywords and phrases. Initially, \"Hardware\" appeared relevant due to the \"monitor\" references. However, after detailed analysis, \"Purchase\" emerged as the primary category. The text explicitly mentions \"purchase order\", \"commercial code,\" and actions tied to procuring items.  This firmly establishes \"Purchase\" as the most accurate classification.\n\n\n"
