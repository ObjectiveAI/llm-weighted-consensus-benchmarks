Based on the text, it appears to relate to managing an email account for a departing employee. I'm considering which of the provided categories best fits this scenario.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've reviewed the IT ticket description mentioning \"leaver mailbox\" and forwarding requests. I've determined that \"Access\" is the most appropriate category, as managing a departing employee's mailbox and its forwarding aligns best with access control and account management.\n\n**Reviewing Access Controls**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket description and am refining my categorization. The core issue involves managing a departing employee's mailbox, which strongly points towards controlling account access and data flow during offboarding procedures. I'm confident \"Access\" is the most suitable category.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently processing the provided IT ticket description. My focus is on discerning the most accurate classification from the available options. The core of the request revolves around managing a departing employee's email account and its forwarding, which I'm evaluating against categories like \"Access\" and \"HR Support.\"\n\n"
