I've analyzed the text, focusing on keywords to determine the primary issue. I'm leaning toward a few options but need to refine my thinking to select the most appropriate category from the list. It's a tricky one!\n\n\n**Analyzing HR Implications**\n\nThe focus has shifted towards the HR aspects of the ticket. After reviewing the provided list of categories and the ticket text, I've eliminated \"Hardware\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative Rights\". The \"Access\" category is still a contender but feels like a subset of the broader HR process needed here. \"HR Support\" clearly aligns best with the \"leaver process\" and panic questions related to employee terminations. I'm confident in classifying it under HR, given the strong signals in the text.\n\n\n"
