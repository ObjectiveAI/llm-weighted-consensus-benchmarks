Based on these clues, I'm leaning toward a category, but I need to make sure I'm not missing anything. I'm carefully considering the list provided to ensure the best fit.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI'm now fully confident that \"Storage\" is the right category. The keywords all point decisively in that direction, even after reviewing the broader context. There's nothing in the ticket suggesting HR issues, access problems, or hardware malfunctions. The language around mailbox quotas, archiving, and space management is definitive.\n\n\n"
