I'm attempting to extract keywords to determine the best category for this request. Initial thoughts are leaning towards \"Access,\" but I'm holding off on a final decision until I analyze further. The term \"maternity leave form\" has me a bit perplexed, since this may also be a form submission issue.\n\n\n**Reviewing the Keywords**\n\nI've refined my keyword analysis for the ticket. After adding \"left\" and \"administration officer,\" I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support.\" The \"access card\" makes \"Access\" still relevant, but the overall context of a maternity leaver points to HR's domain. Further thought: could this necessitate changes to the administrative rights of the departing employee? I still haven't decided between Access and HR, though HR feels like a better fit.\n\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI've decided to categorize this as \"HR Support\". The keywords point to a maternity leaver, with HR tasks dominating the request. Although \"Access\" initially seemed relevant due to the access card, the context of an employee leaving and the associated form suggests the issue is ultimately HR-centric. I believe this broad category encompasses all the components of the issue.\n\n\n"
