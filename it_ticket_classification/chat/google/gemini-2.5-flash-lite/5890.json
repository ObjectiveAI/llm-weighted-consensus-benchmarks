My latest progress involves refining the logic for parsing the ticket text and mapping keywords to the appropriate categories within the predefined schema. I'm aiming for a high level of accuracy and coverage, as my current test runs are promising.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Categories**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided ticket text and the available categories. The core issue is license-related, but the broader picture needs to be considered. \"Purchase\" seems most relevant because acquiring licenses is a potential solution. Keywords like \"interns\" and \"graduates\" add nuance, hinting at user access but the primary concern is the license availability. I'm leaning toward \"Purchase\" as the dominant category.\n\n\n**Evaluating License Options**\n\nI've been honing my focus on the \"Purchase\" category, as the \"paid version\" language strongly suggests an acquisition need. I'm now wrestling with the nuance between a direct request to purchase versus a broader issue of license availability. My aim is to select the category that best encapsulates the underlying problem described in the ticket text.\n\n\n**Determining Final Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and the available categories, and now I'm leaning heavily towards \"Purchase\". The emphasis on \"no license available\" coupled with \"paid version\" creates a strong implication of a licensing acquisition need. While \"Access\" could be a secondary consideration, the core issue revolves around license availability, making \"Purchase\" the most fitting category for accurate ticket classification.\n\n\n"
