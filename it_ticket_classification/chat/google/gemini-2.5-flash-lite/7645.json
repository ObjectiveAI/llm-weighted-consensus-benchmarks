The text contains phrases like \"new project code follow up\" and \"recently requested code created.\" These strongly point towards the \"Internal Project\" category, especially with the mention of \"subtasks.\" I'm evaluating if this is the most precise fit.\n\n**Selecting Project Category**\n\nI've analyzed the IT ticket's text, noting key phrases like \"project code,\" \"code created,\" and \"subtasks.\" Based on this, \"Internal Project\" appears to be the most accurate classification, especially considering the context of project follow-up and task breakdown.\n\n"
