Considering the words \"remove\" and \"hi\", I am leaning towards  a category related to access or potentially a minor issue in a broader category.\n\n\n**Analyzing Calendar Context**\n\nI'm currently focused on the HR and Access categories. The text \"remove calendars\" and \"absence calendar\" leans toward HR, but the \"listed code calendars\" makes me consider access issues to those specific calendars. I'm trying to decide if the calendar issue is due to a permissions problem (access) or an HR-related data management issue with employee calendars. More specifically, the reference to \"code calendars\" and \"sort out\" creates a conundrum, as there is not clear direction towards either Access or HR.\n\n**Determining Ticket's Focus**\n\nAfter further analysis, I've narrowed it down. The references to \"employees,\" \"absence calendar,\" and the need to \"sort out\" the display of \"code calendars\" point strongly toward an HR-related issue. The task is to manage how employees view and interact with their calendars, specifically concerning absences. I believe the best category is \"HR Support,\" though a secondary thought might be the specific access to certain calendars within that broader context.\n\n\n**Confirming Ticket Classification**\n\nHaving solidified \"HR Support\" as the best fit, I'm now certain that the core of this ticket involves managing calendar visibility for employees, specifically concerning absences. The \"filter calendar\" directive reinforces that the task is about displaying relevant information to the right users. Therefore, \"HR Support\" remains the most accurate categorization for this ticket.\n\n\n"
