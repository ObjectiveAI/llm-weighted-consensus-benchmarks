I've read the text, noting the mention of an \"oracle issue\" and the display problem. My focus now is determining whether these issues fall under a defined category, or if they require a new categorization. I am leaning toward a Storage or Access related issue, but I'm still weighing the other options.\n\n\n**Categorizing HR-Related Issues**\n\nI'm now focusing on the HR aspects, given the \"annual leave\" and \"work days\" references. The error seems tied to time tracking, strongly suggesting an HR system problem. While the \"oracle issue\" is present, I believe it's secondary to the core HR function, so HR Support appears the best fit. I'm exploring if the Oracle dependency is a red herring or a symptom of the HR system issue.\n\n\n**Clarifying System Dependencies**\n\nI'm now revisiting the \"oracle issue\". While initially considered secondary, I'm digging deeper into how the Oracle system interacts with HR functions. Is the time-tracking application dependent on a faulty Oracle database? The core issue seems to be in data display/status, potentially tied to the HR system's interactions with Oracle. I'm exploring the system's architecture to pinpoint the root cause.\n\n\n"
