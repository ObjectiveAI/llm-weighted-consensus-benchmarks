My process involves analyzing the provided text within each ticket and matching it to the predefined category options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative. The goal is accurate classification, enabling efficient routing and resolution. This is still a work in progress, but I have a general strategy for this classification task.\n\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nThe ticket analysis continues. I've successfully identified \"Access\" as the fitting category for this ticket, pinpointing the \"unable to access link\" issue as the central concern, despite the surrounding context. It now seems that I can reliably classify tickets based on key phrases and the direct problem presented.\n\n\n"
