My focus is on mapping the user's request for an \"ad ownership change\" to the most fitting category from the given options. I believe \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" are the most probable candidates, and I'm weighing which best reflects the intent behind changing ownership in an AD context.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm refining my assessment of the IT ticket. The mention of \"ad ownership change\" strongly suggests a focus on user account management within Active Directory. I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the most appropriate category, as it encompasses the control and management of user identities and their associated permissions, which aligns perfectly with the ticket's core request.\n\n**Classifying AD Changes**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket's specifics regarding an \"ad ownership change.\" Considering the available categories, \"Access\" appears to be the most suitable classification, as it directly relates to managing user accounts and their associated permissions within Active Directory.\n\n"
