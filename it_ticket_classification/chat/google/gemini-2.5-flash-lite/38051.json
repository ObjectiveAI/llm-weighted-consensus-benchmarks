After analyzing the description focusing on keywords like \"remote machines\" and \"meeting rooms\", I've ruled out several options. It seems most likely to fall under a category related to access or connectivity. I'm leaning toward \"Access,\" but still considering other possibilities.\n\n\n**Focusing on Connectivity**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on the core issue: the inability to connect to remote machines from meeting rooms. While \"Access\" still seems most suitable, I'm now considering the possibility of a network hardware fault. This is because the context of meeting rooms suggests a localized connectivity problem. I'm weighing whether it's primarily an access issue or a hardware-related connectivity issue.\n\n\n**Reiterating the Core Issue**\n\nI'm solidifying my classification of the IT ticket. After careful consideration, I'm confident that the core problem is related to access. The inability to connect to remote machines, specifically from meeting rooms, strongly suggests an access restriction. While I briefly considered hardware faults, the primary symptom is connection failure, making \"Access\" the most appropriate category.\n\n\n"
