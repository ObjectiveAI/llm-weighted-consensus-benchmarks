The phrase \"service now\" is present, but it's not clear if this refers to the software platform, or is more related to its functionality. I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" at this stage, but need to re-evaluate the text for more context.\n\n\n**Identifying Root Cause**\n\nI've been concentrating on the core problem: an empty dropdown menu within \"ServiceNow.\" It points toward a system-level malfunction or a configuration problem in the subcategory setup, related to incident and request tracking. I am currently between \"Miscellaneous\" and \"Internal Project,\" given the focus on a known issue. The user's reference to \"minor evolutions\" further confuses the issue.\n\n\n**Clarifying Ticket Focus**\n\nI'm now carefully re-evaluating the ticket. The empty dropdown suggests a problem within ServiceNow itself, specifically in its ticket categorization system (incidents and requests). While \"Internal Project\" felt tempting due to the \"minor evolutions\" phrase, it's clear the issue is the malfunctioning *tool*, and not a project *to improve* the tool. Therefore, the issue is more likely a core operational issue with the ServiceNow platform, and I need to consider all relevant options. I'm no longer confident of the previous categorization, and want to explore the possible options.\n\n\n**Defining Final Categorization**\n\nI'm now carefully leaning towards \"Internal Project.\" The system issue, a malfunctioning dropdown in ServiceNow (likely an internal tool), resonates with ongoing efforts for system improvement or maintenance, as the phrase \"minor evolutions\" could suggest. This ticket seems to be about the system itself. I've ruled out all other options, and this one seems to be the most accurate fit.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. While \"Miscellaneous\" remains a possibility, the focus is a software functionality defect within ServiceNow, likely an internal system. The phrase \"minor evolutions\" further solidifies the choice. The underlying ticket text problem seems connected to an ongoing project or maintenance effort.\n\n\n**Defining the Best Fit**\n\nMy analysis indicates \"Internal Project\" as the best categorization for this IT ticket. The problem centers on a non-functional dropdown within ServiceNow, an internal system. The phrase \"minor evolutions\" further suggests ongoing development or maintenance efforts. While \"Miscellaneous\" is a broader option, the specific nature of the functional defect and the internal context point toward \"Internal Project.\" This represents an issue within an internal project.\n\n\n"
