Initially, I leaned toward \"Internal Project\" due to the mention of assigning tasks. Now I'm considering \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights\" if the assignment refers to system access. It's a bit ambiguous, but I'm leaning toward a decision.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket: HR Support**\n\nI'm now focusing on the ticket's core meaning. Key phrases like \"joining,\" \"annual leave,\" and \"leaders approved\" point decisively toward HR Support. The text implies an HR-related action, potentially onboarding or leave management. It's clear that it is not about internal projects or administrative rights.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Origin**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text, and \"HR Support\" appears the best fit. Keywords like \"joining\" and \"annual leave,\" along with the mention of \"leaders approved,\" firmly place the ticket within the realm of HR-related tasks, like onboarding or leave management. While assignment aspects exist, they support an HR process, not the assignment itself, leading me to choose HR as the correct category.\n\n\n"
