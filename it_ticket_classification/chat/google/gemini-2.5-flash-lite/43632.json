The text mentions \"unable to select contacts snow,\" \"line manager field template excludes,\" \"starters,\" and \"log starter snow.\"  My initial assessment leans towards an issue related to access rights or possibly a template configuration issue, but more context would be beneficial to precisely determine the root cause.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Problem**\n\nI've been evaluating the available categories and the provided ticket text. The terms \"starters,\" \"line manager,\" and the inability to select contacts strongly indicate an issue within an HR context. Access or administrative rights are potential culprits, but the core issue seems HR-related, possibly user provisioning. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the primary category, with \"Access\" as a secondary consideration.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choices**\n\nI've been further refining my category selection. While \"Access\" seems relevant, the core issue appears to be rooted in HR processes, specifically onboarding or employee management, given the \"starters\" and \"line manager\" mentions. The issue isn't *solely* an access problem, but rather how access is *managed* within an HR context.  I'm now leaning more firmly towards \"HR Support\" as the primary category and potentially adding \"Access\" as a secondary consideration. The system configuration is a cause, but it is to do with \"HR Support\". The problem isn't \"Access\" per se.\n\n\n**Focusing on Root Cause**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the root cause. While access is a factor, the core issue is an HR process breakdown, specifically related to onboarding. The user's inability to select contacts within a template hinders an HR-related workflow. I'm focusing on \"HR Support,\" possibly tagging with \"Access,\" as the issue stems from an HR-centric process rather than a general access problem.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR Process Failure**\n\nI've been drilling down on the root cause, and the HR context is becoming increasingly clear. The inability to select a line manager during an onboarding process points to a crucial breakdown in an HR workflow. The core problem isn't a general lack of access; it's a specific functional issue *within* an HR-related system, likely tied to user provisioning or access to contact information. My focus is now squarely on \"HR Support,\" with \"Access\" a relevant secondary facet for resolution.\n\n\n"
