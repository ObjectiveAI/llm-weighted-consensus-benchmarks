Keywords like \"leaver service,\" \"leaver form,\" and \"ad rights\" directly point to managing user permissions and account states during employee departures.\n\n**Determining Category Assignment**\n\nMy analysis continues to refine the category for this IT ticket. After reviewing keywords related to departing employees, account management, and access rights, I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the most accurate classification for the described processes.\n\n"
