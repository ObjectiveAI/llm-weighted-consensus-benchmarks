It's a bit ambiguous, but the mention of a \"meeting room\" strongly suggests a hardware issue. I'm leaning toward categorizing it as \"Hardware,\" but I need to make sure I'm not missing any subtleties. I'm focusing on the keywords and context.\n\n\n**Classifying the Issue**\n\nThe phrase \"meeting room is not working\" in the ticket is the strongest indicator of a hardware issue, despite some ambiguity. While the additional text requires careful consideration, the core problem presented is with a piece of equipment and should be categorized as a Hardware problem. I've ruled out all the alternative categories.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm focused on the core problem: the meeting room isn't functioning. While the additional context requires consideration, the key indicator is the faulty equipment. I've eliminated less fitting categories like HR support and administrative rights. Now, I'm confident \"Hardware\" accurately reflects the primary issue. The equipment itself is the problem.\n\n\n"
