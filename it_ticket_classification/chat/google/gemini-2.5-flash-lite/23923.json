The phrases \"shared infrastructure,\" \"decommission,\" and \"move assets\" strongly suggest this is a hardware-related issue.  I am leaning toward the \"Hardware\" category.\n\n\n**Analyzing Project Scope**\n\nThe updated analysis confirms an \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. Keywords like \"decommission,\" \"move assets,\" and \"shared infrastructure\" solidify this categorization. The ticket's intent focuses on updating or removing infrastructure components, aligning perfectly with the \"Internal Project\" category.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Type**\n\nI've examined the ticket content carefully. The phrase \"shared infrastructure\" combined with \"decommission,\" and \"move assets\" strongly points to planned work within internal systems. The goal is to update or remove infrastructure components. After ruling out other categories, \"Internal Project\" emerges as the most accurate classification. The \"outage\" is a result of the planned \"Internal Project.\"\n\n\n"
