The description mentions \"server issues\" and access problems, which leans toward either \"Access\" or \"Storage.\" The \"forbidden\" message also points to potential access restrictions. I'm carefully analyzing the text to determine the best fit among the provided categories. It's a bit ambiguous, but I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the primary issue.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI've refined my thinking on the ticket category. While \"Storage\" seemed plausible initially because of the file operation mention, the \"forbidden\" message and \"unable to access\" phrases strongly suggest an access problem. \"Access\" is more precise than \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Administrative rights,\" as it encapsulates the inability to perform actions due to permission restrictions.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nMy current focus is nailing down the most appropriate category. Though the mention of \"server issues\" and file operations sparked initial thoughts of \"Storage,\" the \"forbidden\" message and inability to access the server definitively point to an access-related problem. I'm discarding \"Storage\" since access limitations seem to be the root. \"Access\" is the more fitting category.\n\n\n"
