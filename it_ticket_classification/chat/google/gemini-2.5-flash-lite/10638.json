My current thinking leans towards \"HR Support\" due to the mention of \"annual leave days.\" I need to be certain before I finalize the choice.\n\n\n**Revising Categorization Focus**\n\nI'm now focusing on the phrase \"annual leave days\" and the associated keywords. The user's multiple attempts to submit and the mention of statuses (\"approved,\" \"scheduled\") reinforce an HR-related system issue. I'm strongly leaning towards \"HR Support\" after considering other options. The repeated use of \"annual leave days\" and associated phrases makes this category the most precise fit.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've examined the ticket text in detail, focusing on phrases related to \"annual leave days,\" \"submit,\" and status updates. The user's struggle with multiple submissions and system feedback strongly indicates an HR-related system issue. I'm confident \"HR Support\" is the optimal choice, given the clear connection to managing annual leave. The keywords present a very strong argument.\n\n\n"
