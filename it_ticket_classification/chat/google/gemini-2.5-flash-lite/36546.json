Based on the limited information, it seems to relate to a new employee's access. While it's vague, \"change for new starter\" strongly suggests a need for an access setup. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" but need more data to be certain.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Setup**\n\nMy assessment now strongly favors \"Access\" as the primary category. The \"new starter\" keywords point directly to the need for initial access provision. While \"Administrative rights\" is a sub-type, the broader \"Access\" encompasses the likely range of needs. I am now leaning into this as the best fit.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Access\" as the primary category for this ticket. The phrases \"new starter\" and \"change for starter\" clearly indicate the core need is to set up a new employee, which heavily implies granting access to necessary systems and resources. This fits the likely intent behind this request based on the typical onboarding process. I am certain now.\n\n\n"
