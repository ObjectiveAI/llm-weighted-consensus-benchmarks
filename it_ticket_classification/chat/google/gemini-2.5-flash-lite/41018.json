I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the initial classification.\n\n\n**Defining Primary Category**\n\nI've examined the ticket text and the available categories closely. The phrases \"annual leave issues,\" \"approve,\" and \"re-submit\" point directly toward HR-related processes. Considering the options provided, I've concluded that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate category. It best captures the core issue and the needed action.\n\n\n"
