The words \"project manager\" and \"oracle\" strongly suggest an \"Internal Project\" issue, but I'm cross-referencing to confirm. The \"hi, log, thanks, inform\" seem very generic, not tying to a direct category. I am now looking for other words that are more specific that would change the category.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and key phrases. \"Project manager,\" \"attributes,\" and \"rights\" stand out. I've ruled out \"Internal Project\" as the main category, focusing instead on the request for access. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" as the ticket centers on granting PM capabilities. I'm now cross-referencing to confirm.\n\n\n**Determining Final Classification**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's core request. The phrases \"set as project manager,\" \"pm attributes rights,\" and \"planning budgeting forecasting capability\" are the most important. These point towards administrative privileges for a project manager. I've eliminated \"Access\" as the more precise choice is \"Administrative rights,\" which aligns directly with the ticket's request.\n\n\n"
