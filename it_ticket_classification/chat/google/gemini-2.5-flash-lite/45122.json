I'm carefully weighing which category best fits, considering whether it's hardware, access, or something else.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nRight now, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Hardware\" for this ticket. The phrases \"data issues\" and \"phone get any data connections\" are key indicators. I've also noted the user mentioning they've checked settings, reverted to factory defaults, and confirmed the mobile data is enabled, further supporting a device-level problem.\n\n\n"
