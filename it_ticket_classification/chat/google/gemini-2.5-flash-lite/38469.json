The text clearly indicates mailbox issues, but I'm trying to determine the *specific* nature of the problem to assign the most appropriate category from the allowed set. The ticket focuses on mailbox size, so I am leaning toward \"Storage\" but am considering \"Access\" as the next closest related category.\n\n\n**Determining The Best Fit**\n\nI've determined that \"Storage\" is the ideal category for this IT ticket. After analyzing the key phrases, it became clear that mailbox size issues are the central concern. Although the provided text included a tagline, the core issue revolves around storage limitations. I'm now ready to output the required JSON object confirming \"Storage\" as the proper category.\n\n\n"
