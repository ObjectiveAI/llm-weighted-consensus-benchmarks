My immediate goal is to accurately assign it to the most appropriate category from the predefined list, a crucial step in streamlining the workflow.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's content, identifying keywords like \"permissions,\" \"write,\" \"modify,\" and \"membership.\" This strongly indicates a focus on access rights to folders and drives. I'm confident the \"Access\" category is the most appropriate fit.\n\n**Confirming Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've concluded my analysis of the ticket's text. The recurring keywords and phrases related to permissions, write access, modification, and membership overwhelmingly point towards the \"Access\" category as the definitive classification.\n\n"
