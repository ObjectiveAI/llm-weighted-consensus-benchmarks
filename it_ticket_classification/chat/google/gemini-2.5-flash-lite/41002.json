The text includes mentions of an \"Oracle issue\" alongside a request to \"change line manager\" and a more generic \"issue\" description. My thinking is leaning towards focusing on the \"Oracle issue\" to inform the ticket type. I'm going to determine a category that can accommodate that nuance.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted from the initial \"Oracle issue\" towards the core request: changing the line manager and the related notification problem. I've ruled out several categories like Hardware, Storage, and Access, which don't fit the context. Considering HR processes, my thoughts settled on \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category. It directly addresses the employee information change described in the ticket.\n\n\n"
