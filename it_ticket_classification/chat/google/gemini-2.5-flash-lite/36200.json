Based on this, I'm thinking either HR Support, or maybe Access, since it looks like an issue with a job posting. I need to make sure I don't miscategorize it!\n\n\n**Confirming HR Relevance**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, focusing on keywords like \"manager position\" and \"career site\". The issue revolves around a published job listing that isn't behaving as expected.  \"HR Support\" still feels like the most accurate category, given that the problem is about job posting management, making this a clear HR-related task. The context strongly implies a functionality issue within the HR systems.\n\n\n"
