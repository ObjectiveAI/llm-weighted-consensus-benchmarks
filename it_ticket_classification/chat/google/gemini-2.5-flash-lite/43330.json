Analyzing the keywords, I lean towards \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access\" due to the mention of \"referrals\" and an \"error.\" However, the lack of context makes a definitive categorization tricky. I'm hesitant to make a call without more information.\n\n\n**Reassessing Categorization Options**\n\nI'm reconsidering the ticket's classification. The repetition of \"referrals error\" and the mention of a \"referral tool\" indicate a software functionality problem. After evaluating the schema, the most accurate fit seems to be \"Miscellaneous\" as the issue isn't hardware, HR, access, storage, purchase, or admin rights. The file upload error described within the tool suggests a general application issue.\n\n\n**Defining Appropriate Category**\n\nMy analysis now homes in on the \"Miscellaneous\" category as the best fit. I've re-examined the ticket's core issue, which is a software error within the referral tool. Uploading failures, format issues, and the need for advice point to an application-specific problem. I'm satisfied that this is not hardware, HR, access, storage, purchase, or admin-rights related.\n\n\n"
