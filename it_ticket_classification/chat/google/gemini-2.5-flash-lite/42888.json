I am focusing on matching key phrases and intent to the possible IT ticket types. So far, the context points towards an \"HR Support\" category, due to the mentioned processes related to employees leaving the company, but I'll need to explore it further to be sure.\n\n\n**Narrowing down the options**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text within the IT ticket, specifically focusing on keywords and phrases. I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category. The references to \"leavers,\" \"terminated,\" and \"sending forms\" clearly point to a process triggered by employee departures. Although \"Access\" is partially relevant, \"HR Support\" captures the broader context of the IT tasks surrounding this transition more accurately. I am almost certain about this.\n\n\n**Defining the core issue**\n\nCurrently, I'm working to consolidate the specifics of the IT ticket. I've pinpointed \"leavers\" and \"terminated\" as key indicators, aligning strongly with an HR-driven process. The phrase \"sending you forms\" solidifies the link, pointing towards IT-related tasks stemming from an employee's departure. I'm focusing on the interplay between access revocation, account deactivation, and the HR workflow to refine the best fit for this ticket.\n\n\n"
