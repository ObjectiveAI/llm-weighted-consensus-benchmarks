I'm leaning towards a connection to HR, but I'm being cautious to ensure the most precise classification. I will keep scanning for more clues.\n\n\n**Evaluating Category Options**\n\nMy current thinking revolves around a potential overlap between HR Support and Access categories. \"Leaver\" triggers HR considerations, but the focus on account management leans towards Access. The inventory and storage are secondary details. I will assess how to balance the need for both considerations.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Focus**\n\nI've shifted my perspective to prioritize the overarching process. While initial thinking focused on individual tasks, I now see the \"leaver\" context as central.  The keywords point directly to an HR-driven event. Access and Storage are components, but they are nested within the HR Support framework for managing an employee's departure.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Focus**\n\nThe emphasis on 'leaver' and 'leaving' aspects still feels like the most crucial driver. I'm solidifying my rationale for selecting \"HR Support\" as the primary category. The \"access\" and \"storage\" are components, but they are dependent on the core HR event. Considering the user input, I will stick with the \"HR Support\" categorization.\n\n\n"
