It fits the description perfectly, making it a clear and straightforward choice, especially as it is a physical piece of equipment.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Hardware Classification**\n\nI've been evaluating \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase\" as potential categories for the IT ticket. While acquiring a monitor inevitably involves a purchase, the core requirement centers on the physical device itself. My focus has narrowed to \"Hardware\" as the most direct and accurate categorization, reflecting the equipment-centric nature of the request. \"Purchase\" might be more applicable if the ticket was solely about the acquisition process, but it is clear the need is for a piece of equipment.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm now confident that \"Hardware\" is the definitive category. My reasoning is solid: the ticket centers on a tangible monitor, not the buying process. While purchasing is implied, the core need is the physical item. This aligns with standard IT practices where such requests fall under a general \"Hardware\" umbrella, making it the most accurate and straightforward choice.\n\n\n"
