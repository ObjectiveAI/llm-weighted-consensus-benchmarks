I've ruled out \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Miscellaneous\" due to lack of direct relevance to the primary access-related issue described in the text.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Control**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text again, zeroing in on the core request: a lost badge requiring blocking and replacement. The phrases \"block,\" and \"raise request\" are key indicators. While \"Hardware\" is a potential fit due to the physical nature of the badge, the primary concern revolves around the impact on access. Therefore, \"Access\" remains the clear frontrunner. I've eliminated the less fitting options, solidifying my conclusion.\n\n\n"
