The recurring theme of \"managed add\" and the specific mention of incorrect name formatting point strongly towards an \"Access\" related ticket. This seems to be the most fitting category given the details.\n\n**Assigning IT Tickets**\n\nI've analyzed the input and determined that the issue, particularly the mention of a \"managed add\" with incorrect name formatting, aligns best with the \"Access\" category. This addresses the core problem of user provisioning and subsequent system access.\n\n"
