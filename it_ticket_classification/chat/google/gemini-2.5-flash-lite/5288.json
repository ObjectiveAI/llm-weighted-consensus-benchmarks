This step is crucial for accurate ticket classification.\n\n**Updating Ticket Classification**\n\nI've analyzed the provided IT ticket text, and the mention of \"ram\" and \"install memory\" strongly indicates a \"Hardware\" category. My focus is now on confirming this mapping as the most precise fit for the ticket's content.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the IT ticket and pinpointed \"ram update\" and \"install memory\" as key phrases. My current focus is on definitively assigning this to the \"Hardware\" category from the provided enum, as it most accurately reflects the ticket's core issue.\n\n"
