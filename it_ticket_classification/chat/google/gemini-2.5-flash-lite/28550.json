After analyzing the provided text, the keywords \"password,\" \"reset,\" and the urgency implied by \"expire\" and \"high\" point me toward an Access issue. I am now certain of the category and can provide it to the user.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI'm now honing in on the critical aspect: authentication or account management, which directly stems from keywords like \"password reset\" and the actions described within the ticket. The phrase \"change PC\" also strongly suggests a potential password or account change. I'm excluding categories such as hardware and HR, narrowing the options.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Focus**\n\nI'm now identifying the core issue: authentication and account management. The text clearly indicates a need for a password reset and a potential account modification. I've ruled out hardware, HR support, storage, purchase, internal project, and administrative rights as they don't capture the essence of password and access. After analyzing keyphrases, the \"Access\" category feels correct.\n\n\n"
