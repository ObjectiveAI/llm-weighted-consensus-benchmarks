I'm weighing these two options to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Data**\n\nI'm refining my categorization of the recent IT ticket. The recurring phrases \"unable to add as team member,\" \"unable add member,\" and references to \"adding her member\" strongly point towards an \"Access\" classification, as it pertains to granting entry or permissions within a system. I'm leaning away from HR Support as the core issue appears technical rather than administrative.\n\n**Assigning Access Ticket**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket description, focusing on repeated phrases like \"unable to add as team member.\" This clearly points to an issue with user permissions or system entry. Therefore, I'm assigning this ticket to the \"Access\" category, as it directly reflects the core problem of granting or denying system membership.\n\n"
