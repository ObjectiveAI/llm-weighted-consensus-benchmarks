                    "reasoning": "**Determining the Category**\n\nI'm currently trying to analyze the provided text, \"add a wednesday pm change dear please,\" to determine the most suitable IT ticket category. My initial assessment leans towards \"Miscellaneous,\" but I'm still weighing all options to ensure accuracy. I'm focusing on keywords like \"add,\" \"change,\" and \"dear\" to understand the user's need.\n\n\n**Evaluating Ticket Content**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text, trying to pinpoint the best IT ticket category. The keywords \"campaign,\" \"change,\" and \"high priority\" are pivotal. My latest thinking leans towards either \"Internal Project\" or, if the campaign isn't internal, \"Miscellaneous\" for its flexibility. I'm carefully reviewing all the options again, including \"Access\" which I had previously discounted. I'm focusing on \"bug\" implications.\n\n\n**Defining the Context**\n\nMy analysis continues on this IT ticket categorization. I'm now honing in on the nuanced aspects. This latest text, \"add a wednesday pm change dear please log high priority client campaign added same behavior tickets created points let possible done today tomorrow latest engineer reach myself anytime thanks mob,\" really has me thinking. It seems to be project-related, possibly a \"bug\" that surfaced within a high-priority \"client campaign.\" The \"done today/tomorrow\" urgency and need for engineer involvement tip the scale toward either \"Internal Project\" (if the campaign is internal) or \"Miscellaneous\" as a last resort if it's external.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Strategy**\n\nMy thinking has shifted slightly. I'm now wrestling with the \"client campaign\" aspect.  While \"Miscellaneous\" remains a safe fallback, I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project.\" Even if the campaign is external, the work required to address it within the company can be treated as an internal project, especially given the urgent nature of the task. The phrase \"same behavior tickets created\" points toward a defined problem. It seems the user is reporting an issue or requesting action. If the project isn't internal, \"Miscellaneous\" is the fall back.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Task**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the action requested in the ticket.  The combination of \"change,\" \"high priority,\" \"client campaign,\" and the urgency (\"done today/tomorrow\") reinforces that it's a critical task.  I'm now leaning more firmly toward \"Internal Project,\" even if it is for an external client, assuming it's related to some work that's going on. However, \"Miscellaneous\" remains a backup if the 'project' aspect is absent.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Decision**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the user's request. The phrase \"client campaign\" is the key. While the vagueness of \"add a wednesday pm change dear please\" makes the primary task unclear, the urgency (\"done today/tomorrow\") and reference to existing \"same behavior tickets\" strongly suggest an ongoing project or initiative.  \"Internal Project\" feels most appropriate given the defined context, as it could encompass tasks even for external client campaigns that require internal technical resources and are part of structured campaigns. If it wasn't for \"client campaign\", \"Miscellaneous\" would be it. I'm choosing \"Internal Project\", while maintaining the fallback of \"Miscellaneous.\"\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Request**\n\nThe text's reference to a \"client campaign\" continues to be the key factor I'm considering.  While the language is unclear, the \"Internal Project\" category now appears the most applicable as the work is an urgent task related to a client campaign. I'm focusing on \"same behavior tickets\" as they seem to indicate a problem, potentially a bug that requires action. This is my working hypothesis now.\n\n\n**Determining the Context**\n\nMy analysis continues. I'm focusing on \"client campaign.\" The \"done today/tomorrow\" urgency and \"same behavior tickets\" strongly suggest a project or a bug fix. Given the need for an engineer, \"Internal Project\" is the best fit, even if it's for an external client, as long as it requires some work within the company.\n\n**Refining Categorization Decision**\n\nI've been analyzing the text's core message. Despite the fragmented language, \"client campaign\" is the key. While the request itself is unclear, the urgency (\"done today/tomorrow\") and reference to \"same behavior tickets\" suggests it's likely a project. I've chosen \"Internal Project\" as the best fit, even if it's external, maintaining \"Miscellaneous\" as a fallback.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Action**\n\nI'm focusing now on the action being requested. The combination of \"change,\" \"high priority,\" \"client campaign,\" and the urgency \"done today/tomorrow\" all strengthen the \"Internal Project\" category, even for an external client. The fact that this request seems to require an \"engineer\" reinforces its complexity and importance.\n\n\n\n**Defining Project Context**\n\nI'm now focusing on \"client campaign.\" Even though the user's message is fragmented, the need for an \"engineer\" and the \"done today/tomorrow\" timeframe, combined with \"client campaign,\" strongly suggests a project. It seems an urgent issue requires resolving, thus leaning the scale towards \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category.\n\n\n"
