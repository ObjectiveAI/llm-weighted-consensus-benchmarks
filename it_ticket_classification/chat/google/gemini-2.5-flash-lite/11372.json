Parsing the ticket details, I see recurring mentions confirming \"account locked.\" I'm prioritizing the schema's categories, and determining how to build a model with these words as data points.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket's Scope**\n\nAfter scrutinizing the ticket, \"account locked\" is the pivotal issue. I've confirmed that \"Access\" is the most applicable category, with \"ServiceNow\" being the specific system. I'm discarding the boilerplate and focusing on the core problem for accurate classification.\n\n\n"
