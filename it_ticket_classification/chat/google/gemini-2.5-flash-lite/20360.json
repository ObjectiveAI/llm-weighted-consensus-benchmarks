                    "reasoning": "**Defining Project Category**\n\nI'm currently focused on determining the correct category for this IT ticket. The repeated phrase \"epic link mandatory\" strongly suggests a connection to project management, though it doesn't clearly fit any existing category yet. I'm carefully reviewing the schema again to determine the closest match.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Options**\n\nI'm now considering the context of \"epic link mandatory.\" It seems to imply a process requirement within project management, particularly Agile/Scrum tools. Given the schema, \"Internal Project\" is a strong contender if this is project-specific. If it's a broader tool policy, \"Miscellaneous\" might be better. There's also a possibility that setting it as mandatory involves administrative rights or specific configurations; in that case, I will need to consider whether Administrative Rights is the category.\n\n\n**Assessing System Configuration**\n\nI'm now leaning heavily towards \"Administrative rights.\" The repeated focus on \"epic link mandatory\" strongly suggests a system-level configuration or permission change is required. While \"Internal Project\" was initially considered, the phrasing implies a change to how the system *functions*, not a project-specific need. This new context reinforces this option.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted again to administrative access as the most likely category. The request to \"make epic link mandatory\" strongly suggests a system-level change rather than project-specific support. I've re-evaluated the phrasing, and it seems to imply an administrative intervention is required to implement the change, such as setting a required field or enforcing a new policy within the system. Therefore, I believe \"Administrative rights\" remains the most accurate fit.\n\n\n**Solidifying Category Choice**\n\nI've circled back to the ticket's core request: making an epic link mandatory. This directly implies a configuration change within a system. I'm confident in \"Administrative rights\" now, as it encapsulates the need for elevated permissions or system adjustments. The phrase's focus on enforcement, not project-specific use, confirms this.\n\n\n"
