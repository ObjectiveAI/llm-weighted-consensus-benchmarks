After reviewing the ticket content (\"ram needed\", \"upgrade\"), I'm considering \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category. However, I want to double-check against the other options to be certain before I finalize the choice.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI've re-evaluated the category options, focusing on the recurrent theme of \"RAM\" and hardware upgrades. I've ruled out HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, and Storage. While \"Purchase\" is involved, the primary issue is the hardware itself, solidifying \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate and direct category. The ticket's core request is about the physical component and its upgrade.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Optimal Category**\n\nI am now thoroughly convinced that \"Hardware\" is the correct category. The recurring focus on RAM upgrades, installations, and replacements outweighs the purchase aspect, which is merely a step in obtaining the necessary hardware. After re-evaluating the ticket content, and the category schema, I am confident in selecting \"Hardware.\" This selection directly addresses the core issue of needing a physical component.\n\n\n"
