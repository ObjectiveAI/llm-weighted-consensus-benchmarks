After careful consideration, I've determined the issue primarily revolves around faulty network cables. The user's request for \"fixing rest cables\" further clarifies the hardware-related nature of the problem, thus I have assigned the ticket to \"Hardware\".\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and the available categories. It seems the issue is clearly related to faulty network cables, despite some irrelevant phrases. The user's request, coupled with the detailed description of \"network cables not working\" and \"fuji floor cables\", reinforces this hardware focus. Therefore, I will categorize the ticket as \"Hardware\" because it directly addresses the malfunctioning physical infrastructure.\n\n\n**Deciding Ticket Category**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. Analyzing the ticket text, the \"network cables not working\" issue immediately points to \"Hardware\". Although \"Access\" could be relevant indirectly, the core problem is a physical infrastructure failure. Details like \"fuji floor cables\" and the request to \"fix the rest\" further reinforce the hardware nature of the problem, so it will be categorized as \"Hardware\".\n\n\n"
