The input mentions \"new starter tower,\" pointing towards setting up equipment. From the available options, \"Hardware\" seems the best fit, but I'm considering if \"Access\" is relevant, due to the employee requiring access to the new equipment. I am also considering \"Internal Project\" as the ticket may require coordination between different teams to set up the new hardware for a new starter.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket's Core**\n\nI'm now focusing on the core issue within the ticket. The text includes hardware setup for a \"new starter tower\" and account conversion from \"intern\" to \"employee.\" Initially, I leaned towards \"Hardware,\" but the stronger signal points to \"HR Support\" for the user status change. I'm still considering \"Access\" but believe it is secondary to the HR aspect.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've determined that the primary focus is handling the account conversion from intern to employee. While hardware setup for the new employee is implied, the ticket's core function is user account management due to status changes, which directly falls under HR Support. I've ruled out Hardware and Access as the core task is a status update.\n\n\n"
