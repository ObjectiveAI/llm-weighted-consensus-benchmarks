I've noted \"error\" appearing frequently, alongside mentions of timecards and leave requests. My aim is to distill this down to a specific, actionable category for the ticket. The goal is to accurately tag it for efficient routing and resolution.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've homed in on \"HR Support\" as the fitting category for the IT ticket. My rationale stems from the repeated mentions of \"timecard,\" \"leave,\" and persistent \"error\" messages encountered during those actions. The user's struggle aligns with typical HR system concerns, making this choice seem quite solid. The output is now finalized and ready for the next stage.\n\n\n"
