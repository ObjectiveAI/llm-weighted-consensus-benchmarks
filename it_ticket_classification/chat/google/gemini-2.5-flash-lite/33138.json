The ticket text references \"restore repository,\" which is leading me to consider categories such as \"Storage\" or potentially \"Internal Project.\" I'm carefully weighing which category best fits the core issue described in the ticket.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI've honed in on the \"Storage\" category for this ticket, given the consistent theme of data restoration and storage management across all the examples. The language strongly supports this classification, with terms like \"restore,\" \"repository,\" \"archive,\" and \"storage\" appearing frequently. I'm confident in this assignment.\n\n\n"
