The text \"new starter ad july pm starter\" strongly suggests \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access\" related to onboarding a new employee. I'm leaning towards HR Support as the primary category given the \"new starter\" phrasing.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm refining the classification of this IT ticket. The mention of \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" \"transfer,\" and explicitly \"please make his accesses linked\" points directly to the \"Access\" category. It seems the primary focus is on IT system provisioning for a new employee.\n\n**Finalizing Access Category**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the ticket text, and the repeated emphasis on \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" \"transfer,\" and especially \"please make his accesses linked\" solidifies my decision. The \"Access\" category is the most accurate and encompassing for this request.\n\n"
