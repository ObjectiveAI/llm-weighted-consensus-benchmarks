My initial thought is it doesn't fit hardware, storage, purchase, or internal projects. I'm leaning toward either HR Support or Access, but still analyzing if it's strictly an IT access issue.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've determined that this ticket falls squarely into the \"HR Support\" category. The subject matter \u2013 annual leave, absences, and leave requests \u2013 aligns perfectly with HR-related inquiries, so I am confident in this classification.\n\n\n"
