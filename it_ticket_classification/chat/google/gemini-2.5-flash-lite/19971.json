My current objective is to pinpoint the most fitting classification, specifically discerning whether the request leans towards \"Access\" or \"Storage\" based on the discussion of shared folders and their associated management.\n\n**Organizing Digital Space**\n\nI'm currently refining my understanding of the user's need. The emphasis on creating structured folders within a shared drive for specific tracking purposes, coupled with the issues encountered with current shared drive management, leads me to strongly consider \"Storage\" as the most appropriate category. This encompasses the organization and management of digital assets within a shared environment.\n\n**Refining Category Choice**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the provided text to determine the most accurate classification for the IT ticket.
