The ticket's content, which seems to revolve around time sheet submission issues, is leading me towards either \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access,\" given the nature of the issue. I'm carefully analyzing the text for more definitive cues to ensure the best fit.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm zeroing in on \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate category. The ticket's content, detailing issues with time sheet and leave submissions, strongly aligns with HR processes. While \"Access\" could be a factor, the core issue is the *submission* itself, making \"HR Support\" the better, more specific choice. The \"annual leave\" context further solidifies the need for this category selection.\n\n\n"
