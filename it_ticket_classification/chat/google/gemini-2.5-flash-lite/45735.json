My initial instinct is leaning towards a category related to access or possibly internal projects, but I need to ensure a precise fit. I'm carefully reviewing the defined categories to refine the selection.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nMy current assessment strongly suggests \"Access\" as the most suitable category. The ticket text consistently highlights problems with \"joining meetings\" and \"connecting\", which directly implies an access-related issue.  I am confident that the meeting connection issues are likely tied to some form of permission, network, or application access, solidifying the choice of \"Access\".\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Content**\n\nI am now focusing on the core issue: connecting to meetings. The text strongly emphasizes access problems. After careful analysis, I am confident that \"Access\" is the primary concern. My focus is now on ensuring it applies to the entire problem.\n\n\n"
