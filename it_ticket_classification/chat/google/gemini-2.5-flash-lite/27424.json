I'm exploring various natural language processing techniques to identify keywords and phrases that strongly suggest a specific category. My initial approach involved simple keyword matching, but I'm now incorporating more sophisticated methods to improve accuracy and handle variations in phrasing. I aim to refine the categorization logic to accurately predict the most probable ticket type.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Logic**\n\nI've determined that \"Hardware\" is the appropriate category for the IT ticket. My focus now is on confirming this through more robust keyword analysis. I'm building out a list of key phrases and terms related to hardware to ensure the categorization model is sensitive to multiple wordings. I am also planning to account for more nuanced signals such as phrases like \"needs narrow view\" to improve the specificity of matches.\n\n\n"
