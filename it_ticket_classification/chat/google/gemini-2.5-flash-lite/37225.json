I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or potentially \"Internal Project,\" given the mention of a \"time cards application\" and the inability to select task details. The term \"tracker\" adds another layer, which I need to reconcile with the possible categories.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Strategy**\n\nMy thinking has shifted slightly. While the initial lean was towards \"Access\" or \"Internal Project\" due to the application's nature, I've re-evaluated the category options.  The ticket's core issue is a software malfunction, and since no category precisely matches \"Software Issue,\" \"Miscellaneous\" now feels like the most accurate default. The \"tracker\" aspect still feels ambiguous.\n\n\n**Evaluating Category Fit**\n\nMy analysis has solidified. The ticket's text points definitively to a software malfunction, and after reviewing each category, \"Miscellaneous\" emerges as the optimal choice. The absence of a dedicated \"Software Issue\" option confirms this. The issues described are functional problems with the time card application.\n\n\n"
