The timecard issue with \"direct reports\" clearly points toward either HR Support or perhaps Access, due to missing data. I'm leaning heavily towards HR Support since it concerns time reporting.  I'm ruling out the hardware and storage options, as the context is much more focused on personnel data. My final determination is close.\n\n\n**Determining the Precise Category**\n\nI've determined that the focus of this ticket lies squarely within HR Support. The phrases referencing \"maternity leave,\" \"absence leave,\" and the need to \"update person record\" firmly place it within this domain. Though time submission is referenced, the core concern appears to be with personnel data and leave tracking, confirming my assessment.\n\n\n"
