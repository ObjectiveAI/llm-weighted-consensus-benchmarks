While \"HR Support\" could be a possibility, the context feels more technically focused. I'll need to confirm if it involves modifications to access rights.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Focus**\n\nNow, I'm focusing on the \"HR Support\" category, given the nature of the request. Specifically, name and email address updates are core HR functions. While access considerations might be involved later, the ticket's primary focus seems to be updating employee identity information. I'm prioritizing the HR angle over access control, as the issue is more about identity than permissions.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Relevance**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"HR Support\" category.  The ticket's emphasis is on \"name changes\" and updating email addresses for leadership. While there's an implicit connection to access control, the core issue centers on updating employee identity. The phrase \"please make name changes\" solidifies the HR focus, making this a clear candidate for HR Support. The task is about identity information, a cornerstone of HR processes.\n\n\n"
