It seems to point overwhelmingly toward employee offboarding, but I'm cross-referencing to ensure it doesn't subtly fit into a different category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Classification**\n\nI've honed in on the HR Support category. The \"leaver form\" language is a dead giveaway, but I double-checked the other options to confirm. Nothing else felt as perfectly aligned. This feels like the right call for now, but I will keep an open mind for additional context.\n\n\n"
