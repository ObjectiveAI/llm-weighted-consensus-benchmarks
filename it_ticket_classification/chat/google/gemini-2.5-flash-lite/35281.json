Based on the user's description pointing to high CPU usage and resource consumption impacting daily tasks, I've determined that \"Miscellaneous\" is the most appropriate category, as it doesn't neatly fit into hardware, access, or other more specific options.\n\n**Selecting the Category**\n\nI've identified that the ticket's focus on resource consumption and CPU impact due to recent updates makes \"Miscellaneous\" the most fitting classification. This choice reflects the issue not aligning with more specific categories like hardware or access.\n\n"
