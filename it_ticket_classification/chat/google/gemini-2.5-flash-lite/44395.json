The key phrase \"cr clone errors\" is leading me towards a \"Hardware\" or \"Storage\" categorization, but I'm still evaluating which best fits the context.\n\n**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm still working to pinpoint the best category for this IT ticket. The repeated \"CR clone errors\" and discussions around cloning processes strongly suggest an issue with a specific internal system or workflow, possibly related to change requests. I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" or \"Miscellaneous\" as the most fitting options, depending on the exact nature of the system being referenced.\n\n**Resolving IT Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm refining the categorization of this IT ticket. The recurring \"CR clone errors,\" particularly concerning data mismatches and locked fields during authorization, point strongly towards a functional defect within an internal process or system. \"Internal Project\" remains the most suitable classification, reflecting a need to investigate and fix this workflow issue.\n\n**Investigating CR Cloning**\n\nI'm currently focusing on the nuances of the \"CR clone errors.\" The recurring issues with locked fields and owner mismatches during the cloning and authorization phases strongly suggest a functional defect within an internal system or workflow. This leads me to believe \"Internal Project\" remains the most appropriate category for this ticket.\n\n**Fixing Cloning Workflow**\n\nI'm analyzing the recurring \"CR clone errors,\" particularly concerning locked fields and owner mismatches during authorization. This suggests a functional defect within an internal system or workflow, making \"Internal Project\" the most fitting category for investigation and resolution.\n\n**Analyzing CR Cloning Issues**\n\nI'm currently focusing on the core functional defect described: errors in the \"CR clone flow,\" specifically concerning locked fields and owner mismatches during authorization. This leads me to categorize it as an \"Internal Project\" for necessary investigation and resolution.\n\n"
