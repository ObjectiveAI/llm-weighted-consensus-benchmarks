My aim is to accurately categorize this ticket within the provided options, considering the interplay between network performance and server availability for a stable connection.\n\n**Resolving Ticket Category**\n\nI'm weighing the \"Hardware\" category against the core description of frequent network downtime. While network issues often have hardware roots, the phrasing emphasizes the network's instability rather than a specific faulty component. I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the closest available fit to capture the underlying cause.\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI'm currently prioritizing the most fitting category for the network downtime ticket. While \"Hardware\" appears plausible due to network infrastructure components, I'm also considering how the persistent \"access\" issues tie into the network's instability. The lack of a direct \"Network\" category necessitates careful interpretation.\n\n**Categorizing Network Issues**\n\nI'm currently classifying the IT ticket. Given the descriptions of frequent network downtime and the need for a stable connection, I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate category, recognizing that network infrastructure issues often stem from physical components.\n\n"
