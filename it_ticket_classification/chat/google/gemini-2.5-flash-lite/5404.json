The ticket content mentions \"oracle\" and \"delete code,\" which suggests a technical issue. I'm leaning towards \"Storage\" or \"Internal Project,\" but I'm still analyzing the context to make a definitive decision. The presence of \"error\" strongly suggests a technical issue, which requires deeper investigation to pick the best category.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Project Focus**\n\nI've honed in on the ticket's core issue: deleting code, likely within a project context. Considering the \"oracle\" reference and the repeated requests to remove code, \"Internal Project\" is a strong contender. The error message further solidifies this, as it likely arises from the project's code. I'm focusing on the project's nature to confirm this assumption.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've concluded that \"Internal Project\" is the most accurate category for this ticket. The core issue revolves around \"deleting project code\" and an \"error,\" strongly aligning with internal software development or project management. The \"oracle\" reference, though not definitive, hints at a software system, further solidifying my decision. This aligns perfectly with the available categories, providing a definitive classification for this IT request.\n\n\n"
