Friday PM seems to indicate a scheduled need. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, particularly the repeated phrase \"allocate a monitor.\"  While \"Hardware\" felt initially right, I'm now considering the subtleties of the \"Purchase\" category, as the word \"allocate\" suggests using existing hardware. The text mentions planning, it is possible this is a purchase order of a new monitor for Friday PM. Ultimately, I'm leaning back towards \"Hardware\", but keeping \"Purchase\" as a close second, as the text hints at both.\n\n\n**Defining Final Category**\n\nI've carefully re-reviewed the ticket text with the available categories in mind. The consistent mention of \"allocate a monitor\" and phrases related to a physical screen firmly point towards the \"Hardware\" category. It's a precise fit, given the context of re-allocating or preparing a monitor. I'm confident in \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate classification, and I'm ready to output the JSON response now.\n\n\n"
