This clearly falls under a hardware-related issue.  I am confident in categorizing this ticket under \"Hardware\" due to the specific technical details provided.\n\n\n**Analyzing Storage Implications**\n\nI've determined the ticket's core issue is within the Storage category, even though initial thoughts leaned towards hardware. The focus on disk failures, spares, and configurations for data reconstruction solidifies this classification. I'm now certain this is not a hardware-only problem; the implications for data integrity and storage management are paramount.\n\n\n"
