The words used like 'jobs creation', 'job controller', and 'technician' seem to indicate it's not a standard HR or access-related issue. Instead, it seems like an internal project or a request to create user access or roles, so the appropriate category might be \"Administrative rights\". I'm still weighing this.\n\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've been reviewing the ticket text again and it's looking increasingly like an HR-related request. Specifically, the phrase \"please create jobs\" is key. The user is asking for the creation of specific job roles and positions, which aligns perfectly with HR support. While it could be part of an internal project, the direct phrasing suggests this is a request for a standard HR task. I'm leaning heavily towards categorizing it under \"HR Support\".\n\n\n**Confirming Ticket Type**\n\nI'm now certain this is a request for HR assistance. The user is explicitly asking to \"create jobs\" and then lists specific job titles and grades. This is definitely a standard HR function, more than just an internal project. It's not about hardware, access, or any other IT-related area. I'm focusing on \"HR Support\" as the definitive category.\n\n\n"
