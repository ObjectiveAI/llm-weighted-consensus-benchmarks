While \"Storage\" remains relevant for the drive space, the phone's charging and performance problems clearly suggest either a \"Hardware\" fault or a \"Purchase\" request. The need for a more reliable mobile device has shifted my focus. I'm leaning toward \"Purchase\" as the primary categorization, but \"Hardware\" for the malfunctioning device also makes sense as an secondary issue.\n\n\n"
