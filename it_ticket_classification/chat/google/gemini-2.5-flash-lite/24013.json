So far, the phrase \"new member found\" has me leaning toward a couple of options, and I'm carefully considering the context for further clues. I'm actively weighing the nuances of each potential classification to ensure accuracy.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've determined \"Access\" is the most apt classification for this ticket, and I'm justifying that choice. \"Adding a member\" strongly implies access to systems or resources. I've ruled out \"HR Support\" because the ticket's focus is on the *action* of adding, not necessarily the broader onboarding process. I am also sure that \"Administrative rights\" is a specific type of access, and \"Access\" covers this ticket.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Request**\n\nI'm now fully confident that \"Access\" is the best fit. I've re-evaluated the ticket text, and \"add him member\" is the most prominent need. While HR could be involved, the IT action of adding access is the primary focus, and the phrase points to granting someone access to a system or group. I've excluded all other categories after thorough evaluation, and \"Access\" covers the intent directly.\n\n\n"
