I'm leaning toward either \"Access\" or potentially \"Miscellaneous,\" depending on the broader context.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've reviewed the keywords and the problem's nature, solidifying \"Access\" as the fitting category. The phrasing and the core issue are tightly linked to access problems. The lack of hardware, HR, storage, purchase, or admin rights aspects further confirms this choice. \n\n\n"
