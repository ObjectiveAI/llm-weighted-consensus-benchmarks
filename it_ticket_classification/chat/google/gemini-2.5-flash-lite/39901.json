Considering \"intermittent issues,\" \"credentials pop,\" \"slowness folders,\" and \"asking for credentials,\" I believe \"Access\" is the most fitting category. This seems to be the core concern, rather than hardware, storage, or other departments.\n\n\n**Clarifying Access Concerns**\n\nI'm solidifying my initial assessment. The \"credentials\" issue, paired with folder slowness during updates, keeps pointing me toward Access. While storage issues are possible, the emphasis on authentication makes \"Access\" the central concern. I'm confident in excluding other options like HR or Hardware.\n\n\n"
