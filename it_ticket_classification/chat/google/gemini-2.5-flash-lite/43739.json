Further investigation may be necessary to rule out other possibilities, but this seems the most likely fit at this point.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI've determined the primary issue is the user's inability to access the specified floor and tower with their card. After considering the provided categories, the \"Access\" option appears to be the most appropriate fit. My reasoning is that the user's issue directly relates to this category.\n\n\n"
