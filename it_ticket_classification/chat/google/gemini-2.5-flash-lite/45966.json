The laptop's persistent logo screen issue, combined with repeated login prompts and Outlook difficulties, all point toward a potential systemic problem. Considering the onset on Friday, I suspect a software glitch or a hardware malfunction. I'm focusing on identifying the root cause now.\n\n\n**Identifying Hardware Faults**\n\nI've honed in on the hardware category. The laptop's failure to boot past the logo screen firmly suggests a hardware-related issue or a critically low-level software problem intimately tied to hardware. The repeated login prompts and Outlook issues now seem secondary to this primary failure. This seems like it should be the right category.\n\n\n"
