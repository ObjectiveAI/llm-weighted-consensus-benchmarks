I've narrowed it down to a few possibilities, namely \"Access,\" since the text mentions \"mailbox.\" I'm carefully reviewing the context to make a definitive choice, and will take into consideration that it references a full mailbox.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Requirements**\n\nI've examined the ticket text, and it's clear the primary issue is about managing access to a mailbox. The keywords \"add member\" and \"write ability\" strongly suggest this. While \"full\" could relate to storage, the core request is permission-based. My analysis indicates \"Access\" is the most appropriate category, as it aligns with the user's need to control who can modify the mailbox content.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket Category**\n\nI'm now fully confident that the ticket falls under \"Access\". The core request centers on granting a user \"write ability\" and adding them as a \"member\" to the mailbox. Although \"full\" is mentioned, the emphasis is on who can access and modify the mailbox, not the storage capacity itself. This permission-focused approach makes \"Access\" the most precise and appropriate choice.\n\n\n"
