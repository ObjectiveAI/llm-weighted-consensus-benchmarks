I initially thought it might fall under \"HR Support,\" given the mention of a \"work pattern change.\" However, \"Administrative rights\" also seems like a potential fit. My current focus is on discerning the primary action requested: is it about an *adjustment* to work arrangements, or is it more about granting/adjusting user access? My intuition leans towards HR, but I want to make sure the evidence is strong enough to definitively conclude.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Relevance**\n\nI'm now fully convinced that the ticket falls under \"HR Support.\" The \"work pattern change\" phrasing is the strongest indicator. The user's request is clearly about adjusting work schedules, which is the purview of HR or administrative departments handling employee information. The role of \"administration officer\" further solidifies this conclusion. I have thoroughly ruled out other possibilities like \"Administrative rights\" since the ticket is not about access permissions.\n\n\n"
