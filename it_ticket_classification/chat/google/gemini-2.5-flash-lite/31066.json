I need to determine the best fit from the options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. Considering the wording, \"remove entry\" and \"deleted user\", I'm leaning toward an \"Access\" issue. However, \"Administrative Rights\" could also be relevant, since removing access is a type of administrative task. I'm carefully weighing those two options now.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm deep in the weeds now, thoroughly dissecting the ticket description and the available categories. \"Access\" is looking like the frontrunner, as the issue clearly concerns user permissions. Though \"Administrative Rights\" is tempting, \"Access\" seems more encompassing, addressing the broader need to remove *any* entry related to the deleted user. I'm focusing on the action itself, removing entries, and that strongly aligns with access management. I'm almost there.\n\n\n"
