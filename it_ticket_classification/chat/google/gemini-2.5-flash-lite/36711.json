Considering the available categories, I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most suitable classification for this ticket.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Strategy**\n\nMy focus has shifted to the system context within the ticket text. Specifically, I'm analyzing how \"annual leave\" interacts with the \"fusion\" system and the approval workflow. The automatic decline issue further solidifies the HR connection, despite the technical aspects. Considering the available options, \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate category, given the HR-centric nature of leave requests and approval processes.\n\n\n**Categorizing Leave Approval**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the ticket's core problem: the annual leave approval system. The \"fusion\" system, line manager approvals, and automatic declines all point towards an HR process. Given the available categories, \"HR Support\" clearly aligns with the leave request, approval workflows, and technical difficulties within that context. I'm confident in this categorization.\n\n\n"
