The other words don't seem immediately helpful.\n\n\n**Identifying the Root Cause**\n\nI've honed in on the ticket's core issue: a user with insufficient access to modify an approval flow, resulting in an \"unauthorized\" error. The repeated use of \"insufficient rights\" makes \"Access\" the most likely category, and I've ruled out other less relevant possibilities. I will double check the context before finalising this.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm continuing to zero in on the best category for this ticket, and it's crystal clear: \"Access.\" The repeated mention of \"insufficient rights\" and the inability to \"modify approval flow\" or \"view flow\" strongly suggests a permissions issue. I've considered and dismissed other options, like \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights,\" as they don't capture the specific nature of this user's problem. \"Access\" perfectly encapsulates the problem.\n\n\n"
