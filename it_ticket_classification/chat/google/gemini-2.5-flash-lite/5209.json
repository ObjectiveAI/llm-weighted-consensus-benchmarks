While \"Miscellaneous\" is a fallback, the HR indicators appear quite strong.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm continuing to refine my approach to ticket classification. After a thorough analysis of the provided text, I'm confident in assigning it to the \"HR Support\" category due to recurring keywords related to employee processes, weekly submissions, and training materials.\n\n"
