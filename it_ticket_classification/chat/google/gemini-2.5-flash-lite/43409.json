I'm exploring the nuances to ensure the best fit.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted towards the specific nature of the script. The \"broken notification script\" with rendering and formatting errors now strongly suggests an \"Internal Project\" issue. While administrative rights are a possibility, the core problem centers on the script's internal logic and execution. I'm solidifying my assessment.\n\n\n**Solidifying My Conclusion**\n\nMy analysis now firmly points to \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category. The recurring theme of a \"broken notification script\" coupled with rendering and formatting problems screams of internal development or maintenance issues. The focus is on the script's internal workings rather than hardware, access, or other external factors, confirming \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. I'm confident in this categorization now.\n\n\n"
