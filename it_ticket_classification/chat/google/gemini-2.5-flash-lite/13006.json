The mention of \"shared ownership\" and \"work folders\" are the key indicators. I'm focusing on those specific terms, and the process is narrowing the possible options to this particular category.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Options**\n\nI'm now focusing on the implications of \"work folders\" and \"shared ownership.\" While \"Access\" is a possibility, the context strongly suggests a storage-related issue. The terms point directly towards data management and permissioning, which aligns perfectly with a \"Storage\" categorization. The multiple mentions of shared ownership further solidify this conclusion.\n\n\n**Defining the Key Issue**\n\nI've zeroed in on the terms \"work folders\" and multiple instances of \"shared ownership.\" These points are telling, and they overwhelmingly indicate a \"Storage\" issue. It's the most appropriate classification. Access is involved, but the core issue lies in data management and organization. Thus, I've confirmed that \"Storage\" is the best fit. I believe I have now identified a specific ticket type.\n\n\n"
