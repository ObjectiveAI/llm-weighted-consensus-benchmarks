After analyzing the text, \"new keyboard keyboard hello kindly ask provide keyboard because stuck often aggravates work thanks br engineer,\" I've narrowed it down to potential categories. The repeated mention of \"keyboard\" strongly suggests a hardware issue, but I'm also considering \"Purchase\" as a possibility. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware,\" as the user seems to need a replacement or repair.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nMy current focus is nailing down the most appropriate category for this IT ticket. After re-evaluating the ticket content, the repeated mention of \"keyboard\" is the key. While a purchase might be implied, the core issue is the hardware itself. The request for a *new* keyboard, due to the old one being \"stuck,\" strongly indicates \"Hardware\" is the most direct fit. I'm confident in this choice.\n\n\n**Clarifying Ticket Category**\n\nI've determined that \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category for this ticket, and I feel strongly about this classification. The user's explicit request for a \"new keyboard\" due to the current one being faulty seals this choice. While the need for a keyboard might indirectly imply a purchase, the focus is the hardware issue itself. The \"Purchase\" category is not wrong, but \"Hardware\" better addresses the core problem. This has clarified the previous uncertainty.\n\n\n"
