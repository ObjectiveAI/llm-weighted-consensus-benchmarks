The ticket's content clearly indicates issues with folder access, not hardware or HR related matters. Considering the available options, \"Access\" seems to be the most fitting. It's becoming clearer with each review.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI've been drilling down on this access problem and think I've cracked it. The user reported trouble accessing shared folders, which screams \"Access\" category. No hardware hiccups, no HR questions, just a straightforward access roadblock. The evidence is solid; the category is undoubtedly \"Access\".\n\n\n"
