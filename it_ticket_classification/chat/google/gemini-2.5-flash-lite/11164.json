I've analyzed the current input, \"new certificate for server,\" and I'm working to determine the best fit.\n\n**Securing Server Certificates**\n\nI'm focusing on classifying the current IT ticket. The recurring themes of \"certificate,\" \"server,\" and \"external availability\" strongly suggest a need to manage digital security assets. I'm considering \"Purchase\" as the most fitting category, as ordering and obtaining these certificates aligns with acquisition processes, though the nuances of installation and configuration are also being weighed.\n\n**Ordering Server Certificates**\n\nI'm now refining the classification of the IT ticket. The explicit mentions of \"ordered\" and \"order raised,\" alongside the need for a \"certificate\" from a \"trusted certificate authority,\" solidify \"Purchase\" as the most accurate category. This reflects the procurement of a digital security asset.\n\n**Ordering Digital Assets**\n\nI've analyzed the IT ticket's comprehensive details, focusing on the recurring mentions of \"certificate,\" \"ordered,\" and \"trusted certificate authority.\" This strongly indicates a procurement process for a digital security asset, leading me to confidently assign it to the \"Purchase\" category.\n\n"
