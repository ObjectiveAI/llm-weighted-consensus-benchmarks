My current hypothesis leans towards the Purchase category, but I'm holding off until I've fully scanned all the words. I'll need to double check other areas to be completely sure.\n\n\n**Defining the Key Theme**\n\nI'm now fully convinced the ticket belongs in the \"Purchase\" category. The repeated use of terms like \"PO\", \"purchase,\" \"order,\" and \"receipts,\" combined with phrases like \"new purchase,\" strongly points towards a procurement-related request. There's nothing related to internal projects or any of the other categories. This is a clear case of a purchase order needing processing.\n\n\n**Identifying the Ticket Focus**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the ticket's core intent. The language strongly aligns with \"Purchase.\" The mentions of \"PO,\" \"receipts,\" and \"item needed\" are the strongest signals. It's essentially a purchase order being processed. There's nothing hinting at the other options; it feels straightforward at this point.\n\n\n"
