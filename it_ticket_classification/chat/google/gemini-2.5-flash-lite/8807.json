The provided text snippets are proving challenging. The phrase \"colombia non starter\" is throwing me. It doesn't seem to clearly align with any of the categories, and I'm not sure how to categorize the ticket based on this alone.\n\n\n**Mapping Ticket Content**\n\nI've been examining the provided text, and I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate category. The phrases \"hiring process,\" \"automation tester technician joining,\" and \"completed form\" strongly suggest an onboarding and HR-related context. While there's a potential for an \"Access\" overlap, the primary focus seems to be the HR process itself. I'm now fairly confident in this categorization.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR Alignment**\n\nI'm now quite certain that this ticket belongs in the \"HR Support\" category. Analyzing the text, phrases such as \"hiring process,\" \"automation tester technician joining,\" and \"completed form\" strongly emphasize the onboarding and HR-related aspects of the situation. While access might be a secondary consideration, the core issue revolves around the HR processes. \"HR Support\" seems to capture the essence of the ticket's content.\n\n\n"
