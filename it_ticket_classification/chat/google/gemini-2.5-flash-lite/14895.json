I'm carefully examining the text to see if any other keywords point to a more precise category. I'm also considering the possibility of multiple overlapping categories.\n\n\n**Defining Likely Categories**\n\nI've refined the categorization focus. The multiple occurrences of \"leaver\" and \"leaver form\" point decisively towards \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" as primary categories. I've ruled out \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Internal Project\" as they lack relevance. \"Administrative rights\" is a potential sub-category within \"Access,\" especially given the context of a leaver.\n\n\n**Refining Category Priorities**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the primary and secondary categories. The multiple references to \"leaver\" and the explicit mention of \"leaver form\" solidify \"HR Support\" as the core category. I'm now considering \"Access\" as the secondary category, due to the need for access revocation or modification related to a leaver.\n\n\n**Identifying Primary Category**\n\nI've determined \"HR Support\" as the primary category, driven by the strong presence of \"leaver\" and the \"leaver form\" mention. I am thinking the HR element is central, initiating the overall process, even though it involves downstream Access management, which is a key sub-process, and I have dismissed the other categories. This is also the reason I have not picked multiple categories.\n\n\n"
