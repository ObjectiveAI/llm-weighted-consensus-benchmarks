So far, the primary keywords I've identified are \"requisition\" and \"oracle.\" I'm carefully weighing those in light of the available categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights to make the best possible determination.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on definitively linking the \"requisition\" issue to the most relevant IT ticket category. After reviewing the ticket details and the provided categories, \"Purchase\" keeps standing out due to the requisition process. The issue revolves around an inability to submit or create the requisition in Oracle, so I am strongly leaning towards this classification, while also carefully considering and eliminating other options.\n\n\n"
