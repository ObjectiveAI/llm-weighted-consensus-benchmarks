The recurring themes of \"changing approver\" and \"re changing approver\" strongly suggest an approval workflow modification is the central issue.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI'm zeroing in on the dominant keywords. The repeated references to \"approver\" changes are leading me to classify this under access-related requests, as changing an approver directly impacts who has permission to proceed with a task or workflow.\n\n**Classifying Approval Requests**\n\nI'm refining my understanding of \"approver\" changes. The recurrence of these requests strongly suggests they pertain to system workflows and permissions, making \"Access\" the most fitting classification.\n\n**Focusing on Approval Roles**\n\nI'm continuing to refine my categorization. The consistent theme of altering who has approval authority solidifies my inclination towards classifying these requests under \"Access,\" as it directly pertains to managing permissions within a workflow.\n\n"
