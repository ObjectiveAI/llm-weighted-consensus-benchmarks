The text references \"oracle,\" \"absence date,\" \"annual leave,\" \"public holidays,\" and \"migration.\" This suggests the ticket falls under either HR Support or Access. I'm leaning toward HR Support given the terms related to leave and absence, but I will continue my review to be sure.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter further consideration, I've refined my initial assessment. While \"Migration\" initially hinted at \"Internal Project,\" the core issue centers on absence date functionality post-migration. \"Oracle\" seems tangential, the core issue is about leave and absence, not the database. Given these insights, and after double-checking the ticket text, I'm confident \"HR Support\" remains the most appropriate category.\n\n\n"
