After analyzing the text, my initial thought is that the frequent mention of \"password\" points towards an \"Access\" issue. However, I'm still considering if \"HR Support\" could also be relevant due to the potential employee-related aspect of password management. I'm carefully weighing these two options before making a final decision.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the central problem: password access. After analyzing the ticket, the repeated mentions of expiration and changes strongly suggest an \"Access\" issue. Considering the 'Hardware' or 'Internal Project' categories wouldn't be relevant. My focus is on resolving the user's access-related difficulties. I think \"Access\" fits the bill perfectly.\n\n\n"
