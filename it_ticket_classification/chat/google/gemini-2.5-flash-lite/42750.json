It's becoming clear this revolves around an HR-related issue: the inability to submit a timesheet.  This seems straightforward, so I am going to categorize it as **HR Support**.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and I am now confident this is a straightforward HR support request because the user is unable to submit their timesheet.  This seems quite cut and dry. Now that I am sure it is an HR issue, I am going to assign it as **HR Support**.\n\n\n**Clarifying Ticket's Purpose**\n\nI'm revisiting the ticket's text, focusing on the core problem. The user's inability to submit their timesheet is central.  While there's a possibility of an access issue, I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" because this encompasses timesheet difficulties more directly. I need to make sure this is the right category and go from there.\n\n\n"
