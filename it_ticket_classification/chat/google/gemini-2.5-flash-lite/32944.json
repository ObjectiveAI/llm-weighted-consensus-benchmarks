                    "reasoning": "**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI'm currently dissecting the ticket text to determine the best categorization. The keywords \"oracle,\" \"new,\" \"pm,\" and \"allocation\" are being evaluated in relation to the provided category options. Initial assessment suggests focusing on potential resource allocation or possibly database management. I'm leaning toward either \"Storage\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but want to be sure to get it right.\n\n\n**Categorizing Procurement Needs**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Purchase\" as the most suitable category. The ticket's emphasis on \"invoice,\" \"submissions,\" \"spent,\" and \"contracts\" are clear procurement indicators. \"Internal Project\" is still a contender, but the financial aspects and vendor interactions make \"Purchase\" a better fit. I'm finalizing the association between \"pm allocation,\" \"invoice\" and \"contract costs\" and the procurement scope to give the most accurate categorization possible.\n\n\n**Deciding Procurement Focus**\n\nI'm now weighing the \"Purchase\" versus \"Internal Project\" options. The text highlights project management (PM) codes and allocation, but the strong emphasis on \"invoice,\" \"spent mapping,\" and \"contracts\" is pushing me toward \"Purchase.\" However, \"Internal Project\" also seems relevant given the focus on managing the assignment of codes for new projects. I need to clarify whether these are procurement invoices directly or cost allocation for PMs.\n\n\n**Defining Purchase Scope**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"Purchase\" category. Analyzing the text, the mention of \"new PM allocation\" now strongly indicates the procurement of tools or services related to project management. The combination of \"invoice,\" \"spent mapping,\" and \"contracts\" firmly situates this within the scope of a purchase, not just internal project tracking. The focus on cost control via these actions makes it all a clear \"Purchase\" process to me.\n\n\n**Confirming Purchase Category**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Purchase\" category. The text's focus on invoices, orders, contracts, and spending clearly indicates a procurement process. While \"Internal Project\" was initially considered, the transactional and financial nature of the ticket, especially the new PM allocation, positions it firmly in the \"Purchase\" domain. It seems like the request is about properly mapping and billing for the acquisition of some goods or service.\n\n\n**Confirming Procurement Scope**\n\nI'm solidifying \"Purchase\" as the correct categorization. The analysis of \"PM codes\" now strongly suggests a focus on the allocation of procurement spending, with invoices and contracts as the core elements. The ticket is indeed about handling financial transactions.\n\nI'm finalizing the categorization as \"Purchase.\" The detailed examination of keywords and their relationship to various aspects of project costs, invoicing, and contracts solidified my thought process. All the ticket's components strongly indicate procurement-related activity.\n\n\n**Solidifying Purchase Decision**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Purchase\" category. The text's focus on invoices, orders, contracts, and spending clearly indicates a procurement process. While \"Internal Project\" was initially considered, the transactional and financial nature of the ticket, especially the new PM allocation, positions it firmly in the \"Purchase\" domain. It seems like the request is about properly mapping and billing for the acquisition of some goods or service.\n\n\n"
