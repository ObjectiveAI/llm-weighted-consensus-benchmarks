After analyzing the short text \"space on db pm hi kind\", I'm leaning toward \"Storage\" as the most relevant category. There doesn't appear to be enough information for any other categories.\n\n\n**Deep Diving into Details**\n\nNow that the initial categorization is established, I am digging deeper into the provided ticket text. The terms \"space on db,\" \"cleaning,\" and \"backup files\" are recurring and point towards storage-related issues. I'm confident that \"Storage\" is still the most accurate category, based on this extended analysis and the keywords I've identified. The context aligns well with potential disk space limitations and the need for database optimization.\n\n\n"
