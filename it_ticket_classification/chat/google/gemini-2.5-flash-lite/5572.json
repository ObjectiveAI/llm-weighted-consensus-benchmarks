The keywords \"approval,\" \"requisition,\" and \"action\" point strongly toward an internal process, so I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as the primary category. However, I need to consider if any other category fits too, like \"Purchase,\" but I think it's not the best fit. I'm going to re-evaluate the description with these categories in mind to confirm my decision.\n\n\n**Identifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've analyzed the keywords and the context, and it's clear the ticket concerns an approval process related to a requisition. The terms strongly suggest a \"Purchase\" request requiring authorization. While \"Internal Project\" was initially considered, the focus is on a specific purchasing action. I am now certain that \"Purchase\" is the most appropriate category, and I'll proceed accordingly.\n\n\n**Defining the Best Match**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's keywords \u2013 approval, requisition, and reminder \u2013 in relation to the provided categories.  The description focuses on the flow of requesting and obtaining approval for something. After a deep review of each category, \"Purchase\" seems like the most logical choice.  I'm confident in this classification, as the ticket clearly involves a purchasing request requiring authorization.\n\n\n"
