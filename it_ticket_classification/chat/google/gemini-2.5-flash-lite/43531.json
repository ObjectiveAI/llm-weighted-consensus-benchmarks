The keywords \"annual leave request\" suggest a strong lean towards HR Support. However, the mention of \"incorrect information displayed\" is a curveball. While it doesn't align directly with a hardware issue, it might involve access rights or even an internal system displaying erroneous data. I am weighing the relevance of each category to the provided text.\n\n\n**Categorizing Leave Issue**\n\nThis ticket leans heavily towards HR Support, given the \"annual leave request\" keywords. The phrase \"incorrect information displayed\" is critical, indicating a system malfunction, though not necessarily hardware. It seems an HR system is miscalculating and displaying incorrect leave balance information. The mention of \"screen\" narrows it further to a user interface issue. This suggests the primary focus should remain within HR Support, even though a system malfunction is the root cause.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Focus**\n\nIt's clear this ticket is an HR Support issue regarding leave balance accuracy. The problem manifests on-screen, impacting the reported number of days. I've ruled out all other categories, landing firmly on the HR function. The ticket highlights a user interface glitch that miscalculates leave days, directly aligning with HR Support.\n\n\n"
