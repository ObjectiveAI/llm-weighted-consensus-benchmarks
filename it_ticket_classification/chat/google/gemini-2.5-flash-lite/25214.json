The description \"new starter december starter form ext\" has led me to analyze the keywords. \"New starter\" suggests an HR-related issue, and I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate category. I'll need to confirm that this is a good fit.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket description \"new starter december starter form ext\". \"New starter\" and \"starter form\" point strongly towards HR. \"Ext\" is ambiguous. I've ruled out Hardware, Storage, Purchase, and Internal Project.  \"Access\" is possible, as new hires require system access, but \"HR Support\" seems more directly relevant to the form itself. I'm leaning toward selecting \"HR Support\" for the primary category, with a potential secondary category for access issues if needed.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR Relevance**\n\nI'm now fully focused on the \"starter form\" element of the ticket. The description clearly revolves around the onboarding process. \"December\" provides a date context, confirming it's a current onboarding issue. The \"ext\" term remains ambiguous, but doesn't change the core focus. My choice of \"HR Support\" is becoming more solid.\n\n\n"
