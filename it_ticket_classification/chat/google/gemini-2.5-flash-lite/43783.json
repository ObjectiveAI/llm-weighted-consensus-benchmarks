I'm reviewing the list, trying to match the problem to the categories. Considering if this pertains to hardware, access, or something else.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Problem**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket. The user can't connect to servers, pointing clearly toward an \"Access\" issue, given the context provided. I'm choosing \"Access\" over \"Administrative rights\" because it's a broader category and encapsulates the connection difficulties more directly.\n\n\n**Determining the Root Cause**\n\nI've refined my initial analysis. While \"Access\" is still relevant, I'm now leaning toward the need to pinpoint the exact *type* of access problem. I'm exploring whether the issue is with network connectivity or a specific server access configuration.\n\n\n**Selecting the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Access\" category. The ticket text's emphasis on connectivity troubles and being unable to reach servers aligns perfectly. The prior use of a \"hopping station\" strongly hints at a connection or access point issue, further solidifying \"Access\" as the prime choice. I've ruled out other categories, focusing on the specific problem described.\n\n\n"
