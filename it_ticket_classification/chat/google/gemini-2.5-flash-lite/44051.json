My analysis indicates it likely falls under \"Access\". The phrasing directly concerns access, with a clear reference to HR documents. My primary consideration is how the access issue interacts with HR documentation. The term 'new' suggests a recent change or upgrade.\n\n\n**Narrowing Access Scope**\n\n\\n\\nI'm now zeroing in on 'Access' as the definitive category. While 'HR Support' initially seemed relevant due to the HR documents, a deeper dive indicates the core problem is a *technical* access issue. The recent phrase \"experiencing access issue for location\" confirms this. It's a question of *how* to access files, not *what* the files contain. The language clearly denotes a technical hurdle in obtaining the required permissions. The text confirms the user needs help \"granting access\" in a location, further solidifying the access classification.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've determined that \"Access\" is the most fitting category. While HR documents are involved, the essence of the ticket lies in the technical ability to reach them. Phrases like \"access problem,\" \"experiencing access issue,\" and \"granting access\" all point directly to an access-related problem. Although \"HR Support\" seemed relevant initially, the emphasis on technical access outweighs the HR content itself.\n\n\n"
