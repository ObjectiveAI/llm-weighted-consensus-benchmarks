My analysis leans towards the \"Access\" category, but I am cross-checking for any overlap with other options like \"Hardware\" or \"Internal Project,\" given the limited information. I'll need to confirm that this is a straightforward access problem.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI've honed in on the issue; the phrasing in the ticket strongly suggests an access problem. The user's description, coupled with the provided context, makes a compelling case for selecting \"Access\" as the primary category. I'm satisfied that this is the best fit, given that the other categories appear irrelevant based on the available information.\n\n\n"
