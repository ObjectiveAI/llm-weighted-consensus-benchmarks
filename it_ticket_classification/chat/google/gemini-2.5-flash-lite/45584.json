The \"access\" theme seems highly relevant.\n\n**Determining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm narrowing down the classification for the ticket. Given the repeated emphasis on \"error accessing\" and \"issue with opening documents,\" the \"Access\" category appears to be the most accurate and specific fit.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's text, noting the repeated emphasis on \"accessing\" and \"opening\" issues. Based on this strong recurring theme, I'm confident in assigning it to the \"Access\" category.\n\n"
