It looks like the repeated use of \"storage\" is a strong indicator. I'm leaning toward selecting \"Storage\" as the appropriate category for this ticket. My next step will be to confirm this through further analysis.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI have carefully re-evaluated the ticket text and the available categories. It seems \"Storage\" remains the most accurate fit due to the consistent use of \"storage\" and related terms. While \"Access\" is also present, the core request revolves around storage management and setup. I'm finalizing my analysis and preparing to confirm the assignment.\n\n\n**Solidifying the Selection**\n\nThe \"Storage\" category continues to be the best fit after a thorough review. I've re-examined the ticket content, with the repeated use of \"storage\" pointing me in that direction. The terms \"access,\" \"order,\" and \"setup\" all relate to storage and not to any other of the given categories. This solidifies my decision to classify the ticket under \"Storage.\"\n\n\n"
