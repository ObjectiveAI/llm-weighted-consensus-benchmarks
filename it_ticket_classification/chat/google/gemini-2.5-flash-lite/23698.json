The details point away from simple access, storage, purchases, or administrative rights, suggesting a functional problem within a specific application or its configuration.\n\n**Classifying Application Issue**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the ticket's details, focusing on the non-functioning \"yammer feed on analysis discipline.\" After reviewing the provided categories and the ticket's emphasis on software features like \"feed threads\" and \"view,\" I'm moving away from Hardware, HR, Access, Storage, Purchase, and Administrative rights.
