The text mentions \"new starter contractor\" and \"starter form contractor.\" The context points strongly toward HR Support, or possibly Access, depending on what the \"starter form\" relates to. I'm leaning toward HR Support as the primary category given the general nature of the request. The \"sorry\" does not provide additional information for the categorization. I am still analyzing the ticket contents.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've just finished analyzing the ticket's contents in detail. While \"Access\" could be a secondary category, the primary focus appears to be on the \"starter form\" and its completion. The phrases used - \"new starter,\" \"join contractor,\" \"sorry wrong form,\" and \"please help completion\" - all strongly point towards onboarding. Therefore, \"HR Support\" emerges as the most fitting and direct categorization based on the available information.\n\n\n"
