Based on the \"toner waste container full\" description, I'm leaning toward \"Hardware.\" I'm mentally checking if there's any need to consider other categories. It's a clear hardware issue, requiring replacement of the container. My analysis is pretty straightforward, leaning toward hardware as the top contender.\n\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've finished the categorization. While \"Miscellaneous\" was briefly considered, it lacked the precision needed. The issue is undeniably hardware-related due to the \"toner waste container\" issue. \"Purchase\" was also considered, but the broken hardware itself is the primary concern. \"Hardware\" is the clear and most appropriate choice.\n\n\n"
