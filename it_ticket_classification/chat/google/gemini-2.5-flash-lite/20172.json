The \"new starter\" phrase points toward HR or access. \"Form\" hints at an administrative process. Importance, high, and ext may give more clues, but are less defining. I'm leaning toward the \"HR Support\" category, pending confirmation.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Onboarding Focus**\n\nI'm now focusing on the \"new starter\" aspect and the \"form.\"  The \"february\" element might indicate a time-sensitive setup. Given that HR typically owns the onboarding process, I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the initial category. But \"Access\" is still in the running, especially considering the \"pm starter\" portion.  I'm trying to determine whether the form is a request from HR or a notification to IT.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Onboarding Scope**\n\nI'm now focusing on the nuances between \"HR Support\" and \"Access.\" The \"form\" aspect is becoming central. If the ticket is about *requesting* an action for the new starter, like IT setup, it would lean toward \"HR Support.\" If it's about *fulfilling* a specific access request (e.g., granting permissions), \"Access\" is a better fit. The \"form\" strongly suggests an *initiation* of the process, which aligns better with HR. This supports the initial categorization of \"HR Support\" as the most suitable option, reflecting the broader scope of onboarding forms. I'm prioritizing the context provided by this form, and the initial onboarding activity it signals.\n\n\n**Solidifying HR Onboarding**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's context in light of a scenario: if HR creates the ticket, it signals IT setup initiation.  If a manager does it, it still falls under HR's onboarding responsibility. This reinforces \"HR Support\" as the best categorization. The focus now is definitively on the encompassing onboarding process.\n\n\n"
