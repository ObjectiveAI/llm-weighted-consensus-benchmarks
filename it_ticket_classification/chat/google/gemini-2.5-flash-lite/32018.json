The schema presents clear categories, and I'm determining which one best fits the short phrase. My analysis is ongoing, considering the limited information given, and I'm seeking a suitable category based on the available data.\n\n\n**Identifying the Best Match**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"HR Support\" category as the most suitable for this ticket. The \"annual leave card\" phrase is a key indicator, aligning the text with typical HR processes. While \"reject card approved\" is a more general phrase, it could refer to leave approvals. I am confidently selecting \"HR Support\" as the appropriate category.\n\n\n**Determining Category Confidence**\n\nI'm now evaluating the \"HR Support\" categorization with increased certainty. The \"annual leave card\" phrasing remains a strong indicator, and I've analyzed potential ambiguities. While \"reject card approved\" introduces some uncertainty, it still points towards a process that the \"HR Support\" category encompasses well. Based on the analysis, I'm confident in this categorization and preparing the JSON response.\n\n\n"
