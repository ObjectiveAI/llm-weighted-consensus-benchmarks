The ticket text strongly suggests an \"Access\" issue, given the focus on a \"new starter access card\" and \"enabling access\" details. The \"re starter form induction hi\" part might be a non-essential phrase.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Category**\n\nI've solidified my selection as \"Access\" for this IT ticket. The \"new starter access card\" request is the central theme, overriding any HR-related onboarding aspects. While HR handles new hires, the IT ticket focuses on the technical enablement of access. The \"re starter form induction hi\" text, although initially appearing HR-related, is peripheral to the access card issue.\n\n\n**Defining IT Ticket Focus**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Access\" category. The ticket text's central concern is getting a new employee's access card \"enabled\" and working, so that is what the IT team should deal with. The \"starter form induction hi\" part might be a non-critical phrase that describes the request from an HR perspective. I do not think the IT ticket's scope is for HR support, though it concerns a new employee, ultimately, the request is for an IT-managed component.\n\n"
