I'm focusing on that `category` field in the JSON schema, with its list of possible values. The ticket I'm working with is pretty brief - \"delivery has failed\" - so it's a good test case for initial categorization.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nMy focus is narrowing in on the best category for \"delivery has failed\". I've pulled out key phrases like \"undeliverable\", \"mailbox full\", and \"remote server returned\". These are pointing towards storage or access issues, but I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Storage\" after considering the specifics. I'm now exploring how I can use these keywords to differentiate this ticket from related ones.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nNow I'm diving deeper into the nuances of this \"delivery has failed\" ticket. The critical piece of data is \"recipient mailbox full,\" along with several related phrases. It's becoming clearer that the primary issue is storage related, so I'm firming up my initial leaning toward \"Storage.\" I'm now looking at the other options to confirm this.\n\n\n"
