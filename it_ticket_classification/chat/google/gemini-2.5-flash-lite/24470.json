It's mentioning a \"staff utilization report\" and specifically calls out \"people who are not part of\" something. My initial lean is away from hardware or storage, perhaps HR or some sort of internal project. Needs a little more digging to pinpoint it.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI've been honing in on the category for this ticket. The phrases \"staff utilization report\" and \"people who are not part of\" are key, along with mentions of a calculated part of the report. The initial lean towards HR support is solidifying. The need for this \"utilization report\" strongly suggests an HR function, more so than internal project management.\n\n\n"
