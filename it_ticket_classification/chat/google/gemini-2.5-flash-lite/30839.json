I see mention of \"new starter access card\" and \"interns,\" which indicates access management is required. Also, the word \"return\" might relate to the return of equipment. However, the exact need remains unclear from the provided text, so I am going to lean towards \"Access\" but am not completely certain yet.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've been evaluating the categories for this IT ticket. After considering the phrases \"new starter access card\" and \"interns starting permanent positions,\" I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access.\" While \"HR Support\" has a slight connection, the core action needed here is related to IT and access provisioning. The mention of \"access card\" further solidified my decision, although I have considered the impact of \"return both\".\n\n\n**Finalizing the Categorization**\n\nI've considered all the information and the available categories. \"Access\" is the most relevant. The phrasing \"new starter access card\" and \"interns starting\" points towards provisioning access rights. Although \"HR Support\" has a slight connection, the core action needed pertains to IT and access management. The term \"access card\" solidified my decision. I am now confident that \"Access\" is the most accurate category.\n\n\n"
