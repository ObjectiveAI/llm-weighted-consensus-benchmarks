I've analyzed the text and am considering the keywords \"remove,\" \"add user,\" and \"access.\" My primary concern now is to find which category they best fit. The ticket's brevity requires careful consideration to make the correct choice.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Options**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. \"Access\" is a strong contender because the ticket revolves around adding and removing users, key aspects of access control.  \"Storage\" is relevant for the folder mention, but seems secondary to the user management. While the \"hi guys folder\" raises a Storage flag, the primary action is still managing user access *to* that storage, therefore Access seems to be more appropriate. I will focus my assessment on those categories.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Request**\n\nI've just concluded my analysis, and I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" as the ideal category. The text's focus on user removal and addition, combined with the \"hi guys folder\" reference, firmly points to access management. Although \"Storage\" seemed plausible at first, the core action remains controlling who can interact with the folder, which is fundamentally an access concern. User management seems to be the primary concern.\n\n\n"
