The text \"restrict board view for external user pm re client confluence hi please\" suggests I need to choose from \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" My initial feeling is that it's related to access or potentially administrative rights. I'll need to analyze the meaning to choose the best fit.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and context. The recurring mention of \"restrict board view,\" \"external user,\" and \"confluence\" strongly indicates a focus on access control within the Confluence system. Considering the level of detail, I lean toward \"Access\" as the more precise category, rather than the broader \"Administrative rights.\" The goal is to accurately tag the ticket based on the intended functionality.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and the available categories. My analysis highlights the repeated references to \"restrict board view,\" \"external user,\" and \"confluence,\" solidifying the core issue: controlling access within the Confluence system. While \"Administrative rights\" was a contender, the specific nature of restricting user views makes \"Access\" the more precise and suitable category for this ticket.\n\n\n"
