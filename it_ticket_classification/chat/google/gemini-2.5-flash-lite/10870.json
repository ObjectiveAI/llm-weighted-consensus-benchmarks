The description clearly indicates an employee is departing the company, which directly points me toward the \"HR Support\" category.\n\n**Refining Employee Leaver Ticket**\n\nI'm refining my categorization of the IT ticket. While \"HR Support\" initially seemed fitting due to the employee departure context, the extensive details about disabling accounts, removing access, and managing services like mailboxes and profiles strongly suggest \"Access\" is a more precise fit for this specific request.\n\n**Classifying Employee Departure**\n\nMy thoughts are now focusing on the nuances of categorizing a leaver ticket. The extensive details concerning account deactivation, access revocation, and service management, particularly the explicit mentions of mailboxes and AD rights, solidify my inclination towards the \"Access\" category as the most appropriate classification.\n\n"
