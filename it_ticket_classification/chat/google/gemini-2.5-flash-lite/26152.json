My initial assessment is that \"Access\" appears to be the most relevant category in this case, given the mention of \"access\" and \"files.\" However, I'm carefully considering whether nuances in the request might warrant other categories like \"Storage\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The brevity of the text necessitates further refinement of my categorisation process to handle ambiguous inputs.\n\n\n**Analyzing Storage Needs**\n\nI've dived deeper into the ticket text, focusing on keywords like \"files,\" \"slides,\" and \"too big mb.\" My analysis firmly points towards storage being the primary concern. While \"access\" was a consideration, the context emphasizes file size limitations, making \"Storage\" the most accurate categorization. I've ruled out other categories based on their lack of relevance to the provided content.\n\n\n**Determining Storage Issues**\n\nI'm now fully convinced that \"Storage\" is the definitive category. My analysis of \"files,\" \"slides,\" and the crucial \"too big mb\" phrase solidified my choice. Access is a secondary concern, and the core problem is clearly related to file size constraints, thus ruling out other options. The ticket seems to be about storage limitations, not a lack of access privileges.\n\n\n"
