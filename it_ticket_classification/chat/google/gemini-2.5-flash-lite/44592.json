My focus is on identifying the core issue and relevant details like the item involved and the reported timeframe. This will help me accurately classify the ticket for the appropriate team.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's content, focusing on recurring keywords like \"access card\" and \"lost access.\" Based on this, I've determined the most fitting category is \"Access,\" as the primary issue revolves around regaining or managing building access due to a lost card.\n\n**Refining Category Choice**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket based on its core elements. The consistent mention of \"access card\" and \"lost access\" strongly indicates that \"Access\" is the most precise category, superseding other potential classifications.\n\n"
