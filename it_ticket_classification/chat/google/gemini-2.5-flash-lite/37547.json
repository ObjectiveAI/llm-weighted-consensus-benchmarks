It's related to an inability to access an Oracle database, based on keywords like \"no access\" and \"database access.\"\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Text**\n\nI'm currently reviewing the provided text to assign an appropriate category. The initial part clearly indicates an \"Access\" issue related to an Oracle database, which is my primary focus for classification.\n\n**Focusing on Access Issues**\n\nI've refined my understanding. The primary focus is identifying and categorizing the \"oracle database no access\" problem, which strongly aligns with the \"Access\" category. I'm prioritizing this core IT issue.\n\n"
