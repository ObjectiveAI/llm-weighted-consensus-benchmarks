                    "reasoning": "**Classifying Ticket Text**\n\nI'm currently focused on categorizing that IT ticket. Initial analysis suggests the text is sparse, making automated classification tricky. \"Ring\" appears multiple times, possibly pointing towards Access or Hardware issues, but the lack of context leaves me unsure. I'm exploring different methods to infer the most likely category, given the limited information.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Categories**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and I think \"Internal Project\" is the best fit, with \"Access\" as a potential secondary option. The \"ring\" and \"oms\" keywords, coupled with mentions of dependencies and limitations, strongly suggest a project context. \"Offices added\" could relate to access, but it's not the primary focus of the text. I'm now leaning heavily towards \"Internal Project\" as the dominant category.\n\n\n**Refining the Classification**\n\nI'm now focusing on a more granular view. While \"Internal Project\" is still the primary contender, I'm trying to refine the categorization further. The repeated \"ring\" and \"oms\" strongly suggest a named project, which aligns with \"Internal Project\". The \"dependencies\" and \"limitations\" elements are clear indicators of a project's complexities. I'm carefully considering the impact of \"offices added\" in this context. It could relate to user onboarding or system rollout within the project. The ticket's tone and lack of specific hardware or HR keywords solidify \"Internal Project\" as the best primary fit. However, \"Access\" warrants consideration as a secondary category due to the mention of \"offices added\".\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Specificity**\n\nI'm now focusing on the nuance within \"Internal Project\" vs. a system-specific option. \"Ring\" and \"oms\" together hint at a complex system or project. The request feels more general, suggesting \"Internal Project\" still fits best, with \"Access\" as secondary if we define the \"offices added\" as relevant. However, the ticket's phrasing is more of a project issue or request, solidifying the choice of \"Internal Project\".\n\n\n**Analyzing Text and Context**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the ticket's nuances. The \"ring\" and \"oms\" terms are consistent indicators. While \"Access\" could be linked through the offices mention, the ticket feels more project-focused. Considering the keywords and their association, the \"Internal Project\" category perfectly encapsulates this ticket. All indicators point towards this conclusion.\n\n\n"
