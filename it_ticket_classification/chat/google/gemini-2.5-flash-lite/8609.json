After a first scan, the word \"career\" jumps out, making me lean towards a possible \"HR Support\" category, given the provided schema. I need to re-examine the ticket text and the schema with a finer-tooth comb.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Classification**\n\nMy assessment strongly points towards \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category. The phrase \"oracle career changes\" indicates an issue likely tied to employee data or career management, perhaps within an Oracle system. While \"Internal Project\" is a possibility, \"HR Support\" aligns better with the core issue described in the ticket text. The other categories seem less relevant.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Assignment**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text, focusing on the phrase \"oracle career changes.\" Given the schema, \"HR Support\" appears most accurate. While \"Internal Project\" is a possibility, the context of career-related changes within Oracle systems points directly to HR involvement. The other categories seem increasingly irrelevant after this close look. The request to assign the changes further strengthens the \"HR Support\" designation.\n\n\n"
