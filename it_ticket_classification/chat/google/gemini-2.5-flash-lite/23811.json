I need to determine if it's about the platform itself or access to it, and how to differentiate between those sub-categories.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Assignment**\n\nI've determined that the primary focus is definitely \"Storage\" based on the repeated mentions of \"drive,\" \"share larger files,\" and the context of a \"one drive account.\" While \"Access\" could be a secondary concern, the wording heavily suggests a storage-related problem. I am deciding how to weigh this.\n\n\n**Determining the Precise Issue**\n\nI've examined the ticket text thoroughly. The keywords still point towards \"Storage\" as the primary category, with \"Access\" a possible secondary, but weaker, contender. I've re-evaluated the emphasis on \"share larger files,\" which seems to be the core of the issue. This strongly suggests a storage-related feature or capacity concern, as opposed to a simple access problem. I will finalize the decision soon.\n\n\n"
