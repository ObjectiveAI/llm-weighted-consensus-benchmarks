The \"not working issue uploading\" phrase is leading me towards either \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" or potentially \"Storage.\" The user's attempts at uploading make me lean towards issues with access, or perhaps storage limitations. I need more clues from the rest of the ticket to confidently rule out a \"Hardware\" problem or to identify what type of access is involved before I can decide.\n\n\n**Determining Primary Issue**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the upload failure. While \"Access\" remains a contender, the focus seems less on *permission* and more on the upload *process* itself. The user's mention of Internet Explorer and format suggests a potential software or compatibility issue within the \"Access\" context. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too broad, but I'm leaning that way. It could be a bug in the application being used or incompatibility between the file and upload system. I am keeping \"Access\" in the running in case permissions related to accessing the upload function is the main problem.\n\n\n**Identifying Appropriate Category**\n\nI've carefully assessed the ticket content, and the nature of the upload failure doesn't firmly align with any specific category. While initially considering \"Access,\" the issue appears centered on the *process* rather than pure permissions. The user's mention of Internet Explorer and format suggests a potential software bug or compatibility glitch. \"Miscellaneous\" appears to be the most fitting choice, given the lack of clear indicators for hardware, HR, storage, purchases, internal projects, or administrative rights issues.\n\n\n"
