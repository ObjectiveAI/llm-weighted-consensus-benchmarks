The text is straightforward, with phrases indicating a need for host name deletion. I'm leaning toward \"Administrative rights\" or potentially \"Storage,\" given the mention of hosts and the deletion request. I'll need to carefully consider the exact language and context to finalize the assignment.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Best Fit**\n\nMy analysis indicates \"Administrative rights\" is the most accurate category. The ticket's core request to delete a host name points towards system management, which aligns with administrative tasks an engineer would perform. This contrasts with the other categories like storage, hardware or purchases that are not mentioned in the ticket description.\n\n\n"
