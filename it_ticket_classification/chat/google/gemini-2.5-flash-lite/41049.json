However, I need to consider if there's any implicit hardware dependency. I'll evaluate the context to solidify my choice for the best IT ticket category.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Purchase Issue**\n\nNow, after further scrutiny, I've discarded \"Administrative rights\" and \"Access\" completely. The keywords are guiding me toward a purchasing issue. The mention of a budget and a PO strengthens the case for \"Purchase\". The approval flow is crucial in purchasing. Therefore, I'm confident \"Purchase\" is the most precise category.\n\n\n**Solidifying the Conclusion**\n\nI'm now fully convinced that \"Purchase\" is the ideal category. The \"rejected approval flow issues\" are a direct symptom of the core problem. The PO request and budget indicate this. I've ruled out all other categories, finding they don't encompass the essence of this ticket.\n\n\n"
