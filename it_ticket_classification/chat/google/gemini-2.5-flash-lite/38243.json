The persistent cable issue points strongly toward a physical hardware problem, but the inability to share also hints at potential access restrictions or configuration issues. I'm leaning toward hardware, given the user's troubleshooting steps. Next, I will consider the context further.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Categories**\n\nI've determined \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category. The ticket's focus on malfunctioning cables and the meeting room's setup for presentations, along with the user's trial of replacement cables, solidify that the root cause is hardware-based. This has made my thought process crystal clear.\n\n\n"
