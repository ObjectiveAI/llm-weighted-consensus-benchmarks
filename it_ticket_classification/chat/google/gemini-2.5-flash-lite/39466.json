                    "reasoning": "**Determining Ticket Type**\n\nI'm currently trying to analyze the ticket's text, \"error no tasks with sent monday\". The phrase doesn't provide enough context for precise categorization, it could relate to several areas like access, internal project or miscellanous but it's hard to tell without additional information. I will need more context to assign the most appropriate category for the ticket.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and it appears the primary concern is the inability to submit tasks due to missing pre-sales code information. While I initially considered several categories, the phrase \"add pre sales tasks code\" strongly suggests the root cause lies within a system's configuration or data entry permissions. It doesn't seem like a hardware issue, HR matter, or other options.\n\n\n**Identifying the Root Cause**\n\nThe ticket seems to focus on an issue preventing successful task submission. I've re-examined the language, particularly the request to \"add pre sales tasks code\". It still leans towards a configuration or data entry problem requiring an administrator's intervention. Initially I thought it might be access related, however I now feel that it's more about the lack of specific, possibly pre-defined, pre-sales code. This points towards an underlying system configuration issue.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Problem**\n\nI've been going through the ticket and now I think it's more about someone else having to *modify* or add something within the system rather than needing explicit new rights. The user isn't directly asking for \"access\" but rather for someone to *do* something on their behalf. Given the context of \"add pre sales tasks code\" and the submission error, the core problem looks less like an access issue and more like an issue with the underlying data setup or system configuration. This isn't about general access; it's about a specific configuration needing to be addressed by a person with admin-level abilities.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Root Cause**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Administrative rights\" as the most appropriate category. The user's inability to submit and the request to \"add pre sales tasks code\" strongly indicate a need for a privileged action, a configuration or data entry that's beyond standard user permissions. My thought process moved from initially considering \"Access,\" but the focus is on a *specific* modification, not general access. While I previously considered that they might be missing simple access rights, the phrasing indicates a more complex task than simply gaining login permissions. Now it seems like an administrator is required to resolve this configuration issue. The user needs someone else to *do* something to the system's configuration.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Solution**\n\nI've decided to categorize this ticket as \"Administrative rights\". The recent analysis firmly suggests the core of the problem is a missing configuration or data entry (\"add pre sales tasks code\") that requires privileged action within the system, not a simple access issue. The request is to *do* something to the system, which indicates the need for someone with administrative-level permissions, rather than simply needing new rights granted.\n\n\n"
