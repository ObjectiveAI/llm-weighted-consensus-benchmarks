The text, \"employee title not properly displayed outlook sent wednesday re,\" indicates a potential Outlook display issue. My initial thought is it could fall under \"Access\" or potentially \"HR Support,\" as it involves employee information. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" for now but still considering all options before making a final determination.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Root Issue**\n\nIt's clear the root cause lies in discrepancies between offered job titles and what's displayed.  My assessment now strongly suggests \"HR Support\" as the primary category. The text highlights offers, amendments to titles, and communications around employment, all falling under HR responsibilities. Though Outlook is involved, the core issue isn't a software bug but the data itself.\n\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nMy analysis indicates an \"HR Support\" categorization is the most accurate. The user's input clearly highlights the core issues as pertaining to job offers, employment amendments, and pre-employment screening, all central to HR functions. After reviewing the text and considering all options, I've confirmed that these details align best with \"HR Support\" and have dismissed alternative options as less relevant.\n\n\n"
