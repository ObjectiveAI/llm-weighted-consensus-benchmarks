My primary goal now is to choose the most fitting category, which I'm considering to be **Access**. The text mentions \"unable to view\", which is strongly related to issues related to access.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket description more deeply, focusing on the specific words and phrases used. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" as the appropriate category. The inability to \"view incidents\" and the mention of an error message strongly suggest a permissions or access-related problem within the \"service now\" system. I'm confident that the core issue revolves around this lack of functionality.\n\n\n**Defining the Problem's Scope**\n\nI'm focused on the ticket description, particularly the phrases \"unable to view incidents\" and \"error message.\" It's increasingly clear the root cause lies in accessing data within \"service now.\" The symptoms point directly to an access issue.\n\n\n\n"
