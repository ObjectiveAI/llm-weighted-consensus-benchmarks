The references to \"packets transmitted\" and \"poll status down\" solidify my thinking towards a network or server hardware problem. I'm focusing my decision on the specifics of this hardware category.\n\n\n**Defining the Scope**\n\nI've determined the issue is a direct hardware problem. Examining the ticket's terms, particularly \"routers tower,\" \"poll status down,\" and \"packet loss,\" reinforces this. I've eliminated irrelevant categories and focused the selection on the \"Hardware\" option.\n\n\n"
