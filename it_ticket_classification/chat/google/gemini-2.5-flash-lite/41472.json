The \"time sheet submission error\" indicates this might be an issue related to access, HR support, or potentially an internal project related to timekeeping. The term \"submitting for week\" seems to be part of the user's issue, which is still being clarified. I need to figure out which category covers \"timesheet submission\" out of the available ones.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Alignment**\n\nI've determined that the \"time sheet submission error\" falls squarely under \"HR Support.\" The phrases \"annual leave booked,\" \"submitted approved for,\" \"rectify,\" and \"upcoming leave\" strongly support this conclusion. While the issue touches on IT processes, the root cause is fundamentally an HR-related employee process. I'm satisfied that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate classification.\n\n\n"
