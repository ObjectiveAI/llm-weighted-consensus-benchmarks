Initial thoughts lean toward \"Storage\" due to the mentions of \"file storage,\" \"saved work drives,\" and \"map drive.\" However, I need to consider the broader context to ensure I haven't missed any subtle clues suggesting other categories like \"Hardware\" or \"Access\".\n\n\n**Defining Ticket's Scope**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket content, and the focus is clearly on file access and storage. Key phrases like \"network file storage,\" \"saved work drives,\" and \"map drive letter\" are prominent. While \"Hardware\" is mentioned (\"pc broke\"), the core issue revolves around accessing lost files and mapping drives. The only other potentially related category would be Access, but the focus is clearly more oriented around file management and preservation. I'm confirming \"Storage\" as the best categorization.\n\n\n"
