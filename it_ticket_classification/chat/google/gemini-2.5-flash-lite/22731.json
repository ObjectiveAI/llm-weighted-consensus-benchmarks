I'm aiming to accurately map this to the correct IT issue.\n\n\n**Analyzing Purchase Order Details**\n\nI've refined my focus to the ticket text's mentions of \"PO\" and related terms like \"invoice,\" \"supplier,\" and \"price changes.\" These are strong indicators of a purchase-related issue.  I'm now cross-referencing these keywords with the provided category list to pinpoint the best fit. I'm leaning toward \"Purchase\" as the most appropriate category given the ticket's core focus.\n\n\n**Defining Purchase-Centric Issues**\n\nI'm now focusing on ticket text keywords like \"create installation,\" \"resubmit,\" and \"ordered installed.\" These point to a process, not just a hardware issue. I've mapped the provided categories against the ticket's theme of purchase orders and item installation. I've confirmed that \"Purchase\" is the most accurate category, based on the recurring themes of procurement and installation. I'm satisfied this category accurately reflects the ticket's core function.\n\n\n"
