My focus is on mapping the user's request to the most fitting option from the available enum: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights.\"\n\n**Focusing on Access**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket descriptions and am confident the core issue is related to accessing shared mailboxes and authentication problems. This strongly suggests the \"Access\" category is the most appropriate classification. I've ruled out other options like Hardware as they don't align with the user's stated problems.\n\n**Finalizing Access Classification**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the user's requests and am confirming that \"Access\" is indeed the most fitting category for these IT tickets. All indicators, particularly those concerning shared mailbox authentication and retrieval, align perfectly with this classification.\n\n"
