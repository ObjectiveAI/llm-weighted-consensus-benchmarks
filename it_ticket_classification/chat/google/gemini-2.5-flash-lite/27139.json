I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" as the primary category due to the repeated mentions of \"warranty\" and \"laptop.\" However, \"Purchase\" is also a possibility since the user seems concerned about an order related to the laptop. I'm trying to decide between these two possibilities based on whether the ticket is more about getting help with a problem or placing an order.\n\n\n**Deciding Primary Category**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the primary category, leaning heavily towards \"Hardware.\" Although the phrase \"worried about order\" suggests a purchase angle, the expired laptop warranty is the core issue. The \"snapshot\" reference, while potentially storage-related, more likely relates to backing up data before hardware service. I'm prioritizing the root cause of the query.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Content**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket content, and the focus is firmly on the expired laptop warranty. While \"worried about order\" suggests a potential purchase, it stems *from* the hardware issue. \"Snapshot\" relates to data backup, which is often tied to hardware repair or replacement.  The core issue: expired warranty = Hardware.\n\n\n"
