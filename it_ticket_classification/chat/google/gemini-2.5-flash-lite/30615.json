                    "reasoning": "**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket. The phrases \"grades history\" and \"report change\" suggest something related to data or access permissions rather than hardware or HR issues. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but need more context. I'll continue to analyze the provided text to ensure I'm making the most accurate selection.\n\n\n**Evaluating Category Options**\n\nMy analysis indicates this ticket's core is report modification including employee data. \"Access\" seems wrong, it's not access permission issues, I've narrowed to \"Administrative Rights\" or a tailored category like \"Report/Data Management\". I'm still analyzing to decide between these two possibilities, leaning toward the latter due to the nature of the request.\n\n\n**Reassessing HR Support**\n\nAfter further reflection, I'm considering \"HR Support\" more seriously. The ticket clearly involves data related to HR functions (grades, job titles) and the request is to modify how this data is presented. It's not about providing *direct* HR assistance but enhancing a tool *for* HR use. If the report modification improves HR processes, \"HR Support\" becomes the most accurate category. Alternatively, if this is a very bespoke, custom internal tool, I need to consider \"Internal Project\". I am now weighing these two options and will make a final decision shortly.\n\n\n**Selecting Final Category**\n\nI've carefully assessed \"HR Support\" based on the ticket text and it aligns best. The \"grades history\" and \"job titles\" indicate HR-related data. The request focuses on modifying a report containing this data, which aligns with supporting HR functions. This customization enhances an HR tool, making \"HR Support\" the most precise and fitting category. The alternative, \"Internal Project\", is less specific to the HR nature of the request.\n\n\n"
