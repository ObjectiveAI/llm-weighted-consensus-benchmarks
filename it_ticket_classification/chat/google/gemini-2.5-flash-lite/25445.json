                    "reasoning": "**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently focused on categorizing that IT ticket text. I've broken down the text, looking for keywords that suggest the correct category. \"Change career map,\" and \"job search\" are the key phrases. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" because those phrases relate to employee resources. I'll evaluate the remaining categories and determine which category is the best fit.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Details**\n\nOkay, I've re-examined the ticket text, breaking it down into key phrases like \"change icon,\" \"job search map,\" and \"roles attached.\" My initial thought about HR Support still lingers, but I'm now leaning more towards \"Internal Project\" as the map is likely a component of one, or possibly \"Miscellaneous\" since it doesn't fit the other categories perfectly. I'm focusing on the visual asset modification aspect now.\n\n\n**Evaluating Project Relevance**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text, considering \"Internal Project\" more closely. The focus on icon changes within a \"career map\" suggests this map is a component of a larger system. I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as the map is likely an internal tool or platform. Now I'm evaluating the request as a specific modification within an internal system and am determining if \"Miscellaneous\" still has relevance.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Project Context**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text with a clearer focus on the \"Internal Project\" category. I am now leaning strongly towards \"Internal Project\" given the emphasis on changing a map icon. It suggests this modification is related to a feature within an ongoing internal system. While \"Miscellaneous\" remains a possibility, the specific nature of the request, coupled with the internal focus, points me toward \"Internal Project.\" I need to see if there is any other context to the nature of this project.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter further thought, I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project.\" While the request could relate to HR, the focus on a \"career map\" and \"icon\" modifications strongly suggests a visual element change within an internal system or application. \"Miscellaneous\" might be too broad for the specific nature of this task. Given the choices, \"Internal Project\" provides a more relevant context for this modification.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Action**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text with the action \"change icon\" as the primary focus, and the categories in mind. I now think the ticket relates to an Internal Project. The modification of the icon is a visual asset update for an internal feature. If it's a feature update to an existing internal system, I lean toward the project as the icon is a small change. I'm focusing on its visual and specific nature, which seems like feature updates on an internal project.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. I've considered that the request involves a visual change to a \"career map\" and \"job search map,\" likely within a company system, pointing towards ongoing development or maintenance. The action, \"change icon,\" further supports this. I need to make a final decision.\n\n\n**Evaluating Categorization Decision**\n\nI'm now leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category. After considering HR and Miscellaneous, it seems the core request is changing a visual asset, which is a common task within internal project lifecycles. I'm focusing on the nature of internal tools and their development. The key is that the icons are for a \"career map\" and \"job search map,\" features that strongly suggest it's part of an internal system.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter carefully assessing the context, I'm now certain \"Internal Project\" best suits this IT ticket. The request targets an icon change within a career map and job search context, suggesting an internal application modification. \"Miscellaneous\" seems too broad, while \"HR Support\" doesn't quite capture the nature of this visual asset update.\n\n\n**Choosing Ticket Category**\n\nI'm now leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category. After considering HR and Miscellaneous, it seems the core request is changing a visual asset, which is a common task within internal project lifecycles. I'm focusing on the nature of internal tools and their development. The key is that the icons are for a \"career map\" and \"job search map,\" features that strongly suggest it's part of an internal system.\\n\\n**Refining Categorization Decision**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket with a strong focus on \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. Given the context of the requested icon change within \"career map\" and \"job search map,\" I'm now confident that the request aligns with internal system development. While \"Miscellaneous\" remains a possibility, the specific modification suggests an action on a project, supporting the categorization of \"Internal Project.\"\n\n\n"
