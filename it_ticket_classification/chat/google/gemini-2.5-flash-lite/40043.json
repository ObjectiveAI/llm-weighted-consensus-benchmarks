I am considering the nuances of the options and making my final selection shortly.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket Type**\n\nI have concluded that the IT ticket falls squarely under the \"Access\" category, based on the user's description. The inability to access a shared location, coupled with the explicit mention of access-related errors, solidifies this choice. I am confident in this categorization.\n\n\n"
