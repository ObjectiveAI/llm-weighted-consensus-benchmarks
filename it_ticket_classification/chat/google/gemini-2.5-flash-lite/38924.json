My strategy is to isolate relevant keywords that will point to the correct category. I'll need to develop a robust approach to handle varied phrasing and ensure accuracy in the assignment.\n\n\n**Categorizing Purchase Orders**\n\nI've honed in on the \"Purchase\" category. The keywords strongly suggest purchase order and invoice reconciliation issues, which clearly fits. I've ruled out others like \"Administrative rights\" for now, as the core issue isn't access *per se*, but rather the process of managing the financial documents. The context revolves around how to correctly process these items.\n\n\n**Analyzing Key Phrases**\n\nI've been analyzing the key phrases from the ticket description, focusing on the procurement and financial language. \"Invoice,\" \"PO,\" \"cost center,\" and \"funds\" are the dominant terms. My current assessment is that the \"Purchase\" category is the best fit, as the issue relates to financial document processing. I'll finalize the JSON output with a key: category and a value: Purchase.\n\n\n"
