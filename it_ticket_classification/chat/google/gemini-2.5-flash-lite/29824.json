My focus is on determining the most accurate category from the available options, considering the mention of forms, hardware, and accounts.\n\n**Determining the Core IT Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's content, focusing on keywords like \"new starter,\" \"starter forms,\" \"hardware,\" and \"accounts.\" My current thinking is that the primary intent revolves around the onboarding process for a new employee, which is strongly linked to HR functions. Therefore, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most fitting category, as it encompasses the holistic setup for a new starter rather than just specific technical components like hardware or access.\n\n"
