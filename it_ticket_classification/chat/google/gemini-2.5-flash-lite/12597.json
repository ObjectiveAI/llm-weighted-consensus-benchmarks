The key words are: \"card\" and \"maternity leave\", which suggests either a need for \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access\" related to the employee's card. However, based on the provided schema, I'm leaning more towards **HR Support** as the primary category. Further analysis may be required to confirm or expand on this.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket's Scope**\n\nI'm now focusing on solidifying the reasoning behind the \"HR Support\" categorization. The ticket mentions \"card suspended due maternity leave,\" strongly linking the issue to an HR event. Though \"Access\" is relevant since the card is suspended, the core of the problem stems from the employee's maternity leave status. Therefore, the **HR Support** category best reflects the root cause and required resolution.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nNow I'm revisiting the initial categorization, ensuring \"HR Support\" remains the most accurate. The ticket's phrases, like \"card suspended due maternity leave,\" directly link the issue to an HR event. Though card access is impacted, the root cause is the HR-related status change. The other categories don't fully capture this core issue: access could be affected, and admin rights could change, but the core issue is an HR-related status change. The employee's maternity leave status necessitates HR intervention, making \"HR Support\" the most relevant category.\n\n\n"
