The text, seemingly full of \"kb\" references and quarantine terms, is throwing me. I'm leaning towards \"Storage\" due to the deletion and quarantine elements, but I'm hesitant to make a definitive call without more context. Need to carefully analyze the key terms to determine the most relevant classification among the options provided.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe keywords \"quarantine,\" \"deleted automatically,\" and \"log\" still point me strongly toward the \"Storage\" category. While \"Access\" could be a secondary consideration due to the potential access implications of quarantined items, the core issue seems to revolve around storage management and retention policies. The frequent mention of \"kb\" and the automatic deletion process further solidified my choice. I'm now certain this belongs under \"Storage.\"\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the categories again. The recurring keyword \"quarantine\" in combination with the phrase \"deleted automatically after days\" keeps leading me back to \"Storage.\" The \"change frequency\" element further reinforces this. It seems the main issue is a storage-related management policy concerning quarantined items, not necessarily access rights or HR support. After carefully comparing the options, \"Storage\" feels like the most accurate fit based on the dominant themes of data retention and management.\n\n\n"
