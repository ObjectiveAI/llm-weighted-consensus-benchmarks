The text \"intermittently losing access to and folders when\" strongly suggests an access-related issue. My thought process is narrowing the possible categories. \"Hardware\" seems unlikely, and \"HR Support\", \"Purchase\", and \"Internal Project\" definitely don't fit. I'm choosing \"Access\".\n\n\n**Revising Category Scope**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. While \"Storage\" seemed relevant, the core problem is access, not storage *per se*. The user can't *get to* the stored files. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" now. The user's inability to access files due to connectivity or permissions is more directly addressed by the access category. This feels like the right fit for the ticket.\n\n\n**Refining Category Choice**\n\nI'm solidifying my initial \"Access\" selection. The additional ticket text reinforces that access *itself* is the core problem, even if the files reside in storage. My thought process considered \"Storage\" momentarily, but the *act* of accessing, not just the physical location, demands the \"Access\" category. The remote work context further points to potential connectivity or permission issues.\n\n\n"
