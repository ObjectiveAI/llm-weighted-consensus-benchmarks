I'm double-checking the other categories to confirm this is the best fit.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Optimal Category**\n\nI've rigorously analyzed the IT ticket text, focusing on keywords and phrases. \"Purchase requisitions\" and the rejected \"second monitor\" request are central. After careful comparison with the category descriptions, I've confirmed that \"Purchase\" is the most accurate classification. I'm now certain this accurately reflects the ticket's primary concern.\n\n\n"
