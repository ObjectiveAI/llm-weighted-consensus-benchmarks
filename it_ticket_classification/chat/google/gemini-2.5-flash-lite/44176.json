I've narrowed it down to a few potential categories, but I am leaning towards 'Access' as the most appropriate classification. However, I want to carefully consider other possibilities before committing.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Request**\n\nI've determined that \"Access\" is the most accurate category for the IT ticket. While other categories were considered, the core request to change a password directly relates to user account access. I reviewed the available options and eliminated those that didn't align, concluding that this ticket's focus is fundamentally about access management.\n\n\n"
