My initial assessment leans towards \"Purchase\" due to mentions of \"purchased\" and \"notebook.\" I'm also considering potential overlaps with \"Hardware\" due to the mention of \"installation\". I'm still weighing the key terms against the schema's categories to definitively categorize it.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Classification**\n\nMy analysis now strongly suggests \"Hardware\" as the primary category, given the strong presence of \"notebook\" and the explicit request for installation. While \"Purchase\" is relevant due to the word, the emphasis on installation tips me towards a hardware-focused classification. I'm satisfied that \"Hardware\" best represents the core issue.\n\n\n**Solidifying Ticket Category**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's text, focusing on the \"installation\" request alongside the \"recently purchased notebook.\" While \"Purchase\" was initially considered, the request for installation makes \"Hardware\" the more fitting category. The mention of \"notebook\" solidifies this as a hardware-focused issue.\n\n\n"
