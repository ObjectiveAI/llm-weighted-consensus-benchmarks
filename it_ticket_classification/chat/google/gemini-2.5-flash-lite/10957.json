It involves a software tester requesting a new keyboard for their laptop due to intermittent functionality issues. I'm carefully considering the best category for this request, ensuring it's both accurate and efficient.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the IT ticket. It looks like the software tester is requesting a new, external keyboard for their laptop due to erratic behavior with the built-in keyboard. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category. The user's need for a keyboard directly points to a hardware component. While a purchase might be involved, the core issue is the need for the hardware itself. The request is less about making a purchase and more about securing a functioning input device.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Need**\n\nI've been honing in on the crucial element of this IT ticket. It involves a \"software tester\" needing an \"additional keyboard\" because their current one is \"not working properly sometimes\". Analyzing the categories, \"Hardware\" seems the most appropriate fit. The user's need for a keyboard points directly to a hardware component, even if a purchase might be necessary.\n\n\n"
