I've broken down \"free space on poll status down\" and \"increasing\" to ascertain the ticket's core issue. I'm leaning towards 'Storage' as the relevant category, given the keywords. I'm weighing this choice against the other options, ensuring the most accurate classification.\n\n\n**Categorizing Storage Concerns**\n\nI've examined the ticket details more closely, focusing on recurring keywords like \"partition,\" \"free space,\" and \"threshold.\" \"Storage\" appears to be the most fitting category, especially considering the symptoms described, which strongly point to a disk space issue. The phrases \"increasing partition\" and \"add more partition\" solidify this conclusion. I am confident in selecting \"Storage\" as the appropriate category.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Root Cause**\n\nI've dived into the ticket's language, identifying the critical issue: a storage capacity bottleneck. The phrases \"poll status down\", \"partition over threshold\", and \"clean partition\" strongly indicate a lack of available space. This suggests that the \"Storage\" category is undoubtedly the correct choice. I am confident that the current focus is accurate and relevant to a storage system's needs.\n\n\n"
