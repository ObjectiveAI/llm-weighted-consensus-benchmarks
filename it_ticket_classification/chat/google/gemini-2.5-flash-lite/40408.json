The keywords \"access,\" \"remotely,\" and \"working\" are standing out. I'm leaning towards categorizing this under \"Access\" but want to be absolutely sure before finalizing the label.\n\n\n**Focusing on Keywords**\n\nI've refined my approach to focus on the strongest keywords. The phrase \"needs access remotely\" is definitely the core. While I considered other possibilities, \"Access\" still aligns best with the essence of the ticket. I'm now certain this is the appropriate category.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe analysis is complete! I've confirmed that \"Access\" is the definitive category. My reasoning stemmed from the dominant phrase, \"needs access remotely\". This eliminated other options like Hardware, Storage, or HR Support. Although I considered \"Administrative rights\", the core issue points to a general need for remote access.\n\n\n"
