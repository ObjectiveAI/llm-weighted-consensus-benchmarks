I'm analyzing the ticket's content, starting with \"le\".\n\n**Sorting IT Tickets**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the provided ticket to determine its most suitable category. My current focus is on interpreting keywords related to employee departures to align with available options like \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access\" and \"Storage\".\n\n**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI've been evaluating the ticket's content, specifically focusing on keywords indicating employee departure. My analysis points towards \"HR Support\" as the most encompassing category, though elements of \"Access\" and \"Storage\" are also present within the offboarding process.\n\n**Categorizing IT Tickets**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the provided IT ticket, focusing on keywords related to employee offboarding. My current task involves identifying the most suitable category from the given list, with \"HR Support\" appearing to be the most appropriate fit for the described leaver process.\n\n**Processing Offboarding Details**\n\nI'm currently reviewing the details of an employee's departure. My primary focus is on categorizing the associated IT tasks, and \"HR Support\" appears to be the most fitting designation given the comprehensive nature of the offboarding actions described.\n\n"
