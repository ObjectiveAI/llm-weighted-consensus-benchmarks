My current categorization leans heavily towards \"HR Support.\" I'm also considering the possibility of an \"Access\" issue, depending on what the \"sheet\" entails.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI'm now fully confident that the ticket falls under \"HR Support.\" It seems the user is having trouble with a document requiring their line manager's approval. While \"Access\" had initial consideration, the context of a \"sheet\" and \"submission\" firmly places this within an HR workflow, rather than a system access problem. The other categories are simply irrelevant.\n\n\n"
