The phrases \"buyer role list\" and \"buyer roles employees marked\" strongly suggest this ticket pertains to either \"Access\" or potentially \"HR Support.\" I'm weighing these options carefully, focusing on whether it's an access request or related to employee roles.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've honed in on the ticket's core issue: access management. The phrases regarding \"buyer role list\" and employees' \"buyer roles\" solidify the \"Access\" category. The mention of a \"requested report\" further reinforces this. I've dismissed HR Support as the primary driver and confidently categorized the ticket as \"Access\".\n\n\n"
