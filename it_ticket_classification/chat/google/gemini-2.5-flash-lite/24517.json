Currently, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" because the text mentions \"contract management access.\" The user is requesting access to a tool, and that seems to be the main issue. However, I am still reevaluating this.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the core issue**\n\nI've carefully re-examined the ticket text and the available categories. \"Access\" still feels like the most accurate choice. I am thinking that the request for \"tool creation view\" seems focused on permission, confirming that the ticket is about gaining access. The term \"Oracle\" in this context points to system access as well. I'm focusing my thoughts now on confirming this before moving on.\n\n\n**Finalizing category choice**\n\nAfter reviewing the available options and my previous analysis, I am now confident that \"Access\" is the best fit. I've considered all angles and believe this category accurately reflects the user's primary need, which is gaining access to a tool for contract management. I have successfully analyzed the text and am ready to output the final categorization as a JSON object.\n\n\n"
