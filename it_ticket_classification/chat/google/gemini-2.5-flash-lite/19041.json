My initial instinct is leaning towards \"HR Support\" due to the mention of a \"people manager\" and employee-related changes. I'm carefully reviewing the keywords, weighing them against other possible categories to ensure the most accurate classification. The limited context makes it a nuanced decision.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI've just finished analyzing the ticket text and determined the most appropriate category is \"HR Support.\" The phrase \"people manager change\" was the key indicator, strongly aligning with HR functions. While other categories were considered, none fit as directly. I'm now structuring this categorization as a JSON object, ready for the next step.\n\n\n**Classifying the Ticket**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content, focusing on the phrase \"people manager change.\" This central element dictates an \"HR Support\" category.  Despite some less relevant text, the core request is clearly HR-related, not pertaining to hardware, access, storage, purchases, projects, or administrative rights. I'm now formatting the classification into a JSON object, as requested.\n\n\n"
