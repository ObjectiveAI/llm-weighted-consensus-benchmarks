The key is to match the text to an allowed category. I've got a short list to pick from: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\". So far, the text seems to be about weather or alerts of some kind, and doesn't obviously fit into these categories. I am considering the \"Miscellaneous\" category as a last resort, if none of the others are a good fit. I may need to request more clarification.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket text, \"snow warnings february pm snow warnings hello please warning received by also by thank ext,\" and it's clear that it concerns weather alerts. None of the pre-defined categories like Hardware, HR Support, or Access are suitable. I've concluded that \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit, as the ticket doesn't relate to standard IT issues.\n\n\n"
