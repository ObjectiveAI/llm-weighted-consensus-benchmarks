The \"attachment exceeds limit\" part points toward a potential \"Storage\" issue, perhaps related to file size restrictions. There are several other possibilities, but this seems most probable. I need to make a final decision, though.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've considered all the evidence and confidently settled on \"Storage\" as the proper classification. The evidence of file size restrictions is undeniable, therefore this decision is final.\n\n\n"
