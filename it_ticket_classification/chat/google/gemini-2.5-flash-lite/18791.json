It looks like it could be related to access or mobile cards, but I need to be sure.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Request**\n\nI've been analyzing the IT ticket text, focusing on keywords to determine the correct category. \"Remove from all staff\" and \"sign out\" are leading me towards an HR-related issue concerning employee lifecycle. While \"mobile card\" suggests hardware or access, the broader implications of the phrases point to HR. I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the primary category, but I still need to consider if \"Access\" is a closer fit, as it could be about managing access permissions.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR and Access**\n\nI'm now focusing on the nuances between HR support and access-related categories, given the ticket text. The repeated mention of \"mobil card\" still makes me pause, as this could be hardware or access-related. However, \"remove from all staff\" remains the central action. While it *could* mean changing hardware permissions, it seems more likely that the primary goal is related to employee offboarding. Therefore, HR support is still my primary focus, but a secondary consideration of access-related tasks is also reasonable.\n\n\n**Solidifying HR as Primary Focus**\n\nI'm now focusing on the phrase \"remove from all staff,\" which still strongly indicates an HR-related action, specifically managing staff departures. The context of a \"campaign\" might relate to a project ending, prompting a coordinated offboarding.  \"Mobile card\" likely represents an asset being returned during this process. Therefore, I'm confident that \"HR Support\" remains the primary category, with the possibility of \"Access\" playing a secondary role regarding permission revocation.\n\n\n"
