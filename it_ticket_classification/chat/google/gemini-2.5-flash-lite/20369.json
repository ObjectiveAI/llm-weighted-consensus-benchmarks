The text suggests a problem with shared mailbox access across multiple PCs. There seems to be an existing configuration that works on one machine but fails on others, leading to an error. I'm carefully analyzing the provided text, looking for keywords that will help me choose the correct category.\n\n\n**Focusing on Access Issues**\n\nI've determined that \"Access\" is the most fitting category for the IT ticket. Analyzing the keywords, \"access\" and \"shared mailbox\" are the most prominent. Though permissions might be relevant, the core issue is gaining access to the mailbox from specific PCs, aligning with access control concerns. I've ruled out hardware, HR, storage, purchase, projects, and administrative rights because the user's issue doesn't match the definitions.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI've zeroed in on the central issue: access. The ticket's repeated mention of \"shared mailbox\" and the contrasting behavior across different PCs clearly point to an access problem. I've ruled out hardware, HR, storage, purchase, projects, and administrative rights because the issue revolves specifically around getting to the shared mailbox. The keyword \"access\" is repeatedly used, solidifying its importance. My current categorization centers around that core element.\n\n\n"
