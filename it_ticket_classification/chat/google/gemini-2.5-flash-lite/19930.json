I'm leaning towards \"Access\" but I am still evaluating the available options.\n\n\n**Deciding the Ticket Type**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the \"joining,\" \"contractual agreement,\" and \"persons recently left\" are leading me towards an \"HR Support\" categorization. It seems the request is related to onboarding, or covering for departing staff. \"Access\" is still in the mix, but \"HR Support\" appears a stronger fit for now.\n\n\n**Evaluating Category Choice**\n\nI've re-evaluated the categorization and, after considering the implications of \"joining,\" \"contractual agreement,\" and \"persons recently left,\" I am confident in selecting \"HR Support.\" It aligns with onboarding or covering for departing staff. \"Access\" is no longer a viable option due to the new information uncovered. The analysis continues, but \"HR Support\" appears the correct category.\n\n\n"
