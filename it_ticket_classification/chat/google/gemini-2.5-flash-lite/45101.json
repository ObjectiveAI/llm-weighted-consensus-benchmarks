My analysis so far has revealed that the ticket text mentions \"annual leave days,\" which indicates a possible HR-related issue. My focus is now on the specific context of the \"annual leave days\" to clarify the ticket's nature.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted towards the specific nature of the \"annual leave days\" mentioned in the ticket.  The ticket concerns the visibility of these days, clearly pointing toward an employee leave tracking issue. I am now confident that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category, based on this definitive clue.\n\n\n"
