The \"oracle time card issue,\" the mention of \"annual leave,\" and \"work entries\" point towards something HR related, not strictly hardware, storage, or purchase. \"Access\" also seems less relevant given the context. I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" or maybe a \"Miscellaneous\" catch-all if it's not a standard leave request. This one's tricky!\n\n\n**Defining the Issue's Scope**\n\nI'm solidifying my assessment. \"Oracle time card issue,\" \"annual leave,\" \"work entries,\" \"working days,\" \"vacation,\" \"rejected card,\" and \"double entries\" all scream HR, not hardware or access. The ticket's all about time and leave, so \"HR Support\" appears the definitive fit. I feel confident about that categorization now.\n\n\n"
