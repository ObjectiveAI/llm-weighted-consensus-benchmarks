The words suggest communication, perhaps hinting at an \"Access\" issue. However, \"remove\" and the context around \"hired\" is making me lean towards a \"HR Support\" issue, though it isn't completely certain. I need to balance the clues and think if there is a primary intention. I'm focusing on the context given.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Issues**\n\nI've decided to proceed with \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category. The text's focus on removing someone due to a new hire strongly suggests personnel changes, an area that falls squarely within HR's purview. I've ruled out \"Access\" as the system access is not explicitly referenced. All the other potential categories are clearly irrelevant. The context of personnel changes strongly implies HR Support, so this is my final decision.\n\n\n"
