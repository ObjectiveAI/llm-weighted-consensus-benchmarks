I'm open to reconsidering if new information emerges.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Garbled Text**\n\nI'm continuing to wrestle with the categorization. The garbled text, \"request for info friday pm re ca dear please let owner simplify word owner beforehand maybe needs done order delete thank friday ca ca observant ca face parte el discipline lead,\" is a real challenge. While none of the explicit categories seem appropriate, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Miscellaneous\" at this stage. The request is ambiguous and doesn't align with hardware, HR, access, storage, or purchase.\n\n\n**Reaching a Conclusion**\n\nI've carefully considered the given text and the available categories. Despite the lack of clarity in the ticket, I'm now firmly convinced \"Miscellaneous\" is the most fitting. None of the other categories, such as Hardware, HR, Access, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project or Administrative Rights, are relevant given the ambiguous and disjointed nature of the request.\n\n\n"
