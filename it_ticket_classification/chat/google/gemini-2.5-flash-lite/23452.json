The keywords \"leave\" and \"blocked\" are guiding my analysis. Currently, I'm leaning toward either HR Support or Access, but further review is needed to make a final determination based on the context.\n\n\n**Categorizing Leave Issue**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the IT ticket's content, focusing on leave-related processes. Keywords like \"cancel,\" \"approve,\" and \"pending\" are central to my categorization efforts. Based on this information, I'm confident that the ticket should be assigned to HR Support, given the clear focus on leave management and approval workflows.\n\n\n**Defining HR Support Issue**\n\nI'm deep into the analysis, focusing on the ticket details to nail down the problem's scope. The phrases \"cancel requests pending,\" \"leave request blocked,\" and \"approve help\" highlight the central theme. Given the emphasis on leave, cancellations, and approvals, I'm now certain this issue aligns most closely with HR Support.\n\n\n"
