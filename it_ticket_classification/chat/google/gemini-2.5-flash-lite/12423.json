Given the text describing sharing map documentation, it seems like **Storage** is the most relevant. I'm hesitant, as \"Internal Project\" could also be a possibility if the maps are part of a project, but I'm leaning towards \"Storage\" due to the sharing aspect.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Options**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the best category for this ticket. While \"Storage\" initially seemed likely, the \"Internal Project\" option is now looking more fitting. The core is sharing project-related documentation. I'm hesitant to use \"Miscellaneous\" as I want to be specific, and the ticket's about sharing docs related to a project or internal work process, rather than broad storage. The key is in sharing documentation, related to a project.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Project Context**\n\nI've been drilling down on this ticket. The terms \"map documentation\" and \"map reconciliation document\" plus \"July PM\" all scream *project*. Document sharing is the core request, but the project context is now the most important consideration. It's leaning strongly towards \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Purpose**\n\nOkay, I'm now certain that the ticket's about a project-related document share. The specifics of \"map documentation\" and \"map reconciliation document\", combined with \"July PM\", solidify \"Internal Project\". The \"sharing\" action isn't about setting up access necessarily, but facilitating document exchange *within* a project context. This makes Internal Project more accurate than simply \"Access\".\n\n\n"
