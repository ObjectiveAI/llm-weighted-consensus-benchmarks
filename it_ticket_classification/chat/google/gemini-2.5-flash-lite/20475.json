My task is to assign it to one of the predefined categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. The description is quite brief, so I'm focusing on inferring the most likely need.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm weighing the \"new starter\" context against explicit \"equipment\" requests. Given the mention of a large screen and phone, \"Hardware\" seems the most fitting IT-centric category, though the onboarding aspect could initially suggest HR.\n\n**Finalizing Category Assignment**\n\nI've decided that \"Hardware\" is the most accurate classification for this new starter's IT ticket. The explicit mention of a large screen and phone equipment solidifies this choice, outweighing the general onboarding context.\n\n"
