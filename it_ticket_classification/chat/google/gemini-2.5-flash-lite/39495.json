The phrases \"mailbox is almost full,\" \"maximize space memory,\" \"reduce your mailbox size,\" and \"delete any items\" keep popping up. It's becoming evident that the user is dealing with an issue related to email storage limitations. My aim now is to pinpoint the exact category that best fits this specific technical hurdle.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Context**\n\nI've determined the correct category based on the ticket's language. The user's prompts definitively point to storage issues. After weighing the options, \"Storage\" is the only truly viable selection. My next step will be to confirm this classification and see what the user wants to do.\n\n\n"
