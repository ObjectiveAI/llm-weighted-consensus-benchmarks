After analyzing the keywords, \"phone replacement\" and \"broken phone,\" I've determined it's likely a Hardware issue. I'm hesitant to make a final decision, but Hardware seems to be the most appropriate category.\n\n\n**Confirming Hardware Category**\n\nI've examined the ticket text thoroughly, including phrases like \"phone replacement\" and \"broken phone\", and considered all provided categories. I'm now certain that \"Hardware\" is the correct classification. The focus on a physical device, specifically the phone, aligns perfectly with this category. I've ruled out other possibilities like HR support, access, and miscellaneous, which do not address the central issue.\n\n\n"
