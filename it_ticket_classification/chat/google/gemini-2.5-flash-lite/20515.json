Based on my initial assessment, the phrase \"port channel\" and \"switch\" strongly suggest a technical issue related to network infrastructure.  The direct connection aspect further points toward a potential hardware or configuration problem.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket's Scope**\n\nI'm deep in the analysis, taking in phrases like \"change required,\" \"shared infra,\" \"outage expected,\" \"downtime,\" \"bandwidth throughput,\" and \"link requirement\" alongside \"port channel.\" It's becoming clearer this is about network infrastructure alterations, involving switches and their connectivity. The focus is on the hardware's operational change more than anything else. I'm converging on a solid hardware-related classification.\n\n\n"
