The text, particularly mentioning \"re password changed\" and \"administrator interface,\" has led me to strongly consider the \"Administrative rights\" category. I am still looking over the possible options and considering their semantic nuances in relation to the text.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've honed in on \"Administrative rights\" as the best fit for this ticket. The phrases \"re password changed,\" \"administrator interface,\" and \"administrator\" are definitive signals. While other categories were considered, none truly capture the core issue as directly. The language strongly suggests a problem rooted in privileged access.\n\n\n"
