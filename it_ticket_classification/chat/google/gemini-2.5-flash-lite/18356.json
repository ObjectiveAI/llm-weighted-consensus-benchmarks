Based on the words \"internal\" and \"allocation,\" I think this likely falls under \"Internal Project\" due to the project-oriented language. However, the short and incomplete nature of the provided text makes it tricky.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Options**\n\nI'm now weighing the \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" categories. \"Internal Project\" seems less likely as the project is not explicitly described. The ticket's focus seems to revolve around a phone number change triggered by an employee leaving. Both \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" appear relevant due to the \"phone\" mention and the \"leaver\" context.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've been going back and forth, but I've landed on \"HR Support.\" While \"Hardware\" is tempting due to the phone aspect, the strong \"leaver\" context and the \"transfer\" of the phone number strongly suggest this is an HR-initiated change.  The ticket likely pertains to the de-provisioning or re-provisioning of the phone as part of a departing employee process.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Selection**\n\nI'm now completely confident that \"HR Support\" is the correct category for this ticket. My reasoning has solidified, focusing on the \"leaver\" context as the primary trigger, with the phone-related aspects being a consequence of this HR process. The phone allocation and installation tasks are clearly part of a larger, HR-driven workflow. The ticket text strongly suggests IT is fulfilling an HR-initiated action related to a departing employee. The initial hesitation is resolved; this request is a direct consequence of an HR process.\n\n\n**Revisiting the Context**\n\nMy initial inclination toward HR Support, driven by the \"leaver\" context, remains. While the \"phone\" aspect introduces a hardware element, it's clear the underlying *reason* for the IT task is an HR-initiated change.  The ticket represents IT fulfilling an HR-driven request, making \"HR Support\" the most accurate categorization. I am confident in this classification.\n\n\n"
