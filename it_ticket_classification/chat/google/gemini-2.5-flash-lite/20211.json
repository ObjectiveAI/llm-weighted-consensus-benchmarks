I'm leaning toward either \"Internal Project\" or \"Administrative Rights,\" as those seem most aligned with task scheduling and assignment. I'm carefully weighing which is the better fit based on the specific implications for task assignments.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Topic**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket description thoroughly, focusing on the core activities mentioned: \"unload tapes,\" \"load tapes,\" and \"backup tapes,\" along with \"daily summaries.\" These key phrases strongly indicate a data storage and retrieval focus. The emphasis on operational tasks further solidified the decision to categorize it under \"Storage.\" I'm confident that this accurately reflects the underlying issue.\n\n\n"
