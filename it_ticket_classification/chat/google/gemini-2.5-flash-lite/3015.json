After analyzing the provided content, which mentions \"maternity leave\" and \"access card,\" I'm leaning heavily towards the \"Access\" category. The presence of those keywords suggests an access-related issue.\n\n\n**Revising Ticket Classification**\n\nAfter a deeper dive, I'm adjusting my initial instinct. While the ticket touches on access, the core issue stems from an HR event: a return from maternity leave. This necessitates an access card reactivation. The presence of the \"access card enabling\" text misled me slightly; upon reflection, HR support seems the most accurate category, as the access request is a direct consequence of an HR process.\n\n\n**Confirming Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've finalized my assessment of the ticket. After careful re-evaluation of the key phrases like \"return from maternity leave\" and \"access card,\" I'm confident in selecting \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category. The access request, while present, is a direct consequence of an HR event. The ticket's content highlights the need to re-enable access upon someone's return from leave, placing the primary focus on the underlying HR process, even though a physical access card is involved.\n\n\n"
