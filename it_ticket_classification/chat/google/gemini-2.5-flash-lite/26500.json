My primary task involves mapping the ticket's details to one of several predefined categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative Rights. I'm carefully analyzing the text to discern the most appropriate category.\n\n\n**Analyzing HR-related Tickets**\n\nI've been intensively analyzing this ticket text and I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\". The recurring themes of timekeeping, employee records, leave (maternity/absence), and updating person records strongly suggest an HR-related issue. The repetition in the ticket actually reinforces this conclusion, making me even more certain in my assessment.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm now fully confident in classifying this ticket as \"HR Support\". The recurring themes related to employee records, timekeeping, leave, and process adherence strongly confirm this classification. The text clearly indicates employee-centric issues, aligning perfectly with the HR Support category.\n\n\n"
