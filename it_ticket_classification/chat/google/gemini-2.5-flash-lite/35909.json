Given the details of \"missing timecards,\" \"annual leave,\" and \"submitted,\" I'm leaning toward the \"HR Support\" category, as these are all people-related administrative tasks.\n\n\n**Confirming HR as the Focus**\n\nI'm confident in HR Support being the right category. The evidence of timecard issues, leave requests, and submission processes firmly anchors this ticket within HR's domain. Access might be a secondary factor, but the core issue is the process and the missing inputs.\n\n\n**Clarifying HR's Centrality**\n\nI've further refined my assessment. While access might be relevant, I now believe the fundamental issue is HR-related, focusing on timecards, leave, and submission procedures. These directly fall under HR Support, and the \"missing\" elements strongly point to an HR process problem, not an access one.\n\n\n"
