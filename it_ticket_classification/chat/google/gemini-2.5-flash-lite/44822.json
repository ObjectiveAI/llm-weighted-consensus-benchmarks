The repeated emphasis on \"access rights\" and the inability to \"enter forecast data\" directly points to a permissions-related issue.\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's content, and the recurring theme of \"access rights\" and being \"prevented from entering\" data solidifies my decision. The \"Access\" category is the most precise fit for this specific issue.\n\n"
