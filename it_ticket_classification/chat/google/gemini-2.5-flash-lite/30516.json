The provided text is sparse, making it tricky. I'm carefully analyzing the keywords to see if I can discern any clear indicators, so that the categorisation process will be accurate.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR Alignment**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the HR Support category. The phrase \"annual adjustment\" strongly points towards employee-related processes, which is a key indicator. The text implies the management and modification of user accounts within the context of an annual process, which aligns well with HR system interactions and user role updates. While Access is a possible secondary concern, I'm leaning toward HR Support as the primary category, given the nature of the request.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've rigorously analyzed the provided text and considered each available category. The phrases \"annual adjustment\" and \"users move\" are the key drivers for my categorization. These concepts point directly toward employee management and user account adjustments that are likely HR-related. I believe \"HR Support\" is the most accurate classification. While access management might be involved as a consequence, the core request seems centered around the yearly updates and user transitions driven by HR changes. My analysis firmly supports this selection.\n\n\n"
