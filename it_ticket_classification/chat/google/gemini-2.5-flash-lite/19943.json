I've selected \"Miscellaneous\" as the most fitting designation for this process-oriented issue.\n\n**Selecting Category**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket details, focusing on the complex interplay of CAB approvals, change request statuses, and subject line customizations. After careful consideration, I've determined that \"Miscellaneous\" best encapsulates this process-oriented issue, as it doesn't align with the more specialized categories available.\n\n"
