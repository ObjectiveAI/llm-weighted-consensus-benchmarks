I'm now evaluating how to handle more nuanced cases, such as tickets mentioning \"forms\" which might require access but could also fall under \"HR Support\". I'm also exploring a weighting system for keywords to improve precision.\n\n\n**Evaluating Categorization Refinement**\n\nI've been honing my classification logic, primarily focusing on assigning the ticket to \"Access\". Given the keywords, this appears the most suitable. I've now integrated a priority scoring mechanism and am considering how to improve it. I'm trying to fine-tune the keyword weights to enhance accuracy, especially for ambiguous terms, such as \"forms\" or \"head\". I believe I've made significant progress, yet I'll be revisiting this ticket.\n\n\n**Refining Access Allocation**\n\nI'm now evaluating more complex cases in the ticket classification process. I'm focusing on tickets requesting access to a bid vault, which is clearly access-related. I believe \"Access\" remains the most precise category. I'm also considering other keywords, specifically to enhance the allocation.\n\n\n"
