The core issue is a request for a \"second monitor.\" That definitely points toward a hardware need. The user's role, \"software engineer,\" doesn't change the hardware focus. So, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Hardware\" as the primary category. It's a clear-cut case. I'll need to double-check that this option is the best fit within the provided options.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Choice**\n\nNow that I've settled on \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category, I'm confirming that the provided options don't have a more precise fit. \"Purchase\" remains a possibility, but the core need is the hardware itself, not the procurement process. The ticket is about *getting* a monitor, not the buying of it. I'm satisfied that \"Hardware\" is the most direct and accurate categorization for this specific request. This wraps up this stage.\n\n\n"
