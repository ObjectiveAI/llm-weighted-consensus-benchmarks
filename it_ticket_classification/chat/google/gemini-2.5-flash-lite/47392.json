The user mentions they can access the site, so it may not be a simple access issue. I'm considering Hardware, Access, and Storage as the most relevant initial categories, but I'll need more detail to be certain.\n\n\n**Defining the Problem Space**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"oracle not working\" statement as the central concern. The user can access the site, but encounters an error afterward. This suggests the issue isn't basic site access, but more likely a functional problem within the Oracle application or service. It's likely related to either \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" but the exact cause remains unclear.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've revised my understanding of the issue. The initial access works, but an error occurs afterward, pointing to a functional Oracle problem. While \"Access\" could fit if it relates to using the software's features, \"Miscellaneous\" seems safer, given the lack of specific error details. This general category can encompass various software malfunctions that aren't clearly hardware, HR, purchase, or project-related.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI'm now focusing on the \"not working\" aspect, post-login. The phrase \"lets access site but than get following error\" is central. Initial access works, suggesting a problem with Oracle's functionality or permissions. While \"Access\" could fit, \"Miscellaneous\" seems safer without specific error details. This catch-all can encompass various software malfunctions.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe problem's about the \"oracle not working\" error post-login, indicating a functional issue. I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous,\" as it's a general software problem. While \"Access\" could fit, \"Miscellaneous\" is safer, given the lack of specific error details and the problem's post-login nature.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus remains on the \"oracle not working\" error post-login, indicating a functional issue, not basic site access. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Miscellaneous\" as a general category for this software problem. While \"Access\" could be relevant if it relates to using the software's features, the lack of specific error details makes \"Miscellaneous\" safer, as it encompasses various software malfunctions not clearly tied to hardware or other specific categories.\n\n\n"
