The key words indicate issues relating to time tracking, specifically regarding the \"missing time sheets view oracle\" and manual checking. \"Feature working\" is ambiguous. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"HR Support\", but need to weigh the Oracle reference carefully.\n\n\n**Categorizing Time Tracking Issue**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket details and the provided categories. The focus remains on categorizing the IT ticket, specifically weighing the \"HR Support\" option. While \"Access\" wasn't a direct fit, \"HR Support\" aligns better due to the timesheet-related nature of the problem and the potential Oracle integration. The user's request, likely about viewing or fixing time tracking issues, points strongly toward this HR function. I'm finalizing my decision, leaning toward \"HR Support\".\n\n\n**Deciding HR Ticket Category**\n\nI've continued to refine my categorization. Based on the ticket details, it's clear the issue stems from time sheet functionality, firmly placing it in HR's domain. The Oracle connection further strengthens this argument. While it's tempting to think about internal projects, \"HR Support\" captures the core of the problem: time tracking and its integration with the HR system. I'm finalizing this choice, and feel confident it accurately reflects the user's issue.\n\n\n"
