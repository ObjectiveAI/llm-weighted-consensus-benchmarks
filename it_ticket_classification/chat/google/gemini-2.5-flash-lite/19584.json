The request explicitly mentions \"root\" and \"backup\" partitions and \"monitoring\". My initial instinct leans toward Storage, but the lack of direct purchase or HR-related keywords warrants a second look. Extending the root partition also seems related to storage, but the focus on monitoring is crucial.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus remains firmly on Storage, given the consistent keywords. \"Partition\" and \"extend\" keep popping up. Analyzing the ticket text, the phrases \"root size avail\" and \"boot mapper\" clearly support the storage classification. The \"monitoring\" element suggests a potential overlap with Infrastructure, but fundamentally it all leads back to disk management.\n\n\n"
