Currently leaning towards \"Access\" due to the mention of guest connections and login issues. I'm carefully weighing this against other possibilities, like \"HR Support\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but the access-related keywords are standing out. I'll need to confirm this with the user to proceed.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Scope**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket content and considered the available categories. It seems the core problem revolves around guest network connectivity, likely due to a router malfunction. While \"Access\" could apply, the \"Hardware\" or a potential \"Network\" category would be a stronger fit if available. Considering the urgency, I will categorize this under the most relevant option: \"Hardware,\" due to the router issue.\n\n\n**Refining Category Choice**\n\nI'm now certain the ticket belongs under \"Hardware.\" The focus on the router and the guests' inability to connect directly points to this. I re-evaluated \"Access,\" but the root issue is the broken hardware, not a permission problem. The priority is to repair the router to restore service.\n\n\n"
