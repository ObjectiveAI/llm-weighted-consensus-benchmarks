The description \"leaver december\" is my primary clue.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket description \"leaver december\" to assign it to the most fitting category from the list provided. My current focus is on the implications of an employee's departure on IT resources.\n\n**Processing Leaver Request**\n\nI'm currently reviewing the provided \"leaver december\" ticket details. My analysis strongly suggests categorizing this as an \"Access\" issue due to the numerous references to account deactivation, mailbox management, and rights adjustments for departing personnel.\n\n**Managing User Access**\n\nI've completed my analysis of the \"leaver december\" ticket. Based on the detailed notes concerning account deactivation, mailbox management, and rights removal, I've confidently categorized this as an \"Access\" issue.\n\n"
