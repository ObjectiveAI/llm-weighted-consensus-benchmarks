The text, \"monitor risers friday november pm pal monitor risers hello please log install recently purchased mounts,\" seems to point towards a \"Hardware\" issue, specifically related to monitor mounts. I'm exploring if there are any subtle clues for alternative categorizations, but the hardware focus is the most prominent.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choices**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the categorization based on the expanded text. While \"Hardware\" remains a strong contender due to the physical components and installation aspect, the phrase \"recently purchased\" now has me considering \"Purchase\" as a potential primary category. The issue of adjustable height problems suggests a troubleshooting request associated with the new equipment, so \"Hardware\" or perhaps a combination seems logical. I'm leaning towards focusing on the *resolution* of the height problem now.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted again to the core of the problem. While initially considering \"Purchase\", the context of \"install\" and \"adjustable height issues\" firmly roots this ticket in \"Hardware\". The \"recently purchased\" aspect is now seen as a detail in the broader \"Hardware\" concern. I'm confident in refining the categorization.\n\n\n"
