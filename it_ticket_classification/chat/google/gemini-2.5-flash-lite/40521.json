Given the mentions of \"network issues,\" \"bad connection through cable,\" and a request to \"connect through cable,\" it strongly suggests a hardware-related problem, potentially with the network interface or cabling. The detail about the \"laptop quite old\" further reinforces a hardware focus.\n\n**Refining the Category**\n\nI'm leaning towards categorizing this ticket as \"Hardware.\" The focus on network connection issues, specifically through a cable, and the mention of an older laptop strongly suggest a physical component problem rather than an access or HR matter.\n\n**Identifying the Core Issue**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the core of the IT ticket. The user is experiencing \"network issues\" and connectivity problems via cable, specifically mentioning their \"laptop quite old\" and that the ticket was \"raised for laptop.\" This strongly suggests a hardware-related issue with the user's device impacting network performance, or potentially a localized network problem where the laptop is used. My focus is on distinguishing between a general network infrastructure problem versus a specific hardware or device-level fault.\n\n**Resolving Network Woes**\n\nI'm currently narrowing down the most appropriate category for this IT ticket. My analysis of the user's feedback, particularly \"network issues,\" \"bad connection through cable,\" and the explicit mention of their \"laptop quite old,\" strongly points towards a hardware-related problem. This isn't about system access or an HR matter, but rather a potential fault with the device's network interface or cabling.\n\n"
