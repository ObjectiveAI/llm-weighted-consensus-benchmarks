It's proving tricky, as the user mentions a password change, an error, and general login difficulties. I'm focusing on the keywords, like \"unable to log,\" \"invalid password,\" and \"workstation.\" I'm weighing whether this is a password reset, an account issue, or something else entirely.\n\n\n**Categorizing Login Problems**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Access\" as the most likely category for this ServiceNow login issue. While the user's password works elsewhere, the ticket explicitly highlights an inability to access ServiceNow after a password change, receiving \"invalid name or password\" error. I've ruled out hardware, HR, storage, and purchasing options and am leaning towards an account issue tied to ServiceNow's access control.\n\n\n**Determining Access Problems**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's details. The user's issue with ServiceNow access, despite successful login elsewhere, pointed me towards \"Access.\" I analyzed the specific error message and cross-referenced it with the limited scope of the password reset; while an account lockout is possible, the details suggest an application access problem. This is further reinforced by the workstation logins succeeding.\n\n\n"
