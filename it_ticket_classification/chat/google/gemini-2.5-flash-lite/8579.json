My focus is on identifying keywords and recurring phrases within the user's request to align it with available options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, or Purchase.\n\n**Determining Project Codes**\n\nI'm trying to classify this ticket. The text is a bit jumbled with repeated phrases like \"subtype change\" and mentions of \"project\" and \"codes.\" I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the most fitting category, given the explicit mention of \"project,\" though the request's core seems to be about code modification.\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm currently focusing on the ambiguous phrasing \"subtype change\" and \"change sub type code.\" While \"Internal Project\" was initially considered due to the mention of \"project,\" the repetitive emphasis on changing codes and subtypes suggests a more general classification may be needed if it doesn't directly map to project management itself.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Context**\n\nI'm currently assessing the ticket's content, focusing on the repetitive phrases \"subtype change\" and \"change sub type code\" alongside the mention of \"project.\" My analysis suggests \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting category, as the word \"project\" directly appears and likely provides the overarching context for the requested code modification.\n\n"
