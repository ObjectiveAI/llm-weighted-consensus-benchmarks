My task is to assign it to one of the predefined categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. I'm reviewing the provided text to pinpoint the most accurate classification.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm processing the ticket's description to accurately assign it to one of the predefined categories. My current focus is on extracting keywords and context clues to determine if it pertains to Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights.\n\n**Categorizing Document Access Issues**\n\nI've refined my understanding of the ticket's core problem. It's not a simple hardware failure or HR request; the central theme revolves around difficulties in accessing specific documents due to certificate validation errors and browser compatibility. This points strongly towards an \"Access\" category.\n\n**Confirming Document Access Issue**\n\nI've finalized my assessment. The ticket clearly describes difficulties in accessing and previewing documents due to certificate errors and browser incompatibilities. This definitively places it within the \"Access\" category, as the core problem is the inability to reach the intended content.\n\n"
