The user's input, particularly keywords like \"leaver\" and \"interns,\" strongly suggests an \"HR Support\" category, which is the most probable based on the keywords. I'm building a more robust matching logic to handle similar cases effectively, expanding my lexicon, and refining categorization for similar tickets. I plan to extend the keywords with synonyms for better accuracy.\n\n\n**Evaluating Category Options**\n\nMy analysis continues with a close look at the provided categories. I'm prioritizing \"HR Support\" because the ticket's core issue revolves around \"leaver\" and \"intern\" processing, even though \"disable cards\" initially suggested \"Access.\" I'm also carefully considering the other categories, however, discarding some, such as \"Hardware\", as being irrelevant to the core issue. I'm focusing on \"HR\" to make a firm classification.\n\n\n**Analyzing Category Fit**\n\nMy focus is narrowing on the best category for this ticket. The keywords \"leaver\" and \"interns\" persistently point me toward \"HR Support\". While \"disable cards\" initially suggested \"Access,\" the context of the issue - an employee leaving - makes HR Support a more complete fit. I am now confirming my initial categorization as I review the ticket text, confirming that the \"disable cards\" action is a result of the HR process surrounding employee departures.\n\n\n"
