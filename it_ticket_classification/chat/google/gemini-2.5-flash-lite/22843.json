I'm building a robust system that can infer the correct category even with vague descriptions.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've honed in on the ticket's core issue: user access. My analysis of \"make ad user named created evening alias order log tickets\" reinforced my \"Access\" assignment, confirming the focus is on user account management. This reinforces the choice of \"Access\" as the fitting category.\n\n\n"
