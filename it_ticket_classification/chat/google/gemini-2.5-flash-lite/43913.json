I'll need to look at more to be sure but the initial reading of it points in those directions.\n\n\n**Defining the Problem**\n\nI've carefully reviewed the ticket text to determine its appropriate category. The phrases \"issues when logging onto his machine,\" \"issue accessing his machine,\" and \"seems be locked out\" all strongly suggest an access problem. Therefore, after careful analysis, \"Access\" appears to be the most fitting category for this IT ticket.\n\n\n"
