It seems \"new starter,\" \"Colombia,\" and \"compliance officer\" are important. I'm building a system to map these to predefined categories, prioritizing high-impact terms.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Categories**\n\nI've refined the categorization focus. My analysis now leans toward \"HR Support\" as the primary category, driven by the strong presence of \"new starter\" and \"joining\" keywords. \"Access\" remains a secondary consideration. I'm prioritizing direct indicators of onboarding over less relevant terms like location. The plan is to create a dynamic mapping system that considers these factors.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nI've shifted focus to defining the most appropriate IT category. While onboarding is clearly indicated, I've decided \"Access\" is more specific and directly relates to the necessary IT tasks for a \"new starter\". This includes account setup, software access, and potentially network access. Considering the limited information, \"Access\" best encapsulates the immediate IT requirements.\n\n\n**Defining IT Category Again**\n\nI'm now prioritizing \"Access\" as the central category, given the clear \"new starter\" context. The ticket aims at granting account access and setting up the user for work. \"HR Support\" doesn't capture the core IT actions needed for a new employee.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Keywords**\n\nI've extracted keywords from the IT ticket, focusing on \"new starter,\" \"joining,\" and roles like \"compliance officer.\" I am now prioritizing \"Access\" based on this information. My goal is to map these keywords to categories, with \"Access\" emerging as the most relevant. I think this reflects that my priority is to set up a new person.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the keywords and available categories. While \"HR Support\" seemed relevant initially due to the \"new starter\" context, the core action needed is granting access. This ticket requires me to set up the new employee's IT account, which is a foundational IT task. This will provide necessary access to internal tools and resources.\n\n\n"
