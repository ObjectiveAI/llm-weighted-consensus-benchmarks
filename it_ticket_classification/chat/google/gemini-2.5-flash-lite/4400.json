The term \"new starter\" and the request to \"add information\" point towards a potential HR-related issue. This seems to be the primary focus, so I'm leaning toward assigning it to the \"HR Support\" category. I need to make sure this is the correct answer.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"HR Support\" category, strongly considering the \"new starter\" phrase. The request for information aligns with onboarding activities. Although IT plays a role, the core issue seems HR-centric, and I will be assigning it to HR. This seems like the most logical conclusion given the information available.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket's Scope**\n\nI'm now focusing on the phrases that point most directly to the issue at hand. The \"new starter\" designation is the most pertinent aspect of this ticket. I'm taking the perspective of the IT team supporting this HR function. The ticket asks for additional info; the ticket is about setting up this new hire which is a core HR function. Considering all this, I'm confident in categorizing it under \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n"
