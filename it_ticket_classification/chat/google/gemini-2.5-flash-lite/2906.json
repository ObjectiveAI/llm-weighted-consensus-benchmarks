I've analyzed the text, paying close attention to keywords and context clues. While \"card leaver\" appears multiple times, the overall context remains unclear. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" due to the mention of \"badge\" and \"firma\", but need further confirmation from the context.\n\n\n**Analyzing Candidate Labels**\n\nI've further refined my approach to categorizing the ticket. The phrase \"card leaver\" is still a central piece, suggesting an employee departure. \"Badge firma\" continues to point toward access or HR systems. After reviewing the provided categories, \"HR Support\" appears most fitting because it encapsulates both the employee leaving process and related badge management. \"Access\" is a strong second choice, but \"HR Support\" seems more inclusive of the overall scenario.\n\n\n**Selecting a Primary Category**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket. The \"card leaver\" language strongly indicates an employee leaving, and \"badge firma\" points toward access controls, likely managed in HR systems. While \"Access\" is a possibility, \"HR Support\" appears more accurate as it encompasses both the departure process and the badge's implications. After careful review, I believe \"HR Support\" is the optimal choice. It fully captures the process described.\n\n\n"
