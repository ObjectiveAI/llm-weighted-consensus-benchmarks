It looks like it might be about password issues, so I'm leaning toward \"Access.\" However, the \"change pc\" part makes me second-guess. I'm going to look deeper into the context before submitting the final classification.\n\n\n**Confirming the Classification**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket content and, despite a brief consideration of \"change pc,\" my focus remains on the \"Access\" category. Keywords like \"password expire\" and the standard password reset instructions solidified this. \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" were quickly ruled out, while \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" don't fit the context. Internal projects and admin rights seem irrelevant here as well. Thus, \"Access\" remains the clear and suitable classification.\n\n\n**Reiterating the Context**\n\nMy analysis consistently indicates \"Access\" as the fitting category. Keyword analysis revealed that the repeated mention of password expiry and renewal outweighs the initial \"change pc\" consideration. The explicit directions for password modification via Ctrl+Alt+Delete further supports this. Although \"Hardware\" seemed initially plausible, the focus on *changing something on* the PC, rather than the PC itself, made \"Access\" the clearer choice.\n\n\n"
