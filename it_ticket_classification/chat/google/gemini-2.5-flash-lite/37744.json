Initially, I was considering broad IT categories, but the mention of a \"card reader\" and \"memory card\" is leading me to believe this is a hardware-related issue. The rest of the words don't seem like they add much relevant info, and they seem to imply an issue with the hardware of the camera or laptop.\n\n\n**Identifying the Core Problem**\n\nI've determined that the primary issue is hardware-related. The ticket text strongly suggests a problem with a \"card reader\" and its ability to read memory cards from a camera, likely connected to a laptop. This makes \"Hardware\" the most relevant category. My focus is on the malfunctioning hardware, making other categories like \"Storage\" secondary.\n\n\n"
