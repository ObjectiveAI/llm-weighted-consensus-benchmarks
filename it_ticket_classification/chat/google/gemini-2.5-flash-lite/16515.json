I'm trying to match the text to  \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", or \"Administrative rights\".  This ticket seems complex and might fall under \"Miscellaneous\" or require more context.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text: \"service now cancelled tickets tuesday cancelled tickets hi guys assigned filter also cancelled incidents even rules clearly points active incidents cancelled ones please thank\". The focus on cancelled tickets and incidents, specifically within ServiceNow, is clear. While none of the provided categories like Hardware, HR, or Access directly apply, I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" as the most suitable fit because of the text. None of the keywords align with a more direct fit.\n\n\n"
