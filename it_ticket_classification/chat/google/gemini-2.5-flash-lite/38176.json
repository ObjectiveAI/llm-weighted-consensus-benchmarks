After reviewing the ticket content, the keywords \"cards not working\" stand out.  I'm evaluating which of the provided categories, like Hardware, Access, or even a more general category, best fits the issue described.  I'm leaning towards a hardware or access issue, but need to be sure. The incident aspect also makes this potentially more complex.\n\n\n**Defining the Problem's Scope**\n\nMy focus is narrowing in on the true nature of this access issue. The ticket's phrasing, \"cards not working,\" definitely screams access problem, possibly with physical access cards. I'm discarding options unrelated to access, like Storage and HR Support, but need to consider hardware as a secondary factor. The \"new range\" element adds complexity, meaning cards, a new system, or perhaps both!\n\n\n**Finalizing the Categorization**\n\nI've determined that \"Access\" is the most accurate category for the ticket. The phrase \"cards not working\" directly points to an issue related to access control systems. The \"new range\" element suggests either new cards, a new access system, or a new location that necessitates access, all falling under the umbrella of access. This final assignment ensures the ticket is routed appropriately.\n\n\n"
