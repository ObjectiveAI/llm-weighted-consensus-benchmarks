Initially, I was looking for keywords, but I've realized that the repeated \"solved\" might be misleading. I need to focus on the problem description to determine the correct category. \"Mobile data\" is a key indicator. Given the options, it seems this falls under \"Access,\" but I'll make sure to double-check.\n\n\n**Confirming the Access Type**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories. \"Mobile data\" keeps pointing me towards \"Access.\" I'm now certain this isn't a hardware problem, nor does it involve HR, storage, purchases, or internal projects. My analysis supports the initial choice of \"Access,\" and I'm confident in my conclusion.\n\n\n"
