Given the phrase \"annual leave withdrawal approval,\" I'm leaning toward \"HR Support.\" It seems directly related to an HR function. The process involves employee leave requests, making this the most fitting classification so far. I'm double-checking, but HR appears correct.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket's Focus**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket descriptions, focusing on keywords like \"annual leave,\" \"holidays,\" and \"approvals.\" The evidence is overwhelming: this is fundamentally an HR-related matter. While there's a mention of \"access task application approval,\" the overriding theme revolves around employee leave requests and related processes. Thus, the category \"HR Support\" appears definitively correct.\n\n\n"
