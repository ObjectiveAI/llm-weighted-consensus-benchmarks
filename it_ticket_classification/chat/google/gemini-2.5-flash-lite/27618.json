The phrase \"update pm\" is prominent, yet its context is unclear. I'm trying to decipher if \"pm\" refers to project management, perhaps indicating a request related to \"Internal Project,\" or if it signifies something else entirely. \"Removed working\" and \"thanks\" are weak signals.  I need more context to be precise.\n\n\n**Analyzing Project Context**\n\nI've been drilling down on the \"update pm\" phrase. My initial instinct was Internal Project, and the more I examine the ticket, the more that aligns. \"Tudor Tuesday October\" feels like a project deliverable or schedule update, especially given the \"removed working\" line's implication of progress changes. I'm focusing on the project management implications of these clues.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nI've homed in on \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. Analyzing the phrase \"update pm,\" I'm now certain it pertains to project management activities, probably updating a project board or progress report. The \"Tudor Tuesday October\" mention, coupled with \"removed working,\" solidifies this. My focus is now on confirming this categorization and how to document the thought process.\n\n\n"
