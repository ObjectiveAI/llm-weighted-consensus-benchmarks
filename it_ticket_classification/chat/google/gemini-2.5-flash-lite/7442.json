The key terms \"new starters,\" \"interns accepted job offer,\" and \"convert accounts permanent\" strongly indicate an overlap between HR processes and the need for access provisioning. I'm leaning towards 'HR Support' or 'Access' for the most accurate classification of this onboarding-related request.\n\n**Assigning IT Tickets**\n\nI'm currently processing an IT ticket with the goal of accurate categorization. Based on terms like \"new starters\" and \"interns accepted job offer,\" I'm weighing between \"HR Support\" and \"Access.\" The phrase \"convert accounts permanent\" also points towards account management, so I'm prioritizing a category that best encapsulates onboarding and initial account setup.\n\n**Classifying IT Requests**\n\nI'm currently processing an IT ticket.
