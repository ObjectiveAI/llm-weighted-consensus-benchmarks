I am reviewing the ticket's details to select the most appropriate category from the given enum.\n\n**Categorizing New Resources**\n\nI'm currently refining my categorization for the IT ticket. The request to \"add new meeting rooms\" on the third floor strongly suggests a hardware-related setup. I'm leaning towards the \"Hardware\" category due to the implied need for new IT infrastructure in these spaces.\n\n**Choosing IT Category**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the best category for an IT ticket concerning the addition of new meeting rooms. While \"Hardware\" was an initial thought, the vagueness of the request makes \"Miscellaneous\" seem more appropriate as it doesn't explicitly mention any specific hardware requirements.\n\n**Provisioning IT Spaces**\n\nMy current focus is on accurately categorizing an IT ticket. The request involves provisioning new meeting rooms, and I'm weighing whether the implied IT infrastructure setup falls most appropriately under \"Hardware\" or a more general \"Miscellaneous\" designation, considering the vagueness of the prompt.\n\n**Considering IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently reviewing the IT ticket's details to select the most accurate category. The request to \"add new meeting rooms\" is quite vague, and I'm deliberating between \"Hardware,\" if it implies provisioning IT infrastructure, and \"Miscellaneous,\" as a broader catch-all for unspecified setup tasks.\n\n**Updating IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently re-evaluating the categorization for the IT ticket concerning new meeting rooms. While \"Hardware\" seemed plausible for IT infrastructure setup, the vagueness of \"add meeting rooms\" leads me to consider \"Miscellaneous\" as a more fitting placeholder for unclassified setup tasks.\n\n**Choosing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the IT ticket requesting the addition of new meeting rooms. My thought process is leaning towards categorizing this under \"Hardware,\" assuming it implies the provisioning of necessary IT infrastructure and equipment for these new spaces, as this is a common interpretation of such requests.\n\n**Assigning IT Ticket**\n\nI am currently processing an IT ticket that requires categorization. The request involves adding new meeting rooms on the third floor, and I am deliberating between \"Hardware\" to encompass potential IT infrastructure setup and \"Miscellaneous\" as a broader category for unspecified tasks.\n\n**Refining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently processing an IT ticket about adding new meeting rooms. My initial thought was \"Hardware\" due to the implied IT infrastructure setup, but I'm now leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" given the vagueness of the request, as it doesn't explicitly detail any hardware requirements.\n\n**Provisioning IT Resources**\n\nI'm currently determining the most accurate category for an IT ticket requesting the addition of new meeting rooms. My analysis points towards \"Hardware\" to cover the provisioning of necessary IT infrastructure and equipment required for these new spaces.\n\n**Selecting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently processing an IT ticket concerning the addition of new meeting rooms. After reviewing the available categories, I've decided that \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate classification, as this type of request typically involves the provisioning and setup of IT infrastructure within these new spaces.\n\n**Categorizing New Resources**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the IT ticket that requests the addition of new meeting rooms. While initially considering \"Hardware\" due to implied IT infrastructure setup, the vagueness of the request leads me to categorize it as \"Miscellaneous\" for now, as it doesn't explicitly detail any hardware requirements.\n\n**Adding IT Infrastructure**\n\nI'm currently processing an IT ticket related to the addition of new meeting rooms. My analysis suggests that \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category, as such requests typically involve the provisioning and setup of necessary IT infrastructure and equipment for these new spaces.\n\n**Configuring IT Spaces**\n\nI'm currently finalizing the categorization for an IT ticket regarding the addition of new meeting rooms. My analysis points towards \"Hardware\" as the most suitable classification, assuming the request implies the provisioning and setup of necessary IT infrastructure and equipment within these new spaces.\n\n**Adding IT Resources**\n\nI'm currently processing an IT ticket for adding new meeting rooms. My analysis indicates \"Hardware\" is the most suitable category, assuming it involves the provisioning and setup of necessary IT infrastructure and equipment for these new spaces.\n\n**Equipping New Rooms**\n\nI'm currently categorizing an IT ticket. The request to \"add the new meeting rooms\" implies provisioning necessary IT infrastructure and equipment, leading me to select \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate classification for this task.\n\n"
