My focus is narrowing down the best fit from the given ticket categories. I think the key here is to look for clues in the wording, such as the mention of \"requisition\" and \"approved,\" but I'm still weighing my options.\n\n\n**Categorizing Purchase Issues**\n\nI've honed in on the purchase category. The text highlights problems with approval workflows for invoices and POs, a clear fit for \"Purchase\". Keywords like \"requisition,\" \"invoice,\" and \"PO\" sealed the deal. I'm now ready to classify this ticket as a purchase-related issue.\n\n\n**Confirming Purchase Category**\n\nOkay, the analysis has zeroed in on \"Purchase\". The repeated mentions of requisitions, invoices, and POs, paired with the approval workflow trouble, solidified this choice. I'm now cross-referencing this determination with other similar historical data to validate its categorization.\n\n\n"
