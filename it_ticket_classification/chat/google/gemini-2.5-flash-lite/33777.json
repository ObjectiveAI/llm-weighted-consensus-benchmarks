The phrase \"new graduate access card\" is key, pointing towards either \"Access\" or potentially \"HR Support\".  I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the primary focus, but need to consider potential overlap if additional context emerges.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the ticket categories, now incorporating the \"enabling tower\" and role mentions. While \"Access\" remains a strong contender due to credentials and access card, the \"interns become employees\" element now firmly pushes me towards a primary classification of \"HR Support.\" The \"permanent status\" phrasing reinforces this shift.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Access Request**\n\nI've been honing in on the crucial aspects of this request. The combination of onboarding with credential changes, and permanent employee status, solidifies my position. While initial thoughts led me toward \"Access,\" the broader HR Support context of integrating new graduates into the system has become paramount. I am now certain, the most fitting category is \"HR Support,\" as it encompasses the onboarding and access provisioning aspect.\n\n\n**Choosing the Optimal Category**\n\nI'm now completely decided on classifying this ticket under \"HR Support.\" The \"new graduate\" and \"interns becoming employees\" aspects were pivotal. While access is a part of this, the underlying context of onboarding new permanent staff is primarily an HR-driven process. The emphasis on \"credentials\" is now viewed as an integral part of the HR process, not the defining factor.\n\n\n"
