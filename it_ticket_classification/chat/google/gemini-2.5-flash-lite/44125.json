I've determined that \"survey gizmo\" relates to performance. I am now trying to match the remaining words to your provided schema. It feels most likely to be a \"Miscellaneous\" issue, but I'm trying to see if there is a more direct fit with other categories like \"Internal Project\".\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Scope**\n\nI've expanded my analysis beyond the initial phrase. The phrases \"app slowness\", \"decreased performance\", and \"reports loading\" all point to an application performance bottleneck. I am focusing now on whether \"Internal Project\" is a better fit, but it is leaning more towards an \"Application Performance\" category, though it doesn't exist within the schema.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter reviewing the ticket again, and considering the provided categories, \"Miscellaneous\" is the strongest fit. The description details application slowness and performance issues (\"survey gizmo\"). While \"Internal Project\" felt initially plausible, the issues seem operational rather than project-specific, making \"Miscellaneous\" the best available choice.\n\n\n"
