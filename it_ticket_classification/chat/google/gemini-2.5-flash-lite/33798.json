The user's request seems to involve creating an Oracle view and making it accessible through shared storage. Therefore, I'm leaning toward the \"Storage\" category. I am still considering \"Access\" as another possibility, because the request mentions shared folders. I'll need to make a final decision soon.\n\n\n**Focusing on Storage Solution**\n\nI've been honing in on the \"Storage\" category. The Oracle view and shared folders points strongly to storage management. \"Access\" is still in the mix, as the user might need a particular permission to see the view. However, I'm finding the central theme is the availability and management of data within storage, rather than just permission. Uploading and the view being available seem to indicate data's location is the focus.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been closely analyzing the ticket content, focusing on the keywords and the overall request. The user needs an Oracle view added to file shared folders. Furthermore, they mention \"uploading,\" \"storage name,\" and \"folder view.\" Based on these elements, my thoughts are gravitating strongly towards \"Storage.\" Although \"Access\" is still in the background, the request seems primarily focused on the placement and availability of a data element.\n\n\n"
