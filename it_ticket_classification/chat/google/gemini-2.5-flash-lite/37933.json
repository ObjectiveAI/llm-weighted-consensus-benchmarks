It seems there's an access issue related to work hours, possibly after a period of leave. I'm leaning towards \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" but need to confirm. I'm diving deeper into the nuances of \"submit\" and the context of \"st friday\" to narrow down the correct categorization.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choices**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. While \"Access\" seemed possible, it's not the primary issue. The context of \"maternity leave\" and \"hours worked\" strongly points towards **HR Support** as the most relevant category. The user needs help with a payroll-related process after a period of leave, which is definitively an HR concern.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Decision**\n\nI've carefully re-examined the ticket details, particularly the user's situation after maternity leave. The inability to \"submit\" is core, but the underlying issue points strongly toward an HR process. I'm discarding the possibility of Hardware, Access, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. While the \"st friday\" aspect presented a small hurdle, I've concluded that \"HR Support\" best captures the nature of the inquiry.\n\n\n"
