The context hints at \"Access\" being the core need, making it a stronger contender than HR Support, even though it involves a new employee.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter reviewing all the options, I'm now leaning towards \"Administrative rights\" instead of just \"Access.\" The key is \"admin access,\" a precise indicator of elevated permissions and aligns closely with \"Administrative rights.\" Despite the new starter aspect, which initially prompted me to consider \"HR Support\" or general \"Access,\" the specific request for \"admin access\" makes \"Administrative rights\" the most appropriate category.\n\n\n**Selecting Final Category**\n\nI've carefully weighed the options and have solidified my choice. Considering the precise wording of \"new starter admin access,\" the most fitting category is indeed \"Administrative rights.\" While \"Access\" is relevant, \"Administrative rights\" encapsulates the elevated permissions being requested, making it the most accurate match.\n\n\n"
