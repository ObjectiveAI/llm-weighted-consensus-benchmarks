I think I'll lean towards \"Access\" since it's about not being able to do something within the system, but I need to make sure this is correct. I have to make sure the user is getting help quickly, so I want to be certain about the category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on whether the time entry and approval issues point more toward \"Access\" or \"HR Support.\" The recurring \"contact your administrator\" prompts and the user's inability to *use* the system strongly suggest an access or permissions glitch. I'm leaning toward \"Access,\" but still thinking through the nuance of HR-related workflows. I need to ensure this is the correct choice.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted again to the nuances of access versus HR support. I've re-examined the ticket's language, especially \"access task application\", which solidly aligns with \"Access\". I'm now leaning heavily toward \"Access,\" seeing the time entry issues as a consequence of underlying access problems. The administrator prompts point to a permissions or application configuration issue. I'm confident in my choice.\n\n\n"
