The phrases \"access to link is not working\", \"cannot access document\", and simply \"access\" keep recurring. It's a clear signal, and I'm homing in on classifying the exact nature of this access-related issue. My goal is to determine the appropriate category, prioritizing \"Access\" or another relevant option.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the central issue: consistently blocked access to specific resources. Phrases like \"access denied\" and repeated requests for access clearly point to this. Based on the provided language,  it's quite evident that the most accurate classification for this ticket is \"Access\".\n\n\n"
