It's a bit sparse, but the keywords \"external drive,\" \"borrow,\" \"format,\" and \"disks\" immediately point me towards storage-related issues. I'm focusing on those terms to determine the best fit within the provided categories. It looks like it could be **Storage**.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Selection**\n\nMy thinking has progressed, now that I have completed the initial classification. The key words within the ticket continue to affirm my storage-related conclusions. I'm prioritizing \"Storage\" because the phrases are directly related to the action of manipulating external storage hardware. \"Hardware\" is also suitable, though slightly less precise.\n\n\n**Reaching Final Conclusion**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's language, revisiting my initial ideas and refining my category selection. While \"Hardware\" is relevant, the operations and items described align best with \"Storage\". The keywords definitively point to storage-related issues. I'm now certain this ticket should be classified under \"Storage\", it's the most accurate category within the available options, considering the technical actions and the components mentioned.\n\n\n"
