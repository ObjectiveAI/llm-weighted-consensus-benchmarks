Based on the description, \"HR Support\" appears to be the most accurate choice as the request involves a change to an employee's line manager, which is a common HR-related function.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket description and, after evaluating the provided categories, I'm confident that \"HR Support\" is the most suitable classification for a request to change an employee's line manager. This aligns with standard HR functions.\n\n"
