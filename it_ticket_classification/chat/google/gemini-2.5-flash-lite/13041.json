I'm focusing on keywords and context to accurately assign it to one of the predefined categories. I'm trying to figure out which category fits best with 'new starter' and 'Bucharest'.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI've determined the ticket's core relates to a \"new starter\" in Bucharest, strongly implying an HR Support need. Initially, I sifted through the text, dismissing location and date information. The phrase \"administration officer\" further reinforced the HR Support category, as it relates to employee onboarding. While access might be involved, HR Support encompasses the broader context.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR Scope**\n\nI've isolated the core issue: a new employee in Bucharest. Analyzing the context, the \"administration officer\" phrase and lack of other defining elements solidify the \"HR Support\" category. I've discarded the peripheral details in favor of the onboarding focus. I'm now certain this falls squarely within HR's domain, even though access rights might be involved.\n\n\n"
