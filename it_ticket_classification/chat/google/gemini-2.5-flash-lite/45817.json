I'm leaning toward classifying this as \"HR Support\". I'll compare it with the other possibilities to be certain.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI'm now fully convinced the ticket belongs in \"HR Support.\" The terms \"timecard,\" \"submit,\" and \"approval\" are unambiguous.  I've reviewed the other categories, and none align as strongly with the ticket's core issue of timekeeping and approvals. The other options are irrelevant. I've successfully completed the categorization.\n\n\n"
