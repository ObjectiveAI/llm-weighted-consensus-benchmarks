                    "reasoning": "**Examining Ticket Details**\n\nI'm currently dissecting the ticket text to identify key clues. I'm focusing on keywords and phrases that might link to one of the available categories. \"New starter\" suggests a possible link to HR Support or Access, while \"form\" could potentially point to Administrative Rights. I will analyze these and other potential key terms to refine my classification attempt.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Onboarding Request**\n\nI'm focused on the \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" mentions. This led me to immediately eliminate some categories, and narrowed my focus to HR Support and Access. Since this looks like a new starter process, HR support is likely the most relevant category.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Assignment**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the \"HR Support\" category as the primary one, given the strong emphasis on the \"starter form\" and multiple \"new starters.\" Analyzing the text, the mention of \"details regarding two other\" strongly implies HR's involvement. It suggests the ticket is about fulfilling an HR request for onboarding, rather than a direct request for IT access setup. The \"Access\" category is applicable, but seems secondary to the broader HR onboarding context.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nI've been assessing the text's core intent. The recurring mention of \"starter form\" and multiple \"new starters\" strongly pushes me towards HR Support. While Access is relevant for onboarding, the emphasis on the form implies it's an initial HR request, making IT's role supportive rather than a primary access setup.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Category**\n\nI'm now certain \"HR Support\" is the most applicable category. The \"starter form\" is the lynchpin; it's an HR document triggering IT actions. Analyzing this, the ticket's core function is to support HR processes related to onboarding. Therefore, \"HR Support\" accurately reflects the nature of this IT ticket.\n\n\n"
