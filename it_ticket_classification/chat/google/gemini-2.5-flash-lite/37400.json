While the post-upgrade nature adds nuance, the central problem remains inability to log in to Oracle/Fusion. Issues logging into applications and submitting timecards point clearly to an access problem. Therefore, I confirmed that \"Access\" is the most appropriate and precise categorization based on the available information.\n\n\n"
