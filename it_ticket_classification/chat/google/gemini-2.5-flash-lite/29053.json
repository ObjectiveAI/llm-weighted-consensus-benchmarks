I'm focusing on keywords like \"social,\" \"visible,\" \"advertisements,\" and \"upload errors\" to zero in on the relevant category. The common issue is appearing to affect multiple users and is centered around social job advertisement visibility and uploading.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI've been drilling down on the ticket details, specifically focusing on the keywords and phrases. The description highlights system glitches impacting job advertisements and user uploads, strongly suggesting an HR-related system or platform. I'm leaning toward HR Support as the most suitable category. The issue impacts multiple users, making it a critical one to address. I'm cross-referencing this with possible user feedback or related tickets to make my decision.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's core issue: problems with social job advertisements being visible and colleagues experiencing upload errors, likely related to referrals. After examining the keywords and cross-referencing with possible categories, I've decided \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate. The recurring theme centers on a system impacting job postings, referrals, and user uploads, making \"HR Support\" the clear choice.\n\n\n"
