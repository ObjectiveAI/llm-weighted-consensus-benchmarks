                    "reasoning": "**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI'm focusing on key terms like \"oracle,\" \"planning officer,\" \"holiday,\" and \"infrastructure\" to pinpoint the ticket's category. It seems to involve a request or issue related to Oracle systems, potentially impacting operational planning or resource management around upcoming holidays. I'm exploring whether it relates to system performance, user access, or scheduling.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket's Core Issue**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket's text, focusing on the \"oracle pm,\" \"roll out,\" and \"infrastructure\" mentions. The garbled text presents a challenge, potentially indicating access issues after a system update, but the core points to a system-related problem involving Oracle infrastructure. Considering the categories I have, it's either an \"Access,\" \"Hardware,\" or \"Miscellaneous\" issue. The system rollout seems important.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Problem**\n\nI've been mulling over the ticket's ambiguous phrases. The core seems rooted in an Oracle-related infrastructure challenge, possibly triggered by a rollout. I'm focusing on deciphering the \"per\" issue \u2013 could it relate to access, permissions, or a data-saving problem? \"Infrastructure\" is my primary indicator, but it doesn't align neatly with the pre-defined categories. I'm debating whether \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit, or if there's an \"Access\" or \"Internal Project\" component. The holidays and the printing issue are still unclear.\n\n\n**Determining the Ticket Focus**\n\nI've been analyzing the text, highlighting keywords such as \"oracle pm,\" \"roll out,\" and \"infrastructure.\" I'm now focused on the unclear sentence which might involve data saving or access issues. It's difficult to parse. \"Infrastructure\" remains the key, hinting at a system-level problem. I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Access\" is a possibility given the data access issue in the garbled phrase. The reference to the \"upcoming holiday\" is still confusing.\n\n\n**Interpreting Infrastructure Context**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket's core issue, recognizing \"infrastructure\" is key. The obscure phrases suggest a system access problem after an Oracle PM rollout. The \"per per\" ambiguity highlights potential permissions problems, indicating \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" as possible categories. I'm still trying to connect the holiday mention to the infrastructure issue, but it remains unclear. I'm focusing on \"Internal Project\" because of \"roll out\" of \"oracle pm\" and access issues.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nAfter careful review, I've decided this ticket's core issue is related to \"Access.\" The \"per per\" phrase and inability to save data after the Oracle PM rollout strongly suggest permission problems. The system's infrastructure is affected, implying access and administrative rights are the main challenges here.\n\n\n**Categorizing the System Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text's core problem, which seems tied to an Oracle PM rollout impacting infrastructure. The obscure phrases suggest an access restriction after the update, making saving or task completion difficult. \"Access\" seems the best fit amongst the available categories. \"Internal Project\" is also possible.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Context**\n\nI've been working on interpreting the garbled text and linking the \"infrastructure\" mention to a suitable category. \"Internal Project\" is a contender given the \"roll out,\" but the access problems hinted at in the unclear phrases are making me reconsider. \"Miscellaneous\" still seems like a fallback, but I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The holiday reference remains unclear.\n\n\n\n**Classifying System-Level Problems**\n\nI'm focusing on the ticket's core problem, which seems rooted in the Oracle PM rollout's impact on infrastructure. Although \"Infrastructure\" isn't an option, the garbled text suggests access restrictions after the rollout, potentially blocking saving. The keywords point towards access and internal project concerns, making me consider \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. I'm trying to decipher how the holiday relates.\n\n\n**Interpreting System Deployment Context**\n\nI'm focused on the \"roll out\" and \"infrastructure\" indicators. After analyzing, I think I can assume the ticket pertains to access permissions, specifically saving data. The garbled phrases imply access issues. I'm prioritizing \"Internal Project\" and \"Access\" classifications based on this conclusion.\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Focus**\n\nI've narrowed down the ticket's core to access problems following the \"oracle pm\" system \"roll out.\" The ambiguous text indicates saving or permission issues on the \"infrastructure,\" so I'm focusing on \"Access\" or \"Internal Project\" as the best fit.\n\n\n**Refining the Ticket's Focus**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the ticket's classification. After reviewing the text, the core problem seems related to access issues, given the difficulties with saving data after the Oracle PM rollout. I'm focusing on \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" trying to interpret how the ambiguous phrases relate. The unclear \"upcoming holiday\" phrase continues to confuse me.\n\n\n**Reflecting on Core Problem**\n\nAfter careful examination, the \"Access\" category stands out as the most relevant. The obscure phrasing hints at data access or saving issues after the system update, aligning with this classification. The confusion around holidays and printing remains, but focusing on the access-related problems seems the correct course.\n\n\n**Classifying the Ticket Context**\n\nI've been analyzing the text's core problem, which seems tied to an Oracle PM rollout impacting infrastructure. The garbled phrases and the system's \"rollout\" suggest either access restrictions or a project's technical issues, making \"Internal Project\" a fitting choice or the ambiguous phrases could point towards \"Access\" issues. The holiday and printing issues are still unclear.\n\n\n**Deciphering System Access**\n\nMy focus has shifted to deciphering the key issue, now prioritizing \"Access\" or \"Internal Project\" based on the implications of the Oracle PM rollout and garbled phrases. I'm exploring whether access limitations, permission problems, or project deployment impacts are the main problems.\n\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Context**\n\nI've been analyzing the text's core problem, which seems tied to an Oracle PM rollout impacting infrastructure. The obscure phrases suggest an access restriction after the update, making saving or task completion difficult. \"Access\" seems the best fit amongst the available categories. \"Internal Project\" is also possible.\n\n\n**Interpreting System Deployment Context**\n\nI'm focused on the \"roll out\" and \"infrastructure\" indicators. After analyzing, I think I can assume the ticket pertains to access permissions, specifically saving data. The garbled phrases imply access issues. I'm prioritizing \"Internal Project\" and \"Access\" classifications based on this conclusion.\n\n\n**Classifying the Ticket's Focus**\n\nIt seems that the ticket relates to an Internal Project, specifically an Oracle PM rollout impacting infrastructure. The obscure phrases are now assumed to describe saving or permissions errors. Given the rollout context, this categorization is more suitable.\n\n\n"
