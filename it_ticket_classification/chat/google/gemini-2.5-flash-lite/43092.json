My current focus is on determining the right classification, and I am zeroing in on the descriptions to correctly assign the issue. Right now, I am going to attempt to assign the best category based on the ticket description: \"new conference rooms not visible from outlook\" and \"conference\". My initial thought is it may be related to Access.\n\n\n**Revising Category Assignment**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket descriptions and refined my category selection. I've ruled out \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Internal Project\" as not relevant. \"Miscellaneous\" remains a possibility as a fallback, but the core issue of access to conference room resources within Outlook strongly suggests \"Access\" is the most appropriate categorization. The emphasis is on a lack of integration, which falls under Access Control.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Access Issues**\n\nI have carefully assessed the ticket description and the provided categories again. I am now leaning heavily towards \"Access\" as the ideal categorization. Considering the inability to see and reserve the rooms, I believe the core issue is an access problem, not hardware, HR, or storage related issues. \"Miscellaneous\" seems too broad, and \"Administrative rights\" is not the core.\n\n\n"
