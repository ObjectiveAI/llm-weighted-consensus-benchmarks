My initial focus is on identifying keywords or phrases that strongly suggest a specific area of IT support. I'm prioritizing accuracy to produce the correct JSON output.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Scope**\n\nI've refined my category selection to \"HR Support.\" The ticket's text, rich with phrases like \"nomination,\" \"review,\" and \"approver,\" points decisively towards an employee recognition process. I'm now certain that the core issue is HR-related, rather than hardware or access. The JSON output will reflect this refined understanding.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR Focus**\n\nI've determined that the ticket text, brimming with phrases about \"award nomination,\" \"nominee,\" and \"approver,\" unambiguously points to an HR support issue. My analysis ruled out hardware, access, and miscellaneous options because the core concern is the employee recognition process, I'm confident in the JSON output: `{ \"category\": \"HR Support\" }`.\n\n\n"
