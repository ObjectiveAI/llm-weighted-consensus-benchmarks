The issue involves a manager unable to view an expense report, which directly impacts their ability to approve it. This clearly falls under the \"Access\" category.\n\n**Resolving Ticket Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket to pinpoint the most accurate classification. The core of the issue\u2014a manager being unable to access and approve expense reports\u2014points most strongly towards \"HR Support\" due to the nature of the workflow and the system involved, rather than general access.\n\n**Categorizing Expense Ticket**\n\nI'm refining my categorization for this IT ticket. While \"Access\" is relevant, the specific context of a manager being blocked from viewing expense reports for approval leads me to believe \"HR Support\" is a more precise fit, as it directly addresses the HR/Finance workflow.\n\n"
