My focus is on identifying the core issue presented in the ticket.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Themes**\n\nI'm actively analyzing the ticket text, looking for recurring themes. The data suggests a strong emphasis on site migration and associated content management. I'm refining my keyword extraction to better pinpoint the exact nature of these requests.\n\n**Refining Categorization Logic**\n\nI'm refining my approach to ensure the most fitting category is selected. Given the recurring themes of site migration, file transfer, and content management, the \"Internal Project\" category seems most appropriate. I'm double-checking if any \"Storage\" or \"Access\" nuances might warrant their inclusion.\n\n**Categorizing Site Migration**\n\nI'm focused on the primary theme of site migration. The text repeatedly mentions transferring data, managing content, and transitioning between old and new systems, strongly pointing towards an \"Internal Project\" classification. I'm verifying if any \"Storage\" or \"Access\" components are significant enough to alter this.\n\n**Refining Site Migration Focus**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the ticket text, and the consistent theme of site migration, file transfer, and content management strongly indicates an \"Internal Project.\" I'm now verifying if any secondary elements related to \"Storage\" or \"Access\" significantly alter this primary classification.\n\n"
