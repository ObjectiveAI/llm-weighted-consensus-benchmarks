Given the limited text, \"chat contact type\" and \"type chat default selected\" suggest a potential system or access issue. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or potentially \"Miscellaneous\" at this stage, but I'll need more context to be certain. Further analysis required.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the initial category options, now narrowing down possibilities. The focus continues to be on how the chat feature *behaves*, specifically its selection mechanisms. While \"Access\" remains a contender, it's losing ground to \"Miscellaneous\" or potentially \"Internal Project,\" depending on the broader context of the system. I'm focusing on the *functionality* of the chat selection, and if it is an internal system then \"Internal Project\" is highly relevant.\n\n\n**Defining the Root Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the fundamental problem. The core is the *behavior* of the chat selection and display. The text describes a scenario where the default chat type isn't working as expected, and users are struggling to manually select chats. This makes \"Miscellaneous\" a possible fit, but the system appears to be an internal tool, which makes \"Internal Project\" very relevant. This aligns with the \"unable displayed none\" part, which feels like debugging or testing an internal system.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nMy current focus is on the nuances of the \"Internal Project\" category in light of this new information. The logging aspect now makes \"Internal Project\" a stronger contender, suggesting this issue involves an in-house tool. I'm weighing whether it's primarily about development or configuration, but the focus remains on the specific functionality of this internal chat system and how its behavior deviates from expectations.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Context**\n\nI'm now deeply analyzing the ticket's connection to an internal system. The inclusion of \"tickets logged\" strongly suggests this chat feature is *integral* to an internal workflow, making \"Internal Project\" the most likely classification.  The \"default selected\" and \"manually selecting\" issues are clearly affecting ticket logging, which makes it an Internal Project's feature.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category Priority**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"Internal Project\" classification, given the strong emphasis on tickets and logging within the chat context. The fact that the chat functionality is tied to \"tickets logged\" makes it clear this isn't a general chat tool issue. This is about a specific internal system, making \"Internal Project\" a solid fit.\n\n\n"
