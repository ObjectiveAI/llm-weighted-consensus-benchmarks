The text seems vague but includes terms suggestive of a new employee setup, specifically mentioning \"new starter\" and a location. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" or \"Access,\" but I need to consider all the options and weigh the available information carefully. The \"importance high\" tag also suggests an urgent nature that must be addressed.\n\n\n**Evaluating Access Provisioning**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the nuances of access provisioning, given the context of a \"new starter\" and a location specified in the IT ticket. I've ruled out several categories like \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" because they don't seem to fit the bill as well as \"Access,\" which appears to be the most relevant. I am now meticulously assessing any potential fit for \"Administrative rights\". The high importance tag is definitely another key aspect.\n\n\n**Reassessing Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm revisiting the initial assumption of \"Access\" as the primary category, given the provided text. While \"new starter\" strongly suggests access needs, the context is nuanced. The urgency and location details seem to point towards an access-related issue, rather than a generic onboarding task that HR should do. I've eliminated \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Internal Project\" as unsuitable.  \"Administrative rights\" remains a possibility but depends on whether the new starter will require them or not. \"Miscellaneous\" remains a very loose last resort. \"Access\" is still in the lead, but I'm open to further refinement.\n\n\n"
