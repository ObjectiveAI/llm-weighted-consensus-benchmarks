This strongly points towards an HR Support classification rather than a general miscellaneous issue.\n\n**Determining Ticket Classification**\n\nI've refined my assessment. The \"oracle issue\" is indeed directly linked to absence records and annual leave discrepancies, making \"HR Support\" the most appropriate classification.\n\n"
