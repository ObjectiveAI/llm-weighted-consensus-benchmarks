While \"Access\" initially seemed likely due to the phrasing, the emphasis on workstation problems and potential replacement shifts my focus towards \"Hardware\" as the primary classification. I'm weighing which aspect is the core intent.\n\n**Resolving the Classification**\n\nI'm focusing on the core issue described. While \"access request\" was mentioned initially, the detailed description of workstation problems and the need for replacement strongly points to \"Hardware\" as the most accurate classification.\n\n**Categorizing the Request**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the request, initially leaning towards \"Access\" due to the explicit mention. However, upon deeper analysis of the described workstation issues and the implied need for replacement, \"Hardware\" now appears to be a more fitting primary classification.\n\n**Focusing on Hardware**\n\nMy current focus is on accurately classifying the IT ticket. While an \"access request\" was initially mentioned, the detailed description of workstation malfunctions and the implied need for a replacement strongly indicates \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate primary category.\n\n"
