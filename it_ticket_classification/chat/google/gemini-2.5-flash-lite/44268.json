The focus is on problems related to computer functionality, including restarting and browser behavior.

The issues of restarting, browser crashes, and password problems have led me to choose \"Access.\" After a detailed analysis, the focus is clearly on the user's inability to log in, confirming my initial conclusion.\n\n\n"
