My current assessment leans towards \"Access\" due to phrases suggesting employee interaction and potential issues with system entry, though \"Miscellaneous\" remains a consideration if the text proves too ambiguous.\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI'm re-evaluating the ticket's categorization, leaning towards \"Access\" due to employee involvement and a potential issue after selection. However, the highly garbled nature of the input text is making a definitive assignment challenging, prompting consideration of \"Miscellaneous\" as a fallback.\n\n**Confirming Ticket Category**\n\nI'm finalizing the category for this ticket. Given the heavily garbled text and lack of clear indicators for specific areas like hardware or HR, I'm defaulting to \"Miscellaneous\" as the most appropriate classification for this ambiguous submission.\n\n"
