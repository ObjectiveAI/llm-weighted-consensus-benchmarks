My process involves examining the summary to match it with the most appropriate category from the provided enum list.\n\n**Resolving Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket summary, noting recurring themes like \"root cause analysis\" and \"multiple polls down.\" This points to a technical operational issue rather than specific categories like hardware, HR, or access. I'm leaning towards a more general classification.\n\n**Selecting Best Fit Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's details, noting the phrases \"root cause analysis\" and \"multiple polls down.\" These strongly suggest a system operational issue, rather than hardware, HR, or access problems. Given the provided enum, \"Miscellaneous\" appears to be the most suitable category for this type of technical investigation ticket.\n\n**Investigating Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the IT ticket summary, focusing on the phrases \"root cause analysis\" and \"multiple polls down.\" These indicators strongly suggest a system operational issue that doesn't align with the specific categories of Hardware, HR Support, Access, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative Rights. Given the provided options, \"Miscellaneous\" appears to be the most fitting category for this type of technical investigation.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket summary, which frequently mentions \"root cause analysis\" and \"multiple polls down.\" This strongly indicates a system operational issue requiring investigation, rather than falling into Hardware, HR, Access, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative Rights categories.
