The ticket content suggests an emphasis on permissions, specifically around access control, not general HR issues.  I'm drilling down to differentiate between access requests and broader administrative rights issues. The \"manage rights\" and \"manage permissions\" language confirms the Access category fits best, but I'm considering further sub-categorization for efficiency.\n\n\n**Defining the Scope Further**\n\nI'm solidifying \"Access\" as the primary category. The keywords all point decisively towards user permissions, file access, and rights management. I've ruled out \"Administrative rights\" because the focus is on specific file-level access control, not broader system administration. The ticket clearly centers on managing permissions for individual users, reinforcing the choice of \"Access\" as the central category.\n\n\n"
