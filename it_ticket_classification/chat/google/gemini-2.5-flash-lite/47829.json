I'm leaning toward \"Access\" right now, but I need to make absolutely sure that it doesn't fit another category better. I'll need to double check to see if there are any other aspects in the ticket text that can change my answer.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Control**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text. While data security and storage are present, the pervasive theme is clearly access management. The phrases \"unrestricted access,\" \"access only,\" and \"any one can import\" strongly point to Access as the core issue. I'm focusing on validating this choice against alternative options, ensuring the primary concern is indeed with controlling who can access what, not simply data storage or HR processes.\n\n\n**Defining Access Controls**\n\nMy current thinking is consolidating on \"Access\" as the proper classification. The focus on who can view confidential data and the need for restricted access confirms this choice. \"Data security\" aspects are present, but they are subordinate to the central concern: limiting and regulating who can see and modify data. I am almost ready to submit my finding.\n\n\n"
