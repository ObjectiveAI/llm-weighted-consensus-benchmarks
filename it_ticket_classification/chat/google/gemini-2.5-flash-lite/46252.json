The description really screams \"Storage\" to me, considering all the talk about space, partitions, and availability. I'll need to double-check, but that feels like the right box.\n\n\n**Defining Best-Fit Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's language, zeroing in on keywords like \"space,\" \"disk,\" and \"partitions.\" The persistent theme of data storage and its management is clear. After comparing the description to the available categories, \"Storage\" really does seem like the strongest match for this request. I'm feeling confident in that assessment.\n\n\n"
