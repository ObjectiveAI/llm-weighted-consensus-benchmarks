The term \"maternity leaver\" is a clear indicator of HR involvement, and the explicit mention of \"hardware\" is secondary in this context. While \"Hardware\" is mentioned, the HR aspect seems primary. My current working hypothesis is \"HR Support\".\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nMy thinking has shifted slightly. While HR's involvement is undeniable, the focus of this *IT* ticket seems to be the hardware itself: its return, repurposing, or deactivation due to the employee's departure. Therefore, \"Hardware\" seems the most appropriate primary category, even though HR triggers the event. The \"maternity leaver\" aspect is the *reason* for the hardware action, not the central *subject* of the IT request.\n\n\n**Analyzing IT's Role**\n\nMy analysis now focuses on the IT perspective. While the HR connection is clear, the request centers on handling the hardware linked to the leaver's departure. I've re-evaluated each category, and \"Hardware\" now seems the most specific. The primary action IT will undertake, based on this ticket, is related to hardware management. The HR-related context acts as the trigger, not the core function.\n\n\n"
