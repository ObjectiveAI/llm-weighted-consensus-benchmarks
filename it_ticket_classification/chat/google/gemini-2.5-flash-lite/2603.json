The text indicates password policy inquiries, which leads me to lean toward \"Access\" or potentially \"Administrative rights\" based on the \"tried change\" phrase. I'm carefully weighing whether the policy question is primary or if the user is having trouble with their rights. I am reviewing the list and re-assessing any potential categories.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Password Issue**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text, identifying a strong association with password policy inquiries and failed change attempts. \"Access\" emerges as the most suitable category, encompassing user authentication and permissions issues, over \"Administrative rights\" which is slightly broader. After ruling out other options, I'm confident in classifying the ticket under \"Access.\"\n\n\n"
