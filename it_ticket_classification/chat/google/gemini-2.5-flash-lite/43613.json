The text \"unable to open files\" feels like it could be Access, but Storage or a network issue is also possible. I'm weighing those options before I finalize the category.\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Issues**\n\nI'm solidifying the ticket categorization as \"Access.\" The ticket text clearly revolves around file access problems and domain/network interactions. \"Unable to open files\" is the central issue, reinforced by phrases like \"need access files\" and \"domain controller.\"  The domain context helps solidify this. It fits more than \"Storage,\" which is only potentially involved.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Access Problem**\n\nCurrently, I'm firming up the categorization to 'Access'. The ticket text centers on file access issues related to domain integration and authentication. \"Unable to open files\" is the primary clue, backed by mentions of needing file access and network interactions. I've now ruled out options such as Hardware, Storage, or Administrative rights, as the core problem lies in accessing the files. The domain and error context reinforces the Access classification.\n\n\n"
