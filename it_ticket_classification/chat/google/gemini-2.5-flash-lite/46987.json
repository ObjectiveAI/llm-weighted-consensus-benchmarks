My process involves analyzing the provided text descriptions and mapping them to predefined categories such as \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. I'm actively working to identify key issues within the descriptions. My objective is to achieve accurate ticket categorization.\n\n\n**Diagnosing Access Issues**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text. The core problems appear to be related to Active Directory, authentication failures, and account lockouts, suggesting an \"Access\" issue. However, there's also the concern about potential password guessing or hacking. I'm focusing on the interplay of authentication errors with the module connection problem, which might require a \"Miscellaneous\" subcategory for its unique nature.\n\n\n**Identifying Access Problems**\n\nI've carefully reviewed the ticket description. The key issues are account lockouts, authentication failures related to Active Directory accounts, and a possible connection problem with a module. While there's a security concern about password guessing, the core problem is access restriction. I'm focusing on the interplay of authentication errors with the module connection problem, which might need a more precise subcategory within \"Access\" for its specific nature. The primary concern is the end user's inability to access the system.\n\n\n"
