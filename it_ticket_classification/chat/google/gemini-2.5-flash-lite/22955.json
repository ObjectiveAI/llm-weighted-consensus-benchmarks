The \"new starter\" mention suggests a possible HR or Access issue. \"Changed size\" and \"moved\" could hint at hardware or storage. \"Thursday pm\" doesn't seem relevant. The attachment is unclear without context. I'm leaning toward either HR Support or Access, but need more clarity before committing to a category.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Content**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket. The \"new starter\" phrase keeps screaming HR Support, as it's the core focus.  While \"changed size\" suggests hardware or storage, the new employee aspect makes HR Support the primary concern. \"Filled form\" further cements the HR angle. I'm leaning heavily towards HR Support, but may cross-check with Access based on context.\n\n\n**Assessing Onboarding Context**\n\nI've been evaluating the ticket text, focusing on the \"new starter\" aspect and subsequent phrases. \"Changed size\" still seems less prominent than the new employee's onboarding tasks. \"Filled form\" and \"completion\" solidify the HR Support angle. I've ruled out Hardware, Storage, Access as primary drivers, but I'm keeping an eye open for how those might be related. Right now, all signs indicate a core HR Support case.\n\n\n"
