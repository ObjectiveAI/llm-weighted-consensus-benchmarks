I'm carefully analyzing the text, looking for keywords and phrases to pinpoint the best fit from the provided categories. It seems to involve some kind of access modification related to a specific timeframe, Wednesday PM. The available categories are under close consideration to identify the best match.\n\n\n**Evaluating Access Changes**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"Access\" category. The ticket text's language strongly suggests modification of access privileges: \"remove,\" \"add to,\" \"amend,\" \"include.\" Phrases like \"floor pm\" and \"building\" further reinforce this. While HR might be involved in access control, the core request feels more technical. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" as the primary categorization.\n\n\n**Finalizing Access Determination**\n\nI've determined that the \"Access\" category is the best fit. I've been carefully assessing the ticket text. The terms \"remove from,\" \"add to,\" \"amend,\" and \"include\" all point toward access management. The phrases \"floor pm\" and \"building\" solidify the case. Though HR could have related influence, the core request is technical. I'm confident \"Access\" is the primary categorization.\n\n\n"
