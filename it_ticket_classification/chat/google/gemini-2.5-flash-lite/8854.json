I'll need further context to confirm.\n\n\n**Identifying HR Support Ticket**\n\nI've determined that the ticket's primary focus is HR-related, specifically regarding employee versus contractor status and record amendments.  The provided text, including mentions of \"permanent member\" and \"amend her record\", solidifies my conclusion.  I've cross-referenced this with the available categories and confidently believe \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate.\n\n\n"
