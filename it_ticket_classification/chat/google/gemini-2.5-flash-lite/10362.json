The terms \"mailing lists,\" \"ad groups,\" and \"shared mailbox\" strongly suggest a focus on managing user access and group memberships, leading me to categorize it primarily under \"Access.\"\n\n**Assigning IT Tickets**\n\nI'm continuing to refine my process for categorizing IT tickets. By analyzing the recurring terms like \"mailing lists,\" \"add members,\" and \"ad groups,\" I've concluded that the ticket primarily concerns managing user access and group memberships, making \"Access\" the most appropriate category.\n\n"
