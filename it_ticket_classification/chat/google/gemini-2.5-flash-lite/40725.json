Based on the description, I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" due to the mention of \"system scan\" and \"high resource usage.\" But I'm also considering \"Miscellaneous\" as a broader bucket if it doesn't fit perfectly. I'll need to carefully analyze the details. The allowed categories from the schema help narrow the choices down.\n\n\n**Confirming Ticket Classification**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nI've carefully reviewed the ticket details. The 'high resource usage' and 'system scan' points made me initially think of 'Hardware,' but upon closer inspection, it seems more about the impact of the scan than the hardware itself. The description doesn't fit the other specific categories. 'Miscellaneous' appears to be the most appropriate given it covers system performance and resource issues. I'm finalizing this choice.\n\n\n"
