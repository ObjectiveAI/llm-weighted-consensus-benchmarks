The \"project manager\" and \"backup approver\" keywords strongly suggest an \"Internal Project\" classification. However, I need to confirm that this is the best fit, considering the full ticket text, which I don't have access to at the moment. I will need to consider other categories. I'm exploring the context of the words.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket: Internal Project**\n\nI'm now certain that \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. Analyzing \"set cc as project manager for and as backup approver\" is key. The ticket's emphasis is not on hardware or access, but on defining roles linked to the \"oracle\" system. This configuration change clearly falls under an internal project. I'm focusing on the keywords and the phrase provided.\n\n\n**Analyzing Best Category Fit**\n\nThe \"Internal Project\" classification seems solid, but I'm now comparing it against \"Access.\" While assigning roles like \"project manager\" might involve access, the core of this ticket is role management within a project. I'm focusing on the keywords and the specific phrasing about \"setting\" someone as manager and approver, which leans toward project configuration. The mention of \"oracle\" and the \"change pm\" reinforces this project-centric viewpoint.\n\n\n"
