The presence of \"maternity leave,\" \"oracle account,\" and \"leaver form\" strongly suggests this is an employee offboarding request related to maternity leave. I'm focusing on fitting the ticket into the provided schema, zeroing in on the best category match.\n\n\n**Determining the best fit**\n\nI've been honing in on the best category match, considering all the clues. While \"Access\" is relevant due to the Oracle account, the central issue is the employee's departure, driven by maternity leave. This necessitates HR involvement, making \"HR Support\" the clear frontrunner in this scenario. Processing the \"leaver form\" is also critical to this ticket.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Involvement**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's core intent. The recurring mention of \"maternity leave\" and the \"leaver form\" solidify this as an HR-driven request. Though an Oracle account is present, the employee's offboarding, spurred by maternity leave, is paramount. I'm definitively leaning towards \"HR Support\" due to the central HR nature of the request.\n\n\n"
