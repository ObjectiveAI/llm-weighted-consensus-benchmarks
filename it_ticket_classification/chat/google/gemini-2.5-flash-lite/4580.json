The keywords \"leaving announcement\" strongly suggest this is related to an employee departure.  Based on this, the best choice appears to be \"HR Support,\" as it aligns with employee-related processes. I am finalizing my assessment now.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've re-examined the key phrases and category options. The text consistently points towards an employee leaving, making \"HR Support\" the most appropriate. The announcements, resignation details, and employee-specific information all align perfectly with this category. I'm confident in my final decision.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Criteria**\n\nI've re-examined the text and category options once more. The focus on an \"employee leaving\" coupled with phrases like \"resignation\" and \"announcement\" firmly place this ticket within the realm of HR-related processes. While access might be impacted indirectly, the primary concern appears to be the notification and associated employee departure procedures. I believe \"HR Support\" remains the most appropriate category, representing the core issue.\n\n\n"
