The \"Belgrade\" detail introduces a geographical element, but the contradictory accessibility claims are the red flag. It points definitively toward a network access or server accessibility problem. My focus is on deciphering the specific nature of this access restriction.\n\n\n**Defining the Problem's Scope**\n\nMy analysis indicates this isn't a simple access issue; it's a geographically-dependent network problem. The user's clarification about a server app on a Belgrade VM is key. \"Access\" is still the most fitting category, but now I'm leaning toward a specific network segment issue tied to the VM's location. The \"Internal Project\" option seems less relevant, considering the immediate need for a fix.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Root Cause**\n\nI'm now focusing on the conflicting descriptions of accessibility. The contradiction is the key, and it all points to network access or server accessibility. With the additional details, the focus is on a server application in Belgrade that's not accessible from certain locations. The category is definitely \"Access\". This looks like a network segment issue.\n\n\n"
