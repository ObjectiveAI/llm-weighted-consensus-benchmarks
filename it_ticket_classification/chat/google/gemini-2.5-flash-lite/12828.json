I've analyzed the content (\"project team member tuesday july pm member dear ask pm holiday assign member must approve requests\") and am leaning towards \"Internal Project\" due to the mention of \"project team\" and \"approve requests\", but I am still evaluating other options.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Core Issue**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the root cause of the IT ticket. While keywords such as \"expense report\" point towards HR, the context seems ancillary. The central theme revolves around a \"project team member\" and the potential need for \"add member\" functionality. Although there's a code error involved, I will need to consider whether it's related to the project team access. It looks like it is more appropriate for me to go with \"Internal Project\" as the root.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've finished evaluating the ticket's content and considered each category. Based on the analysis, the essence of the ticket revolves around a \"project team member,\" with add/manage functionality within a project context. While expense reports and code errors are mentioned, they're ancillary, stemming from project-related requests. The keywords and context led me to categorize this ticket under \"Internal Project\" since it best reflects the core issue's project-centric nature.\n\n\n"
