My initial inclination is to lean towards \"Access\" but I'm also considering the implications of \"shared\" mailboxes which might involve storage considerations. I'm carefully weighing all the clues to ensure the categorization aligns perfectly.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Focus**\n\nI've determined that \"Access\" is the most fitting category, given the clear indicators in the ticket.  The keywords point directly to tasks like removing or deactivating mailboxes. I considered other options, but \"Access\" aligns best with the action requested.  \"HR Support\" is a possibility for deactivated accounts, but the primary task is technical and falls under access management.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nMy current focus is solidifying the categorization. The analysis of ticket text continues to point decisively towards \"Access.\" I'm examining how to efficiently map this ticket to \"Access\" while anticipating future tickets.  \"HR Support\" is being dismissed, as the technical nature of the request is clear. The ticket's emphasis is on account management, rather than HR process management.\n\n\n"
