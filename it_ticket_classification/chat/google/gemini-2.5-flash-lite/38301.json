I'm trying to weigh which category is the most direct fit and will provide the most effective resolution path.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm zeroing in on \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate category. The time card issue points directly to HR-related systems. Though administrative rights could be relevant, the problem description leans more toward application functionality than permission issues. \"HR Support\" offers the best starting point for resolution.\n\n\n"
