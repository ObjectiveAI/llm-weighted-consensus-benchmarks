The user's inability to connect to remote machines from meeting rooms seems to point towards a network-related issue. \"Access\" is looking like the frontrunner. I am considering if \"Hardware\" could be relevant if it is a physical device in the meeting rooms, but the wording suggests a more general issue. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" being the best fit.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nNow I am re-evaluating the current top choice, \"Access.\"  While it fits, I am considering whether the problem might be more about network connectivity than specific access rights. The location-specific nature of the issue (meeting rooms) suggests a network configuration or firewall issue. This will lead me to update my final choice.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on solidifying my choice for the category. The core issue is the user's inability to connect to remote resources from specific locations. While \"Access\" still seems appropriate, I am exploring whether the context of meeting rooms suggests a deeper network connectivity issue that is restricting this access. I'm prioritizing \"Access\" as the strongest candidate. I'm focusing on the remote machine aspect to make the final determination.\n\n\n"
