I am now leaning towards \"Access\" as the primary category. The mention of \"oracle account setting\" strongly indicates an access-related issue, and \"submit her according her shifts\" and \"print screen\" could point to access restrictions or permissions problems. I am still considering other options, but \"Access\" seems most appropriate based on the current clues.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Issues Further**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Access\" as the prime category, but I am still entertaining \"Administrative rights\" and \"HR Support.\" The \"Oracle account\" aspect strongly supports \"Access\". \"Submitting according to shifts\" and \"print screen\" point to potential limitations or permissions within the system, although they could be HR process-related, which still may include administrative privileges. I am moving forward with further investigation.\n\n\n**Deepening Category Analysis**\n\nI'm now leaning heavily towards \"Access\", since the focus is on the user's ability to \"submit\" within the Oracle system. \"Administrative rights\" is a secondary consideration. The core issue is the user's *functional access*, which aligns with the \"Access\" category. I am now looking at refining the specific access problem, and possible keywords. I am going to analyze the specifics of an inability to \"submit\" which points to access permissions.\n\n\n**Focusing on Permission Limitations**\n\nI am now focusing on the nuance of the \"Access\" category. The ticket's emphasis on \"unable to submit\" strongly suggests a *limitation in permissions* within the Oracle system. While \"Administrative rights\" remains a possible secondary consideration, the core issue is the user's restricted *functional access* to a specific feature: submitting. The Oracle account's configuration is the central problem.\n\n\n**Narrowing in on Oracle Configuration**\n\nI'm now focusing on the Oracle system as the critical point. The core of the problem is that the user cannot submit within Oracle due to a specific account setting. I believe it's an access issue because the ticket is about granting functional access through the account. It's not about the user becoming an administrator. \"HR Support\" appears less relevant, and the issue is specifically about *what* the account allows, which leans heavily towards an access category. I am going to analyze the specifics of the Oracle account and its configuration.\n\n\n"
