The text, \"referral system issue\" and \"tried using different browsers\", is helping me narrow the focus. I'm carefully reviewing the provided categories, trying to find the most fitting one to tag this ticket appropriately. I'm focusing on the user's issue with a referral system, which seems to imply a core functionality problem.\n\n\n**Determining System Function**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the ticket's core issue: the \"referral system\" isn't functioning correctly. The user's troubleshooting steps, like switching browsers, underscore that this is likely a system-level problem. The category, \"Access\" seems the best fit, as the user can't access or use the system's intended functionality. While other categories are relevant, such as \"HR support\", or \"Internal Project\" they don't seem to reflect the key issue.\n\n\n**Clarifying HR's Role**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the connection between the \"referral system\" issue and the provided categories, especially \"HR Support\" vs. \"Access.\" The user's actions \u2013 trying different browsers and the system repeatedly asking for employee information \u2013 suggest a functional problem within the referral process itself. I've re-evaluated \"HR Support\" as a key candidate since the referral system is an HR tool. The issue seems to stem from a failure in the referral workflow, not access permissions.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR's Role**\n\nI've re-evaluated \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate category. The ongoing struggle with the referral system, especially the continuous prompts for employee information, points to a workflow defect. While access could be a factor, the issue is more about the functional breakdown of the referral process, a core HR function. I think it's clear the system isn't fulfilling its intended purpose.\n\n\n**Refining Category Choice**\n\nI'm now carefully re-evaluating the best category, focusing on \"HR Support.\" The recurring problems with the referral workflow strongly point towards an issue related to HR functions. Despite the \"Access\" and \"Internal Project\" contenders, the user's struggle within the system and the connection with employee data makes \"HR Support\" the most appropriate. The issue is with a core HR system, and how it is functioning.\n\n\n"
