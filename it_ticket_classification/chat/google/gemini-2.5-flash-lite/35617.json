Based on the phrases \"permissions needed,\" \"staff utilization report,\" and \"obi,\" I'm leaning toward either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The key seems to be the need for permissions to run a specific report. I'm focusing on the nature of the report to solidify my choice.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Selection**\n\nI've refined my thinking. Analyzing the ticket details, it's clear the primary issue revolves around report access, not broader administrative rights. The repeated phrases about \"permissions to run\" a specific \"utilization report\" solidify \"Access\" as the most precise category. It's not about general admin privileges, but rather gaining entry to a particular resource, which is the report.\n\n\n"
