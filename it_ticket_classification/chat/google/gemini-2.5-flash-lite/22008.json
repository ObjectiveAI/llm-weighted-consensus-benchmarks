I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access,\" given the nature of onboarding. However, the mention of \"attached\" could suggest a broader request. My next step will be to examine the attachments, which are not currently available.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Support**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category for the ticket. The phrase \"new starter\" is a strong indicator of an HR-related onboarding request. While access is a component, it falls under the broader HR support umbrella. The other categories don't align with the sparse information provided in the ticket.\n\n\n**Analyzing the New Ticket**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on a choice between \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" for this ticket's classification. The \"new starter\" language keeps pointing me toward HR processes related to onboarding. The IT action, while primarily access provisioning, is born from the HR event. I'm carefully weighing whether the *initiation* of the request or the *action* taken is the primary determinant in this case. Ultimately, the schema's \"HR Support\" seems more appropriate, it aligns best with the ticket text's context.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Support**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category for the ticket. The phrase \"new starter\" is a strong indicator of an HR-related onboarding request. While access is a component, it falls under the broader HR support umbrella. The other categories don't align with the sparse information provided in the ticket.\n\n\\n\\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI'm now confidently settling on \"HR Support\" as the definitive classification. The text's focus on a \"new starter\" makes it clear this is about onboarding, which is primarily an HR process with IT support. While access provisioning is an IT function, the *source* of the request aligns more closely with HR. This categorization aligns with best practices in IT service management where tickets are often classified by the *originating business process*, rather than only by IT task performed.\n\n\n**Solidifying the Classification**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"HR Support\". The phrase \"new starter\" is the clearest indicator of an HR-driven onboarding process, and my focus is on the *origin* of the service request. While access is a part of this, the HR onboarding event is the main driver. This aligns with IT service management best practices to categorize tickets according to the originating business function. The \"HR Support\" category seems best suited to encompass the entire onboarding support process required.\n\n\n"
