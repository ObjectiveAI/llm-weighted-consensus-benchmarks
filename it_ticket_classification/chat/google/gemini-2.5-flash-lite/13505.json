It's minimal, but the \"new starter\" phrase suggests an onboarding process is involved. The lack of specific technical details complicates a direct category match. I need to consider all the possibilities from the allowed categories.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text focusing on keywords and potential category matches. I've ruled out Hardware, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights as they don't apply based on the available information. Although \"Access\" is relevant to new starters, I've decided \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category, given the emphasis on \"new starter\" and the mention of the \"administration officer\" role, as it encompasses a wider range of onboarding tasks that are most likely related to HR.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've been honing in on the ideal category for this ticket. After considering the \"new starter\" context and the mention of the \"administration officer\", I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support.\" It aligns perfectly with the onboarding process, which is the primary focus of the ticket. I considered \"Access\", but \"HR Support\" feels more encompassing for the broader initial setup.\n\n\n"
