The text appears to concern \"annual leave days,\" which complicates the process, since it does not fit neatly within any of the defined categories. I am deliberating between \"HR Support\" and \"Miscellaneous\", given that \"annual leave\" could arguably fall within both.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Classification**\n\nI've refined my thinking and I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\". The ticket's content focuses on \"annual leave days,\" which strongly aligns with employee-related inquiries. While \"Miscellaneous\" remains a possibility, the specific mention of \"annual leave\" steers me decisively towards the \"HR Support\" category. I am comfortable making this decision.\n\n\n"
