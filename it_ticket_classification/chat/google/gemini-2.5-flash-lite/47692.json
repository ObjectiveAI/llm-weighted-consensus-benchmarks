I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" or possibly \"Internal Project,\" though the exact nature remains somewhat vague. Double notifications could relate to several areas, from hardware issues to coding, so the best category selection is a bit tough to determine. More context would be helpful!\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Categories**\n\nCurrently, I'm focusing on \"Miscellaneous\" as a likely match. I'm also considering \"Internal Project,\" given the notification system might be considered an internal initiative. I'm trying to determine whether the issue stems from the notification system itself, which leans towards an \"Internal Project\" classification, or if it's a general technical glitch best handled in \"Miscellaneous.\"\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Options**\n\nMy analysis now focuses on the \"Miscellaneous\" category, given the lack of a precise fit. The core problem is a software bug related to notifications and scores, a glitch that doesn't align well with the other, more specific categories. This is a tough ticket to categorize. \"Internal Project\" might fit if the notification system is an internal project, but that is not specified.\n\n\n**Choosing the Final Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's nature, identifying it as a software bug impacting notifications and scores. After reviewing all categories, including re-evaluating their fit, I concluded that \"Miscellaneous\" is the most apt choice. The bug's nature doesn't neatly align with the predefined options.\n\n\n"
