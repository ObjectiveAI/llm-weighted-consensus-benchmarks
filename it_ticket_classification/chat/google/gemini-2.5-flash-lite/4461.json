I'm homing in on the words and context clues to select the most appropriate category, aiming for precision and efficiency in my decision. It feels like \"HR Support\" could be a match, but I need to make sure.\n\n\n**Defining the Best Fit**\n\nMy analysis of the ticket text continues to point toward \"HR Support.\" The issue focuses on timecard errors, submissions, and approvals, which fall squarely within the scope of HR-related processes. I've ruled out other categories like \"Hardware\" and \"Access\" as irrelevant.  \"Miscellaneous\" felt too vague, whereas \"HR Support\" captures the essence of the problem. This categorization feels accurate.\n\n\n"
