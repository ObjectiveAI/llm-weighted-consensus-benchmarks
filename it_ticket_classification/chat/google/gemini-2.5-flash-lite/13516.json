The wording \"new starter hardware allocation\" points strongly toward \"Hardware,\" which seems to be the most accurate fit. I'll need to consider this suggestion.\n\n\n**Defining the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now considering the context of the ticket beyond just hardware. I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\" because the ticket involves new employee onboarding and initial access setup. The phrases \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"student starting\" are leading me to think HR is initiating this request, even if IT will handle hardware and access. I'll make a final decision.\n\n\n**Resolving Ticket Classification**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content, focusing on the keywords that suggest the initiating party. The phrases \"starter form\" and \"new starter hardware allocation\" solidified my thought process. While hardware and access are present, they are secondary to the broader context of onboarding a new individual. Concluding, \"HR Support\" best captures the primary function of this ticket, as it encompasses the coordinated effort between HR and IT.\n\n\n"
