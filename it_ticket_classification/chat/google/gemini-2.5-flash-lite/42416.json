This seems to encompass the core issue of managing access for departing employees.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Options**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the possible categories and their relationship to the ticket content. The ticket's focus on \"leaver access\" strongly points toward \"Access\" as the ideal choice. I eliminated the other categories based on the specific terminology in the ticket, such as \"leaver access card\" and \"active AD accounts.\" I'm confident that \"Access\" accurately reflects the primary concern.\n\n\n"
