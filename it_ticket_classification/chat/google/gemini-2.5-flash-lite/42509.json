                    "reasoning": "**Examining Leaver Process**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and it seems the focus is on a leaver process, specifically around closing accounts and access.  I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the most relevant category because the keywords point towards access management, account closure, and the token process. Although \"HR Support\" could be relevant if the leaver process has HR components, the emphasis seems squarely on access-related tasks. I'm going to refine this categorization.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR and Access**\n\nI'm now focusing on whether the ticket primarily concerns HR support or access management for leavers. The keyword analysis is highlighting a strong link to HR due to the \"leaver form\" and administrative processes. However, the requirement to close accounts and manage the token also points to access concerns. I'll need to weigh these two aspects further to determine the best categorization.\n\n\n**Determining Core Category**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category: \"HR Support\" vs. \"Access.\"  The \"leaver\" context points to HR, encompassing the full offboarding. While account closure is access-related, the ticket's scope is the *process* of an employee departing, from form completion to account shutdown. The ticket addresses the *overall* leaver flow, not just a single access issue. I'll stick with \"HR Support\" because it covers the process and its associated access implications. \"Access\" is a consequence of the HR process, not the driver.\n\n\n**Revising Categorization Focus**\n\nI'm now focusing on the ticket's primary concern: the \"leaver process.\"  It's clear the ticket covers both HR support and access management aspects. I am now leaning more towards \"HR Support\" because the ticket addresses the entire orchestration of an employee's departure, from forms to account closure. The emphasis is on the broader process flow and the support IT provides to it. \"Access\" is a necessary step, but a smaller part of the overall scope. This categorization best encapsulates the core IT support function related to the departure process.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"HR Support\" as the category. The \"leaver process\" encompasses IT's role in supporting the HR-driven employee departure, from form issues and automation failures to account closure. Although access is a key part of the process, the ticket's core issue lies in IT's support of the *overall* HR-managed leaver workflow, not just access management in isolation. \"HR Support\" accurately reflects this broader context.\n\n\n"
