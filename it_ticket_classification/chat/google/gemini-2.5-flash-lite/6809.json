The keywords \"leaver,\" \"ServiceNow,\" \"Frankfurt,\" and \"leaver form\" strongly suggest this falls under \"HR Support.\" I'll confirm this by reviewing the other listed options and ensuring a better match doesn't exist.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket description, recognizing \"leaver\" is the central theme. The details confirm it's an employee departure, touching on account deactivation, access rights, mailbox forwarding, and inventory. The focus is on the actions related to the \"leaver.\" I'm now leaning heavily towards a \"HR Support\" categorization, but I am still ensuring other options like \"Access\" aren't a better fit before finalizing the decision.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Alignment**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the ticket details to solidify the 'HR Support' category. Considering the actions required, I see the central theme remains the employee departure process. While access management is key, it's a direct consequence of the HR-initiated leaver workflow. I'm cross-referencing this against other ticket examples, ensuring this categorization logic remains consistent and applicable to similar cases.\n\n\n**Solidifying the 'HR Support' Choice**\n\nI'm now concluding that \"HR Support\" is the best fit. While \"Access\" is relevant due to the account deactivation, the overarching context centers on the employee's departure. The ticket details clearly indicate that the IT actions are a direct consequence of an HR-driven process. Examining the keywords and described activities, I see a clear alignment with the procedures of an employee departure handled by HR, which involves IT as a supporting role. I've re-examined the other categories, and it remains clear that the ticket is best classified as \"HR Support\".\n\n\n"
