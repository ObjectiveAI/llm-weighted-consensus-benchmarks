My process involves dissecting the description to identify key themes and keywords that align with \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\"\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm narrowing down the IT ticket category. The recurring emphasis on \"timecards,\" submission processes, and reminder notifications strongly suggests an HR or administrative function, steering me away from purely technical categories like hardware or storage. I'm considering \"HR Support\" or possibly \"Administrative Rights\" if the core issue is related to system permissions for managing these processes.\n\n**Assigning IT Ticket**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket details and the recurring themes point strongly towards HR processes, specifically around timecard submissions, onboarding dates, and reminder notifications. Based on this, I am confident assigning it to \"HR Support\".\n\n"
