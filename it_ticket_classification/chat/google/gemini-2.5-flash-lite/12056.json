My analysis suggests this likely falls under \"Miscellaneous,\" but I'm still weighing other options. Could it be related to \"Access\" or potentially \"Internal Project\"? My next step is to carefully re-examine the ticket text for any subtle clues that might point to a more precise category.\n\n\n**Defining Visibility Issue**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket text concerning the visibility of resolved tasks. It now appears the central concern is the display of \"done\" items, suggesting an issue with their task management system. I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category, as this appears to be a problem within an internal workflow. However, if this is a general issue with the platform, \"Miscellaneous\" might also be applicable. I need to clarify if this is a platform feature issue or a dedicated project.\n\n\n**Clarifying Internal Tool Function**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket, focusing on how resolved tasks are displayed. The recent text suggests a change in behavior within an internal tool. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Internal Project,\" as it appears related to managing internal workflows within their project system. This isn't hardware, HR, or external purchases. It's about an internal tool's features, making the \"Internal Project\" category the best fit. I'll need to confirm that this directly relates to the project management tool itself.\n\n\n**Defining Tool's Workflow**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the core issue: the visibility of resolved tasks. It's becoming clearer that this relates to a specific feature or workflow within their internal project management system. While \"Miscellaneous\" remains a possibility, the focus on the backlog and resolved tasks strongly suggests a problem with their internal project management tool, making \"Internal Project\" a more accurate categorization. I'll need to see if this affects the general system or just a specific project.\n\n\n**Focusing on Workflow's Visibility**\n\nThe issue appears to be centered on an internal system's functionality regarding visibility. The phrasing strongly suggests a project management or task-tracking context. I'm prioritizing \"Internal Project\" over \"Miscellaneous\" because the core issue is about managing internal workflows and tasks, which is the cornerstone of an Internal Project. It's about how the team is tracking its work, making the \"Internal Project\" category the better fit.\n\n\n"
