The text provided appears related to issues finding a person in the system, and is leaning towards Access-related issues. I am re-evaluating to be certain that my categorization is the best fit, and that I'm not overlooking any subtle clues that would be more fitting of other categories.\n\n\n**Assessing HR Relevance**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"HR Support\" category. The text's repeated mentions of \"users,\" \"add worked person,\" and \"user grade unit location\" strongly point towards an HR-related issue.  I am confident that this is the best fit, now that I have reviewed the other categories.\n\n\n**Categorizing HR Data Issue**\n\nI have carefully re-analyzed the text, considering all categories. The recurring phrases, specifically the repeated mentions of \"user,\" \"worked person,\" \"grade,\" \"unit,\" and \"location,\" have solidified my conclusion. The difficulty in \"finding\" and \"adding\" a \"worked person,\" combined with the context of user data and attributes, aligns precisely with HR-related support. I'm now confident that an issue with the underlying HR system is the root cause.\n\n\n"
