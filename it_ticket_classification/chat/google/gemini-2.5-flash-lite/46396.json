After analyzing the text, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support.\" The phrase \"cannot complete time card\" is a strong indicator, though I'm still weighing other possibilities, ensuring accuracy before making a definitive decision.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've just solidified my categorization. The time card issue, coupled with the detailed explanation of weekly submissions and the phrase \"established processes,\" solidified my choice of \"HR Support.\" It aligns perfectly with the problem description. I considered the other categories, but this seems to be the most relevant.\n\n\n"
