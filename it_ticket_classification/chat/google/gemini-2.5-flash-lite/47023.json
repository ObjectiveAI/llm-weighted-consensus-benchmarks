Initial analysis of \"leaver notification sent\" and \"received\" suggests it could relate to either HR Support or Access, potentially involving a departing employee. I'm leaning toward HR Support, but need more context for a definitive selection from the possible categories.\n\n\n**Categorizing Further Ticket Details**\n\nBased on additional phrases, I'm now certain this ticket concerns HR Support. The terms \"end date,\" \"exit interview,\" \"holiday,\" and \"leave balance\" confirm this. It appears to be related to finalizing a departing employee's information, specifically ensuring notifications are received and details are correct. The mailbox issue is likely secondary.\n\n\n"
