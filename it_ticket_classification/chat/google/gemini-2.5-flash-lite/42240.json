It's related to external connectivity. I'll need to confirm that this is a network issue, and not a server problem.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Access Problems**\n\nI've honed in on the access angle. The \"not accessible from outside\" statement is central. This strongly hints at a network issue, but I'm broadening it slightly to cover communication access and configuration. The 'undeliverable' messages seem to support this. I'm verifying that connectivity/configuration settings are the root cause and not a hardware fault, internal project, or administrative issue.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Focus**\n\nI'm solidifying my approach, now centered on Access. The text points to external accessibility problems. The core problem, \"not accessible from outside,\" aligns precisely with an access issue. 'Undeliverable' messages support this, suggesting either network connectivity or configuration settings. I'm certain now that Access is the correct label. I'm focusing on validating these two components and ruling out external system errors.\n\n\n"
