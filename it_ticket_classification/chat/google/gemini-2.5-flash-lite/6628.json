The key phrases \"meeting room notification resolved\" and \"issues resolved tested\" strongly suggest an incident closure or resolution, likely related to a communication system within the Thames meeting room.\n\n**Classifying Meeting Room Issue**\n\nI'm focusing on classifying the IT ticket. The phrases \"meeting room notification resolved\" and \"issues resolved tested\" point towards a resolution for a meeting room's functionality. Considering the available categories, \"Hardware\" seems most fitting if the problem involved equipment, otherwise \"Miscellaneous\" might be appropriate.\n\n**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm refining my categorization of the IT ticket. The phrases \"meeting room notification resolved\" and \"issues resolved tested\" strongly indicate a resolved incident within a meeting room environment. Given that meeting rooms often rely on AV equipment, displays, and control systems, \"Hardware\" appears to be the most precise classification for this resolved issue.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm finalizing the category for the IT ticket. The phrasing \"meeting room notification resolved\" and \"issues resolved tested\" strongly suggests a fix related to the physical components within the meeting room environment. Given this, \"Hardware\" appears to be the most appropriate classification.\n\n"
