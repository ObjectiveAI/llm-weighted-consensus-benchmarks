It points towards an access-related problem, but I need to ensure it's not a password reset that could be categorized differently, such as HR support. The repetition is making this a bit confusing.\n\n\n**Identifying the Root Cause**\n\nThe ticket text, \"changed password at and now having issues with and password changed password having issues with password\", definitively reveals access difficulties following a password change. Analyzing the core phrases - \"changed password\" and \"having issues\" - confirms that \"Access\" is the most fitting category. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, moving us closer to a solution.\n\n\n"
