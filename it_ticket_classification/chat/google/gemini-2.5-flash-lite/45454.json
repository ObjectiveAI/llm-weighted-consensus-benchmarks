The words \"editing rights,\" though lacking context, seem central, and I'm cross-referencing this against the available categories.\n\n\n**Defining the Access Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"Access\" category. The key terms \"editing rights,\" \"permissions,\" and the context of modifying documents strongly suggest this is the correct classification. Specifically, the ticket's description of who can view/edit what aligns perfectly with access control issues. The garbled nature of some phrases isn't blocking the identification of the access challenge. The word \"administration\" is the reason this has been selected.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text more closely, and the term \"administration\" keeps surfacing, leading me to focus on who is able to view and edit certain forms, indicating some level of access needs attention. I'm now leaning heavily towards \"Access\", as the central problem involves which employees have edit or view access to specific documents. This is a much stronger match than other options like \"Administrative Rights\", which is encompassed by \"Access\".\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Permissions**\n\nI'm now fully confident that the ticket falls under \"Access\". The phrase \"editing rights,\" mentioned consistently, seals it. I've considered that the term \"administration\" appears but this does not require administrative rights, but rather simply \"Access\". This covers the broader need for permissions. The core issue is who can perform certain actions on specific resources, which maps best to the \"Access\" category. \"Administrative Rights\", as a separate category, is too narrow. This encompasses \"Access\", as well as broader user permissions.\n\n\n"
