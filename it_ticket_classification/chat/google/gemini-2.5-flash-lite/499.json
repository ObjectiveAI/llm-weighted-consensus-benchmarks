Considering the options, I lean towards \"Access\" as the primary category. The mention of \"entities\" adds a layer that might suggest database or system access, which reinforces this choice. I need to make sure this is accurate, and I'll confirm.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've refined my thinking, solidifying \"Access\" as the right category. The consistent emphasis on \"accessing reports,\" coupled with phrases like \"visibility,\" confirmed this. I've ruled out alternatives like \"Administrative rights\" because the focus is on report access, not broader administrative privileges. My analysis of keywords and context strongly supports this conclusion.\n\n\n"
