The focus seems to be about removing someone from lists, which suggests an Access issue. I'm carefully considering if other categories might be relevant, like HR Support or Administrative rights, but \"Access\" appears to be the most fitting based on the limited information.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR and Access**\n\nI'm now leaning heavily towards a combined approach of HR and Access. While the initial instinct was Access, the \"former colleague\" detail keeps bringing me back to the HR implications of employee offboarding. It seems HR would initiate the removal, while IT manages the technical aspects of access revocation. This makes a combined HR/Access categorization most logical.\n\n\n**Confirming HR as Primary**\n\nI've determined that the key trigger is the employee departure, making HR the primary focus. While \"Access\" is involved, it's a consequence of the HR action. The phrase \"former colleague\" firmly places this as an HR-driven request. I'm now certain HR Support is the initial driver, with IT Access handling the technical removal.\n\n\n"
