I'm leaning toward \"HR Support,\" but it's a close call with \"Administrative rights.\" The lack of context is making this difficult. Perhaps the \"hi\" is relevant. I am going to choose HR support and see if anything changes.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Selection**\n\nI've meticulously analyzed the ticket content, and the pattern points strongly toward \"HR Support.\" The repeated mention of \"re submit\" and \"hours,\" along with the date references, clearly indicates an issue related to employee time tracking. This aligns perfectly with the functionalities typically handled within the HR domain, making it the most accurate choice.\n\n\n"
