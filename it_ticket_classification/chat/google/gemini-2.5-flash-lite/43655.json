After analyzing the text, my initial thought leans towards \"Access\" due to the mention of \"join meeting\" and potential connection issues. I am evaluating if \"Miscellaneous\" might also be applicable as the issues appear vague. I am going to explore other keywords to solidify the best match before settling on an answer.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've decided to refine my initial assessment. While \"Access\" seemed promising, upon deeper reflection, the phrase \"meeting errors\" suggests the problem might lie within the application itself, or the user's permissions related to the meeting software. \"Access\" is therefore still a good choice, as the error is related to access to a meeting application or platform, such as Zoom, Teams, or similar software. I am going to double-check this before I finalize the category.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nMy analysis indicates this is likely an \"Access\" issue. While other categories were considered, the core problem of \"meeting errors\" when attempting to join a meeting points towards a problem with accessing the meeting platform or service, rather than a more general software bug. This classification makes the most sense.\n\n\n"
