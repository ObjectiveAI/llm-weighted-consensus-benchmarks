The phrases \"time card status\" and \"card appears submitted although already approved\" are the key. I am currently evaluating \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" as the most likely fits. I am leaning towards \"HR Support\", but \"Access\" might also be applicable. I must consider if this is a systemic issue or a user-specific one.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"HR Support\". The \"time card\" focus is decisive. While \"Access\" could be relevant, the timecard issue clearly signals an HR process problem. The user's request for help further confirms the \"HR Support\" need. I am satisfied that I have made the correct decision.\n\n\n"
