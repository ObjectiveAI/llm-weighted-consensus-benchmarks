My current focus is on extracting key information like \"add at drive,\" \"db server,\" and the specified date and time to match against the provided categories.\n\n**Categorizing Database Requests**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the IT ticket. The mentions of \"add drive on db server,\" \"create column,\" \"delete column primary key,\" and database-related terms strongly suggest a focus on **Storage** and database administration. I'm narrowing down the categorization based on these specific technical actions described.\n\n**Processing Database Modifications**\n\nI'm actively analyzing the ticket's content, focusing on the specific database manipulations like \"create column,\" \"delete column primary key,\" and index/trigger references. This, combined with the earlier mention of adding a drive to the DB server, solidifies my assessment that the core request aligns with **Storage** operations and database infrastructure management.\n\n**Refining Database Categorization**\n\nI've refined my categorization further. The explicit request to \"add drive on db server\" strongly points towards \"Storage.\" The subsequent database modifications, like creating and deleting columns and managing keys, are closely tied to how data is organized and managed within that storage.\n\n"
