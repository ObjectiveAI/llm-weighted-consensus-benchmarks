The current challenge revolves around accurately classifying a reported laptop keyboard malfunction, especially when there's an \"accident\" potentially involved. I'm carefully comparing the ticket's specifics to the predefined categories to find the best fit.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Hardware Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the hardware nature of this problem. The coffee spill is the likely culprit for the malfunctioning keyboard. Disabling the built-in keyboard and using an external one seems like a temporary solution. I'm now certain \"Hardware\" is the correct category. I'm wrapping up my analysis.\n\n\n"
