It seems the core action is \"add users.\" I'm cross-referencing this with the available category schema to determine the most fitting classification. The phrase \"access to\" might also offer relevant clues, which I am noting for further refinement. The goal is to ensure a precise mapping to the appropriate category.\n\n\n**Mapping Intent to Schema**\n\nI've refined my category mapping. The initial focus on \"add users\" led me to consider \"Access\" as the primary classification. Further review confirmed that the phrasing aligns best. I initially considered \"Administrative rights,\" but the user's focus on adding members for access tips the scale towards the broader \"Access\" category as a more accurate representation of the ticket's core intent. I am now confident in this assignment.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nMy analysis of the ticket's text, specifically the terms \"add users\" and \"add members,\" reinforced the initial \"Access\" category assignment. I've ruled out \"Administrative rights\" since the ticket doesn't specify elevated privileges. It's now evident that the user is seeking general access granting. The other categories are simply irrelevant. I've concluded with high confidence that \"Access\" accurately reflects the user's intent.\n\n\n"
