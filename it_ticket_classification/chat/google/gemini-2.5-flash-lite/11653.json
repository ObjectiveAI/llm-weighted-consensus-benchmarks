The primary focus right now is discerning the best approach for the categories provided: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I'm focusing on \"unable to into com advise request thursday july pm unable order complete tomorrow\" to test the system. The next step is writing code to identify relevant keywords to automatically map a ticket to the defined categories.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've been drilling down on the \"unable to into com\" text, and the \"mistyped caps lock\" clue has been the key. It's becoming clearer that \"Access\" is the primary category. The \"order complete tomorrow\" element is distracting, but after deeper thought, seems secondary to the access issue. I'm focusing on strengthening the keyword mapping logic to handle this ambiguity and prioritize access-related indicators. My goal is to produce the output \"Access\".\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nOkay, the \"order complete tomorrow\" element now sounds like context: A new employee getting their new computer, and they can't access it. This reinforces that **Access** is the correct category, with the \"purchase\" potentially being a secondary consideration. I've decided to prioritize keywords related to login, access, and inability to enter, while taking \"order\" and \"computer\" into account as supporting but not primary indicators. The code will need to weight keywords accordingly.\n\n\n**Revising Category Priorities**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the role of \"order complete tomorrow\" and determined its supporting, not primary. Considering that the text specifies \"unable to into com\" and a \"mistyped caps lock\", I'm now prioritizing direct login issues over purchase implications. \"Access\" remains the clear primary category, with purchase being a secondary consideration.\n\n\n"
