The text seems sparse, but I'm focusing on keywords and phrases to make an informed decision. I've narrowed down the options based on the available categories provided, attempting to filter out any extraneous information. My primary focus is to identify the most fitting category for this particular issue.\n\n\n**Categorizing Network Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the key phrase, \"desktop pc network connection issue.\" After carefully weighing the options against the ticket text, I'm leaning toward \"Hardware.\" Although network connectivity could indirectly relate to access, the core problem is the PC's connection itself. I'm prioritizing the direct description over potential indirect implications for now, but I still need to make a final decision, after considering more.\n\n\n"
