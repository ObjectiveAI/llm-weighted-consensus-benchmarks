The text \"install for non local admin rights\" is being carefully assessed to pinpoint the best fit. My initial assessment leans towards \"Administrative rights,\" but I need to ensure this is the most accurate choice.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe text analysis is moving forward, and I've significantly narrowed it down to the \"Administrative rights\" category. I am now working on further refining this decision. The recurring theme of \"install\" alongside the need for elevated privileges, such as \"run administrator\" and \"entering credentials\", is solidifying this choice. I am also considering the context of \"software authentication\" and user access. The process is nearing completion.\n\n\n**Defining the Scope**\n\nI am now focusing on refining the ticket classification. The analysis of \"install for non local admin rights\" and the included documentation has highlighted a range of issues. I am evaluating if this falls under \"Administrative rights\" or should also include \"Access.\" I have identified that software installation and certificate management are central to this.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nMy analysis indicates that \"Administrative rights\" is still the most relevant category. The provided details emphasize installation procedures requiring elevated privileges and user rights management. After further review, I am leaning toward \"Access\" for the end-user needing to access the software. Still working on nailing down the ticket priority.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy analysis indicates that \"Administrative rights\" is the most relevant category. The text highlights installing software with elevated privileges, user access management, and certificate configuration. I am also thinking about adding another category to better encapsulate the essence of this particular ticket. My focus now is on what combination of keywords best represent all of the necessary facets of the issues.\n\n\n"
