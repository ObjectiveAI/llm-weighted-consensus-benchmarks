The text \"activate cards\" seems to point towards an access-related issue. My goal is to achieve accurate categorization based on keyword analysis.\n\n\n**Defining Keyword Relevance**\n\nI've been refining my approach to keyword relevance. Analyzing \"activate cards\" and \"add colleagues\" points me towards HR onboarding/offboarding or access control. \"Analysis,\" \"app,\" and \"testing\" seem more aligned with internal projects or app-related issues. The term \"badge\" further reinforces the access or HR angle. My current focus is weighting keywords to improve the categorization accuracy.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text, focusing on the keywords. \"Activate cards\" and \"badge\" are key, strongly suggesting an access-related issue. \"Add colleagues\" reinforces this. While \"analysis,\" \"app,\" and \"testing\" are present, they seem secondary. My current thinking leans heavily towards categorizing this as \"Access.\"\n\n\n"
