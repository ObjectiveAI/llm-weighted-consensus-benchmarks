The urgency expressed further solidifies this direction.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Classification**\n\nOkay, I've eliminated the irrelevant options. \"Hardware\" is the standout choice. The phone's charging issue and suspected battery failure perfectly align. I've considered that the request is urgent, which also supports this classification. The phone is not working as intended, and the user needs this solved quickly.\n\n\n"
