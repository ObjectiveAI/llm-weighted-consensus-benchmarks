The phrase \"annual satisfaction survey\" is clearly a key indicator. I'm leaning toward classifying this as \"HR Support\" due to the survey's nature, but I need to ensure there are no other clues.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category for this ticket. The content revolves around an \"annual satisfaction survey\" with phrases like \"feedback annual survey\" and a \"survey link,\" solidifying the HR connection. While there might be a minor technical aspect, the core issue aligns directly with HR processes, and I've excluded other, less relevant categories.\n\n\n"
