My initial focus is on \"leaver mobile subscription notification.\" This suggests a potential HR or administrative aspect. Further analysis will determine if additional elements point toward other categories.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nI've refined my initial analysis, and the emphasis on \"leaver\" and mobile subscription management clearly leans towards HR Support, though Hardware is indirectly involved. The key is how mobile subscriptions and numbers are handled during the leaver process. I'm now certain this fits the HR Support category, and not Hardware or Access.\n\n\n**Clarifying Category Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. Analyzing the ticket text, the \"leaver\" aspect dominates, strongly suggesting HR involvement. Mobile subscription details and hardware removal are linked to the leaving process. HR Support is the primary driver, rather than strictly hardware or access issues. It clearly centers on HR's mobile service management during a user's exit.\n\n\n"
