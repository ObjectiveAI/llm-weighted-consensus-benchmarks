It seems the user's focus revolves around a change, likely within an HR system or similar platform. The phrases \"change of line manager,\" \"reopened form,\" and \"clicked save\" suggest this. I believe the core issue points towards an issue with user access or a specific HR-related function, leaning me towards a decision between HR Support and Access.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe analysis of the ticket description has deepened. The repeated mention of \"change of line manager\" remains the strongest indicator. While there's a technical issue, the *what* not the *how* guides the categorization. The user's goal (change of line manager) aligns directly with the \"HR Support\" option. I am moving towards finalizing the category as HR Support, focusing on the core business process.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's language, focusing on the intent behind the technical hiccups. The phrase \"change of line manager\" is the crux of the user's issue. Despite the technical difficulties described, the user's main objective is a change within the HR system, leading me to definitively classify it under HR Support. The other categories don't align with the underlying process.\n\n\n"
