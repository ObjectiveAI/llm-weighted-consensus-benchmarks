The focus right now is on understanding the nature of the inquiry. I've ruled out several options, and I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as the most suitable fit, given the reference to \"story points\" which often relates to project management. The other options seem less relevant based on the information I've gleaned from the ticket's description.\n\n\n**Revising Category Selection**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's content and the category options. \"Internal Project\" is still the strongest contender, given the clear connection to agile methodologies and project management concepts like \"story points.\" However, I'm now also considering \"Miscellaneous\" as a potential secondary classification, as the request could involve a custom setting, which doesn't directly fit other categories. I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the primary categorization.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Decision**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's text, focusing on the \"story points\" mention. This strongly points towards an internal project, especially given the context of \"custom total\" and \"automat\". I've ruled out \"Miscellaneous\" as primary, because the ticket clearly relates to project tracking, a distinct area. \"Internal Project\" is the best fit now.\n\n\n"
