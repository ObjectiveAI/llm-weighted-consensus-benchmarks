The \"internal audit\" phrase strongly hints at a compliance-related task. I'm focusing on keywords like \"visitor cards\" and \"review\" to identify the specific action needed. The goal is to determine the appropriate category based on the provided schema.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Strategy**\n\nMy focus has shifted towards the specific aspects of \"Access\" as a category. While \"Internal Audit\" initially pointed towards broader compliance, the user's focus on visitor cards points toward Access as a better fit. I'm now fine-tuning the definition of \"Access\" to capture not just entry/exit but also information management related to visitor access. The keywords are leading me to believe the audit is centered on data security.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've taken a deep dive into the provided ticket details. The language of the ticket (\"internal audit,\" \"visitor cards,\" \"review,\" \"accurate\") solidified my initial inclination. After meticulously comparing these elements with the available categories, I've confirmed that \"Access\" is the most precise. It directly addresses the review and management of visitor access, which are central to the ticket's purpose.\n\n\n"
