After analyzing the phrases \"switch access cards\" and \"granted,\" it seems the ticket primarily concerns access control. Therefore, \"Access\" is the most fitting category. This decision is based on the key phrases within the ticket's text.\n\n\n**Evaluating Ticket Category**\n\nI've re-evaluated the categorization. While \"Access\" seemed initially correct, the phrases \"granted cleaning switched shifts,\" \"work mornings evenings\" point towards HR involvement. Managing access cards based on shifts falls under HR operations. \"HR Support\" now appears the most accurate fit over \"Access.\"\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Control**\n\nI've re-evaluated again, and I'm leaning back towards \"Access\". While HR implications exist, the central action is \"switch access cards.\" The shift and cleaning details explain the *why*, which influences access management. The request is ultimately about provisioning or modifying access credentials.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Focus**\n\nI've reviewed the reasoning and the ticket's core request. The phrases \"switch access cards\" and the underlying need to manage access based on shift details point firmly towards \"Access.\" While HR implications exist, the *action* is about *managing physical access credentials* and the shift details explain the context. The ticket aims to change access, not to change the shift policy. Categorizing it under \"Access\" covers the main task.\n\n\n"
