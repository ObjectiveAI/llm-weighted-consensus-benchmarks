The phrasing \"on is not working\" and the impact on productivity strongly suggest a hardware-related issue, though I'm keeping \"Miscellaneous\" as a secondary consideration due to some ambiguous wording.\n\n**Classifying IT Ticket Content**\n\nI'm currently focused on definitively classifying the IT ticket. The repeated emphasis on productivity impact and urgency, combined with the ambiguous phrase \"on is not working,\" leads me to lean towards \"Hardware\" as the most probable category, assuming \"on\" refers to a malfunctioning device or component.\n\n**Resolving Ticket Category**\n\nI'm narrowing down the category for this IT ticket. The strong emphasis on productivity impact and urgency, coupled with the ambiguous \"on is not working\" phrase, leads me to finalize \"Hardware\" as the most probable classification.\n\n**Classifying IT Issue**\n\nI'm finalizing the categorization for this IT ticket. The emphasis on productivity impact and urgency, coupled with the vague \"on is not working\" phrase, strongly suggests a hardware malfunction.\n\n"
