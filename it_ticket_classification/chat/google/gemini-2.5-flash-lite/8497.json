I'm leaning toward these options at the moment and will need more context.\n\n\n**Analyzing HR Relevance**\n\nThe recurring phrase \"sick leave\" and several mentions of \"consult\" have now clearly led me to prioritize HR Support. I've thoroughly considered each category, and the evidence points definitively to employee leave or related HR processes. After careful examination of each option, I have decided to select \"HR Support\".\n\n\n"
