My current focus is on identifying keywords and phrases that will help me categorize the ticket accurately according to the provided schema. I'm exploring various potential categories, considering the scope of each option.\n\n\n**Deciphering Ticket Content**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text to pinpoint the core issue. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" due to the emphasis on time cards, approvals, and submission deadlines, but there's a possibility it crosses into \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" based on error descriptions. The JSON output will reflect the most appropriate category. My focus is now on ensuring the category accurately reflects the user's need.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Scope**\n\nI've determined the ticket falls under \"HR Support.\" My analysis of the text identified key phrases like \"time card issues,\" \"submit for approval,\" and \"rejected card,\" solidifying this categorization. The focus is on processes within the HR system rather than technical access or hardware problems. My JSON output will reflect this classification.\n\n\n"
