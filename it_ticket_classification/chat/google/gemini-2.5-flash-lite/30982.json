The ticket mentions a \"replacement for cordless mouse\" \u2013 that seems straightforward. I need to figure out which category from the list best fits this request. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware,\" but I want to make sure I'm not overlooking anything. The simplicity of the request is throwing me a little. I want to make certain.\n\n\n**Defining the Best Fit**\n\nI've refined my thinking on the ticket. The \"hardware\" category is the clear frontrunner for this one. After reviewing the options, I eliminated the others as they didn't quite capture the core request. It's a simple case of replacing a physical component, and the label should reflect that. I am set on \"Hardware\", unless there's an unforeseen nuance.\n\n\n"
