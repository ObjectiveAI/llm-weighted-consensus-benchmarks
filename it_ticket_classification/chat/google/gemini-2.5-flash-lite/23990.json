The goal is to identify the most relevant category from the options provided. It appears the initial phrase \"should...\" points to a request rather than a factual reporting of an issue. I'm carefully evaluating the full ticket context to make an accurate categorization within the given constraints.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and the provided category options to narrow down the possible matches. The initial focus on \"removed from notifications\" and \"shared users\" has led me towards options related to user access or subscription management. I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the most appropriate category. I am still considering other options, but the primary focus seems related to access controls.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've examined the ticket content and identified key phrases like \"removed from notifications\" and \"shared users.\" The context suggests a need to manage user access and subscriptions. \"Access\" is the most fitting category, as it directly relates to modifying permissions and notifications for users. I'm confident \"Access\" accurately reflects the core issue presented in the ticket.\n\n\n"
