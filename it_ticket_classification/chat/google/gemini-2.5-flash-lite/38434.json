The user needs to input \"forced hours\" and then \"resubmit.\" This points toward an application or system issue rather than hardware, so I'm focusing on software-related categories.\n\n**Resolving Ticket Category**\n\nI'm refining my categorization. The \"forced hours\" and \"resubmit\" keywords strongly suggest an application issue, likely within a time-tracking or project management system. I'm considering \"HR Support\" as the closest fit, given the context of hours, unless a more specific application category emerges.\n\n**Categorizing System Error**\n\nI'm focusing on categorizing an IT ticket. The user's issue with \"forced hours\" and the need to \"resubmit\" strongly indicates a problem within an application or system that handles time entry, making \"HR Support\" the most fitting category due to its relation to work hours and potential system oversight by HR.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI'm continuing to refine the categorization of this IT ticket. The user's request to fix an issue with \"forced hours\" and the subsequent need to \"resubmit\" strongly suggests a problem within a time-tracking or project management system. I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate classification given the context of work hours.\n\n"
