Initial troubleshooting seems ineffective, so I'm now leaning towards \"Hardware\" or \"Access\" as the most likely categories. This requires further investigation to determine if it's a hardware fault or a broader network access problem.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Root**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the \"no network connection\" ticket. I've ruled out HR Support, and Internal Projects, and I'm currently torn between \"Hardware\" and \"Access\" as the primary culprits. Focusing on the device itself and considering the provided hardware, I'm leaning more towards a hardware-level issue.\n\n\n"
