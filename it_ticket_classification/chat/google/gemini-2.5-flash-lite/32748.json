Keywords like \"purchase request\" and \"purchased\" are strong indicators. I'm also considering adding related synonyms to improve accuracy and reduce false negatives. I'm working to expand the initial classification based on the schema I was provided.\n\n\n**Analyzing Purchase Signals**\n\nI've further analyzed the keywords in the ticket description. \"Purchase request\", \"purchased\", and related phrases leave no doubt about the \"Purchase\" category. The presence of \"items\",  \"approval\",  and \"user guide\" related to a purchase further solidifies this conclusion. I have now successfully classified it as a \"Purchase\" ticket.\n\n\n"
