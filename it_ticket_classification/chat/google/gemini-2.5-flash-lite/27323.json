My goal is to select the single most fitting category as required by the schema.\n\n**Determining the Category**\n\nI've reviewed the IT ticket description and identified keywords related to disabling mailbox forwarding, indicating an action concerning an employee's email services. Considering the available categories, \"Access\" appears to be the most fitting choice, as it directly encompasses managing user accounts and their associated functionalities.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the IT ticket description regarding disabling mailbox forwarding for a departing employee. Based on the keywords and available options, I've determined that the \"Access\" category is the most fitting classification for this request.\n\n"
