The content suggests a recurring notification issue, potentially related to a specific system.\n\n**Sorting Ticket Data**\n\nI'm sifting through the ticket text, identifying keywords like \"leaver,\" \"delete,\" and \"absence,\" which strongly indicate the issue relates to managing employee records and access after they've departed the company. The focus is on ensuring proper cleanup of accounts and data.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI've refined my analysis of the ticket's content. The recurring mention of \"leavers,\" \"deletions,\" and managing \"direct reports\" in relation to absences strongly indicates the core issue lies within HR processes and employee record management. This leads me to believe \"HR Support\" is the most accurate categorization.\n\n"
