The key is differentiating between \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" given the nuances of correcting incorrect system entries stemming from hiring status. I believe \"HR Support\" is the stronger fit due to the core data correction required.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the ticket's content to pinpoint the most accurate category from the provided list.
