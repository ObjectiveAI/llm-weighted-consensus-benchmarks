The consistent mention of \"snow\" strongly suggests this is related to a specific system, likely requiring access. The recurring \"unable to log in\" phrases solidify access as the core problem. I'm leaning toward categorizing this as \"Access\", given the emphasis.\n\n\n**Focusing on Categorization**\n\nI've determined that the user's ticket clearly falls under the \"Access\" category. The repeated phrases \"unable to log into snow\" and \"access snow error\" all point toward a login/access issue. I've ruled out other categories like \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" as irrelevant, and \"Administrative rights\" is not the core problem. The issue is simply inability to access, so \"Access\" is most accurate. I'm ready to output this in the required JSON format.\n\n\n"
