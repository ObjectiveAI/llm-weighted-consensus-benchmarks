The phrase \"issues on submit\" immediately suggests a problem related to submission, likely within a time tracking or project management tool. I'm focusing on keywords like \"working hours,\" \"error,\" and \"holiday\" to narrow down the specific nature of the issue. The goal is to accurately categorize it for efficient resolution.\n\n\n**Determining Best Fit Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket description, focusing on keywords like \"working hours,\" \"submit,\" and \"holiday app.\" The user's mention of errors and attempts to troubleshoot the \"tool activity\" points directly towards an HR-related system, likely time tracking. Considering the options, \"HR Support\" appears to be the most accurate category, as the issue stems from a functional problem within an HR-related tool concerning working hours submission and holiday applications.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI'm now fully confident in the \"HR Support\" category. The ticket describes problems submitting working hours and using the holiday application, both core HR functions.  The reference to an \"error\" reinforces that the issue is not related to access or hardware but to the correct operation of an HR-related tool. The user's efforts to troubleshoot the \"tool activity\" strengthen the conclusion that this is a functional problem within an HR system.\n\n\n"
