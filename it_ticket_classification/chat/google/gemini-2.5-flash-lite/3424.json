It seems related to onboarding, which leads me to consider potential options like \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" I'm deliberating between these two, weighing the implications of a \"new starter\" in terms of access provisioning versus general HR support.\n\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's text: \"new starter kale building starter form induction hi bile please complete attached empty part thank officer.\" Focusing on \"new starter\" and \"induction\" is key. These point strongly to HR processes. While \"Access\" could be relevant, \"HR Support\" appears more comprehensive as it encompasses the entire onboarding process, including but not limited to access provisioning. Therefore, I'm leaning toward definitively categorizing this as \"HR Support,\" as the trigger seems entirely HR-driven.\n\n\n**Revising Categorization Focus**\n\nThe ticket seems entirely about onboarding, explicitly mentioning a \"new starter\" and \"induction.\" While there might be resulting IT actions like access provisioning, the initial trigger and core intent are clearly HR-driven. The term \"starter form\" further solidifies this. I'm confidently classifying it as \"HR Support\" because the IT aspects are likely consequences of an HR process.\n\n\n"
