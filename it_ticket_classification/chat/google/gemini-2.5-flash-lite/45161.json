Currently, I'm leaning toward the \"HR Support\" category as it relates to timecard submission.  I'm ruling out \"Hardware\" as it doesn't align with the issue.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've honed in on the HR Support category for the IT ticket. The saved-but-not-submitted Oracle timecard issue squarely fits. I've ruled out all other options, like \"Hardware\" and \"Access\", as irrelevant.  \"Miscellaneous\" felt too vague, and the others were clearly off-target. This is a solid fit for HR-related timecard support.\n\n\n"
