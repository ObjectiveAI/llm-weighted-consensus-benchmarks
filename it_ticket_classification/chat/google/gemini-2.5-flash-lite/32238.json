Keywords like \"purchase requisition,\" \"licenses,\" and \"acquisition\" are consistent. Delving deeper, \"approvers,\" \"cost,\" and \"inventory issue\" reinforce its procurement nature. The client's need is clearly software acquisition related, not hardware or HR, access, storage, internal projects or administrative rights.\n\n\n"
