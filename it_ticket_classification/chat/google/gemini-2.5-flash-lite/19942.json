The key phrase \"old and new permissions migration\" suggests an **Access** issue, as it pertains to user rights. This aligns with a need to modify or update access levels related to the user who is leaving, which often involves adjusting permissions and access control.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Leaver Ticket**\n\nThe initial focus on the user's access needs is clear. I've broken down the ticket text and reviewed possible categories.  Keywords point to access control tasks tied to a departing employee. \"Access\" is indeed the most appropriate category, as it encompasses permissions migration, unassigned accounts, and transfer of site library ownership.\n\n\n"
