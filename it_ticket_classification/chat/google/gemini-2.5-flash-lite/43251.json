My initial assessment leans toward \"Access,\" given the mention of a lost access card and the request to disable it. However, I'm also considering potential overlaps with \"HR Support\" if the access card relates to employment or employee information. This will require further analysis, the goal is to map the ticket accurately.\n\n\n**Clarifying Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've determined that the ticket should be assigned to the \"Access\" category. The text highlights a lost access card needing deactivation and replacement, aligning directly with access control processes. While there's a slight possibility of HR overlap, the core issue is immediate access, solidifying \"Access\" as the primary focus.\n\n\n"
