                    "reasoning": "**Pinpointing Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm currently zeroing in on the text. My focus is on extracting the key terms: \"leaver service\" and \"leaver form.\" This will help me select the most accurate category from the list. I'm leaning toward either \"HR Support\" or \"Access\", but need more context to be sure.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Choices**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the text and identifying key phrases.  The \"leaver\" theme is overwhelmingly strong, clearly suggesting employee termination. I'm seeing supporting IT deprovisioning actions too, like mailbox access and deprovisioning, but the central thread is HR related. After reviewing all potential choices, I'm strongly leaning toward \"HR Support\". The other suggested categories just don't fit the pattern of this text.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Ticket Category**\n\nI've been meticulously reviewing the text and the potential categories. The \"leaver\" references are abundant, clearly indicating an employee departure.  While the IT tasks are critical (access revocation, account deprovisioning), the trigger is inherently an HR process. Although \"Access\" is relevant to the technical actions, the overall request is anchored in employee termination.  I'm now confidently deciding on \"HR Support\", as it best reflects the root cause and initiating department.\n\n\n**Deciding the Primary Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories extensively. While \"Access\" is relevant due to the IT deprovisioning tasks, the core of the request is driven by the \"leaver\" process, firmly placing it in HR's domain. The \"leaver form,\" \"leaving details,\" and the overarching context of employee termination strongly point to \"HR Support\" as the primary category, with IT activities acting as crucial supporting actions. The ticket is fundamentally a request from or on behalf of HR, even if IT carries out the technical work. I am now confidently assigning the category as \"HR Support\", recognizing the integral role of IT within the context of the larger HR process.\n\n\n**Reaffirming HR-Driven Nature**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the text, carefully weighing all elements to refine the category choice. The \"leaver\" theme is overwhelmingly dominant, and all actions listed within the text are directly in response to that leaver context. While IT's \"access\" activities are crucial (mailbox, AD rights), they are the *consequence* of the employee's departure. The ticket itself stems from an event that's fundamentally an HR concern. Considering the origin of this request, I will categorize the ticket as \"HR Support\".\n\n\n**Solidifying HR Support Justification**\n\nI'm now completely focused on the text, carefully weighing the nuances of each phrase. While \"Access\" is relevant due to deprovisioning tasks, the overwhelming emphasis on \"leaver\" processes makes \"HR Support\" the clear frontrunner. I'm focusing on the context; the IT actions are in support of an HR-led event. The phrases \"leaver service\", \"leaver form,\" etc. solidify that the request originates from HR, even if IT executes the technical steps.\n\n\n"
