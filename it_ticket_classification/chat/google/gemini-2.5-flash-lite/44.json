It seems related to cloning or self-service dashboards, but the context is still a bit hazy. I'm focusing on keywords like \"clone,\" \"dashboard,\" and \"self-service\" to determine the best fit among the provided options. My inclination is leaning towards something related to the system's \"Internal Projects.\"\n\n\n**Defining the Scope**\n\nI've been examining the text more closely, focusing on phrases like \"cloning\" and \"dashboard.\" It's becoming clearer that this ticket is centered around the replication and adaptation of existing dashboard elements. \"Snow\" probably references a platform like ServiceNow, which narrows the focus further. My current hypothesis leans towards categorizing this under \"Internal Project\" due to the emphasis on internal system customization.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Category**\n\nI'm now fully convinced that this falls under \"Internal Project.\" The user is aiming to clone and customize dashboards and widgets, specifically for \"sd specialists\" to monitor tickets. \"Snow,\" likely ServiceNow, confirms the system focus. I've ruled out other categories, and \"Internal Project\" best reflects the goal of improving internal tools.\n\n\n**Defining the Scope Further**\n\nI'm now fully confident that the ticket falls squarely under \"Internal Project.\" The focus on cloning dashboards, widgets, and user profiles, combined with the \"Snow\" reference (likely ServiceNow), points directly to an internal initiative to improve monitoring and reporting capabilities for the \"sd specialists.\" The core request is clearly about *building* or *enhancing* an internal system, so I'm finalizing this.\n\n\n"
