My focus is on mapping keywords to the predefined schema categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I anticipate this will fall under \"Purchase\" given the mention of invoices.\n\n**Routing Pending Approvals**\n\nI'm refining my categorization logic for IT tickets. While \"invoices pending approval\" initially suggested \"Purchase,\" I'm leaning towards a more nuanced classification due to the emphasis on the *approval workflow* and *reassignment* rather than a direct procurement action. The \"accountant\" and \"reassign for approval\" phrases are key indicators.\n\n**Refining Invoice Routing**\n\nMy ongoing analysis of ticket content is refining the categorization logic. While \"invoices pending approval\" initially pointed to \"Purchase,\" I'm now focusing on the core request: the *reassignment* of a task within an approval workflow. This suggests a more administrative or workflow-oriented classification might be more precise.\n\n**Refining Invoice Routing**\n\nI'm refining my categorization logic for IT tickets.

While \"invoices pending approval\" initially suggested a \"Purchase\" category, the emphasis on \"reassign\" and the context of the accountant suggests a focus on workflow management within financial processes, rather than a direct procurement action.\n\n**Processing Workflow Bottlenecks**\n\nI'm continuing to refine the categorization of incoming IT tickets. My latest focus is on distinguishing between direct purchase requests and administrative tasks related to ongoing financial processes, such as invoice approval workflows and the necessary reassignments within them.\n\n**Revising Invoice Workflow Logic**\n\nMy current analysis is focusing on the core action: reassigning tasks within an invoice approval workflow.
