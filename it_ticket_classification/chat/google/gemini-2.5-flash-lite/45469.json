However, I need to consider other factors before making a final decision.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Category**\n\nI'm now certain the ticket belongs in the \"Storage\" category. Key phrases like \"issue with work storage,\" \"runs out,\" and \"free up space\" are undeniable indicators. The user's description of files taking up less space than the phone reports further reinforces this conclusion. It's a clear-cut storage issue.\n\n\n"
