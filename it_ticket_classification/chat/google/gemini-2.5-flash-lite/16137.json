The key phrase \"project pm add issue type\" suggests this might fall under \"Internal Project,\" focusing on project management software configurations. I'm cross-referencing this with the list of possible categories to confirm if it's the best fit.\n\n\n**Defining the System Scope**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the system aspects. While HR concepts are present, the core request is about defining 'issue types' within a system. 'Internal Project' still seems most apt as I'm focused on configuration and adding features to an internal system, refining the project management module. The ticket details are centered on a workflow within a software tool.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Details**\n\nI've further analyzed the ticket and confirmed my categorization. The intricate details concerning the \"issue types,\" candidate management, interview stages, and grading all strongly indicate a system being actively built or refined. My focus is on the software aspect, and I see the request as a software improvement, likely for a project management or workflow system. This falls comfortably under the umbrella of an \"Internal Project,\" given the focus on internal processes and system enhancements. The user's request centers on project configurations for an internal project, so this should be an easy classification.\n\n\n"
