Based on the provided text, the keywords \"needs proper equipment\" immediately point toward a hardware-related issue.  I am confident that this ticket falls into the \"Hardware\" category.\n\n\n**Analyzing Purchase Needs**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment of the IT ticket. While hardware was initially considered, the explicit request for cost approval and equipment acquisition now strongly suggests a \"Purchase\" category assignment. The ticket details clearly revolve around the procurement process, making it a more accurate fit than \"Hardware\" or other potential options.\n\n\n"
