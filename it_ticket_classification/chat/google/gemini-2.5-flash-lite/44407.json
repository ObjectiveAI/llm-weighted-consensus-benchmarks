A final category choice is imminent.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've meticulously reviewed the ticket details, correlating keywords like \"connection\" and \"signing\" with potential categories. My analysis strongly supports \"Access\" due to the emphasis on external connectivity and authorization. Though \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility, the core issue appears to be general access, making \"Access\" the definitive choice.\n\n\n"
