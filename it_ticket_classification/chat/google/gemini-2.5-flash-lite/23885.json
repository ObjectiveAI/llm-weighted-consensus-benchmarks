I've analyzed the text and am considering the keywords related to leave requests and approvals. My initial thought is it relates to an access issue, but the phrasing is vague. The \"stuck\" aspect leans towards a system problem, possibly \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" since it mentions leave, but \"Administrative rights\" is unrelated. More context is needed, as it doesn't clearly fall into a single category.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"HR Support\" category as the best fit. While there are elements of workflow and access implied by \"skip approvers,\" the heart of the issue is the annual leave request being stalled. I've ruled out \"Access\" as the primary issue, though access might be an indirect consequence. Hardware, storage, purchase, internal project, and administrative rights are clearly irrelevant. The keywords and context solidify \"HR Support\" as the optimal categorization.\n\n\n"
