Initial assessment suggests it's likely related to \"Storage\" or \"Hardware,\" given the server restore context. Further refinement of the keywords might lead to a more definitive classification.\n\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted to the 'Storage' category, as the server restore context strongly aligns. I've re-evaluated the keywords: \"service recovery,\" \"restore,\" and \"template\" all point towards a storage-related issue, possibly a data backup or recovery process. Though it could be broadly categorized under 'Miscellaneous', 'Storage' seems a more accurate fit given the emphasis on server operations and data handling. The documentation aspects lend further credence to this classification.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category: Storage**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Storage\" as the definitive category. Server restoration, service recovery, and the associated documentation (templates, instructions, reports) all strongly suggest a storage-centric issue. The keywords \"server restore,\" \"restore template,\" and \"service recovery\" solidify this classification. My assessment leans toward storage as the most relevant category given the inherent connection between restoration and backup systems.\n\n\n**Confirming \"Storage\" Classification**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Storage\". The keywords solidify this. \"Server restore\" signifies data management. The \"service recovery test\" is a storage system activity. Documentation like \"restore template\" is storage-related. Considering the schema, \"Storage\" is the best fit, despite the lack of a \"Server Maintenance\" category. The test emphasizes storage system integrity.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category: Storage**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Storage\" as the definitive category.

My assessment leans toward storage as the most relevant category given the inherent connection between restoration and backup systems.\n\n\n**Focusing on the Core Issue**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Storage\" classification. Server restoration fundamentally links to data management and backup systems. The \"annual service recovery test\" description cements this connection. Documentation like \"restore template\" and \"work instruction\" are clearly storage-related. Considering the given schema and the nature of \"server restore,\" this category is the most fitting.\n\n\n"
