The \"servers audit\" aspect is pretty clear-cut, but the repeated mentions of \"decommission\" are the crux. I'm focusing on those keywords to determine the best category for this ticket. My initial lean is toward \"Storage\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but I need to make a more informed decision.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Focus**\n\nMy current thinking is zeroing in on \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate category. The presence of keywords like \"servers,\" \"machines,\" and the dominant theme of \"decommission\" all point directly towards hardware management. While \"Storage\" might be indirectly relevant, the core action described leans heavily on physical equipment removal. I've ruled out other categories like \"Miscellaneous\" as less specific and \"Purchase\" as a less appropriate fit given the context of decommissioning. I'm confident in my selection now.\n\n\n**Determining Best Ticket Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's language, concentrating on the \"decommission\" instances alongside other key terms. While the \"order\" aspect is present, the overarching theme of server/machine removal has solidified my choice. My evaluation ruled out \"Purchase\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" landing solidly on \"Hardware\" because it directly addresses the action described in the ticket. The additional phrases, like \"running decommission\" and the \"servers audit,\" all reinforce this choice. I am confident now that the best category is \"Hardware.\"\n\n\n"
