My latest approach involves identifying key phrases and their relevance to the allowed categories, with particular attention to terms that suggest hardware requests. I'm exploring different methods to make this more accurate than before, and the early results look promising, although there's still room for improvement.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Hardware Detection**\n\nCurrently, I'm focusing on strengthening my ability to recognize and classify hardware-related IT tickets. My recent efforts have centered on identifying specific keywords and phrases indicative of hardware issues, such as \"install working station\" and \"os profile needs diagnose,\" which clearly suggest a \"Hardware\" category. I am working on enhancing the accuracy of this detection to avoid misclassifications.\n\n\n"
