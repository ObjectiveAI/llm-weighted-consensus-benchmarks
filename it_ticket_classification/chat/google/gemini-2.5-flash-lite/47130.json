It appears to involve adding new team members, which I believe falls under \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access\" given the context of onboarding. I'll cross-reference this with the JSON schema's definitions for each category to make the final determination.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Access**\n\nI'm focusing on classifying the ticket by examining the user's difficulties in finding and adding new team members. The core problem seems to revolve around access permissions and user identification within systems, leading me to categorize it under \"Access\" as the most fitting option.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket details and the provided schema. The recurring theme of difficulty in finding and adding users strongly indicates an \"Access\" issue, rather than a hardware or HR problem. This classification best reflects the user's core challenge.\n\n"
