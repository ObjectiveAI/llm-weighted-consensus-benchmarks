                    "reasoning": "**Identifying Ticket Focus**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the ticket content to determine the most relevant category.  The frequent mention of \"neptune meeting room\" is a key indicator.  I'm weighing this against the provided categories, considering the context of the ticket's overall purpose and the specific needs. It seems to be gravitating toward a specific area of support.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI've determined that the ticket primarily concerns hardware procurement and installation, coupled with the need for a purchase requisition. The language used, like \"purchase,\" \"buy,\" \"cameras,\" and \"mount TV,\" heavily implies this. It also suggests, but not exclusively, a need for the correct IT category. While \"Internal Project\" is a possibility, \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase\" offer a more precise fit based on the ticket's direct content.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Scope**\n\nI've refined the ticket focus based on further analysis. The \"neptune meeting room\" context, alongside requests for \"purchase requisition\" and \"buy\" for cameras and TV mounting, solidifies its primary concern. I'm now leaning more towards a combined \"Purchase\" and \"Hardware\" categorization due to the focus on procuring physical equipment and the related purchase process. The \"installation genius\" also heavily implies the hardware domain.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Scope - Revisited**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket to pinpoint the primary focus for optimal categorization. Considering the \"Purchase\" and \"Hardware\" labels, it's about buying and setting up hardware. Both are relevant, but \"Purchase\" is direct because the ticket is about getting approval for items.  The details about cameras and TVs support the need for procurement. It's a hardware *purchase* request for IT.\n\n\n**Analyzing Purchase Request**\n\nI've determined the ticket's primary focus leans strongly towards \"Purchase\".  The repeated requests for a \"purchase requisition\", and explicit mentions of \"buy\" coupled with the detailed request for cameras and mounting solutions solidify this. I'm focusing on the actionable request, and \"Purchase\" accurately reflects this need for procurement.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Objective**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the core request. It's clear that the main goal of this ticket is to procure specific hardware, mainly cameras, for meeting room enhancements, making \"Purchase\" the most accurate categorization, though \"Hardware\" also aligns with the subject matter.\n\n\n**Focusing on Ticket Procurement**\n\nI've determined that the overarching goal is clearly a purchase. The ticket is centered around buying cameras and mounting them. The \"purchase requisition\" request is explicit. While hardware is relevant, the action is to get new equipment, so purchase encompasses the core of the issue.\n\n\n**Focusing on Ticket Procurement**\n\nI've determined that the primary focus of this ticket falls squarely within the \"Purchase\" category. The user's detailed description of required hardware, combined with the repeated calls for a \"purchase requisition\" and explicit desire to \"buy,\" solidifies this conclusion. I'm prioritizing the actionable request to initiate procurement.\n\n\n"
