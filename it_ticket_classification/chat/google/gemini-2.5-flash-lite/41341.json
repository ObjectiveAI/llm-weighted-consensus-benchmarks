The phrases \"special leave request approval flow issue\" and \"unable\" are pointing me toward either HR Support or Access, potentially overlapping. I need to consider which aspect is more relevant: the workflow itself or potential access problems preventing completion. I'm leaning toward HR Support, given the context.\n\n\n**Determining HR Focus**\n\nI've taken a deep dive, thoroughly analyzing the ticket's content and its implications. The recurring themes of leave requests, timecards, and system issues tied to HR processes solidify my earlier assessment. While access might play a role, the crux of the problem lies within the HR workflow. Therefore, I'm confident \"HR Support\" is the correct category, aligning perfectly with the core issue.\n\n\n"
