Initial assessment suggests it leans towards \"Access\" due to the mention of a user account and permissions (\"change exists user...\"). Further refinement might be needed, but that's my working hypothesis.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Ticket**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text more deeply, and \"Access\" remains the most suitable category. The \"starter\" context is less relevant than the critical keywords: \"change,\" \"exists user,\" and \"keep history.\" These point unequivocally to user access adjustments, even considering the potential implication of administrative rights, access management is the core issue here. I am confident in this categorization.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket's Scope**\n\nI've carefully re-evaluated the ticket, considering all categories. The initial \"Access\" classification still feels most correct. Examining the language, terms such as \"change,\" \"exists user,\" and \"keep history\" reinforce this. Though \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility, \"starter\" doesn't necessarily indicate that level of access. It's more about regular account maintenance linked to a departing employee. The scope firmly sits within access management, confirming my prior assessment.\n\n\n"
