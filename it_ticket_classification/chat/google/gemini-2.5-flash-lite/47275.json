The key is in determining whether the issue relates to hardware, HR, access, or is miscellaneous. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" since the description mentions a license and multiple users experiencing the same issue. I want to confirm that is the best category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket description, focusing on keywords like \"license\" and \"working.\" My initial instinct of \"Access\" still seems correct. The license issue appears to be preventing \"idea\" from functioning, affecting multiple users. While Administrative rights could be a factor, the core problem seems rooted in access to the software. I am now exploring whether \"idea\" is working due to a technical, access-based, or functionality-related issue.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've decided to finalize the category as \"Access.\" The ticket's core problem revolves around a license preventing \"idea\" from functioning for multiple users, confirming the original assessment. Though administrative rights could be indirectly involved, the primary issue is the user's ability to access the software. The lack of a valid license restricts access to the \"idea\" application.\n\n\n"
