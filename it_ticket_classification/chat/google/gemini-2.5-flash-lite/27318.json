It seems related to access and potentially HR, specifically concerning maternity leave. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" but need to confirm. The \"HR Support\" category seems like a possible secondary category to consider.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've revised the initial categorization. While \"Access\" seemed possible, the \"maternity leave\" and \"leaver form\" context strongly points to \"HR Support\" as the primary category. The access card mention now seems a consequence of the HR process, not the main issue. The focus is now firmly on the HR-related aspects of this ticket.\n\n\n**Revising Category Priorities**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's focus and the initial categorisation. After a deep dive, I'm now leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\" as the main category. It appears that the references to access are ancillary to the core HR process \u2013 managing the \"maternity leaver form.\" Though the access card may change, the underlying need centers on an employee status change, and that solidifies the \"HR Support\" focus.\n\n\n"
