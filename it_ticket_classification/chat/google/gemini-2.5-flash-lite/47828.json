The mention of \"password expire days\" and \"change your password\" strongly suggests a password-related problem. I'm now evaluating how the domain controller error message fits into this, aiming for the most precise classification.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm focusing on identifying the most fitting category for this ticket. The keywords point towards an access issue, likely related to administrative rights on the domain controller, stemming from a password expiration problem. I'm weighing between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" to best capture the nuanced problem.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the provided ticket details, focusing on the recurring themes of password expiration, domain controller interaction, and \"access denied\" errors. Based on this, I've concluded that \"Access\" is the most appropriate category to encompass the core issue of a user being prevented from performing a necessary action due to systemic permission problems.\n\n**Resolving Ticket Category**\n\nI've refined my assessment of the ticket's core issue. The combination of password expiration, the domain controller error indicating \"access denied,\" and the inability to change the password leads me to confidently categorize this as an \"Access\" issue.\n\n"
