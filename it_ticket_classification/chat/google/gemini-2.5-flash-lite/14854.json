Based on the text, \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" are key phrases, pointing strongly towards \"HR Support.\" There is a strong possibility of this ticket being about onboarding process. It appears to be linked to an onboarding process. I am leaning toward HR Support, however, there is possibility of access, and perhaps internal project.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI've refined my thinking on the ticket category. The repeated use of \"starter form\" and \"new starter\" solidifies my original thought of it being HR-related. Further analysis eliminates other categories, narrowing the choice to HR Support.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Relevance**\n\nI'm now fully confident that the ticket falls under \"HR Support.\" The repeated emphasis on \"starter form\" and \"new starter\" solidifies this conclusion. Although access might be a subsequent step, the initial request revolves around completing the starter form, which is an HR-driven process. The phrase \"pm starter form\" further supports this, suggesting the form is role-specific, likely related to employee onboarding handled by HR.\n\n\n"
