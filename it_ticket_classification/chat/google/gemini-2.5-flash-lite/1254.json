                    "reasoning": "**Evaluating Keywords**\n\nI'm currently dissecting the ticket text to pinpoint the most relevant keywords. I'm focusing on terms that strongly indicate a specific category. \"Change\" is a common term, so I'm cross-referencing it with the other words to eliminate false positives and better clarify the meaning of the request. \"Sonar\" does not mean a category, so it can be safely ignored. At the moment, I'm leaning towards \"access\" due to the user requesting changes to entry points. I'm still weighing all other options!\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and I think \"Internal Project\" best aligns with the request. The primary focus seems to be the upgrade of \"Sonar,\" suggesting a planned initiative rather than a specific access or hardware issue. The phrase \"entry change\" remains somewhat ambiguous, but doesn't seem to be the primary concern. \"Change maps\" could be related, but also feels secondary to \"Sonar.\" I've ruled out all other categories, and \"Internal Project\" appears to fit the context most naturally.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Internal Project\" as the key driver. The repeated mention of \"sonar\" and its upgrade strongly suggests an internal initiative, potentially involving configuration and access modifications as secondary elements. The vagueness of \"entry change\" remains, but I now see it as a component within the broader scope of an internal project. I'm less sure \"Change Maps\" holds any bearing on the core project. \"Access\" remains a possibility but appears subordinate to the core \"sonar\" upgrade.\n\n\n**Revisiting Core Category**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the category, and now feel \"Internal Project\" is still the best fit. I've considered that \"entry change\" might relate to access, but the repeated mention of the \"sonar\" upgrade firmly centers it on internal development. \"Change maps,\" although vague, likely involves configuring or updating system maps in relation to the sonar upgrade. Therefore, the focus remains on the software project. I am now certain the user does not want HR support, storage, or administrative rights at this time.\n\n\n**Refining Category Choice**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Internal Project.\" While \"Access\" could be a factor with \"entry change,\" the repeated \"sonar\" upgrade dominates the context. \"Change maps\" now seems a technical configuration element within an internal project. I'm discarding other options definitively, \"Internal Project\" is now my primary focus, assuming this is an internal maintenance issue. I'll stick to this until further data.\n\n\n**Defining Actionable Categories**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category. While \"Access\" is a possibility based on \"entry change,\" the focus on the \"sonar\" upgrade is clear. The \"change maps\" aspect seems to be a minor configuration element. I'm satisfied that this covers all aspects.\n\n\n**Confirming the Scope**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Internal Project\". The \"entry change\" term is the only piece of the prompt that could be related to access, but I'm confident it's secondary to the core sonar upgrade. I'm focusing on the software upgrade as the driver, assuming the user will describe any access changes needed later. This concludes my current round.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Core Actions**\n\nI've decided to prioritize \"Internal Project\". While \"entry change\" might relate to access, the dominant focus on the \"sonar\" upgrade strongly indicates a system upgrade. I now view the changes as part of a broader internal project. I'm focusing on the software upgrade, assuming any access will be handled later.\n\n\n**Focusing on Core Project**\n\nIt seems the primary action is upgrading \"sonar,\" strongly aligning with the ongoing \"Internal Project.\" \"Entry change\" might relate to access, but is secondary to the \"sonar\" upgrade. I'm viewing this as a system-level project, with configuration changes as a secondary task.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI'm now focusing on \"entry change\" within the upgrade context. While \"sonar\" remains central, \"entry change\" could imply user access or configuration changes *related* to the upgrade, but I'm not convinced it's the primary driver. I'm prioritizing \"Internal Project\" to reflect the core system-level activity.\n\n\n**Analyzing Primary Focus**\n\nI'm now focusing on \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category. While \"entry change\" could relate to \"Access,\" the \"sonar\" upgrade is the dominant element. The user may need access *after* the upgrade, but I'm assuming it will be dealt with in a separate ticket.\n\n\n"
