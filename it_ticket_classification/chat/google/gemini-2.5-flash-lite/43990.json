It seems the primary concern revolves around \"access to documents.\" The ongoing thread details repeated access requests and confirmations, reinforcing this access-related nature. Hardware isn't the issue, so I'm moving toward an IT ticket categorization.\n\n\n**Focusing on Categorization**\n\nI've been drilling down on this IT ticket. The repeated access issues are definitely the crux. Examining the available categories, \"Access\" feels spot on; it perfectly encapsulates the document loading problem and the ensuing access grants. \"Administrative rights\" is a sub-issue, so sticking with the broader \"Access\" is wiser. The other options, like \"Hardware,\" are irrelevant. So far, all signs point to \"Access\" being the best classification.\n\n\n"
