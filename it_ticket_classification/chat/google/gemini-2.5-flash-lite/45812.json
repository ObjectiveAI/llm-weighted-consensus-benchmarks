After reviewing the text, I've identified the keywords \"time cards\" and \"submit,\" which seem most relevant. Considering the available categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the best fit, as the issue appears to involve a timekeeping system. However, I'm holding off on a definitive selection to consider further nuances, if any.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Categories**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided text and concluded that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate category. After reviewing the ticket content, which consistently mentions issues with \"time cards\" and the \"submission\" and \"approval\" processes, I've ruled out the other categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" and others. My reasoning is that the core issue directly relates to a function within the realm of Human Resources and employee management.\n\n\n"
