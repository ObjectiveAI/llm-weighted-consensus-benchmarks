It seems centered around \"new starter access card\" and \"enabling,\" which leans towards an access-related issue. \"New starter\" also implies a potential HR collaboration might be needed. So, I'm leaning toward \"Access,\" but I'm keeping HR support in mind as a secondary possibility.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Focus**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on the core action: enabling the access card. Though HR might be involved with the \"starter form,\" the user's immediate need centers on granting building access. This solidified my initial assessment: \"Access\" is the primary category, with \"HR Support\" considered for potential escalation if the access issue stems from onboarding procedures.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core IT Role**\n\nAfter further analysis, I've confirmed my initial leaning. The user's goal is building access for the new hire, not primarily HR form processing. While there's a connection to HR, IT's direct responsibility is card activation. This makes \"Access\" the central category. The \"starter form\" is likely HR's contribution; IT focuses on physical access provisioning. The \"enabling\" verb cements access as the IT task, so it solidifies this as the primary category.\n\n\n**Prioritizing the Core Action**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's intent: to grant building access to a new employee. While the new starter form is important, the IT task is clear. I'm focusing on \"Access\" as the primary category, with HR as a potential support. I'm choosing \"Access\" because IT's direct responsibility is card activation, regardless of form origins.\n\n\n"
