I'm evaluating categories like \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" to best capture this specific issue.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the best fit for an IT ticket where a user can log time in Oracle but is experiencing a login error this week, though they logged in successfully on Friday.
