I'm carefully weighing the options to ensure the most accurate classification.\n\n\n**Determining the Ticket Type**\n\nI've determined the ticket falls under \"HR Support\". The recurring terms of \"expenses,\" \"reimbursement,\" and \"funds deposited\" clearly indicate a financial reimbursement request. I considered other options, but the explicit financial nature of the ticket makes \"HR Support\" the most logical and accurate choice for its classification.\n\n\n"
