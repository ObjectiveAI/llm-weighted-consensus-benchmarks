The ongoing analysis of keywords and phrases, particularly those related to timecards and approvals, is guiding me towards a more precise classification.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the provided text, and my current focus is on accurately mapping its content to the most appropriate category. The recurring themes of \"time cards,\" \"submission for approval,\" and \"rejection/correction\" strongly indicate a connection to HR processes. Based on this, I'm confident in assigning the \"HR Support\" category.\n\n"
