I'm exploring potential subcategories within \"Access\" or considering a combined category to ensure accuracy. The \"logged\" aspect is less clear and could indicate further investigation is needed.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Management**\n\nI've been drilling down on the access aspects. Password resets are primary, but user creation and updates also point towards access control. While HR might be involved in initial setup, the ticket's focus is on maintaining access, which firmly puts it under \"Access.\" I'm now fine-tuning the categorization to reflect the core issue: ensuring users can properly access resources.\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Issues**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Access\" as the primary category. The ticket's repeated mentions of password resets, user creation, and persistent login problems solidify this direction. While there's a slight HR aspect regarding user creation, the core focus is ensuring users can access resources. I've ruled out \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Storage\", and other unrelated categories.  I'm confident in \"Access\" and will refine the subcategories.\n\n\n"
