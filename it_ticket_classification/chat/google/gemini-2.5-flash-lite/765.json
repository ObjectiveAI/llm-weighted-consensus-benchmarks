I am leaning toward the category \"Access\" for this ticket.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Context**\n\nI've further analyzed the phrases and their implications. \"Host building,\" \"entrance,\" and \"door secured by key\" solidify the initial \"Access\" categorization.  The focus remains on controlling physical entry, reinforcing it's not a generic issue needing the \"Miscellaneous\" category. I am confident in my selection.\n\n\n"
