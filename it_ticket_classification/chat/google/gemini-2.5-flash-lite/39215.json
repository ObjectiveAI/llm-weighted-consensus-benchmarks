The phrase suggests an issue related to employee requests, which leans towards the \"HR Support\" category. I am still considering alternative categories like \"Access\" because the error might be related to access to the leave request system, but my primary focus is HR at this stage. I plan to refine this based on potential context clues from additional text.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI've taken a deep dive into the ticket content, now including Thursday's date and the admin officer's thanks. The core complaint is clearly about problems with the annual leave process. Considering potential error causes, I've ruled out \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" as irrelevant. While an access error is possible, the direct issue is HR-centric annual leave. Therefore, \"HR Support\" still emerges as the strongest fit, surpassing \"Access\" in direct relevance, and leaving \"Miscellaneous\" too vague.\n\n\n"
