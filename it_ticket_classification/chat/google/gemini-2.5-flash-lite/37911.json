I'm focusing on the technical side, trying to figure out if it's a CPU thing or maybe some kind of hardware glitch. I'm narrowing down the best category for this ticket from the given options, and it's starting to point towards a specific choice.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's description of a constantly running laptop cooler and comparing it against the provided categories. It's becoming increasingly evident that \"Hardware\" is the most accurate fit, as the issue directly concerns a physical component and its potential malfunction. The other options, like HR Support or Administrative rights, are clearly not relevant. I think this will wrap it up.\n\n\n"
