My focus is on determining the best fit from the provided categories, specifically considering the user's inability to change their manager. This points towards a more administrative or HR-related issue.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm narrowing down the category for this IT ticket. The user's struggle with manager changes and approval processes strongly suggests \"HR Support,\" as it directly touches on personnel management workflows, rather than general access or hardware.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Type**\n\nI'm refining my understanding of the ticket's core issue. The recurring phrases around manager changes, approval steps, and process completion indicate a problem deeply rooted in how personnel hierarchies and workflows are managed. This strongly points towards HR-related system functionalities.\n\n"
