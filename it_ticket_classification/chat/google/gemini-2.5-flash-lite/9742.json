The text revolves around modifications to a \"new starter form,\" which doesn't immediately suggest hardware, storage, or admin rights. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Internal Project,\" though \"Miscellaneous\" is still on the table.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Category**\n\nI've refined my thinking on the ticket category. While \"HR Support\" remains a strong contender due to the new starter form context, I'm now exploring the implications of the form's specific elements: \"advertising accounts\" and \"pro boxes.\" These details suggest a potential link to user provisioning and system configuration, which slightly shifts my focus. \"Internal Project\" is still in the mix, as is \"Miscellaneous\". However, I think the ticket may be an internal process, so maybe the category should be \"Internal Project\".\n\n\n**Clarifying the Focus**\n\nI've zeroed in on the core of this ticket: it's not just about a \"new starter form,\" but the automation and configuration *within* that form related to \"advertising accounts\" and \"pro boxes.\" This points decisively toward \"HR Support\" as the most accurate category. While \"Internal Project\" was initially considered, the focus is on a process directly tied to HR's onboarding workflow. It is clearly related to the automation or default settings of the \"new starter form.\" \"Access\" is not right.\n\n\n"
