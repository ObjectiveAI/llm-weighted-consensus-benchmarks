Initial assessment suggests it leans towards \"Access\" due to the mention of alerts and recipients, but I need to ensure that it doesn't also fall under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"HR Support\" due to the specific issue raised. The \"undeliverable\" aspect could be related to various system issues, so a more precise classification is needed.\n\n\n**Defining the Root Cause**\n\nThe ticket seems email-related, possibly a notification system issue. I'm focusing on \"Access\" given the recipients and alerts but want to avoid misclassification. The \"undeliverable\" problem ties to the notification setup, which could be Access-related, but also somewhat \"Miscellaneous,\" depending on the system's design. I need to clarify the system context for a precise classification.\n\n\n**Refining the Classification**\n\nI've decided to categorize this as \"Miscellaneous,\" as none of the other options seem accurate. While it involves a server and email, it's not a hardware, access, storage or purchase issue. I've considered that the alerts and recipients could suggest \"Access,\" but the root problem is undelivered notifications, which are more general. This fits best under miscellaneous given the available options.\n\n\n"
