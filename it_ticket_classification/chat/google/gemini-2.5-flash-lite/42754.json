So far, it seems like access is being denied. I'm carefully going through the text for any key phrases. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" at the moment.\n\n\n**Focusing on Access Issues**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and I'm quite certain the user's main problem is being locked out of Confluence. The words and phrases are leaning heavily towards needing access. The steps of resetting the password and getting an error point toward this, I feel confident about that. I've ruled out all other categories, and \"Access\" appears to fit perfectly. It is the best choice because this user can't do their work.\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Problem**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and the available categories. The user is locked out and needs help regaining access. I've eliminated categories that don't fit, such as \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support.\" \"Access\" is clearly the best choice because the central problem is the inability to log in due to a password error. \"Miscellaneous\" is too broad, and the need for access overrides other considerations like internal project work. The focus here is getting the user back into Confluence.\n\n\n"
