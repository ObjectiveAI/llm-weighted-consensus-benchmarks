I'm carefully analyzing the provided ticket text to identify the most relevant keywords and context clues. The goal is to produce a JSON object that strictly adheres to the specified schema, ensuring the selected category is accurate and unambiguous. So far, the analysis indicates a primary focus.\n\n\n**Identifying the Key Context**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and the schema. The mention of \"leaver,\" \"timecard,\" and \"approvers\" points strongly toward HR-related processes, even without a direct \"HR Support\" label. I'm confident \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category, rather than a more generic option. I've ruled out all the other options provided as they don't seem applicable to the current scenario, focusing on the core issue: a timecard problem.\n\n\n"
