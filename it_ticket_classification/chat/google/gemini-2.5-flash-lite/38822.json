My approach involves analyzing the ticket text, extracting the core topic, and mapping it to a predefined category. I aim to build a robust system that can handle a variety of ticket types effectively.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Key Phrases**\n\nI've been drilling down into the ticket text, searching for phrases that accurately represent its core purpose. The main focus seems to be around permissions and potential incorrect behavior related to access. I've noted \"incorrect behavior,\" \"have permissions,\" and \"added ad\" as critical indicators. My next step will be to create a semantic map of these keywords to find the best suitable category.\n\n\n**Defining the Category Scope**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. Based on the ticket, the core issue revolves around access and permissions, with the resolution potentially involving AD modifications. \"Access\" is the most encompassing category, but \"Administrative rights\" is a very specific subcategory. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the primary categorization for now, but will make sure that the system recognizes this as an administrative access issue.\n\n\n**Determining Best Categorization**\n\nI've been examining the ticket text and I'm convinced the issue is access-related. Based on the phrases \"incorrect behavior\" and \"have permissions,\" combined with the resolution involving \"added ad,\" it's clear the core problem is related to granting or restricting access. Though \"Administrative rights\" is a very specific type of access, the ticket's general nature fits best with \"Access\" as a category. I will implement this categorization, but keep in mind that this is an administrative access issue.\n\n\n"
