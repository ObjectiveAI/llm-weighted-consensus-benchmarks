My focus is on keywords like \"oracle,\" \"notification,\" and \"duplicates\" to identify if it relates to system issues or access problems.\n\n**Identifying System Malfunctions**\n\nI'm refining my categorization. The mention of \"oracle notification duplicates\" and \"notification process\" strongly points towards a system or application issue rather than HR-specific problems or access requests. I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the most fitting umbrella term given the specific system malfunction described.\n\n**Resolving Category Conflict**\n\nMy thoughts are currently focused on determining the most precise category for the ticket. While the mention of \"time card\" might suggest \"HR Support,\" the core issue lies with the \"oracle notification process\" exhibiting duplicate entries, pointing more strongly towards a system malfunction. I'm weighing \"Miscellaneous\" against a broader interpretation of \"HR Support\" to ensure the best fit for this specific technical problem.\n\n**Classifying System Glitch**\n\nI've determined that the ticket describes a system malfunction. The recurring issue of duplicate Oracle notifications related to timecards points away from HR support or access, leading me to classify it under \"Miscellaneous.\"\n\n"
