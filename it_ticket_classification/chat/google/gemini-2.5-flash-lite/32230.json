Given the ticket content, which mentions \"monitor\" and \"cable,\" I've narrowed it down to potential categories. While it initially seems hardware-related, the provided options require careful consideration. My priority is to find the most fitting label from the prescribed list, aiming for accurate categorization based on this specific text.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Details**\n\nBased on the ticket text, \"monitor and cable,\" I've isolated crucial keywords: \"monitor,\" \"cable,\" and \"floor socket.\" These point strongly towards hardware. While \"ordered\" hints at purchase, the core concern is the hardware itself, implying a hardware category, not a purchase issue, is most apt. The floor socket is also tied to hardware, not HR, access, storage, or miscellaneous issues.\n\n\n**Confirming Hardware Focus**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's keywords: \"monitor,\" \"cable,\" and \"floor socket,\" which all scream hardware. Though \"ordered\" initially suggested \"Purchase,\" the core request is about the physical equipment. My refined analysis indicates \"Hardware\" is the most apt category, overriding any potential purchase-related nuance. The floor socket further confirms the hardware context, solidifying my decision.\n\n\n"
