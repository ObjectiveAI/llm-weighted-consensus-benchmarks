Currently, I'm focusing on \"oracle submit timecard for leaver\" and similar phrases, to classify the tickets accurately based on the provided schema. I'm considering \"HR Support\" for any timecard-related issues. The other phrases I'm trying to map to a more definitive category as well. I'm focusing on achieving high accuracy in ticket classification.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Details**\n\nI've analyzed the \"oracle submit timecard for leaver\" tickets. Key terms like \"leaver\" and \"timecard\" strongly suggest \"HR Support\". I've determined that \"administration officer pm\" could imply administrative access, but the core issue remains HR-centric. I'm focusing on \"HR Support\" for any timecard-related issues.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nI've determined \"HR Support\" is the best fit for tickets referencing \"oracle submit timecard for leaver.\" The keywords strongly indicate HR processes, specifically for an employee leaving. Even with terms like \"administration officer pm,\" the core request revolves around the timecard submission. I've ruled out other categories like \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" since the focus is the act of submitting the timecard itself, not necessarily access issues, although they may be related.\n\n\n"
