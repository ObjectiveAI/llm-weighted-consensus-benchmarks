                    "reasoning": "**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the ticket text, \"wireless networks scan bogota wed\". My goal is to determine the most relevant category from the options provided. Initial assessment leans towards either \"Hardware\" or \"Access\", but I'm still weighing the nuances to ensure the best fit. I'm focusing on keywords and context to finalize the categorization.\n\n\n**Categorizing Network Issue**\n\nI'm now leaning heavily towards \"Access\" for the tickets. Analyzing the \"wireless networks\" focus, the actions imply managing network access and possibly troubleshooting connectivity. The keywords and actions align better with access control than a hardware malfunction. I'm focusing on the \"assign tickets\" aspect, further solidifying \"Access\" as the most relevant category.\n\n\n**Evaluating Project Scope**\n\nThe updated analysis leans firmly towards \"Internal Project\" for these wireless network tickets. Considering the recurring phrase \"wireless networks\", the mention of scanning, approval, advising, and assigning tasks strongly suggests a managed operation. The \"rogue wireless networks\" aspect and the \"attached procedure\" further support this, indicating a project-oriented approach to network security or performance optimization. \"Hardware\" remains a possibility if the focus shifted to malfunctioning WAPs, but the current context prioritizes management and operational aspects. \"Miscellaneous\" remains the fallback, but \"Internal Project\" best captures the tickets' overall intent.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Project Goal**\n\nMy current assessment is firm: **Internal Project** appears the best fit for these tickets. I'm focusing on \"rogue wireless networks\" combined with task assignments and procedures, reinforcing this as an internal initiative for network management or security. I'm prioritizing the overall operational aspects over potential hardware issues, solidifying this categorization.\n\n\n**Confirming Internal Focus**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Internal Project.\" Analyzing the provided text, the core activity revolves around managing and securing \"wireless networks\" through tasks,  and procedures. I'm prioritizing the proactive and operational aspects, like scanning for \"rogue networks,\" over possible underlying hardware issues. This all points towards an internal initiative.\n\n\n**Confirming Internal Scope**\n\nI'm solidifying my assessment as \"Internal Project.\" Given the recurrent phrase \"wireless networks,\" coupled with the mention of assigned tasks,  \"scanning\" for issues, and a \"rogue networks\" focus, this points to an ongoing, structured activity. It strongly suggests an internal initiative aimed at maintaining or improving network health, making \"Internal Project\" the most relevant.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Operational Scope**\n\nI'm now firm on \"Internal Project.\" Given the \"wireless networks,\" task assignments, \"rogue wireless networks\", and \"attached procedure,\" this signals an ongoing operation. I prioritize the network's management and security over potential hardware issues, solidifying this as the primary focus.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Operational Focus**\n\nThe ticket's core activity revolves around *managing and securing* wireless networks, with a particular emphasis on \"rogue networks\". I'm prioritizing the proactive and operational scope implied by task assignments and procedures. This strengthens my belief that \"Internal Project\" best reflects the overarching aim of this work, and no other category fits it well.\n\n\n"
