However, upon closer examination, the focus appears to be more about an employee policy and accessibility rather than a technical access issue. I'm now leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate classification. This seems to encompass the core issue regarding the employee referral policy.\n\n\n**Evaluating Key Aspects**\n\nI'm now focusing on \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" as the primary categories. The employee's ticket explicitly requests access to a policy related to the employee referral program. While the user uses the word \"access\", the underlying issue seems more about HR-related policy and program accessibility. The other categories don't seem like they apply here.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI've made the final call and categorized the IT ticket as \"HR Support.\" While \"Access\" was a strong contender given the user's phrasing, the core of the issue revolves around an employee referral policy and ensuring all staff have access to it, which squarely falls under the purview of HR-related matters. The user's request for \"access\" is a means to achieve a more comprehensive HR goal.\n\n\n"
