So far, \"new purchase po\" and \"updated purchase\" seem particularly relevant, but I need to consider the broader context before making a final decision.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Category**\n\nI've honed in on the \"Purchase\" category. The presence of \"purchase po,\" \"new purchase po,\" and \"updated purchase po\" in the ticket text is a strong indicator. I'm confident that these phrases definitively point towards a purchasing-related issue, thus confirming my initial assessment.\n\n\n"
