My aim is to accurately map the ticket's content to one of the predefined enum values.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm actively working through categorizing the IT ticket. Based on the keywords like \"deleted\" and \"removing form\" in conjunction with \"cr approvers,\" I'm leaning towards classifying this under \"Administrative rights,\" as it seems to involve managing permissions or access to a system's approval workflow.\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI've refined my analysis, and \"Administrative rights\" appears to be the most fitting category. The keywords \"cr approvers,\" \"deleted,\" and \"removing form\" strongly suggest a request to manage or revoke roles and permissions within a system, aligning with administrative functions rather than just general access.\n\n**Assigning IT Ticket Category**\n\nI've finalized the categorization of the IT ticket. Based on the phrasing \"cr approvers to be deleted\" and \"removing form,\" I've confidently assigned it the \"Administrative rights\" category, as it pertains to managing roles and permissions within a system's workflow.\n\n"
