After analyzing the text, I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" or potentially \"Miscellaneous.\" The language suggests a physical device issue, but the vagueness leaves room for other possibilities. I'll need to carefully consider the exact nuances to confidently assign the correct category.\n\n\n**Identifying the Root Cause**\n\nI've determined that the issue is undoubtedly hardware-related. The ticket text's mention of connecting a monitor and experiencing problems with it solidly places it within the \"Hardware\" category. No further ambiguity exists, and I've confirmed that a physical component is indeed the root of the problem.\n\n\n"
