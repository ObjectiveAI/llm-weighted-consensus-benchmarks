The keywords are \"new starter,\" which immediately leans towards HR Support or Access. Given the mention of a \"starter form,\" I'm leaning more towards HR Support for now. This requires a deeper dive to rule out Access-related needs, such as provisioning. My aim is to accurately categorize it and rule out other possibilities.\n\n\n**Deciding on Category**\n\nI've homed in on \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category. The \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" indicators align directly with HR onboarding activities. While \"Access\" is relevant, \"HR Support\" is broader and encompasses the initiation of that process. I've ruled out the other options because they didn't fit the ticket's core context.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI've refined the initial assessment, focusing squarely on \"HR Support\" as the most precise fit. The ticket's content, specifically \"new starter\" and \"starter form,\" strongly points towards HR onboarding activities. While access is a part of this, the initial setup is typically initiated via HR. I've eliminated Hardware, Storage, Purchase, and others, recognizing the context is HR-driven.\n\n\n"
