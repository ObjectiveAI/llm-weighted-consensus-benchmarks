My initial assessment points strongly toward an \"Access\" issue, given the mention of a locked account. While it's a bit sparse, the core issue is clear. I'll flag this one.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've examined the ticket text: \"account locked sent friday july locked dear was locked but helped solve have great you party.\" The recurring phrase \"account locked\" solidifies my conclusion. \"Access\" is the most relevant category as it addresses account lockouts directly. I've ruled out other categories like \"HR Support,\" \"Hardware,\" and \"Storage\" because the provided text doesn't indicate any issues related to them.\n\n\n"
