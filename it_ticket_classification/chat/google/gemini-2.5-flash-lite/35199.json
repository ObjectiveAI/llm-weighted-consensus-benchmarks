I am starting to analyze the requirements, specifically the mapping of text to the correct category from the given list: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\". I will analyze the text for keywords and contextual clues to accomplish this task.\n\n\n**Delving into HR Ticket Details**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"HR Support\" category, given the prevalence of \"special leave\" and absence request terminology. The context emphasizes workflows, approvals, and communication within the HR system, solidifying \"HR Support\" as the dominant category. I'm noting the recurring patterns and language, which will be crucial for automated categorization.\n\n\n**Categorizing Leave Requests**\n\nMy assessment strongly points towards \"HR Support\" as the appropriate category. The recurring phrase \"special leave\" and its association with absence requests and approval workflows are the key indicators. The provided text consistently revolves around HR system interactions and processes, making \"HR Support\" the most logical choice.\n\n\n"
