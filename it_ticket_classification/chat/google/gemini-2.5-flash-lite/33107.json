My process involves identifying key terms and themes within the provided text to accurately map it to one of the predefined IT ticket categories. I'm particularly looking for indicators that align with \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\"\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm now synthesizing the information. The recurring themes of \"new starter,\" \"hardware,\" and \"starter form\" strongly suggest this ticket pertains to onboarding a new employee and the associated equipment requests. Therefore, I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" or potentially a broader onboarding category if one existed.\n\n**Mapping Ticket Content**\n\nI'm focusing on the key phrases like \"new starter\" and \"hardware section,\" along with mentions of \"monitor,\" \"software,\" and \"phone.\" These terms strongly indicate the ticket is related to equipping a new employee, making the \"Hardware\" category the most fitting classification.\n\n"
