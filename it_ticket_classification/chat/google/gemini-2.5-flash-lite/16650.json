My focus is on keywords like \"change for and thursday\" to see how they align with the available options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI'm refining the ticket categorization based on keywords indicating system adjustments and data flow, such as \"code changed,\" \"backdated effective,\" and \"transfer never happened.\" This leans away from Hardware or Purchases and towards areas like Access or potentially Administrative rights, as the request seems to involve modifying system parameters or ownership.\n\n**Identifying HR-Related Changes**\n\nI've analyzed the keywords like \"owner change,\" \"transfer never happened,\" and \"annual leave.\" These strongly indicate the ticket pertains to HR processes, specifically employee status or responsibility shifts. Thus, I've categorized it as \"HR Support.\"\n\n"
