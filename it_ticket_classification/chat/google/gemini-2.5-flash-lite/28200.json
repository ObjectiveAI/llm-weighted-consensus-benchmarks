My latest refinement involves parsing ticket text, such as \"career map\", to accurately extract the intended category, so I can format a corresponding JSON object with the right \"category\" field. Potential categories include \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", and others, but the \"career map\" text points to HR Support.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text which includes phrases like \"career map feedback,\" \"roles,\" and \"responsibilities.\" My latest approach is to determine the best fit from categories such as \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. My analysis suggests \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category, as this query pertains to employee development and career structure, rather than hardware or other unrelated areas.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Categories**\n\nI'm currently identifying a ticket's primary category. Ticket text includes variations on \"career map,\" encompassing feedback, roles, and future growth. I've narrowed it down based on the text, and I'm updating my JSON object to reflect the \"HR Support\" category, given the nature of the request.\n\n\n"
