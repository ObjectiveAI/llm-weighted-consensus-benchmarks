The mention of \"switch ports\" and their locked-down state strongly suggests a hardware or access issue. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Hardware\" as the most likely categories, but I'll need a deeper dive to clarify which is more suitable.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Category**\n\nI've just refined my categorization approach based on the ticket's language. Now I'm quite certain that \"Hardware\" is the primary category. The phrases \"switch ports locked down\" and \"assign pc switch port\" strongly point to managing network equipment and ports. \"Access\" is a possibility, but the core issue revolves around the physical configuration of the hardware itself. Confidence is high, but I'll double-check for any subtle clues I might have missed.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe analysis points strongly to \"Hardware\" as the best category. The ticket text's repeated mentions of \"switch ports\" and their locked state confirm this. While \"Access\" could be relevant, the core issue is about physical port configuration. I'm now confident in this decision based on the specific language used and the available categories.\n\n\n"
