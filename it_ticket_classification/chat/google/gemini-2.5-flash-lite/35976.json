So far, the phrases \"referral tool issues\" and \"positions have already closed\" are prominent.  I'm trying to determine the most relevant category from the options I've got, considering both the described issue and the available categories. My goal is to select the best fit.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've carefully reviewed the ticket content again. The terms like \"referral tool issues,\" \"closed positions,\" and \"referral processes\" strongly point toward HR-related functions. Initially, \"Miscellaneous\" seemed plausible, but upon further analysis, \"HR Support\" appears the clear winner. My rationale centers on the tools used for these HR processes, making this category the most precise.\n\n\n"
