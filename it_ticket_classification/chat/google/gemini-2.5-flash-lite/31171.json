Given the ticket content, my initial instinct is leaning towards either \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\". I need to carefully weigh the wording to pinpoint the most accurate fit. I'll need to look at similar situations to ensure consistency. The focus on connecting a device suggests access might be the best route.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and the possible categories. \"Add resource\" and the connection request point towards either \"Access\" or \"Internal Project\". The \"connect guest\" language strongly implies an access-related issue. \"Internal Project\" is a possible but secondary option if the \"resource\" is project-specific. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" but I am re-evaluating context.\n\n\n**Reaching a Conclusion**\n\nI have carefully assessed the ticket text and the available categories. The phrases \"add new resource,\" \"connect guest,\" and the focus on connection strongly indicate an access-related issue. While \"Internal Project\" was initially considered, the broader context of adding resources and connecting guests makes \"Access\" the more accurate categorization. I'm now confident in this decision.\n\n\n"
