The text highlights invoice approval and requisition approval, which leans towards a financial or procurement-related process. While none of the explicit categories are perfect, \"Purchase\" seems like the most apt descriptor based on the context, as it could encompass the procurement process. I'm still considering alternative approaches.\n\n\n**Analyzing Approval Bottlenecks**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's language, focusing on the core issue: approval roadblocks. The terms \"reject,\" \"approve,\" \"invoice,\" and \"PO\" point directly to financial processes. I'm now leaning heavily towards \"Purchase\" as the primary category, with an acknowledgement that access issues might play a secondary role. I'm considering refining this further.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Relevance**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's core issue, which centers on invoice and purchase order approval. The language, especially \"automatically rejected\" and \"unable to validate,\" suggests a systematic block within the procurement cycle. I'm now certain that \"Purchase\" is the most precise categorization, representing the function being impaired. The phrase \"PO validation\" is central.\n\n\n"
