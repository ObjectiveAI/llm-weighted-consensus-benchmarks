Based on the details provided, I'm leaning towards classifying this under \"Miscellaneous\" as it doesn't neatly fit into the more specific technical categories available.\n\n**Refining Category Choice**\n\nI'm re-evaluating the IT ticket's categorization. After examining the details about the \"neptune\" room's recurring scheduling conflicts, and considering the available enum options like \"Hardware\" and \"Access,\" I'm still finding \"Miscellaneous\" to be the most fitting category. It captures the essence of an unexpected booking issue that doesn't align with more defined technical problems.\n\n"
