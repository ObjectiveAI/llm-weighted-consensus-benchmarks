It looks like this falls under the umbrella of HR Support. I'll need to confirm that my interpretation is correct with the user.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text: \"people not project anymore thursday pm anymore hi anymore receiving vacations requests please thanks\". Filtering the noise, \"vacation requests\" and \"people not project anymore\" stand out. HR Support seems most relevant, aligning with personnel management and vacation processes. While \"Access\" is a possibility, the core is receiving these requests, pointing firmly towards HR. The other categories are clearly a mismatch. \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate fit.\n\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI'm now revisiting the \"HR Support\" categorization, seeking further confirmation. \"People not project anymore\" warrants careful interpretation; it may touch on access issues. However, the core of \"receiving vacation requests\" solidifies the HR connection. I'll need to check if the ticket system acknowledges access requests under the HR umbrella.\n\n\n"
