Initially, I was leaning towards a few options, but given the context of errors, I'm now leaning more towards a very specific category, let me think if there are any other aspects to consider.\n\n\n**Evaluating Category Options**\n\nI've examined the ticket content carefully and eliminated some initial category contenders. The core focus remains the \"security roll out,\" a clear indication of an internal project. However, the requirement for user action and the impact on their systems introduce an element of access change. I am balancing if the best category is \"Access\", and I'm also considering the \"Internal Project\" one. I need to consider if user actions are necessary.\n\n\n**Defining Project Scope**\n\nThe \"Internal Project\" category appears to be the most accurate fit so far. I've analyzed the entire content, including the key phrase \"security roll out\", and the user actions required, and I've verified that this is a project. The focus is a planned, company-wide deployment with significant technical and security implications. This is not simply about changing access or getting help, this is an internal project.\n\n\n"
