Considering the keywords and overall request, I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" as the most relevant category. It's a bit of a stretch, but it seems to be the best fit.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Choices**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket content and the available categories. While \"Purchase\" was initially considered, the request \"provide monitors\" strongly suggests fulfilling a hardware need rather than initiating a procurement process. \"Hardware\" remains the best fit. I've eliminated \"Internal Project\" as it's clearly unrelated, and the other categories are also unsuitable.\n\n\n**Finalizing Hardware Decision**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Hardware\" as the definitive category. My analysis of \"plug monitors\" clearly outweighed other interpretations. The original ticket's focus aligns squarely with needing physical monitors, solidifying this decision. Despite the ambiguity of \"shared plug,\" the hardware need is paramount.\n\n\n"
