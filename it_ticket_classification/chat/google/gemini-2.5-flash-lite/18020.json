My focus is on aligning the given text with one of the predefined options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, or Purchase.\n\n**Resolving Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket description, which mentions a \"card\" being \"damaged\" and refers to a \"leaver\" and the card being returned. Based on these keywords, my current focus is on determining whether this falls under \"Hardware\" due to damage, or if it's more related to employee offboarding processes.\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nMy focus is now on solidifying the categorization of the ticket. The strong indicators of an employee departure, coupled with the mention of a damaged card, lead me to believe \"HR Support\" is the most fitting classification, rather than a general \"Hardware\" issue.\n\n"
