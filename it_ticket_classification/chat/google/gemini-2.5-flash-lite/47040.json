My preliminary assessment leans towards a connection with administrative rights or access controls.  I'm refining my understanding of the terminology and scope to pinpoint the best fit.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Scope**\n\nI've been analyzing the \"leaver\" ticket text and determined the main issue is the failure to automatically generate necessary tickets as part of the employee offboarding process. While related to access control (disabling accounts), the core problem appears to be a procedural glitch impacting HR processes. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the primary category, with \"Access\" a secondary, but closely related, label.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Root Cause**\n\nI've been drilling down on this IT ticket. The \"leaver\" process is the central issue, which deals with deactivating accounts and generating related tasks when an employee leaves. My analysis indicates this is more than just access control; it's a procedural problem linked to HR's offboarding workflow. I'm focusing on \"HR Support\" as the primary category as the leaver process's core function is HR driven. \"Access\" is still very relevant, but the problem goes beyond simple access changes.\n\n\n"
