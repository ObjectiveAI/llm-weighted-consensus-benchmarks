The content \"lost pass card\" immediately suggests \"Access\" is the closest fit. No other information seems to apply. My next step will be to verify this categorization, but it seems straightforward.\n\n\n**Revising Categorization Focus**\n\nI'm now revising my categorization strategy. Considering the ticket content, which includes terms like \"lost pass card,\" \"block current id,\" and \"provide one,\" my thinking is solidifying around the \"Access\" category. The focus is now on ensuring this choice aligns with the full ticket scope. I am ready to move to my next evaluation of this ticket.\n\n\n"
