I'm now favoring \"Access\" as the most appropriate category, as the core need is entitlement to use the software via a license.\n\n**Granting Software Access**\n\nI'm refining my assessment of the IT ticket. The core request for \"allocate confluence license\" now strongly points towards granting user access to the software rather than initiating a purchase. I've therefore decided \"Access\" is the most fitting category.\n\n**Granting Software Access**\n\nI'm now confident that \"Access\" is the most accurate category for the IT ticket. The request to \"allocate confluence license\" directly implies the user needs the entitlement to use the software, which falls under granting access.\n\n"
