The \"maternity leave\" topic is prominent, alongside mentions of \"access card\" and \"completed forms.\" I'm leaning toward HR Support, given the maternity leave context, but I need to consider if \"Access\" is also applicable because of the access card. I am still processing this information.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Details Further**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on the precise wording. \"Maternity leave\" and \"fill maternity leave form\" solidify \"HR Support\" as the primary category. While \"access card\" introduces an \"Access\" consideration, the context of leave management makes \"HR Support\" a better fit, potentially handling access adjustments. I'm now certain this is the ideal categorization.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI'm now fully confident in the \"HR Support\" category. The presence of \"maternity leave,\" the \"completed forms,\" and especially the phrase \"fill maternity leave form\" clearly points to this being the primary focus of the ticket. While \"access card\" introduced an \"Access\" possibility, it appears tied to managing leave access, making it a function under the HR umbrella. After thorough review, this categorization decision feels solid.\n\n\n"
