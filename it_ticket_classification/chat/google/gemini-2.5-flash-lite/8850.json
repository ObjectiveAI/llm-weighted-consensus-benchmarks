The terms \"server,\" \"install,\" and \"link\" are pointing me toward \"Storage\" or potentially \"Internal Project,\" but I still need to be sure. I'm carefully analyzing the context to make a definitive call, and avoid the risk of misclassifying the ticket.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Details**\n\nI've been drilling down on the key terms and their implications. \"Sonar,\" \"server,\" and \"install\" seem to be the core focus here. This strongly suggests \"Internal Project\" is the best fit, as it points to a software implementation on a server for development. \"Miscellaneous\" remains a secondary contender if the implementation is a small, standalone task, but \"Internal Project\" is a more precise characterization.\n\n\n**Defining the Project Scope**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Internal Project.\" The ticket's clear focus on \"install sonar\" on a \"server\" for the \"design lead\" solidified this. While \"Miscellaneous\" was a possibility, \"Internal Project\" best encompasses the project's internal software initiative nature. This designation captures the essence of installing a development tool, which helps in my final classification.\n\n\n"
