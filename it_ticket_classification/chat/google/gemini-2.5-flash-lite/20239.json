Analyzing the phrases \"recent leavers admin account check,\" \"make accounts these leavers disabled,\" and \"removed\" points strongly towards an \"Access\" category, specifically related to user account management and termination processes. I am finalizing the assignment.\n\n\n**Revising Category Assignment**\n\nNow, I'm refining my earlier decision. While Access still feels appropriate, I'm also considering the potential for overlap with HR Support. However, the actions described (disabling, removing, checking) are IT-driven and directly impact user access, solidifying \"Access\" as the primary focus. I am confident in my assessment, and the ticket is now accurately categorized.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Primary Focus**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's core intent. I'm focusing on \"Access\" as the primary category. While \"HR Support\" could be a secondary consideration, the core actions of disabling and removing accounts, directly relate to user access. I'm satisfied that my selection of \"Access\" best encompasses the ticket's core issue of managing and securing user permissions, specifically related to departing employees. This concludes the category selection.\n\n\n"
