My current approach involves identifying key phrases and keywords within the text that strongly indicate a specific category from the list. I'm focusing on the semantic context to ensure accuracy in the classification, and will output the results as requested.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Access**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"Access\" category, solidifying its relevance. The recurring phrase \"unable to access documents\" coupled with \"wants access documents\" points strongly in this direction. Despite a brief consideration of \"Storage\", the primary concern is the inability to retrieve documents. I\u2019ve refined my analysis to confirm this, and I'm confident in the determined category.\n\n\n**Defining the Root Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the core problem: accessibility. Through a meticulous review, phrases such as \"unable to access documents,\" and \"cannot access\" consistently emerge. The focus isn't simply storage, but the inability to retrieve documents, which firmly situates this ticket under \"Access.\" The nature of the documents (contracts, agreements) provides context, not a new category. Therefore, I will define the most specific category.\n\n\n"
