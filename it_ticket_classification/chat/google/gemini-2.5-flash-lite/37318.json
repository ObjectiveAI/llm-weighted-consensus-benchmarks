I've read the ticket content and am now assessing the potential categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket's content suggests a strong possibility it will land in HR Support. However, I'm carefully considering whether \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" might also be applicable.\n\n\n**Defining Final Category**\n\nI've just finished the final categorization of the IT ticket. After carefully reading through the content, which referenced \"leaver time cards,\" submission issues, and approval workflows, I've concluded that \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category. I considered all other options, but the strong emphasis on employee processes pointed clearly to HR.\n\n\n"
