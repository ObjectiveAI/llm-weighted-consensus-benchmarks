Given the nature of the issue \u2013 a service being down rather than a hardware or access problem \u2013 I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the most appropriate classification, though I'm considering if a more specific, unlisted category might eventually emerge.\n\n**Classifying Service Disruption**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket details and am categorizing this as \"Miscellaneous\". The issue describes a widespread outage of the Outlook web client, which doesn't align with hardware, HR, access, storage, purchase, internal projects, or administrative rights.\n\n**Categorizing Web Client Issue**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket description about the Outlook web client being down. Considering the available categories, \"Access\" seems the most fitting as the core issue prevents users from accessing the web client, even if it's a service-wide outage.\n\n**Investigating Web Client Status**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket's description of the Outlook web client being down. Given this is a service-wide unavailability rather than a personal access problem, I'm categorizing it under \"Miscellaneous\".\n\n**Classifying Web Client Outage**\n\nI'm processing the IT ticket regarding the Outlook web client being down.
