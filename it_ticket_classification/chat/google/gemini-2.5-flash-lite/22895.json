Keywords like \"purchase,\" \"po,\" and \"purchased\" strongly suggest a procurement request.  I'm ruling out other categories as they don't seem applicable based on the provided text. I'll need to double-check to make sure it's the best fit and that there isn't more that could suggest another category.\n\n\n**Finalizing Categorization Decision**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text, considering each keyword. While \"installation\" suggests hardware, the core action is the purchase itself. \"Purchase\" encompasses the entire request: new purchase, purchase order, and the purchased item. No other category aligns as closely with the ticket's primary focus. I am now confident that \"Purchase\" is the correct categorization.\n\n\n"
