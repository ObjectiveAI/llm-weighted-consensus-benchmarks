The ticket text, \"annual leave request\" and \"working days december,\" necessitates a selection from \"Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights.\" The phrasing is somewhat vague, and I'm leaning toward HR Support, given the subject matter.\n\n\n**Analyzing Leave Requests**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment of the ticket. After a deeper dive into the provided text, the leave request aspect is dominating. I've considered the broader implications of \"annual leave,\" including allowances and the approval process. The language and content overwhelmingly point towards HR processes, solidifying my choice of \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n"
