The provided text, specifically references to a \"full mailbox\" and a need to \"increase mailbox size,\" are the key indicators. I'm carefully weighing whether these point towards a broader \"Storage\" issue, an \"Access\" issue, or perhaps even a more specific category from the list.\n\n\n**Defining Correct Category**\n\nMy analysis strongly suggests a 'Storage' category for the ticket. The phrases highlight the user's mailbox capacity concerns, and how to increase or manage it. I'm confident in this classification given the provided details. I've ruled out other categories as they don't capture the essence of mailbox storage constraints.\n\n\n"
