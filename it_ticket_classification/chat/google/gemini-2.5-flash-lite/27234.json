I'm actively building a lexicon of keywords and phrases to map the text to one of the defined categories. I'm prioritizing accuracy in matching to ensure the right category is assigned.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Text**\n\nI've examined the ticket text and isolated relevant keywords like \"new starter,\" \"candidate has accepted,\" and \"create credentials.\" This points towards an HR-related issue. While access creation is implied, I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the primary category, encompassing the initial setup. I'm prioritizing accuracy in this categorization, ensuring the ticket gets routed correctly.\n\n\n**Confirming Ticket Type**\n\nI've determined that the ticket text, revolving around a \"new starter\" and credential creation for a newly accepted candidate, is a clear fit for the \"HR Support\" category.  The phrase \"create his credentials\" is a supporting detail, since the central concern is the onboarding of a new employee, a process that HR initiates. I've considered that while access and admin rights are related, the broader context of a new hire makes \"HR Support\" the optimal choice.\n\n\n"
