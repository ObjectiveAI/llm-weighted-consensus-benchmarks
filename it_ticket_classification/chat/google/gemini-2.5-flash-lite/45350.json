It's about misaligned job position data within Oracle, meaning the critical point is correcting or updating the user's role/title in that system. This is a data-centric issue, therefore, will need further categorization accordingly.\n\n\n**Reclassifying the IT Ticket**\n\nThe process of categorization is ongoing. The existing description of the Oracle issue is focused on misaligned job position information. My focus is now on mapping this specific issue to the most applicable category, and I'm finding \"HR Support\" appears most fitting. The reason is the problem centers on correcting employee job details which falls under HR responsibilities. This classification is now the key area of focus for next steps.\n\n\n"
