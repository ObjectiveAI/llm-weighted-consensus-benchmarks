The text mentions a \"mailbox increase\" and \"archiving,\" leading me towards either a \"Storage\" or potentially an \"Access\" issue. However, \"Storage\" seems more probable given the mention of mailbox size, so I will stick with that for now.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nOkay, the ticket text pointed to mailbox size, so I've decided to prioritize \"Storage\" over \"Access\" due to the specific language used. This is based on examining the user request and ruling out other possibilities like hardware or HR support issues. I've broken down the request into key phrases, then mapped the content to the predefined categories. The main issue at hand is the mailbox size, so \"Storage\" appears most suitable to reflect this situation.\n\n\n"
