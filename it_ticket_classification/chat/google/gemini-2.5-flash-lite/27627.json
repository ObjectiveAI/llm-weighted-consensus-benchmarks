My current goal is to determine if this falls under hardware, software, or a broader project.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the recurring terms to categorize the IT ticket. My current thought is that \"Internal Project\" is the most fitting label, given the focus on systematic upgrades, planned changes (CRs), and asset updates, suggesting a broader organizational effort rather than a singular hardware or access issue.\n\n"
