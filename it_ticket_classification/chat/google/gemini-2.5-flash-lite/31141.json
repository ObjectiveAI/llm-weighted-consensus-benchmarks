The text seems related to wireless connectivity issues within a meeting room.  After a quick scan, \"Access\" appears to be the most relevant option based on the provided keywords. Further refinement may be needed to ensure accuracy before final classification.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Categories**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories to classify an IT ticket. Focusing on keywords like \"wireless access\" and the inability to connect, \"Access\" still seems like the appropriate choice. Though there's a mention of \"restrictions\", it's secondary to the primary wireless connectivity problem, so I'm sticking with \"Access\" for now.\n\n\n**Assigning the Correct Category**\n\nI've been going through the provided IT ticket, breaking down the text to find the best category. The \"wireless access\" issue is clear, and the user can't connect. \"Access\" is the obvious choice. The \"restrictions\" mention is less important than the inability to connect. So, Access is it. I'm ready to produce the output.\n\n\n"
