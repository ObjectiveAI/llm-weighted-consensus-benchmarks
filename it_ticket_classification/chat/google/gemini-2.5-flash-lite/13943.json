My process involves matching the ticket's content to the predefined `category` enum, which includes options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and several others.\n\n**Investigating Display Glitches**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the notebook's display problem. It seems to involve color rendering issues affecting design work, not a simple hardware fault as initially suggested by the monitor mention.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket, trying to pinpoint the most accurate category. My current focus is on the phrases \"notebook cannot say same,\" \"colors problem persist,\" and \"text has shadows,\" which strongly suggest a display issue on the notebook, leading me to believe \"Hardware\" is the most fitting classification among the available options.\n\n**Assigning IT Ticket**\n\nI'm currently classifying an IT ticket. My thought process leads me to categorize this as a \"Hardware\" issue, given the persistent display problems described for the notebook, impacting visual design work and manifesting as color issues and text shadows.\n\n**Categorizing IT Tickets**\n\nMy current focus is on accurately classifying an IT ticket. After analyzing the provided text, I've determined that the recurring display issues described on the notebook, such as color problems and text shadows affecting design work, most closely align with the \"Hardware\" category.\n\n"
