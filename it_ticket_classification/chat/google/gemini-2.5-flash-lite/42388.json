Recently, I'm focusing on identifying key phrases within the ticket text, like \"pending approval,\" which strongly suggests a potential category. My logic is being refined to quickly narrow down the relevant category based on these initial indicators. I'm also ensuring that the context of the entire ticket is considered, avoiding a purely keyword-based approach.\n\n\n**Analyzing Approval Processes**\n\nThe recent focus is on refining the categorization logic. I'm prioritizing the \"approval\" aspect derived from phrases like \"pending approval.\" I'm weighing \"Purchase\" as a strong contender due to equipment mentions. I'm also considering the context and weighing the potential overlap between \"Purchase\" and the more general \"Internal Project\". The key is finding the right balance.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Purpose**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on defining the ticket's core purpose. The frequent mentions of \"pending approval\" and associated terms, combined with the clear need for \"equipment\" and \"purchase requests\", are overwhelmingly pointing towards a \"Purchase\" category. Contextual clues like \"robot avatar\" support this interpretation, reinforcing the connection between the request and the intended use of the purchased items. My latest analysis decisively leans towards classifying this as a purchase request.\n\n\n"
