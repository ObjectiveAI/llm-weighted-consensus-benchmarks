I've noted keywords like \"outlook,\" \"Johannes,\" and \"left,\" pointing towards an HR-related issue. My thought process leans towards either HR Support or Access, but I'm still considering potential overlaps. I need to make a solid call.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket's Scope**\n\nI'm honing in on the \"HR Support\" category as the most accurate fit. The language in the ticket, particularly references to \"Johannes,\" who has \"left,\" and associated calendar information, strongly indicates an employee departure. This is a common HR-driven event. While \"Access\" is relevant to the required actions, \"HR Support\" offers a broader context, aligning with the likely source of this ticket. I've reevaluated the keywords and decided that this ticket clearly requires HR's involvement.\n\n\n"
