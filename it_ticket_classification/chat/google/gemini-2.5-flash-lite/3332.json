Based on the \"backup,\" \"storage issues,\" and \"production protection\" mentions, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Storage.\" The other categories don't seem like a fit. I need to make sure though.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content, focusing on terms like \"backup,\" \"storage,\" and \"production protection.\" After a detailed analysis of the available categories, \"Storage\" emerges as the most fitting and accurate classification. The user's query centers on backup and storage-related concerns, solidifying my decision. Other options are either irrelevant or too broad in comparison.\n\n\n"
