Considering \"new starters applications management\" and \"discipline name correction,\" I'm leaning toward either HR Support or Access, but still weighing the nuance. I'm focusing on the core activity and the most relevant fit. I'm starting to exclude irrelevant or general categories.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Key Activities**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the account management aspect. It seems the core of the issue involves user provisioning and potentially correcting access-related details for new hires. The \"discipline name correction\" is increasingly suggesting user profile updates, reinforcing the account management focus. I'm moving toward Access or HR Support, but Access feels like the better fit based on the dominant theme of user accounts.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket: HR Focused**\n\nI'm now focusing on the ticket's core function: onboarding. The internship program and new-hire applications point strongly to an HR process. I'm prioritizing \"HR Support\" because it covers the data correction and account setup needs of new users. Considering account management implications for the new user, this category seems better, even though access administration is involved.\n\n\n"
