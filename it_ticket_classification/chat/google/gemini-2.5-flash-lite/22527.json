My current thinking is leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" given the focus on specific functionalities within Confluence, rather than hardware, access, or administrative matters.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently refining my categorization by closely examining the keywords and context of the ticket. My analysis suggests that the request pertains to a specific functionality within Confluence regarding report insertion and limitations, which doesn't neatly fit into the more defined categories. I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the most appropriate classification due to the lack of a more precise match for a software feature usage or reporting-related query.\n\n**Focusing on Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm currently reviewing the ticket's details, specifically the keywords \"confluence\" and \"inserting reports,\" to determine its most appropriate classification from the available options.

The keywords \"Confluence,\" \"inserting reports,\" and metrics like \"created vs resolved,\" coupled with the role of an \"acting test lead,\" are leading me to favor \"Internal Project\" over \"Miscellaneous\" as a more precise descriptor for this ticket's context.\n\n"
