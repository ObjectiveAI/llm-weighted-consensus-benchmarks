The keywords suggest a focus on client connectivity, possibly indicating a network or access issue. I am considering the \"Access\" category due to the connection-related terminology.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've carefully re-examined the ticket text, considering the phrases \"client connection,\" \"guest wireless,\" and \"separate cable availability.\" This points towards an access issue. My current thinking aligns strongly with the \"Access\" category, as the user is explicitly requesting a solution for network connectivity, particularly regarding permanent and guest wireless connections. The request for a \"solution\" reinforces this.\n\n\n**Defining the Best Fit**\n\nI've refined my assessment of the ticket text, focusing on the core request for connectivity solutions. Considering the phrases \"permanent guest wireless,\" and \"separate cable availability,\" the \"Access\" category seems most appropriate. The user's query about these connectivity options aligns perfectly with access-related issues. I am certain now that this category is the best fit, as the issue clearly concerns network access and connection methods.\n\n\n"
