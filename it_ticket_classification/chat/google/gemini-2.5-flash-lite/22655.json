The phrasing \"password reset for external user\" strongly suggests an \"Access\" issue. I'm also considering the \"forgot mention commercial change\" which makes me think this may be a \"Miscellaneous\" issue if that is a catch-all in the user's system. The user needs to clarify that.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Requirements**\n\nI've further analyzed the ticket's text, focusing on the core request for a password reset for an external user. The keywords \"password reset\" and \"external user\" consistently point toward an \"Access\" category. Considering the context, phrases like \"forgot mention commercial change\" and \"change PC\" further reinforce this. While other options were considered, \"Access\" remains the most accurate categorization for this request.\n\n\n"
