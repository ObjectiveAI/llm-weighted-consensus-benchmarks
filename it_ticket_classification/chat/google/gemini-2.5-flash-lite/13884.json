Given the keywords \"leaver\" and the context suggesting employee departure (\"leaver for friday,\" etc.), I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support.\" It seems the user is looking for advice related to a leaver. My thinking is, the \"access\" option has less relevance, as this seems to be about the employee leaving, not the employees access.\n\n\n**Re-Evaluating Ticket Taxonomy**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the best category for this IT ticket. Initially, I thought \"HR Support\" was the most fitting, given the \"leaver\" keywords. Now, I'm considering that \"Access\" might be equally or even more appropriate, considering the need to revoke system permissions. I'm torn between the two, because the process involves both aspects.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the keywords and context. The recurring term \"leaver,\" coupled with phrases like \"leaver for friday,\" definitively points to an employee departure. This has reinforced my earlier conclusion: \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category, encompassing the holistic leaver process, including necessary access revocations. While \"Access\" is a consequence of the process, HR is the initial trigger. I'm now certain of this categorization.\n\n\n"
