The phrase \"invisible docs\" coupled with the need for retrieval, searching old results, and lack of document visibility, directly points towards an access-related concern. After careful analysis, I've eliminated other categories such as \"Storage\" or \"Miscellaneous\" as they didn't capture the essence of the ticket's problem.\n\n\n"
