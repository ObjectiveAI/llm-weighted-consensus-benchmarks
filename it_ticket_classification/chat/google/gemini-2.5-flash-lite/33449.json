The keywords seem related to a migration to Git, which could fall under \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Storage.\" I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" due to the nature of the task described.\n\n\n**Assessing the Core Task**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and narrowed down the ticket's primary focus. Although user rights are mentioned, the core need is migrating a repository to Git. This highlights a development infrastructure change. \"Internal Project\" now seems a strong contender, since it reflects the nature of the task. However, I want to confirm that it's the right choice.\n\n\n**Evaluating Category Options**\n\nMy analysis continues, focusing on the ticket's primary goal: the repository migration to Git. User rights are mentioned but are secondary to the core technical task. This suggests a strong leaning towards \"Internal Project,\" as it encompasses development infrastructure changes. I am considering this carefully, as the task appears to have high importance. I'm focusing on the nature of \"Internal Project\".\n\n\n**Selecting the Optimal Fit**\n\nI'm now fully confident that \"Internal Project\" best categorizes this ticket, given its explicit focus on migrating a repository. The \"user rights\" aspect is secondary to this core technical objective. The ticket describes a defined task to improve the internal development infrastructure, strongly fitting the category's scope.\n\n\n"
