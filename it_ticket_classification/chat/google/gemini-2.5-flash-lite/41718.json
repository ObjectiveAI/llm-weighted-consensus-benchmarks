It appears the user is reporting an error with annual leave days. I'm currently leaning towards categorizing this as a \"HR/Payroll\" issue, based on the keywords I've picked out. I'm now structuring the output JSON.\n\n\n**Revising Categorization Approach**\n\nI'm now refining the classification approach based on the ticket text. The phrases \"wrong number of annual days,\" \"annual days left,\" and \"annual leave days\" indicate an issue linked to employee entitlements. Considering the available categories (Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights), \"HR Support\" appears the most suitable. I'm structuring the JSON output accordingly, with \"HR Support\" as the assigned category value.\n\n\n"
