Initially, I'll need to output a JSON object with \"category\" and one of the prescribed values: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\".  My current approach involves a detailed analysis of the text to identify key terms and their relation to the available categories.\n\n\n**Categorizing Meeting Room Requests**\n\nI've been analyzing the text of the IT ticket concerning the meeting room finder. It's clear that the primary concern isn't about hardware issues, HR support, access rights, miscellaneous IT queries, storage limitations, or purchase requests. Instead, it seems to fall under the category of \"Internal Project,\" as it involves the functionality and features of a specific internal application. I'm focusing on keywords like \"meeting room,\" \"finder,\" \"booking,\" and \"open/booked\" to confirm this categorization.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Assignment**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the meeting room finder ticket and confirmed my initial assessment. It's clearly about the development or improvement of an internal tool, specifically the \"meeting room finder\". After examining all provided ticket text, and identifying keywords like \"meeting room,\" \"finder,\" \"booking,\" and the request to \"add jersey meeting room list,\" I'm confident that \"Internal Project\" is the best categorization. My analysis consistently points towards feature requests and enhancements to an existing internal system, confirming that \"Internal Project\" is the appropriate fit.\n\n\n"
