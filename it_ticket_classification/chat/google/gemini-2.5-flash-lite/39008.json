'Hardware' is definitely out, as there's no physical hardware involved. I'm carefully considering the remaining options, keeping in mind the core issue is the creation of a timecard. I'll need to rule out irrelevant categories before selecting the most appropriate one.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI've refined my category selection to focus on the timecard issue. The initial review of options like \"Hardware\" and \"Storage\" led me to exclude them as irrelevant. Now, the emphasis is on \"HR Support\", which aligns with the timecard function's core HR nature. I've considered \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights\" in context, finding they could be secondary causes, but the heart of this problem is supporting an HR-related system, making \"HR Support\" the best fit.\n\n\n"
