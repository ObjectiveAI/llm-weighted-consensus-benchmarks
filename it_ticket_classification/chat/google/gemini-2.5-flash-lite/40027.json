It seems the core issue revolves around a problem within the HR domain, specifically related to the process of recommending someone. The other categories don't quite fit, and I am leaning towards \"HR Support\".\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on the phrase \"recommending a friend for a job.\" This immediately points towards an HR function. While I considered \"Access,\" the core problem is a bug in the recommendation process itself, not simply a lack of access. The issue isn't hardware, storage, purchases, or admin rights; it's a specific functionality within the HR domain. \"HR Support\" remains the most accurate categorization, given the user's need to perform an HR-related action.\n\n\n"
