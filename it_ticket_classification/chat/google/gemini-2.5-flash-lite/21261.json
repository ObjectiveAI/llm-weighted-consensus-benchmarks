The repetition of \"cleaning process\" suggests a possible need for support, which needs to be clarified by the available categories.\n\n\n**Assessing Project Scope**\n\nI'm now evaluating the category \"Internal Project\". The ticket's text, discussing application logic standardization, improvements, and statuses, strongly aligns with internal development activities. The phrases \"example order improve performance application\" and \"looking standardize leave\" point toward ongoing project work. I've ruled out other categories like hardware, HR, access, storage, and purchasing as inapplicable. \"Miscellaneous\" remains a fallback if \"Internal Project\" doesn't fully capture the essence, but I lean towards this category based on the provided text.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Category Match**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. Analyzing further, the ticket's language about \"schema,\" \"logic standardization,\" and \"performance improvement\" aligns perfectly. The phrases about process clarification may suggest a documentation task, which could be part of an internal project to improve system documentation. The exclusion of other categories is confirmed, making \"Internal Project\" the most likely classification, with \"Miscellaneous\" as the distant backup.\n\n\n"
