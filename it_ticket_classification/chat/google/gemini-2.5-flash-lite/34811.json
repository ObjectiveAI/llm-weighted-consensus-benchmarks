I'm cross-referencing this to make sure, maybe there's an administrative aspect as well. I'm exploring if \"Administrative rights\" is relevant too but I'm leaning toward \"Storage\" at the moment, given the repetitive nature of \"mailbox full\" in the description.\n\n\n**Defining the Scope**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"Storage\" category as the primary classification for this ticket, given the consistent mention of a full mailbox and requests to expand storage capacity. While there might be minor administrative actions required, the core issue and solution are undeniably storage-related. I'm satisfied that my initial assessment is sound, now I'll prepare the response.\n\n\n"
