I've begun to recognize key phrases that point to specific categories. For example, connection issues lean toward \"Access,\" while software requests suggest \"Purchase.\" This involves creating an initial mapping of keywords to categories. I am beginning to handle edge cases, where tickets are less clear in their primary focus.\n\n\n**Focusing on Category Assignment**\n\nI've just assessed the IT ticket example and have decided the appropriate category for the ticket is \"Access.\" The ticket content strongly suggests connectivity issues with the Exchange server and the general server, indicating access problems. The provided text contains phrases that hint at network access.\n\n\n"
