                    "reasoning": "**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the ticket text. The goal is to map the user's request, focusing on terms like \"server on\" to the most appropriate category within the provided schema. The categories are: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\". My initial focus is on keywords to determine the primary function, and from there to map them to the corresponding pre-defined ticket categories.\n\n\n**Categorizing IT Request**\n\nI'm now identifying the most fitting category for this IT request. I've broken down the text and found the key themes are installation of an application, certificate management, and connectivity/authorization. \"Server on\" isn't explicitly mentioned, but the underlying issue seems related to these broader areas. My focus has shifted from solely relying on keywords to considering the context and overall function.\n\n\n\n**Mapping Ticket Themes**\n\nI've re-evaluated the themes in light of the categories. The ticket text is a technical request involving app installation, certificate management, and connectivity issues. While \"Access\" could apply, the core seems to be broader: deploying and securing an application, which could fall under server setup and app configuration.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've re-evaluated the user's request. The primary focus seems to be troubleshooting technical setup, which likely involves setting up a new feature or application. I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as the closest fit due to the developmental nature of the issues, considering the app, certificates, and secure communication setup. I am considering \"Access\" as secondary, given the secure communication components.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've re-evaluated the user's request, considering the latest analysis. My focus has sharpened to determine the most fitting category. While \"Access\" could apply due to the secure connection requirements, I'm leaning more towards \"Internal Project\" as the root issue. It encompasses the configuration, troubleshooting, and developmental nature of the described task. It seems the user is building something which is experiencing ongoing issues, so a project category seems likely.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Context**\n\nNow, I'm analyzing the context further. The recurring focus on secure connections and certificate management, alongside phrases like \"next version,\" strongly suggests internal project work. While \"Access\" could be relevant, \"Internal Project\" best encompasses the configuration, deployment, and troubleshooting elements of this task. It includes setup of secure application access.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe focus has shifted towards the core technical challenges, and I've analyzed if the nature of the described issues points to the broader context of building an internal product. Specifically, the \"callback\" feature and \"next version\" references suggest an \"Internal Project\" best encompasses the configuration, deployment, and troubleshooting elements of this task.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Scope**\n\nI've narrowed down the context. The frequent focus on secure connections and certificate management, along with mentions of a \"next version,\" strongly suggests that this work involves an internal project. While \"Access\" could be relevant, \"Internal Project\" best encompasses the configuration, deployment, and troubleshooting elements of the task, including setting up secure application access.\n\n\n"
