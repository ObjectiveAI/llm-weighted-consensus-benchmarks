My focus is on assigning the most appropriate category from the provided list: [\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\"].\n\n**Refining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm still working on categorizing the Oracle Fusion report data source change ticket. After reviewing the available options, I've narrowed it down. The request involves modifying report functionality by changing a data field, which doesn't fit neatly into hardware, access, or purchase. It's more of a configuration or data-related adjustment.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've re-evaluated the IT ticket concerning the Oracle Fusion report data source change. While the action is technical, the context of \"staff assignments\" and \"employment location\" strongly suggests an HR-related purpose. Therefore, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most fitting category for this specific request.\n\n**Refining IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've re-evaluated the IT ticket concerning the Oracle Fusion report data source change.
