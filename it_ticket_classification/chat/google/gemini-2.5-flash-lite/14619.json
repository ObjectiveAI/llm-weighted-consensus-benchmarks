The options I'm working with are \"Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights\". The text \"timecards missing Tuesday pm\" and \"re please action\" are the only clues.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe analysis points towards an HR-related issue. Timecard management, reminders, and established submission processes strongly suggest the \"HR Support\" category is most fitting. The \"pc\" mention is likely secondary. Now, I'm focusing on crafting a succinct and informative categorization rationale for this ticket.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Type**\n\nI've examined the ticket text more closely, looking for context clues. It appears to focus around timecard completion and submission difficulties, specifically with employees on gardening leave, and reminders. The text describes an issue with the process rather than a hardware problem. This further validates \"HR Support\" as the appropriate category, not hardware, access, or other IT related functions.\n\n\n"
