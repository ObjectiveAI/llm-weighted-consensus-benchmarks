It's becoming clear that the focus on \"deleting a document library\" suggests a category from this list, rather than, say, \"HR Support\" or \"Internal Project\". I've begun to consider the nuances of \"Storage\" and \"Access\" in relation to the function. This action might impact data storage or data permissions.\n\n\n**Focusing on \"Storage\"**\n\nI'm solidifying my assessment. The request to delete a document library undeniably points towards \"Storage\". This aligns perfectly with the impact on file management, and makes other options seem less applicable. Deleting a document library is a storage management function, full stop.\n\n\n"
