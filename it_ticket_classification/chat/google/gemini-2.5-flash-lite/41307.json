I'm taking a moment to eliminate irrelevant choices and zeroing in on the best fit.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Issues**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided text and narrowed the issue down to \"Access\". The phrases consistently point toward password reset and expiration problems for external clients. After thoroughly comparing the problem to other categories such as HR support and hardware, I concluded that \"Access\" is the most fitting choice. It matches directly the user's core trouble.\n\n\n"
