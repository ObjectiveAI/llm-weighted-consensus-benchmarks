I've noted the keywords: \"direct reports missing time,\" and \"reports.\" This initial assessment suggests a potential issue related to employee time tracking or reporting. I'm carefully reviewing the context to determine the best fit from the provided categories, leaning towards \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access,\" depending on the specifics of the reports in question.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Relevance**\n\nI've delved deeper into the ticket's language. The focus on employee records, absences (like maternity leave), and \"direct reports\" confirms an HR-centric issue. The phrase \"person record\" and the absence-related details solidify the HR support category. No system access, hardware, storage, purchase, or administrative rights concerns are apparent.\n\n\n"
