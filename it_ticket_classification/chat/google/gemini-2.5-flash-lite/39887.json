I'm leaning toward \"Access\" since the words \"access,\" \"card,\" and \"open\" are present, but I'm cross-referencing this to ensure it's not a different category, like \"Hardware.\"\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI've refined my category selection to \"Access,\" confirming the initial hunch based on keywords and the problem description. Now, I'm analyzing the provided text's specifics, noting the precise location mentioned to understand the access limitation. The \"Access\" category seems most aligned with the issue described and aligns well with my initial assessment.\n\n\n**Defining the Issue's Scope**\n\nI'm now focusing on confirming the final category after carefully analyzing the ticket text. \"Access\" is still the leading contender, as the ticket clearly concerns card access and location-based limitations. I'm ensuring there are no hidden details suggesting a different category is better suited.\n\n\n"
