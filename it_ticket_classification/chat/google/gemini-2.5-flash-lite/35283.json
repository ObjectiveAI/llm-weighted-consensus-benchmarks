The content strongly suggests an issue related to submitting employee-related documentation for approval, pointing me towards a specific support area.\n\n**Selecting HR Support Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's content, which heavily features terms like \"submit cards for approval,\" \"timecard,\" \"bookings,\" and \"leave days.\" Based on this, I'm confident that \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category for this ticket.\n\n"
