My initial approach was to use keyword matching, but I'm now exploring a more nuanced approach. I'm considering using semantic analysis to better understand the user's intent, and the relationship between the keywords.  The ticket has phrases which don't obviously fit any category, so I'm trying to balance accuracy and completeness, considering edge cases.\n\n\n**Determining Category Assignment**\n\nI've homed in on \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category for that ticket. The crucial keywords were \"paternal leave\" and \"planned vacation\", strongly aligning with employee benefits and time off. I've ruled out other categories like \"Hardware\" and \"Storage\", which are clearly irrelevant based on the text.\n\n\n"
