Keywords like \"hybrid cloud computing,\" \"self assessment,\" and \"criterion\" are the most recent findings. I'm carefully comparing these terms to the available categories to determine the best match. My goal is an accurate categorization!\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI've re-evaluated the categories and believe \"Internal Project\" best captures the essence. The ticket outlines a comprehensive initiative encompassing self-assessment, strategy, and improvement centered around hybrid cloud, skills, and external consultants. This represents a structured internal project aimed at organizational enhancement, not hardware, HR, access, storage, purchase, or administrative rights.\n\n\n**Revisiting the Choice**\n\nI've re-reviewed the ticket text with the updated keywords in mind. The mention of \"regulatory compliance\" and \"contractual conditions\" adds another layer to the strategic scope. \"Maturity assessment\" and \"cost-benefit analysis\" reinforce the internal project focus. The involvement of \"senior level positions\" and \"hired consultants\" further highlights the structured, enterprise-wide project.\n\n\n"
