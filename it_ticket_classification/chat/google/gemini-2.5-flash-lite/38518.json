The issue description is a bit ambiguous, but I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Access\" due to the mention of \"code\" and \"submit\". I'm carefully weighing the possibilities against the available categories to make the best determination.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Ticket**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's keywords, focusing on \"project code\" and \"submit.\"  \"Oracle\" seems less relevant. \"Finding\" the code points towards access, but the context leans more towards an \"Internal Project\" issue because it suggests a system managing these codes. The urgency (\"high priority\") is noted.\n\n\n**Refining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"project code\" aspect. While \"Access\" could be a factor, the focus is on locating and using the code within an internal system, making \"Internal Project\" the stronger fit. The ticket's urgency is clear, but the core problem appears to be a procedural hurdle related to project code management. I'm focusing on the nature of this hurdle.\n\n\n"
