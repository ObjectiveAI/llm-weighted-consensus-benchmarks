I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most suitable choice, because the terms \"leaver form\" and \"leaver notification\" are present. I want to ensure my categorization is accurate.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Details**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket content, and the focus on \"leaver form,\" \"notification,\" and \"AD disabled\" processes are clear indicators for the correct category. The language reinforces an employee departing, which aligns with HR. The ticket involves form completion, and account deactivation, and all point to \"HR Support\" being the right choice.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket's Focus**\n\nI'm solidifying my assessment. The combination of \"leaver form,\" \"notification,\" \"AD disabled,\" and \"reset date\" seals it. The language paints a clear picture of an employee departing, triggering specific HR processes. I'm confident in \"HR Support\" as the right category, it's the most inclusive and precise. It encompasses form completion, access adjustments, and notification management.\n\n\n"
