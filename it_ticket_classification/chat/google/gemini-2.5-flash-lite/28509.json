It's difficult because the text is really short and doesn't have much context, but I can see it's about someone starting a new job, so I might need to make assumptions. I'm considering all the options and trying to rule out which aren't a good fit. I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" because of \"new starter\".\n\n\n**Confirming HR Direction**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment, and \"HR Support\" remains the most viable category. The key phrase \"new starter\" solidifies this direction. The additional details, while present, don't change this, as they function more as contextual pieces than category drivers. I've ruled out the IT-centric categories based on the content. The phrases like \"enclosed\" and \"regards\" are simply email boilerplate, irrelevant to classification.\n\n\n"
