The key elements seem to point towards an access issue related to file manipulation. My current hypothesis leans toward narrowing it down to \"Access\" or \"Storage,\" but the precise category remains unclear, it might also be \"Hardware\". Further analysis is needed to confirm the best fit.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nMy analysis now definitively favors \"Access\" as the ideal ticket category. The user's inability to copy files, coupled with explicit mention of a \"file server access request\" and the need for write permissions, paints a clear picture of an access-related issue. While \"Storage\" was considered initially, the focus on permission and file modification strongly indicates \"Access\" as the more precise and suitable choice. \"Administrative rights\" remains off the mark due to its broad system-level implication.\n\n\n"
