Phrases like \"cannot connect\" and \"issue\" are recurring, but they lack specific context. The \"intern\" reference is interesting; it might indicate an HR or Access issue, but I'm hesitant without more information. My instinct leans towards a general \"Miscellaneous\" category at this stage, but I'm still processing.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Category**\n\nI'm now leaning heavily towards \"Access\" as the ideal category. The \"cannot connect\" issue is central, and it's too general to pinpoint hardware. This phrase can mean so many things like a network policy violation, a configuration problem, or a disabled service. The word \"Intern\" is less of a factor, and \"Access\" feels the best fit for this broad problem.\n\n\n**Confirming the Access Category**\n\nI've been going through the analysis, and the phrase \"cannot connect\" continues to weigh heavily on my mind. While the \"intern\" part is somewhat relevant, the focus remains the connection problem, which is core to the Access category. My current process is confirming that Access is the *best* broad match for \"cannot connect\". It feels like an appropriate choice, as it is a general categorization.\n\n\n"
