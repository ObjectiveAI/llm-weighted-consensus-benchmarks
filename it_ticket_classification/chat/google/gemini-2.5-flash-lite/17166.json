                    "reasoning": "**Mapping Ticket Contents**\n\nI'm currently focused on the ticket content and how it maps to the categories. The text \"new starter tuesday pm re hello please find attached\" doesn't provide enough information yet for a definitive categorization. I need to consider what information is typically associated with new employee processes to make a judgment call if it is one of the categories. I'm leaning toward HR Support.\n\n\n**Revising Category Considerations**\n\nI've re-analyzed the ticket text. While initially leaning towards HR Support, the presence of \"credentials\" and \"changing default\" now pushes me toward a dual categorization of \"Access\" and \"HR Support\". The phrase \"new starter\" remains a strong HR indicator. Considering that new employee setups often involve both access provisioning and HR processes, this seems the most accurate. I'm exploring how to represent this dual categorization effectively.\n\n\n**Defining Prioritization Criteria**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the categories based on the strongest indicators within the ticket text. \"New starter\" remains a primary signal towards HR. While \"credentials\" and \"changing default\" suggest \"Access\", the context of a new employee setup leads me to prioritize \"HR Support\" as the main classification. I'm exploring how to account for the \"Access\" aspect as a secondary, or related category. I'm thinking about whether to denote the primary and secondary categories.\n\n\n**Categorizing Onboarding Context**\n\nI'm now viewing the ticket through the lens of onboarding. The ticket text strongly implies a request related to setting up a new employee. This context, emphasized by \"new starter,\" leads me to prioritize \"HR Support\" as the primary category, while also considering \"Access\" for the credentials aspect. I am examining how to represent the dual nature of this request.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Context**\n\nI'm now assessing the ticket as an onboarding setup, where the \"new starter\" context dominates. While access requests are present, the emphasis on a new employee's needs prioritizes HR support. \"Credentials\" and \"changing default\" suggest Access, but the overarching aim is to get a new starter operational, and that falls under HR's umbrella. The presence of the administration officer also reinforces an onboarding context. I'm choosing \"HR Support\" as primary, with a consideration for \"Access\" as a related category, given the nature of the specific requests.\n\n\n**Defining a Primary Category**\n\nI'm now prioritizing \"HR Support\" as the main category, even though the text highlights access-related needs. The presence of the phrase \"new starter\" strongly suggests an HR-driven onboarding process. While \"credentials\" and \"changing default\" are direct indicators of \"Access\", the overall context aligns more closely with HR's responsibility in setting up new employees' access.\n\n\n**Determining the Core Purpose**\n\nThe emphasis shifted to prioritizing the context of a new hire. Considering \"new starter\" as key, \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate primary categorization, given that setting up credentials for a new employee is part of HR's onboarding workflow.\n\n**Choosing Onboarding Focus**\n\nI now understand that \"HR Support\" should be the main category. It's because the phrase \"new starter\" indicates an onboarding process handled by HR, which requires IT support for credentialing. Although the ticket contains an access request, the main focus is setting up a new employee, which is handled in conjunction with HR.\n\n\n"
