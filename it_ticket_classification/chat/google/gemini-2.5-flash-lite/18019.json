I'm leaning toward either HR Support or Access, but will need more context. I'm carefully evaluating the relevance of \"Confluence\" and \"attached details\" to further refine the categorization. The aim is to make the best possible initial judgement.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the central issue: new starter access to Confluence. \"Bucharest\" provides location context but isn't a determining category. The priority now is accurately assigning this request to the \"Access\" category, as the primary requirement is likely related to granting the new hire proper Confluence permissions. While HR Support is relevant, the initial focus appears to be access provisioning.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've narrowed the choice down to \"Access,\" as the focus is on a new employee needing Confluence access. The keywords 'new starter' and 'Confluence' sealed the deal. While HR support might be involved, the core IT task is access provisioning, aligning the request with the \"Access\" category. Considering the context, I think it's the most accurate classification.\n\n\n"
