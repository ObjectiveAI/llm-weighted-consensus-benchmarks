So far, the phrase \"planned leave related\" suggests an HR Support angle, but I am still evaluating the presence of any other keywords or contextual clues. I'm focusing on the overall context to make the right call.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Context**\n\nI've been leaning heavily towards HR Support as the primary category, given the strong presence of HR-related keywords like \"planned leave,\" \"terminated,\" and the request to \"make changes.\" While \"access\" is relevant, the overarching context of HR events strengthens the case for HR Support as the more fitting choice. I'm prioritizing the broader context, aligning it with the employee's status changes.\n\n\n**Evaluating HR Impact**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the strong HR implications within the ticket text. The terms \"planned leave\" and \"terminated\" are driving my decision toward HR Support. The request to amend or make changes to allocations is a direct consequence of these HR events, solidifying the choice. I'm prioritizing the context of employee status changes as the primary factor.\n\n\n"
