The keywords are proving helpful, particularly \"project\" which points towards \"Internal Project\" as a strong contender. The rest are a bit fuzzy, I'll need to explore the ticket context to determine any possible overlaps. I am leaning towards filtering out any of the more specific categories.\n\n\n**Evaluating Specificity Further**\n\nI'm now diving deeper into the nuances of the \"Internal Project\" category, given the strong project management vibe. I'm trying to figure out if there's a more specific subcategory or if \"Internal Project\" is the most apt choice. The developer-focused language in the description is leaning me away from broader categories like \"Miscellaneous\" or \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the ticket description and all potential categories. While \"Internal Project\" felt likely from the start, I wanted to rigorously rule out other options. The absence of hardware, HR, access, storage, and purchase-related keywords solidified my confidence. The project management and developer-focused language made \"Internal Project\" the clear winner. I'm now certain this is the correct category for this ticket.\n\n\n"
