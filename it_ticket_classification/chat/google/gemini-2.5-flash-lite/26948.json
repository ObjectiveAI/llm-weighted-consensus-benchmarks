I'm leaning toward HR Support, however I'm also considering Access.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Details**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and the provided categories to determine the best fit. While \"oracle issues\" suggests potential technical problems, the recurring theme is \"direct reports missing time\" and the processes surrounding report submission. I'm now leaning heavily toward HR Support and Access due to the employee time tracking and access to reporting systems. The maternity leave mention is a strong indicator of HR involvement, and the Oracle issues may affect employee time reporting.\n\n\n**Clarifying HR Focus**\n\nI'm now fully focused on HR support for this ticket. The combination of \"direct reports missing time,\" \"maternity leave,\" and the reporting process, especially the weekly submissions, all solidify my categorization. Even if Oracle is involved, it affects HR processes related to tracking employee time and producing reports.\n\n\n"
