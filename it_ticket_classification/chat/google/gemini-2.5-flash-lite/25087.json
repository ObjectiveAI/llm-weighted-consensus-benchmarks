The text, \"leavers script hi please run script order how users attached excel file ad active,\" presents a bit of a challenge. I need to distill its essence to select the appropriate category from the provided list.  I'm leaning towards \"Access\" but want to confirm based on the context of the words.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Relevance**\n\nI've been evaluating the ticket text, considering \"leavers script\" as the core issue. I'm now strongly inclined to select \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category. The \"leavers script\" strongly suggests this is linked to the HR offboarding process. While access is a factor in user account deactivation, the primary trigger, a departing employee, is clearly an HR-driven event. \"Access\" is still in the running, but \"HR Support\" is the more direct match.\n\n\n**Resolving Category Choice**\n\nI'm now completely set on \"HR Support.\" The phrase \"leavers script\" is the deciding factor; it's the core focus of the ticket. While access management is involved, it's a consequence of the HR-driven leaver process. Focusing on the script's origin points definitively to an HR-related issue.\n\n\n"
