Based on the text \"add new member,\" I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access,\" but I am also considering \"Miscellaneous\" due to the very ambiguous nature of the description. However, it seems likely that the request involves granting access to a new employee. I'm double-checking the keywords now.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've been evaluating the ticket text, \"add new member to wednesday october pm add member hi please add thanks,\" and have refined my initial classification. While \"Access\" seemed plausible initially, I'm now leaning toward \"HR Support\" because the core action is adding a new person. The date/time elements and polite phrasing don't impact the categorization. The request, at its root, concerns onboarding, which is strongly associated with HR.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Focus**\n\nAfter reviewing the ticket again, \"add new member,\" I'm now certain that \"HR Support\" is the right call. The context of onboarding a new person is clear, aligning perfectly with HR's responsibilities. It's a more encompassing category for the initial process.\n\n\n"
