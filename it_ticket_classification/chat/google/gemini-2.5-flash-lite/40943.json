The phrase \"unable to access\" strongly suggests an \"Access\" related categorization is most probable.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket details and confirmed that the primary concern revolves around a user's inability to access job advertisements on their tablet, while it functions on a mobile phone. This pattern strongly indicates an \"Access\" category is the most appropriate classification for this issue.\n\n"
