The text \"pm change for projects\" and \"pm change both\" seem to relate to project management.  I need to determine if that falls neatly into one of the allowed categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights.  I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" but I need to make sure.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and considering potential categories. The phrases, \"pm change\" and project-related terms, are recurrent. I'm trying to decide between \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or a more specific category if one is available.  \"PAS\" may be a system, so there's a strong chance it's something internal. The record assignment indicates a task. I'm eliminating \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase.\"\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and the available categories. Phrases like \"pm change for projects\" and \"projects new\" strongly suggest an internal project management context. The request also mentions details and requirements, which are typical elements of a project change request. Based on this, I'm confirming that \"Internal Project\" is the best fit, as \"pm change\" likely relates to project management changes, and the overall description involves changes tied to internal projects. I am confident in my selection now.\n\n\n"
