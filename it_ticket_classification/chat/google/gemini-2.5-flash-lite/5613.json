                    "reasoning": "**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the ticket text, \"approval flow for flow hi please help flow code pm approver code which also add second approver other,\" to determine its appropriate category within the provided schema. The keywords related to 'approval' and 'code' are making me lean towards a few potential categories. I need to make a more definitive choice.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text and the available categories. It seems the best fit might be 'Internal Project' since the ticket concerns an approval *process*. While 'Access' is related, the focus isn't on granting specific access, but rather on configuring a workflow. I'm leaning toward 'Internal Project' as it encompasses a broader scope related to internal operational changes.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've been going through the ticket and the category descriptions again. I'm now leaning heavily toward \"Internal Project.\" While the initial thought was on \"Access,\" upon closer inspection of the details, the primary concern appears to be setting up an approval mechanism, which sounds more fitting for a project or internal process. The \"approval flow,\" \"flow code,\" and \"approver\" terms all point towards an internal configuration.\n\n\n**Confirming the Final Classification**\n\nCurrently, I'm analyzing the implications of choosing \"Internal Project\" over \"Access\" more deeply. I'm focusing on the configuration aspect. The core of this request seems to revolve around configuring how approvals work *within* an internal system. The details provided, particularly \"flow code\" and the addition of a \"second approver,\" strongly point towards an internal workflow setting. The objective of the ticket is to establish an internal process, so I'm finalizing my decision.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Assessment**\n\nI'm now fully confident in classifying this ticket under \"Internal Project.\" While the initial leaning towards \"Access\" was understandable due to the role-based nature, the emphasis is on workflow *configuration*. The phrase \"approval flow for flow code pm approver code which also add second approver\" clearly indicates the focus is on a system or project's internal process rather than granting direct access. The keywords related to 'flow', 'code', 'pm', and roles cement this decision.\n\n\n**Confirming Final Category**\n\nI'm now fully confident in classifying this as \"Internal Project.\" While the initial leaning was toward \"Access\" due to potential user-based permissions, the emphasis here is squarely on workflow *configuration*, which is a key trait of a project task. The request focuses on an \"approval flow,\" setting approver \"codes,\" and adding roles, which all suggest a system or project process. The term \"similar role\" further emphasizes the setting up or modifying of a workflow system.\n\n\n**Focusing on Workflow Configuration**\n\nI'm now completely confident in classifying this ticket as \"Internal Project.\" While initially, there was a slight leaning towards 'Access,' considering the roles involved, the primary emphasis is on configuring a specific internal *workflow*. The terms \"approval flow\" and \"flow code\" strongly signal a system configuration request, and \"add second approver\" supports the focus on workflow design.\n\n\n**Deciding on the Correct Category**\n\nI'm solidifying my choice. The \"flow code\" and \"add second approver\" phrases strongly suggest this is about configuring an *internal* system's approval process. While \"Access\" is relevant, the core issue is the workflow setup within a project or internal system.\n\n\n"
