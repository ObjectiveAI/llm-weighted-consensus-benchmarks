I'm reviewing the ticket details to refine the categorization.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've evaluated the IT ticket text, which highlights \"report access\" problems, difficulty \"navigating requests,\" and being unable to \"find\" reports. The predefined categories were reviewed: hardware, HR support, access, miscellaneous, storage, purchase, and internal project. \"Access\" is the most fitting because the core issue is about getting to and finding reports, making it a better fit than the more general \"miscellaneous\" or the potentially relevant but less direct \"administrative rights\".\n\n\n"
