So far, the language suggests the issue involves logging time for a new employee. I'm leaning toward either HR Support, or possibly Access, but I need more context to be sure. I'm focusing on keywords like \"starter\" and \"log time\" to pinpoint the best fit. I'll need more info to determine if it's strictly a system access issue.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on whether the issue is primarily access-related, or if it's a broader HR onboarding problem. The repeated use of \"starter\" and the need to \"log time\" strongly point towards HR Support. While \"access\" is mentioned, the core complaint is about data entry for a new employee and onboarding issues. This suggests the access problem is a symptom of a larger HR process issue. The \"membership start date\" and \"profile description\" further reinforce this.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Onboarding**\n\nI've refined the categorization to focus on the time-entry challenges related to the new \"starter,\" and the onboarding flow. The \"membership start date\" and \"profile description\" details strongly link it to HR processes. While \"access\" is mentioned, it's more of a secondary concern tied to data entry. The colleagues' involvement in logging time further solidified my assessment; this is not just an access issue.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the fact that the primary concern is the inability to log time, particularly for a new hire (\"starter\"). While \"access\" is mentioned, it seems a secondary symptom of a larger HR Support issue. The focus on time entry for a new employee and the reference to an \"HR contact\" further solidify this categorization.\n\n\n"
