I'm leaning towards \"Hardware,\" but I need to ensure there are no other relevant keywords before making a final decision. I'll focus on excluding irrelevant categories like HR or Access.\n\n\n**Narrowing Hardware Focus**\n\nI've determined that the \"Hardware\" category is the most appropriate. The issue described focuses on a monitor or TV failing to display an image when a laptop is connected. While I considered \"Miscellaneous,\" the hardware malfunction is the core of the problem. It seems safe to exclude \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase.\" The internal project possibility doesn't fit the focus of the issue.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the ticket description and considered each category. The issue lies within a physical display (monitor or TV) failing to display the laptop image. After ruling out other options, \"Hardware\" is the most direct and accurate categorization. The phrase \"same issue matter what laptop we use\" solidifies this conclusion. No other category, such as Internal Project or Miscellaneous, truly captures the core problem. The ticket is definitively hardware-related.\n\n\n"
