The language around \"holiday request\" is key. \"Not received,\" \"received,\" and \"submitted\" point strongly towards an HR-related issue. My initial thought leans toward \"HR Support\" as the most relevant category. I'm now cross-checking for any other subtle clues within the text.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's language, zeroing in on phrases like \"holiday request\" and \"submitted requests\". It's pretty clear this centers on managing leave. I've ruled out hardware, access, and storage as unsuitable. While \"internal project\" and \"purchase\" are possibilities, the phrases strongly imply HR-related functions, and this will be my focus for the category.\n\n\n"
