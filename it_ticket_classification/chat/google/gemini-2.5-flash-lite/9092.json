I'm examining keywords like \"leaver,\" \"mailbox,\" \"AD rights,\" and \"token\" to accurately map them to categories such as \"Access\" or \"HR Support,\" considering the employee departure context.\n\n**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI've refined my analysis, zeroing in on the core function of managing a departing employee's digital footprint. My conclusion is that the ticket most accurately falls under \"Access,\" encompassing the deactivation of user accounts, mailbox management, and permission adjustments.\n\n"
