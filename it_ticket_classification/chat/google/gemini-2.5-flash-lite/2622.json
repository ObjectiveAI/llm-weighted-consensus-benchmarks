Analyzing keywords like \"monitor\" and \"purchase\" has led me to prioritize \"Purchase\" as a likely category, especially with phrases like \"purchase requested.\" Refining the criteria to differentiate between similar tickets is a work in progress.\n\n\n**Revising Category Priorities**\n\nI've re-evaluated the category weights, and \"Purchase\" remains the strongest contender. Although \"monitor\" keywords initially suggested \"Hardware,\" the specific phrase \"purchase requested\" solidifies \"Purchase\" as the dominant category. I've ruled out \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and others as clearly irrelevant, and \"Miscellaneous\" feels too vague given the purchase request's specificity. Ultimately, the ticket's core intent centers on a product acquisition.\n\n\n**Identifying Main Ticket Theme**\n\nI've homed in on \"Purchase\" as the definitive category. While keywords like \"monitor\" initially suggested \"Hardware,\" the overarching context, particularly the phrase \"purchase requested\", makes \"Purchase\" the most accurate fit. I've considered other categories, but \"Purchase\" captures the core intent more precisely than \"Hardware\" or the broader \"Miscellaneous.\" The final determination is now locked in.\n\n\n"
