My focus is on terms like \"contract,\" \"countersigned,\" and \"extension,\" which suggest an administrative or contractual process rather than a direct IT request. I'm evaluating how these fit within the existing categories like \"Miscellaneous\" or potentially a broader \"Procurement\" if it were available.\n\n**Analyzing Contractual Approvals**\n\nI'm refining my understanding of how to categorize tickets focused on contractual processes. My current efforts involve interpreting terms like \"contract ID\" and \"countersigned\" to determine the most suitable classification, leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as a default for these administrative-heavy requests given the provided IT-centric categories.\n\n**Categorizing Contract Approvals**\n\nI'm continuing to refine my classification logic.
