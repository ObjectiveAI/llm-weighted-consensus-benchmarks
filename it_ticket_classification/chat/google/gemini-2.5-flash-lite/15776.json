The words 'borrowed book' and 'library' suggest something not directly related to IT infrastructure, HR issues, access, storage, purchase, or admin rights.\n\n\n**Categorizing Further Refined**\n\nI've re-analyzed the text, focusing on the keywords. It's clearer now that the ticket doesn't perfectly align with any of the options. \"Library\" and \"borrowed book\" are the crucial terms. Even though this seems like an IT request, it has nothing to do with IT infrastructure. It's really not IT-related at all. I will continue to work on it.\n\n\n"
