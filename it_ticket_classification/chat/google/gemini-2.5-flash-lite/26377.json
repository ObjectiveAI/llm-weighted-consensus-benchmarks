My task is to accurately map the ticket's description to the most suitable category from the provided enum, which includes options like Hardware, Access, and HR Support.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket description to assign it the most accurate category. Given the recurring themes of \"leaver,\" \"access,\" \"mailbox,\" and \"rights,\" I'm leaning towards classifying this under \"Access\" or potentially \"Administrative Rights\" due to the explicit mention of AD rights and inventory of rights.\n\n**Defining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm actively categorizing an IT ticket, focusing on keywords like \"leaver,\" \"access,\" \"mailbox,\" and \"AD rights.\" My current assessment points strongly towards the \"Access\" category, as it broadly covers the management of user permissions and system entry, though \"Administrative Rights\" is a close contender.\n\n**Assigning IT Ticket Category**\n\nI've concluded my analysis of the IT ticket. Based on the keywords like \"leaver,\" \"access,\" \"mailbox,\" and \"AD rights,\" I've determined that the \"Access\" category is the most appropriate classification for this ticket, as it broadly encompasses the management of user permissions and system entry.\n\n"
