It seems to concern an \"oracle role\" for someone on maternity leave, mentioning a \"preparer\" role and colleague assistance. My current task is to assign it to one of the following categories: [\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\"].\n\n**Classifying the Request**\n\nI'm focusing on categorizing the IT ticket. Given the mention of \"maternity leave\" and \"change position,\" \"HR Support\" feels most appropriate, even though it involves an \"oracle role\" and system access. The underlying trigger is an HR event.\n\n**Categorizing the Request**\n\nI'm refining the classification of this IT ticket. While it involves an Oracle role, the explicit mention of maternity leave and a \"change position\" strongly suggests the primary driver is an HR event, making \"HR Support\" the most fitting category for its underlying context.\n\n**Classifying the Request**\n\nI'm confirming the classification of this IT ticket. The mention of \"maternity leave\" and \"change position\" strongly indicates an HR-driven event, making \"HR Support\" the most suitable category, even though the ticket involves system roles.\n\n"
