                    "reasoning": "**Defining Ticket Type**\n\nI'm currently focused on determining the correct IT ticket category. After analyzing the text, \"for upload to for upload hi trying upload contracts there error,\" I'm leaning toward either \"Storage\" or potentially \"Access\" due to the mention of \"upload\" and implied file access. I'm carefully weighing which is more fitting.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Upload Issues**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the upload failure. While \"Storage\" remains a possibility, the consistent theme is the inability to *complete* the upload. Access might be relevant if permission is preventing upload, but the core issue is the upload process itself. The ticket text strongly suggests a process error. I am looking more closely at \"Storage\" as that relates to where the contracts are being uploaded to.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Functionality Flaws**\n\nI'm now focusing on the core issue: the upload process itself consistently failing. While \"Access\" could be a contributing factor, the consistent \"upload failed\" message points to a problem with the uploading *functionality* rather than user access restrictions. I believe the error is functional, requiring IT intervention.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories. The repeated mention of \"upload failed\" highlights a fundamental *functional* issue. While access restrictions could be a *cause*, the core problem is the *act* of uploading not working. I'm focusing on \"Access\" now, but will keep an open mind for alternative solutions as this ticket requires administrative input to resolve.\n\n\n**Defining Access Issues**\n\nI'm now focusing on the core problem: the repeated \"upload failed\" message. While the failure could stem from a system bug or a lack of administrative permissions, I'm leaning toward an \"Access\" issue, but am considering other options. The user consistently asks for administrator help, indicating a potential permission-based problem during the upload process.\n\n\n**Analyzing Permission Issues**\n\nI've been going through the ticket and I'm leaning more towards \"Access.\" The repeated failure of the upload and the direction to contact an administrator strongly suggest a permission-related problem. While it could be a system error, the administrator's role implies a problem they can fix, and access control is a likely area. The ticket's phrasing is consistent with access restrictions.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Upload Permission**\n\nI'm now focusing on the user's need to upload. The repeated \"upload failed\" message, and the need for administrator contact, strongly suggest an access-related issue. Whether it's a lack of permission or a system glitch affecting the upload functionality, the issue boils down to the user's ability to complete the intended action.\n\n**Identifying the Core Problem**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the upload failure. While \"Access\" is a possibility, the core is still the inability to upload.  The error strongly points to a *functional* problem that the administrator must address. I'm focusing on \"Access\" as a potential contributor.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Permissions**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on a consistent issue: upload functionality failure due to permissions. The repeated \"upload failed\" message, coupled with the need to contact an administrator, strongly implies an access-related problem. While a system glitch is possible, the administrator's role suggests a permissions issue the user cannot resolve independently. The focus is now on confirming that the user has appropriate permissions.\n\n\n**Focusing Ticket Resolution**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the root cause of the upload failure and its resolution.  While considering \"Access\" due to the administrator involvement, I'm focusing on why the upload itself fails repeatedly. I am analyzing the common aspects of upload failures and their resolution.\n\n\n"
