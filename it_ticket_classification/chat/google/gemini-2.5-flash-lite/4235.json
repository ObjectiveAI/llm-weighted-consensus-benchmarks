The keywords \"request access\" and \"raising level\" strongly suggest an access-related issue. My initial thought is to categorize it under \"Access\". However, I'm still considering the overall context to ensure this is the most accurate fit before finalizing the categorization.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Request Details**\n\nI've examined the ticket text, and the HR-related context doesn't change my focus. The core issue remains access and permissions; it looks like colleagues' departures require adjustments to access rights, not HR-specific support. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" considering it involves roles and potentially managing permissions. I'm focusing on \"request access,\" \"rights,\" and related action verbs within the text to refine the categorization.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Classification**\n\nI've carefully reviewed the ticket, noting the request for access and permission adjustments. The maternity leave context is a trigger for the request but not the core issue, confirming \"Access\" as the primary category. The text directly asks for access and \"proper rights,\" making it the most logical fit, overriding any HR-related implications.\n\n\n"
