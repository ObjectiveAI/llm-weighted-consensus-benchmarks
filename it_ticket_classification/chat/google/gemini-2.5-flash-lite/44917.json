My initial analysis shows recurring instances of \"reset password\" and \"password request,\" which strongly suggest a focus on access-related issues. I'm exploring the nuances of these phrases and other ticket content to refine my classification logic, prioritizing precision to minimize miscategorization. The goal is a robust solution that consistently nails the right category.\n\n\n**Determining the Ticket's Category**\n\nI've examined the ticket text and isolated key phrases pointing to a password reset need. My analysis of terms like \"reset password,\" \"password request,\" and \"update your password\" all align with access-related issues. I've concluded that \"Access\" is the most precise categorization, disregarding context phrases as extraneous to the core problem. The goal is to consistently and accurately determine the correct category.\n\n\n"
