I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" because it sounds like onboarding or employee-related access issues. The other choices seem less relevant.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating the Options**\n\nI'm reconsidering the category for this ticket. The initial instinct pointed to \"HR Support\" due to the \"new starter\" element. However, on further reflection, \"Access\" is looking more relevant. The ticket mentions access requirements for a new employee. While \"HR Support\" is linked, the core issue seems to be granting access to systems. I'm now leaning towards \"Access\" as the primary category.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've been honing in on the optimal category for this IT ticket. The \"new starter\" phrase is dominant. Considering the available options, I am still inclined towards \"HR Support\". While access might be part of the ticket, the overall context of onboarding a new employee aligns perfectly with HR processes, making this the best fit. I've also discounted the other categories.\n\n\n"
