I've noted keywords like \"disable leaver account,\" \"leaver form,\" and \"terminate.\" It seems to revolve around managing employee accounts, likely related to employee departures. My initial thought is to categorize this under Access, but I'm considering HR Support as it involves leaver procedures. I'm carefully analyzing the text to determine the best fit for these specific employee termination related tasks.\n\n\n**Revising Category Assignment**\n\nNow, I'm leaning more towards \"HR Support\" over \"Access\" as the primary category for this ticket. While disabling the account is an access-related task, the core request stems from an employee departure, making it an HR-driven event. The keywords \"leaver form\" and \"terminate his contract\" solidify this. This aligns better with IT's role in supporting HR's leaver procedures, rather than being solely about access rights.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Categorization**\n\nMy decision is firm: this ticket belongs in \"HR Support.\" The primary focus is clearly the employee's departure and subsequent account management, aligning perfectly with HR's processes. While access management is involved, it's a supporting action triggered by an HR event. I've re-evaluated \"Access,\" but \"HR Support\" captures the full context more accurately, encompassing both the HR-driven request and IT's specific actions.\n\n\n"
