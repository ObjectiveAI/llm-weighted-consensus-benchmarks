After careful consideration, I've analyzed the text, paying close attention to keywords and phrases. The primary focus seems to be on a request for audio equipment, leading me to believe it falls under the \"Hardware\" category. I am fairly confident in this categorization and will proceed accordingly.\n\n\n**Deciding the Best Fit**\n\nMy current assessment is leaning toward \"Hardware.\" The ticket's text clearly requests a \"sound system,\" which is indeed a hardware item. I carefully considered other categories like \"Purchase\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" but \"Hardware\" provides the most direct and specific match. I'm focusing on aligning the request's core need (sound equipment) with the category.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Selection**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text (\"sound system needed...\") and its implied meaning. While \"Purchase\" was initially considered, the lack of explicit purchasing terms (budget, ordering) makes \"Hardware\" a better fit. The core need is for the physical equipment itself, even if for a specific event. I'm now confident in finalizing the categorization as \"Hardware.\"\n\n\n"
