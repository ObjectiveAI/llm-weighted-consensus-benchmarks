I'm focusing on \"sub,\" \"tasks,\" and any keywords related to the provided categories. I'm leaning toward eliminating \"Internal Project\" and \"HR Support\" for now. The core issue of categorization is still open for consideration.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket Category**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket. The \"employees filling timecards\" phrase strongly points towards HR Support. \"Process owners\" and \"sub tasks\" further reinforce a workflow related to employee tasks, an area handled by HR. While \"sub code\" suggests an IT aspect, the timecard issue clearly leans toward HR support. I'm excluding categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" as they aren't relevant. I'm focusing on validating my HR Support choice.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've carefully considered the given text and various categories.  The mention of \"employees filling timecards\" is the decisive factor.  While \"sub code\" suggests an IT element, the core issue revolves around an HR-related process.  I'm confident in categorizing this ticket under \"HR Support.\"  My reasoning is now complete.\n\n\n"
