Based on the description \"for meeting join and exit notifications meeting,\" I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as it doesn't fit neatly into Hardware, HR, Access, Storage, Purchase, or Internal Project categories, nor does it explicitly imply a need for Administrative rights.\n\n**Classifying Meeting Feature**\n\nI'm refining the classification of the IT ticket. Given the focus on a specific \"meeting join and exit notification feature\" and the mention of \"teams stand devices,\" I'm now considering \"Miscellaneous\" as the most appropriate category, as it best encompasses feature-related requests that don't fit standard technical silos.\n\n**Investigating Meeting Notifications**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the IT ticket details. The request focuses on investigating and activating a \"meeting join and exit notification feature\" for Teams devices, specifically mentioning issues with the text-to-speech engine. This leads me to believe \"Miscellaneous\" is the most fitting category.\n\n**Evaluating Meeting Features**\n\nI'm currently assessing the IT ticket description. The focus on activating a \"meeting join and exit notification feature\" with an issue related to the \"text-to-speech engine\" on Teams devices leads me to classify this under \"Miscellaneous\" as it best represents a specific functionality request that doesn't align with other defined categories.\n\n**Refining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm continuing to refine the categorization of this IT ticket. My current thinking is that \"Miscellaneous\" remains the most suitable classification. The core of the request centers on investigating and activating a specific notification feature within Teams, along with troubleshooting its text-to-speech component, which doesn't align with other defined categories like Hardware, HR, Access, Storage, Purchase, or Internal Project.\n\n**Refining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm continuing to refine the categorization of this IT ticket.
