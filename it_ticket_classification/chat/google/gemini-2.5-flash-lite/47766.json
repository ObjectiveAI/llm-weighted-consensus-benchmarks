I'm leaning toward an HR Support categorization, but I'll need to double-check my findings against the specific schema.\n\n\n**Identifying Problem Category**\n\nI've determined the initial category for this ticket is \"HR Support\". The recurring terms, such as \"annual leave\" and \"submit,\" strongly point toward this domain. I'm confident in the assignment, and will now double-check the ticket text against the schema, particularly focusing on how \"leaver process\" fits.\n\n\n"
