The initial content is somewhat vague, referencing an \"increase in maximum storage limit.\" After carefully evaluating this ticket, I'm leaning toward the \"Storage\" category as the most appropriate classification.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Keywords**\n\nI've closely examined the ticket's text, identifying key phrases such as \"increase storage limit\" and \"outlook account.\" These phrases strongly suggest the \"Storage\" category is the best fit. I've ruled out other categories like \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" because they don't align with the content. The request is specifically about storage capacity, making \"Storage\" the clear choice.\n\n\n"
