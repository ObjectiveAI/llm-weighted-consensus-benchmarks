This suggests a potential client-side or application-specific issue rather than a broader system failure. My next step is to cross-reference this with the provided schema to determine the most fitting categorization.\n\n**Exploring Resume Upload Errors**\n\nI'm examining the resume upload issue, noting the difference between normal and incognito browser behavior. This points to a client-side or application-specific problem. I'm now reviewing the schema to find the best fit, leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as other categories don't quite align with a specific functional bug.\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI'm continuing to analyze the resume upload error, noting how incognito browsing differentiates the behavior. This strongly suggests a client-side or application-level issue. I've reviewed the schema options again and am confirming \"Miscellaneous\" as the most suitable fit given the absence of a more specific technical or functional category.\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the resume upload error, noting how incognito browsing reveals a client-side or application-specific behavior. Given the provided schema, \"Miscellaneous\" remains the most appropriate classification as no other category accurately captures this type of functional software glitch.\n\n**Finalizing Resume Upload Categorization**\n\nI've completed my analysis of the resume upload error, and after carefully considering all schema options, I'm confirming \"Miscellaneous\" as the most fitting category. The distinct behavior across normal and incognito browser windows strongly indicates a client-side or application-level glitch, which doesn't align with any other specific technical or functional classifications provided.\n\n**Selecting Final Category**\n\nI've completed my thorough analysis of the resume upload error. Considering the distinct behavior observed between normal and incognito browser windows, I am confident this indicates a client-side or application-level glitch. Reviewing the available schema, \"Miscellaneous\" remains the most appropriate classification as no other category accurately encompasses this type of functional software issue.\n\n"
