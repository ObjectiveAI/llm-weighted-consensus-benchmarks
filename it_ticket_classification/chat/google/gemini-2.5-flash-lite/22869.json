Friday PM and PO are not relevant and can be ignored. I will choose \"Purchase\" as the category.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Data**\n\nI've been drilling down into the text, focusing on the key phrases. \"Purchased equipment,\" \"shipment received,\" and the mention of specific hardware like \"switch\" and \"firepower\" keep pointing towards a purchase-related issue. The presence of a PO number further cements this connection, so I'm leaning toward \"Purchase\" as the category.\n\n\n**Reaching a Conclusion**\n\nI've considered all the evidence. The PO number and phrases like \"purchased equipment\" and \"shipment received\" sealed the deal. I'm now certain that \"Purchase\" is the ideal category for this ticket, and I am ready to tag it as such.\n\n\n"
