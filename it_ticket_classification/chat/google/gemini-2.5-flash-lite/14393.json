My initial assessment leans towards \"Access\" due to the mention of \"links\" and needing to \"work\" them. However, I am still evaluating if it could fall under another category. The context is rather limited.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted from \"Access\" to a potential blend of \"Purchase\" and \"Access\". The recurring \"requisitions\" and \"purchase requisitions\" strongly point towards the purchase module. However, the recurring theme of \"links\" and access issues also remain significant. I am considering the possibility of a broken link within the purchase requisition area, potentially affecting user authorization. This appears to be a crucial aspect to investigate for more conclusive results.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Focus**\n\nI've honed in on the access issue within the purchase requisition context. The recurring \"authorization\" and \"forbidden\" errors clinch the category as primarily \"Access.\" While \"Purchase\" is involved, the core problem is a user's inability to access the relevant links or modules. The admin contact further confirms a need for access resolution.\n\n\n**Reiterating the Core Issue**\n\nI'm solidifying my assessment as \"Access.\" The ticket's core revolves around authorization problems preventing users from using the links tied to purchase requisitions. Repeated references to \"forbidden\" errors and the administrator's involvement underscore this core access constraint.\n\n\n"
