The initial focus was broad, but I'm now leveraging keywords like \"leaver form\" and \"add location\" from the ticket text. This should guide me to the correct categories, specifically \"HR Support\" or \"Access\". I'll consider how these keywords relate to the categories provided, aiming for the most accurate match.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and available categories. Keywords like \"leaver form\" and \"update location\" are key indicators. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" because the ticket involves an HR-related form and location data. I'm evaluating the fit of other categories, ruling out options like \"Hardware\" and \"Storage,\" which are clearly irrelevant. My focus is on ensuring the best match. I am considering the implications of \"add location\" not being explicitly about access, but rather an update to the system used for employee offboarding, thus leading me to \"HR Support\".\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Alignment**\n\nI'm now revisiting the categorization, focusing on the keywords from the ticket text. While I initially considered \"Access\" due to the \"add location\" aspect, the core issue is the \"leaver form\" and its submission. This suggests a strong tie to HR processes and workflows. Therefore, after careful review, \"HR Support\" appears the more accurate and appropriate category for this particular issue. The update location is needed to be added into the form.\n\n\n"
