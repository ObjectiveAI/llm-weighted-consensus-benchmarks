I am confident that the provided text falls neatly into the \"Storage\" category. This is the obvious and appropriate classification.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Keywords**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket's language, paying close attention to keywords and phrases. I'm zeroing in on \"db backups,\" \"database backup,\" and \"backups ready.\" These indicators strongly point towards storage-related concerns.  The repeated emphasis on data backups for deployment solidifies my conviction that \"Storage\" is the most accurate classification.\n\n\n**Determining Best Fit**\n\nMy analysis is proceeding well. I'm focusing intently on the core of the request. The consistent mentions of \"db backups,\" \"database backup,\" and the phrase \"backups ready\" have solidified my belief in the \"Storage\" category. The text consistently refers to database backups and their role in deployment. After a thorough review, it's clear \"Storage\" aligns best with the essence of the IT ticket.\n\n\n"
