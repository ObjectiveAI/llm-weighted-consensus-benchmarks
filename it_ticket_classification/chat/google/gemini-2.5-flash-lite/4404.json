I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category because it involves processes and contractual obligations related to employee time tracking. However, I'm considering if there might be overlap with \"Access\" if the missing timecards are due to some system access problem. I will check for evidence of access issues.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket content again and am firming up my conclusion. The references to \"missing timecards,\" the \"timecard process,\" and related employee data strongly suggest an HR-related issue. \"HR Support\" clearly aligns with these aspects, even if there may be some indirect connection to access rights later.\n\n\n"
