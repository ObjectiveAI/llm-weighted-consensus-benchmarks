My initial approach involves identifying key phrases and words that will allow me to match the ticket to one of the defined categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and the keywords \"interns\" and \"ad accounts\" stand out. The core task seems to be creating access for new interns. \"Access\" is the most appropriate category, given the request is for account creation, suggesting access provisioning. While HR might be tangentially involved, the focus is on the technical aspect of granting access. I am now confidently classifying the ticket under \"Access.\"\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Focus**\n\nI've examined the ticket text further and the keywords \"ad accounts\" and \"interns\" are the most prominent. The user is requesting the creation of accounts for interns. This clearly falls under \"Access\", indicating a need for user provisioning and account setup, not HR-related processes. \"Ad accounts\" is a strong indicator of access rights. Therefore, I'm confirming the classification as \"Access.\"\n\n\n"
