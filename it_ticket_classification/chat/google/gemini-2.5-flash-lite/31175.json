Currently, I'm focusing on \"not working meeting room\" to understand how to apply the predefined categories: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights\". My initial thought is to categorize this under \"Hardware\", since the issue seems to be related to a physical component.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Network Issue**\n\nI've dived deeper into the ticket's components. The \"meeting room\" theme runs through it all, focusing on the phone, extensions, ports, and switch. My analysis of the provided categories solidifies \"Hardware\" as the best fit, as the issue lies with physical infrastructure and device connectivity, and nothing else. I'm ready to mark this ticket as \"Hardware\" and move on.\n\n\n**Confirming Hardware Focus**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's details again. Analyzing the symptoms\u2014the non-functional phone, the problematic ports, and the switch\u2014confirms my initial intuition. The issue centers on tangible network components, making \"Hardware\" the ideal category for resolution. The issue is with a tangible, physical component.\n\n\n"
