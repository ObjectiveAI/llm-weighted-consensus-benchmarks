My current task is to refine the logic for assigning \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\"\n\n**Parsing Ticket Keywords**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the input text to identify keywords relevant to IT ticket categorization. My focus is on extracting terms that directly map to the defined categories within the JSON schema, such as \"issue,\" \"affects version,\" and other potential system field names.\n\n**Mapping Ticket Fields**\n\nI'm now focusing on the specific text provided. It seems to be a collection of field names from an IT ticketing system, mixed with some confidentiality disclaimers. There's no clear description of an actual problem to categorize.\n\n**Processing Ticket Fields**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the provided text, which appears to be a collection of field names and a confidentiality notice rather than a clear problem description. My focus is on how to map this meta-information to the available ticket categories.\n\n**Assigning Category Based on Text**\n\nI've analyzed the provided text, which consists primarily of IT system field names and a confidentiality disclaimer. As there's no specific problem described, I'm assigning it to the \"Miscellaneous\" category.\n\n"
