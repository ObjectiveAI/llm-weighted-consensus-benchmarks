The text indicates a problem with duplicate approval requests, possibly stemming from an HR process involving line manager appointments. I am considering \"HR Support\" as the most relevant category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Issue**\n\nThe system sending duplicate approval requests due to an HR-related event has become clearer. While the root cause stems from an HR process, the actual problem is a systemic error in the approval workflow, likely within Oracle.  I'm now leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the most accurate category, given that the direct issue isn't strictly HR support.\n\n\n**Defining the Problem Domain**\n\nI'm now understanding the root issue as a systemic flaw within Oracle's approval process, triggered by an HR event. Though the text references HR, the core problem is a technical system error causing duplicate notifications. I'm wavering between \"HR Support\" and \"Miscellaneous\", but leaning towards the latter as the problem's domain is the system, not direct HR assistance. I'm focusing on the nature of the *duplicate approval requests* as the central aspect.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI'm now very certain that \"HR Support\" is the correct category for this ticket. After deeper analysis, the core problem is an issue in the approval workflow which is directly tied to an HR event. The duplicate requests stem from the system's reaction to an HR action (the line manager's replacement). While Oracle might be the system sending the duplicates, the *cause* lies in how this HR process is mapped in the system. Thus, supporting the proper operation of the HR process is the primary concern here.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI've finally reached my firm decision: \"HR Support\" is the correct categorization. After revisiting the nature of the duplicate approval requests, and the direct link to the line manager replacement, it's clear this ticket pertains to the operational integrity of the HR workflow within the Oracle system. While Oracle's workflow is the mechanism, the root cause is intrinsically linked to an HR event.\n\n\n"
