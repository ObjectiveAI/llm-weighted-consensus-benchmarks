Keywords like \"apple pro retina intel plus graphics kb monitor\" point strongly towards a hardware issue, specifically related to a computer. I'm focusing on the technical vocabulary to make the most accurate categorization.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and am leaning toward classifying this ticket as related to \"Hardware\". The presence of terms like \"apple pro retina intel plus graphics kb monitor\" and \"hubs\" strongly suggests a hardware concern. I am still considering the relevance of \"order number required\" to see if a \"Purchase\" element is also present.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've determined that \"Hardware\" is the most fitting categorization for this IT ticket. After carefully assessing the provided text, the descriptions of equipment such as the Apple Pro Retina monitor and hubs clearly point to a hardware-related issue. The presence of \"order number required\" adds an element of Purchase, however, the primary focus is on the hardware itself, leading me to prioritize Hardware over Purchase. This feels like the most accurate and useful classification of the issue.\n\n\n"
