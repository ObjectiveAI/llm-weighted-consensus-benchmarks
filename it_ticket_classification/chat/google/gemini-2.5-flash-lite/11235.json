I'm actively comparing these phrases against the provided categories, which include \"Access,\" \"Administrative rights,\" and others, to determine the most fitting classification. I am trying to determine the most relevant category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and I think I've narrowed it down.  The focus is clearly on \"add people to groups\" and managing shared mailbox memberships. I've re-examined the options, and \"Access\" seems to be the best fit, as the core task is about granting or modifying user access to resources. \"Administrative rights\" felt close, but this specific task seems more like standard user access management. I'm confident in \"Access\" being the best choice now.\n\n\n**Revisiting the Choice**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the initial \"Access\" selection after a deeper look. While the focus on \"add people to groups\" and managing shared mailboxes still strongly suggests access management, I've considered that the ticket's scope might be broader. While \"Access\" is good, I am reconsidering if \"Administrative rights\" could also be appropriate.  I'm trying to decide if the group management aspects imply broader administrative control within the system.  I'm still leaning towards \"Access\", but the nuance requires further examination.\n\n\n"
