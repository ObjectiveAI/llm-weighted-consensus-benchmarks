The provided text, with its mention of a \"new starter\" and attachment, is leading me toward either \"HR Support\" or \"Access\". I'm digging deeper to isolate the primary request. It feels like this could be about granting an employee access, which is the defining factor here.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Involvement**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. The \"new starter\" and \"joiner\" cues are definitely steering me towards \"HR Support\". While access might be part of it, I believe it's a supporting element. The primary function appears to be related to the new employee's setup, which aligns most closely with HR's onboarding processes.\n\n\n**Analyzing Onboarding Needs**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the \"new starter\" ticket, emphasizing the \"joiner\" aspect. Initial categorizations are showing that I need to be certain about the new joiner's IT needs, such as setting up access. My analysis leans strongly toward \"HR Support\" because the IT tasks are onboarding-related and support the HR onboarding process, but setting up access may be a key piece.\n\n\n"
