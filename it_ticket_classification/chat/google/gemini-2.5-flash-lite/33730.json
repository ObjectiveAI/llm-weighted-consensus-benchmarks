While \"HR Support\" seems a potential fit due to the employee development aspect, I'm considering if the underlying need for this training might point towards \"Access\" or even \"Miscellaneous\" if a more precise match isn't evident.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm continuing to refine the categorization of the ticket. While \"HR Support\" initially seemed strong due to the training aspect, I'm now considering \"Access\" more closely, weighing whether the training is a prerequisite for system access or merely for effective usage after access is granted.\n\n"
