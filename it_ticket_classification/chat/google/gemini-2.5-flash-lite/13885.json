My goal is to determine the best fit from the categories provided: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The text seems to reference a monitor, and it's being used while working. \"More monitor\" is also mentioned, so I am leaning toward \"Hardware.\"\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text, searching for clues to its underlying problem. The frequent mention of \"monitor\" and \"additional monitor\" strongly points toward a hardware issue or request. I've ruled out categories like HR Support, Access, and Storage, as they lack any supporting evidence within the text. My focus is narrowing in on the hardware category as the most probable fit.\n\n\n**Reiterating Hardware Emphasis**\n\nI'm now completely fixated on the \"Hardware\" category. The repeated references to \"monitor\" and \"additional monitor\" within the ticket's text continue to scream hardware-related need. I've re-examined the other categories, but they simply don't align with the content. The core request is clearly about acquiring or addressing issues with physical IT components, so I'm firm in my \"Hardware\" classification.\n\n\n"
