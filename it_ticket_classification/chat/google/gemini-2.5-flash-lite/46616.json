I'm focusing on key phrase extraction and theme identification to refine my category assignments. My goal is to improve accuracy in matching tickets to categories like \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", or other types. I'm actively working to make this process more robust and more precise.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket: Probation**\n\nI've just analyzed the ticket content and determined the core theme is \"probation notifications and status\". This confirms the initial impression of needing to categorize the issue within \"HR Support.\" I've ruled out \"Hardware\" and \"Access\" as they aren't the primary focus. The keywords \"probation,\" \"period,\" and \"notification\" were crucial in this determination.\n\n\n**Defining HR Support Tickets**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content, focusing on keywords such as \"probation,\" \"period,\" and \"notification.\" The central theme revolves around probation status and communication, definitively placing it within \"HR Support.\" While \"mailbox\" appears, the core concern lies elsewhere, and not in other options like  \"Hardware\" or \"Access\". My analysis strongly points to a \"HR Support\" categorization, considering it is the main priority described in the ticket.\n\n\n"
