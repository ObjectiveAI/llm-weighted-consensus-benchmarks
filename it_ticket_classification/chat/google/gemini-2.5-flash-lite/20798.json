Initial analysis suggests the text hints at some sort of user creation/access request. I'm weighing whether it fits best under \"Access\" or potentially \"HR Support\" due to the mention of interviewers. Further refinement is needed to pinpoint the most appropriate category.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and categories, leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. While elements touch on creating/adding users (possibly access-related), the focus seems to be on setting up a process or project specifically related to interviewing. This is not HR support or simple access management, but more of a project setup task. The user is requesting that these users be added and integrated into the project. This would involve \"Access\" to a certain set of systems, and the creation of user profiles.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Choice**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text, focusing on the \"integration practice\" context. While access and user creation are present, the overall goal seems to be project-oriented: setting up the \"interviewers,\" the owner, and persons. This points more decisively toward \"Internal Project.\" This isn't just granting access, it's about configuring a process. The actions \"create,\" \"add,\" and the term \"integration practice\" strongly suggest this.\n\n\n"
