My initial impression leans towards a hardware-related issue, but I'm being thorough.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket content, pinpointing \"cursor issues\" and the user disabling their laptop as crucial clues. My assessment reinforces the hardware category as the most accurate fit.  I've systematically ruled out other options such as HR Support, Access, and Miscellaneous. I am confident in my categorization, moving onto the next step of the process.\n\n\n"
