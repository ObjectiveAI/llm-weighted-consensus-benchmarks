After careful consideration of the text \"bucharest not working meeting room\" and \"meeting room building,\" I've narrowed it down.  I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" but need to ensure my reasoning is sound before making the final call. The reference to the \"building\" is making me think a building resource/hardware rather than a software access issue.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've refined my thinking and I'm quite certain this ticket warrants a \"Hardware\" classification. The focus is indisputably on the malfunctioning meeting room's communication capabilities, and \"Hardware\" aligns most precisely with that. The call functionality specifically implies an equipment issue rather than a broad, ill-defined problem. I'm ready to mark the ticket as \"Hardware\".\n\n\n"
