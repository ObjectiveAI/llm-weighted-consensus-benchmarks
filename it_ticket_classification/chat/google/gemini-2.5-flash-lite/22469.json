Based on the provided text, \"people management change for issue with flow and approval Thursday,\" I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most suitable classification, as it seems to be related to internal processes and approvals that typically fall under HR. I am refining my analysis, however, since the ticket does not explicitly mention HR.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've been evaluating the optimal category. While \"Internal Project\" is a possible fit, the phrase \"people management change\" strongly implies an HR-related system, making \"HR Support\" a more precise classification. The \"flow and approval\" issue further reinforces this, as HR systems often manage workflows. I'm focusing on the core problem \u2013 a process breakdown within a likely HR domain \u2013 to ensure the most effective routing for resolution.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Relevance**\n\nI'm now fully convinced that \"HR Support\" is the correct category for this ticket. The phrases \"people management\" and \"flow and approval\" strongly point toward an HR-related system, likely one used for internal processes like employee management or approvals. This decision is reinforced by the general IT nature of the ticket. While other categories might be vaguely applicable, the specifics of the text make \"HR Support\" the most precise and beneficial route for resolution.\n\n\n"
