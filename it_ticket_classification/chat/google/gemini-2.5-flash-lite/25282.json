I need to determine the precise category within IT. So far, no obvious category has jumped out. I'm focusing on \"Technical Glitch\" and evaluating if any category fits best.\n\n\n**Defining the Problem's Root**\n\nI'm now focusing on \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category. The text highlights \"faulty ports\" and a \"broken switch,\" which are clear hardware components. The description also mentions moving the ports, clearly pointing to a hardware repair. Other options like \"access\" and \"HR Support\" don't seem applicable here. It is clearly a \"Hardware\" issue.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the text. The phrase \"faulty ports\" and \"broken switch\" clearly define a hardware problem, not HR support or access-related. While the automated system is acting up, the root cause is the hardware failure, which falls within the \"Hardware\" category. It's the most appropriate fit.\n\n\n"
