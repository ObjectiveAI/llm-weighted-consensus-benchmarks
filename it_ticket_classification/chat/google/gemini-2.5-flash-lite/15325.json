The core of this issue revolves around access management, specifically concerning visitor cards and temporary assignments. It aligns perfectly with the \"Access\" category because it involves granting, activating, and managing permissions related to these cards. Other categories like \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" aren't relevant, while \"Miscellaneous\" is too broad. \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights\" are also unsuitable since they don't capture the essence of the access-related request.\n\n\n"
