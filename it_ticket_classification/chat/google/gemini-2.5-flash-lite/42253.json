I'll need to carefully distinguish between access-related issues and other possible causes before making a final decision.\n\n\n**Assessing Access Points**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the correct IT ticket category. I've re-read the ticket text regarding spreadsheet errors and access problems. My analysis leans toward \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" as the likely buckets. I'll need to carefully distinguish between access-related issues and other possible causes before making a final decision.\n\nI'm now carefully weighing \"Access\" against \"Administrative rights.\" The function not working could signal a permission problem. The phrase \"trying to access\" is key. Also, \"seem be working\" implies that the function itself might be fine. Considering these points, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" as the primary category, with \"Administrative rights\" a close secondary consideration.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Details**\n\nI've identified the root of the problem: access is blocked on an expense spreadsheet function. My current approach favors \"Access\" over \"Administrative rights,\" as the description centers on usage rather than permission problems. However, the exact category might be a matter of interpretation, which I'm taking into consideration as I finalize my assessment of the ticket. I can still tweak my classification based on additional clarifying information.\n\n\n"
