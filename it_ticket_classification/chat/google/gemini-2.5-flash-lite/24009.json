While other terms are present, the emphasis seems to be around a new server instance. I'm leaning toward either \"Storage\" or \"Purchase\" as the best fit, but need to consider the broader context.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. \"Purchase\" seems most accurate because the core request is a \"cost estimation\" for acquiring a server, strongly implying procurement. The references to \"server,\" \"cpu cores,\" and \"infrastructure\" are critical and confirm the \"Hardware\" aspect, strengthening the selection. After careful consideration, I've ruled out HR, Access, and Administrative Rights. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too generic, and while \"Storage\" is tangential, it's not the main focus.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Request**\n\nI've carefully re-examined the ticket details, keeping the available categories in mind. While \"Hardware\" is relevant due to the server mention, \"Purchase\" aligns better with the core request. The repetition of \"cost estimation\" and the inclusion of \"initial setup costs\" strongly suggest a procurement focus. This isn't just about hardware, but about getting approval or budget for it.\n\n\n"
