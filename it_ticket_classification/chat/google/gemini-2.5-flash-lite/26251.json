After analyzing the text, \"remove people from development leadership,\" I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or potentially \"HR Support,\" as it seems like a personnel management request. I'm now cross-referencing this with the available categories to make a final decision, keeping in mind the other bits of text provided, such as \"interim head.\"\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've been honing in on the optimal IT ticket category. The text, \"remove people from development leadership,\" clearly points towards \"Access\" as the prime choice. While \"Administrative rights\" is a viable option, \"Access\" feels more encompassing. The additional context seems to be standard communication, not changing my analysis.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Focus**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Access\" as the correct category for this ticket. After deeper reflection, the phrase \"development leadership\" strongly implies access controls. The additional context feels like procedural communication and doesn't warrant changing my initial analysis. I'm ready to mark the ticket with this selection.\n\n\n"
