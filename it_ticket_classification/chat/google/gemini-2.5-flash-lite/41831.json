My challenge is to match ticket descriptions, like the one about an \"expense report at approval flow,\" to predefined categories such as \"HR Support\" or \"Internal Project.\" I'm carefully analyzing keywords and context to ensure the best fit. I'm considering that the example indicates a potential HR or internal project issue, or perhaps even both, as I work to find the best match to categorize the ticket.\n\n\n**Identifying Ticket Focus**\n\nI've determined the key focus of this ticket to be \"HR Support,\" primarily due to the repeated mentions of \"expense report\" and \"approval\" within the ticket descriptions. Phrases like \"expense report at approval flow\" and \"please approve\" solidified my decision. I am confident that \"HR Support\" accurately reflects the nature of the issue.\n\n\n"
