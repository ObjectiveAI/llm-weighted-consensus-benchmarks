This points to a problem with the storage and recovery system, so I'm leaning toward **Storage** as the most accurate category. It's a key issue related to data access.\n\n\n**Confirming Storage Category**\n\nI've refined my thinking on the ticket category.  The \"critical alert\" alone wasn't conclusive, but \"recovery points\" and \"protection agent\" are definitive. They both strongly point toward backup and storage systems.  It's clear that the communication breakdown impacts the ability to back up and recover data, further solidifying \"Storage\" as the correct classification.\n\n\n"
