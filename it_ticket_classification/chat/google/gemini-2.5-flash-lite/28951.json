The mention of \"ad groups,\" \"members,\" and \"owners\" strongly suggests an \"Access\" classification, as it directly pertains to managing group affiliations and permissions within the IT environment.\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the ticket's keywords, such as \"ad groups,\" \"members,\" and \"owners,\" and concluded that \"Access\" is the most appropriate classification.
