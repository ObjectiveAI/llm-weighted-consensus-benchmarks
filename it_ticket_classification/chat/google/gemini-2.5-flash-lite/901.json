While it involves managing calendar events, the specific inability to cancel meetings organized by someone else, possibly due to their maternity leave, points towards an access or administrative rights issue rather than a general miscellaneous task.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm continuing to refine the categorization of this IT ticket. Given the user's inability to cancel meetings organized by another, especially in the context of that organizer's leave, I'm leaning towards \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" as the most fitting categories. The core issue appears to be permission-based, rather than a general request.\n\n**Seeking Administrative Rights**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the ticket content. The core issue appears to be a permissions-based problem, where the user needs the ability to manage calendar events they didn't originally organize. This leads me to believe \"Administrative rights\" is the most accurate classification.\n\n"
