Based on the keywords, \"access\" seems to be the most relevant category. Therefore, I will categorize the ticket as \"Access.\"\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket.  I've sifted through the description, focusing on key terms like \"access change.\" While \"cleaning staff\" suggests HR could be involved, the core action is the alteration of access permissions. \"Access\" feels like the most accurate and efficient categorization, with \"HR Support\" a potential secondary tag. Other categories like \"Hardware\" or \"Storage\" are clearly irrelevant.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've carefully re-examined the ticket, focusing on the keywords and the potential categories. While \"cleaning staff\" initially suggested HR involvement, I've concluded that \"access change\" is the paramount action. Thus, I've landed on the \"Access\" category as the most accurate fit, as it directly addresses the requested action. After careful consideration, I believe this is the most effective and precise categorization for this ticket.\n\n\n"
