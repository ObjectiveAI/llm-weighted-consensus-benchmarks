The phrase \"people manager change\" seems to point towards a category related to HR or administrative adjustments, so I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" or perhaps \"Access\" if it involves system changes for managers.\n\n**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the IT ticket, and the key phrase \"people manager change\" strongly indicates an HR-related issue. My current thought process is to categorize this under \"HR Support\" due to the implications for employee records and system access typically managed by HR functions.\n\n**Identifying HR Support Needs**\n\nI'm confirming the IT ticket's focus. The recurring mention of \"people manager change\" strongly points towards the \"HR Support\" category, as it directly relates to employee management and administrative updates handled by HR.\n\n"
