Analyzing the ticket text, I'm leaning toward \"Purchase\" due to the mention of an \"approved amount\" and \"bigger than limit.\" This seems to indicate a potential issue with a purchase approval process. I will continue to review other keywords and phrases to ensure the most accurate categorization.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Classification**\n\nI've refined my approach to categorize the IT ticket. Initial analysis identified \"Purchase\" as a strong contender. Now, by focusing on keywords like \"approval amount\" and \"limit,\" my certainty in the \"Purchase\" category is solidified. I'm confident that this ticket pertains to a financial transaction needing authorization. This refined focus allows for a more effective categorization process.\n\n\n**Solidifying Ticket Diagnosis**\n\nI'm now fully confident in classifying this ticket as a \"Purchase\" issue. My reasoning is reinforced by the presence of critical terms like \"approved amount,\" \"bigger than limit,\" and the need for an \"approval check.\" These phrases consistently point to a financial transaction needing authorization. My ongoing assessment consistently points toward this specific category.\n\n\n"
