I'm exploring the nuances of these keywords to ensure accurate classification.\n\n\n**Classifying Ticket Details**\n\nI've determined that the \"node upgrade\" and associated contract mentions align most closely with an \"Internal Project\" category.  The ticket involves ongoing work and approvals within the business, strongly suggesting a project-related context. While \"node upgrade\" hints at a hardware component, the overall focus isn't a hardware issue itself.  I'm now confidently assigning this ticket as an \"Internal Project.\"\n\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket details and the available categories. While \"node upgrade\" initially suggested \"Hardware,\" the project context, with phrases like \"sustaining work,\" \"converted contract,\" and \"approvals,\" points definitively towards an \"Internal Project.\" I'm confident in classifying it this way.\n\n\n"
