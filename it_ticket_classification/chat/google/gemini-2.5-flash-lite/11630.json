                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm currently focused on categorizing this IT ticket. After analyzing the keywords, \"new starter,\" I believe it leans toward \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" I will need further information to differentiate the category. I'm carefully reviewing the ticket text to refine my analysis, searching for clues about specific support needed.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket Category**\n\nI'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" for this ticket based on \"new starter\" and \"contractor starter form.\" I've ruled out \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The onboarding context suggests HR is involved. I will re-examine the ticket text to determine if it necessitates IT configuring system access and user permissions.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Focus**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and am strongly considering \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" as the primary categories. The keywords, including \"contractor starter form,\" push me toward these choices because they involve onboarding. I am still evaluating the details of the ticket to pinpoint the best option. I believe it is about configuring access or providing initial support for this new contractor.\n\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm now focusing on a more granular approach. Given the \"new starter\" and \"contractor starter form,\" I'm analyzing whether \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" best reflects the *action* required. The ticket text suggests IT actions like account setup are needed, supporting \"Access.\" However, \"HR Support\" could be relevant if IT needs further data for access. I'm carefully reviewing the context to distinguish where the action is.\n\n\n**Revising Ticket Classification**\n\nAfter deeper analysis, I'm now leaning heavily toward \"Access,\" but I'm keeping \"HR Support\" as a strong secondary option. The key is to determine if the ticket's focus is on IT providing *specific access*, such as email and network logins, or if it represents a more general request arising from the onboarding process. The \"contractor starter form\" is a clue pointing toward HR involvement. I am re-evaluating the implied action within the ticket.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Action**\n\nI'm now determining whether the ticket is *about* helping HR or *for* providing a new starter with IT resources. While the keywords highlight the involvement of \"new starter\" and the \"contractor starter form,\" I'm analyzing whether IT is providing a service *for* HR's process, *or* if IT is acting on behalf of the new contractor. Given the information and the available categories, \"HR Support\" seems most relevant because IT usually serves to support HR's onboarding workflow.\n\n**Determining the Core Action**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and am now leaning strongly toward \"Access\" because setting up access is fundamental for new contractors. The ticket seems like an automated notification for an IT action: creating accounts, granting permissions. I am focusing on what IT must do to enable the new contractor.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket Action**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the core IT action this ticket represents. Given the onboarding context and \"contractor starter form,\" I'm focused on provisioning the correct system access. While \"HR Support\" could be a factor in an *auxiliary* role, I'm analyzing whether this request demands direct IT action: setting up accounts, permissions, and network access for the new contractor.\n\n\n"
