The words \"delete\" and \"cards\" are prominent, but I need to determine the context. Is it about a hardware issue, HR-related, access, storage, purchase, a project, or administrative rights? I'm leaning toward HR Support, but need to be sure.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and key phrases like \"delete oracle time cards\" and \"enter hours\" to determine the most fitting category. While the words relate to user data and system functionality, the core request seems less about gaining access and more about managing data within a HR-related context. Thus, \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate category, based on the nature of the request.\n\n\n**Clarifying HR Context**\n\nI'm now certain this ticket falls under HR Support. The phrases \"delete oracle time cards\" and \"enter hours\" decisively point to tasks within an HR system. Although \"access\" is a consideration, the core issue is data management, not permission changes. The context is unequivocally HR-centric.\n\n\n"
