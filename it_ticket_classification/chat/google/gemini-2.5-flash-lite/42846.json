The \"someone trying modify while logged\" error points strongly towards an \"Access\" issue, potentially with permissions or simultaneous editing conflicts. I'm carefully reviewing the provided categories, but \"Access\" appears to be the most relevant based on the information available.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm digging deeper into the specific error message to pinpoint the precise category. While \"Access\" still seems most likely, I'm considering \"Administrative rights\" as a possibility, as permissions issues could be at play. The \"someone trying modify while logged\" text hints at access control challenges with the shared file, but \"Administrative rights\" is relevant as it may affect who can access shared files. I'll thoroughly examine the permissions angle to make a definite decision.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Details Further**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the error message within the ticket. The \"someone trying modify while logged\" description reinforces the strong likelihood of an \"Access\" issue. I've re-reviewed the available categories, and the evidence continues to point toward access control, shared document editing conflicts, or permission discrepancies as the root cause.\n\n\n"
