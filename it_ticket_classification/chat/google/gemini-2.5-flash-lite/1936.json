My focus is on identifying keywords and phrases that align with the available options: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" This will ensure an accurate and efficient classification.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Categories**\n\nI'm refining the classification of the IT ticket. The text strongly suggests it relates to digital certificates and encrypted mail, pointing towards access or administrative rights rather than hardware or HR. I'm leaning towards \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" as the most fitting labels.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm confirming the classification of the IT ticket. Based on the terms \"encrypted mime,\" \"digital certificate issued,\" and \"shared mailbox,\" I'm definitively assigning it to \"Administrative rights.\" This aligns with the need for managing security configurations and user credentials.\n\n**Configuring Mail Encryption**\n\nI'm finalizing the categorization of the IT ticket. Based on the presence of \"encrypted mime,\" \"digital certificate,\" and \"shared mailbox,\" I'm definitively assigning it to \"Administrative rights,\" as these elements relate to security configurations and system management.\n\n"
