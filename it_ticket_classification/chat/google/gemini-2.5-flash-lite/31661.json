I see \"purchase\" and \"order,\" which points me toward \"Purchase\" as the most relevant category. It's a clear transaction, not an administrative right, hardware, storage, access, HR, or internal project issue.\n\n\n**Categorizing Purchase Orders**\n\nI'm solidifying my approach: the consistent thread is purchase orders and their implementation. The text details a range of purchase order information, from initial requisition to order details, confirmations, and receiving items. The evidence strongly supports \"Purchase\" as the correct category, given the transaction-focused content. This seems like an irrefutable conclusion.\n\n\n"
