I also want to check the details for information about other IT tickets. I need to make sure this meets the exact requirements of the category.\n\n\n**Confirming the Hardware Category**\n\nI've finalized my analysis of the IT ticket text. My assessment clearly indicates the issue pertains to hardware; the recurring theme of device connection problems decisively aligns with this category. I'm now certain \"Hardware\" is the correct classification.\n\n\n"
