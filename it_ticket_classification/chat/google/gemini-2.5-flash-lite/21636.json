The keywords \"connection cable,\" \"desktop to laptop,\" and simply \"cable\" strongly suggest a hardware-related issue. My goal is to assign the appropriate category from the predefined list, ensuring the ticket is routed correctly.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Match**\n\nI've carefully considered the given ticket text and the available categories. It seems \"Hardware\" is the most fitting. No other option, like HR, Access, or Storage, appears relevant. \"Miscellaneous\" is too vague, and while \"Purchase\" is technically possible, the focus here isn't buying but connectivity. \"Hardware\" is the most direct and accurate choice.\n\n\n"
