The user's laptop is down after a restart, which is an urgent issue given the upcoming demo. I must select the best fit from the provided list: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. Considering the symptom, I'm leaning toward \"Hardware,\" but I need to make sure this is the correct choice.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Root Cause**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket details to categorize it appropriately. The core issue is the user's non-functional laptop post-restart, which is causing urgency due to the upcoming demo. After assessing the symptoms and the provided categories, \"Hardware\" seems the best fit. While other options were considered, the laptop's non-functionality directly aligns with a hardware-related problem. The urgency strengthens this choice.\n\n\n"
