Based on the provided text, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category for this IT ticket. The issue clearly centers around a physical component of the laptop, specifically the battery. I'm confident I have a good grasp of the primary issue and am ready to finalize the categorization.\n\n\n**Solidifying the Categorization**\n\nI've determined that \"Hardware\" is the definitive category. All the evidence points directly to a battery malfunction or failure. The phrases like \"battery broke,\" \"battery failed,\" and the observed behavior when the charger is disconnected, all strongly suggest this hardware issue. I'm ready to mark this categorization as complete and move to the next step.\n\n\n"
