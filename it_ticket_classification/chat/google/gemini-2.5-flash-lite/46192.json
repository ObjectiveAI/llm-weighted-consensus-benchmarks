I need to look at the ticket description and pick the best category from the list given. I'm focusing on the words to figure out what they mean.\n\nI've started by looking for keywords. I'm trying to get a sense of how the description connects to the given categories. This will lead to the creation of the mapping logic I need to classify the tickets.\n\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on a tricky ticket. It's all about annual leave requests and getting them approved. After carefully examining the keywords like \"annual leave,\" \"line manager,\" and \"approval,\" I'm confident that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate category. It's a clear fit! I need to ensure this logic is captured.\n\n\n"
