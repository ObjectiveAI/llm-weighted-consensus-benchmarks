My approach involves a careful analysis of the provided text, looking for keywords and phrases that directly relate to the predefined categories. \"Unable to connect remotely\" seems to suggest an issue with access or potentially hardware connectivity, therefore narrowing down the possibilities.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted towards the specific aspects of \"Access\" as the core issue. The recurring phrase \"unable to connect remotely\" strongly points to network connectivity or remote access protocols. I am currently cross-referencing this finding with other possible implications that might have been ignored during the initial run. I'm also assessing the likelihood of the issue being related to administrative permissions, though \"Access\" remains the stronger fit given the present information.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nMy analysis indicates the ticket content strongly points to an \"Access\" issue. The core problem, \"unable to connect remotely,\" directly implies problems with network connectivity or remote access protocols, thus making \"Access\" the most accurate categorization, and I've concluded on this.\n\n\n"
