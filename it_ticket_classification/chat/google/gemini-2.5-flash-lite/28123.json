The phrases \"jobs creation,\" \"senior engineer,\" and \"accountant\" point towards potential HR or access concerns, but there's a lack of specifics. The language seems too vague for a definitive classification, leaning towards either \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" at this point. I'll need to dig deeper.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket: Progress**\n\nI've been honing in on the \"HR Support\" category. The text clearly revolves around \"jobs creation,\" specifying roles like \"senior engineer\" and \"accountant,\" and mentioning aspects like \"job knowledge\" and \"grade.\" It seems like a request to set up new positions, which aligns well with the HR Support. Access, Hardware, Storage, Purchase and Administrative rights are not relevant. My analysis is leaning strongly towards \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket's Scope**\n\nI'm now focusing on the core request: \"create jobs.\" The provided text contains mentions of job roles (\"senior engineer,\" \"accountant,\" \"technician\") and HR-related concepts like \"job knowledge\" and \"grade.\" This suggests the ticket is not just about setting up job titles, but likely involves the entire process of defining roles, potentially in a new organizational structure or project. \"HR Support\" remains the best fit. I've ruled out all the other categories at this point.\n\n\n"
