My initial assessment leans towards \"Internal Project\" due to the recurring \"work program\" and the mention of \"Oracle,\" hinting at a new system or initiative.\n\n**Processing Ticket Request**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the IT ticket text against the available categories, focusing on terms like \"work program\" and \"Oracle.\" My analysis suggests \"Internal Project\" as the most fitting classification, given the context of a new initiative and system involvement.\n\n**Classifying New Initiatives**\n\nI've analyzed the IT ticket and am confident in classifying it as an \"Internal Project.\" The recurring mention of \"new work program\" alongside \"Oracle\" strongly indicates a new initiative or system rollout requiring user guidance.\n\n"
