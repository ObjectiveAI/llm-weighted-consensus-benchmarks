The keywords \"project access request\" and \"added members site\" point towards \"Access\". However, I need to ensure this is the best fit, considering other potential categories like \"Internal Project\" or even \"Administrative Rights\". I will also need to review the other possible categories before settling on the most appropriate one.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm making a solid case for \"Access\" as the right category. The keywords strongly suggest it. I'm focusing on \"project access\" and \"adding members\" to file shares. While other options exist, the current evidence points towards this choice. I still need to quickly cross-check to be completely sure.\n\n\n"
