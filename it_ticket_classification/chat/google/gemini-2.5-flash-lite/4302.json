My initial assessment leans towards \"HR Support\" due to the mention of \"allocated\" and the departure of an employee. However, I'm carefully reviewing the wording to ensure it's not a hardware request disguised as an HR inquiry. I'm focusing on the nature of the request: is this about a device or about employee information related to a device? I'm leaning more towards the latter, but I need to be certain.\n\n\n**Confirming Hardware Classification**\n\nI've determined that the ticket primarily concerns a hardware issue. Despite the HR-related context (\"recently left\"), the core request revolves around a mobile phone allocation, firmly placing it in the \"Hardware\" category. I've re-evaluated the context and concluded that the focus is on the hardware itself, even if related to a departing employee. My decision is final.\n\n\n**Revising Categorization Focus**\n\nI'm revisiting the ticket's core issue: the inquiry is about a mobile phone allocation, which is undoubtedly hardware-related, even with an HR-tinged background. \"Mobile phone\" is the key term. The departure of an employee is secondary. I'm confidently classifying this as a \"Hardware\" request. My revised assessment is based on a refined understanding of the core request: verifying the allocation status of a device.\n\n\n"
