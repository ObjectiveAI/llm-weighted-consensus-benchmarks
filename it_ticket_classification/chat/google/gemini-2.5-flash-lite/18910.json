The phrase \"change project code\" suggests I should consider \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Administrative rights.\" The rest of the text seems less relevant. I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" because it implies ongoing work. I'm now comparing the choices and their respective context.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Request**\n\nI've narrowed it down to \"Internal Project\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The repeated phrase \"change project code\" is the key. While changing project codes *could* require admin access, the core *request* centers on project management, aligning with \"Internal Project\". I'm dismissing \"HR Support,\" even though \"annual leave requests\" appeared, as it seems secondary to the main request. My current assessment heavily favors \"Internal Project.\"\n\n\n**Deciding the Ticket Category**\n\nI've been honing in on \"Internal Project\" as the best match for this ticket. The constant repetition of \"change project code\" cements this. I've re-examined \"Administrative rights\", but changing a project code is a task, not necessarily requiring administrative access. The temporal element \"friday march pm\" further reinforces the project management aspect. My reasoning now leans decisively toward \"Internal Project\". I am confident in this categorization.\n\n\n"
