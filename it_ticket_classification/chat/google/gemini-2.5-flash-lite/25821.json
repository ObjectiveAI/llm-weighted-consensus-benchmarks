I need to ensure my final selection is accurate and reflects the user's need appropriately.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Analysis**\n\nI've homed in on the \"Storage\" category as the most appropriate classification, primarily driven by the explicit requests to \"increase storage space\" and \"increase allocated storage.\"  While there are hints of potential project or purchase implications tied to costs and an engineering lead, my current assessment is that the core issue is storage capacity. I'm confident my choice best reflects the user's primary need.\n\n\n"
