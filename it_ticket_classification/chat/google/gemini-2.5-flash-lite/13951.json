My focus is on identifying keywords and context clues within the ticket description to ensure accurate classification for effective routing.\n\n**Identifying the Core Issue**\n\nMy analysis indicates the primary concern is a malfunctioning laptop due to age and wear. The description details hardware failures like a broken port and poor battery life, strongly suggesting \"Hardware\" as the most fitting classification, though a \"Purchase\" is implied for replacement.\n\n**Selecting the Category**\n\nI've refined my assessment, identifying the core issue as a hardware failure. The request for a new allocation, coupled with detailed descriptions of wear and tear and functional defects, solidifies \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate classification.\n\n"
