I'm weighing the keywords to ensure accurate classification.\n\n**Classifying the IT Ticket**\n\nI'm focused on classifying an IT ticket concerning Oracle timesheets. The request asks for guidance on how to proceed with submitting timesheets, suggesting a need for assistance with the system's functionality or access. I'm evaluating the provided categories, particularly \"Access\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" to best represent this user's query.\n\n**Classifying the Ticket**\n\nI'm currently assessing the user's request regarding Oracle timesheets. The prompt asks for guidance on submission and mentions an administrator, leading me to consider categories like \"HR Support\" or \"Access,\" as time sheets are a core HR function and users might require assistance with system navigation or permissions.\n\n**Addressing Time Sheet Submission**\n\nI'm currently focusing on categorizing an IT ticket related to Oracle time sheets. The user is seeking guidance on how to proceed with submitting their timesheets, which strongly suggests a need for support within the HR domain. I'm evaluating \"HR Support\" as the primary category given the nature of time tracking and submission.\n\n"
