After a close read, \"Miscellaneous\" seems like a decent fit, or possibly \"HR Support\" if the \"candidates\" are job candidates. I am re-examining the ticket text, searching for stronger indicators. I'll need to be precise, as the right category helps the team.\n\n\n**Revising Ticket Classification**\n\n\\n\\nI've re-evaluated the ticket and now believe \"HR Support\" is the best fit, despite initial inclinations toward \"Miscellaneous.\"  The core issue centers on a tool's incorrect reporting of active candidates, directly impacting HR-related data and processes. The user seeks assistance generating a proper candidate report. I'm confident in \"HR Support\" as the right category.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket: Final Decision**\n\n\\n\\nAfter a thorough review, I've confirmed that \"HR Support\" is the correct classification. The ticket's core revolves around a tool misreporting active candidates within the recruitment process. The user's goal is to obtain an accurate report, highlighting the HR focus. All other categories are less relevant.\n\n\n"
