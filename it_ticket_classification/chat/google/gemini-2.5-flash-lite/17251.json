My initial instinct is to focus on keywords to determine a primary category from the schema (\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", etc.). \"Access\" is jumping out at me, but I need to consider other terms present and how they might relate. I\u2019m thinking I will try some natural language processing and pattern recognition to improve my accuracy.\n\n\n**Defining Key Categories**\n\nI've refined my approach by focusing on the core issue: the user's difficulty accessing Confluence after receiving a link. While \"Access\" is still prominent, the context necessitates a closer look at potential sub-categories within \"Access\" based on whether it is a technical access issue or a more general functionality problem related to the link. I'm considering using the frequency of \"access\" and \"link\" to guide this determination.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Focus**\n\nI've determined that the primary category is definitively \"Access\". Now, I'm analyzing the ticket content to pinpoint *why* the access is failing. The issue seems to stem from a problem with a link. I am considering ways to automatically categorize the ticket more granularly, such as \"Access - Confluence - Link Issue.\"\n\n\n"
