The phrase \"fails whenever switch\" suggests a problem related to functionality or access. My analysis points towards this being an \"Access\" issue, but I'm cross-referencing to check other options.\n\n\n**Evaluating Hardware Issues**\n\nI've determined the issue is a network connectivity problem when not on wireless. It could be Hardware or Access. \"Hardware\" seems more likely due to implied network card or cable faults, and switch-related issues. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware,\" but I will continue to investigate the possibility of an \"Access\" issue.\n\n\n**Investigating the Connection Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and am focusing on the \"fails whenever switch\" statement, coupled with wireless functionality. My assessment leads towards \"Hardware\" being the most accurate category, reflecting potential network card, cable or switch port issues. \"Access\" is a possibility if it's a network reachability problem, but the language suggests a physical/logical connection problem. I've ruled out HR, storage, and purchasing issues. I'm leaning toward hardware, based on the phrasing \"fails whenever switch.\"\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Culprit**\n\nI've been examining the text and the potential categories. The \"fails whenever switch\" part, combined with the successful wireless connection, leans me strongly toward a hardware diagnosis. This could involve a faulty network interface card, a damaged cable, or a problem with the switch port. I've considered that it *might* be an \"Access\" issue, but the language suggests a physical connection issue first and foremost. I will now finalize \"Hardware\" as the solution to this ticket issue.\n\n\n"
