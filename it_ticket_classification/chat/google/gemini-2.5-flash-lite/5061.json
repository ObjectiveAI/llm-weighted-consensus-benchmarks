                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing Ticket Text**\n\nI'm currently focused on categorizing that IT ticket text. My initial attempt is to identify keywords related to the schema categories. \"New starter\" might point towards \"HR Support\" or \"Access\". \"Attached location\" feels like a red herring but needs consideration. I'm exploring how word context affects category assignments, and trying to refine my rules for the provided categories. It's a bit ambiguous, but a good start.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Rules**\n\nI've been drilling down on the \"new starter\" phrase, which seems central. It pulls strongly towards HR Support and Access, potentially Hardware if we assume hardware setup. The attached location is still a bit fuzzy, but I'm thinking of it as an indicator, but not a primary category driver. The remainder of the text is less useful. I'm focusing on strengthening the rules based on keyword combinations, like \"new starter + location\".\n\n\n**Determining the Primary Category**\n\nI've been leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\" as the initial categorization for tickets mentioning \"new starter.\" I've considered that while \"Access\" is relevant, new starter requests are often initiated through HR, encompassing more than just access permissions. I'm focusing on \"HR Support\" as it seems the central category given this text, and \"Access\" can be considered a sub-category. I'm building a system to account for variations to make certain this decision is sound.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Driver**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"HR Support\" categorization.  The 'new starter' keyword is the strongest signal, and the rest of the text is ambiguous. My analysis emphasizes that onboarding is an HR-driven process. IT supports the new starter. Therefore \"HR Support\" is correct, while \"Access\" is a sub-category. The \"location\" portion is vague and might imply access based on a location, but more context is required.\n\n\n**Determining Primary Category**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"HR Support.\" The text's \"new starter\" focus is the key. While access is crucial, this ticket's root likely falls under onboarding, an HR-driven event. IT's role is to service this onboarding, hence, \"HR Support\" feels like the top level. I'm focusing on strengthening rules to clarify this in future.\n\n\n**Finalizing Primary Category**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting top-level category. Despite \"Access\" being relevant, the ticket's core revolves around the *onboarding process*, initiated by HR. IT is providing support to HR, not the other way around. My analysis now focuses on capturing nuances in text to accurately route tickets like this in the future.\n\n\n**Determining the Core Focus**\n\nGiven the provided text, I'm now certain that **HR Support** is the most accurate primary category. The \"new starter\" phrase serves as a firm anchor, indicating an onboarding event coordinated with HR. IT's role is a supporting function in this process. I'm focusing my analysis on these types of signals to classify tickets.\n\n\n"
