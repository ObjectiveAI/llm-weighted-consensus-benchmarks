The \"new starter\" and \"former intern\" indicators, alongside \"access\", strongly suggest a focus on access provisioning and perhaps termination. While other categories might touch on these aspects, the specific context seems to point towards **Access** being the most relevant.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been evaluating the different categories to land on the best one. I initially leaned towards \"HR Support,\" as the ticket strongly revolves around onboarding and personnel. Then \"Access\" appeared to be a strong fit because of the \"access card\" and provisioning aspects. However, I\u2019m now leaning back towards \"HR Support\" because it feels more inclusive of all the factors.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Onboarding Context**\n\nI've been meticulously examining the text and the potential categories. While \"Access\" highlights a key aspect, the broader context of onboarding a \"new starter\" and \"former intern\" strongly indicates a \"HR Support\" issue. The \"starter form\" and general setup procedures solidify this conclusion, as HR typically manages these tasks.\n\n\n"
