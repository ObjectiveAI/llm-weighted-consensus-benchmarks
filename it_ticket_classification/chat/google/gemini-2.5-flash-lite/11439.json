The ticket's mentioning of \"maternity leaver\" strongly indicates HR Support, but there's also the \"access card\" which could lean towards Access.  I need to weigh the keywords carefully and finalize my categorization approach, factoring in potential overlaps in categories.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Context**\n\nI've been meticulously examining the ticket's text, especially the keywords and phrases, to ensure the most accurate categorization. My primary focus is understanding the core issue - a \"maternity leaver\" requires HR support, but also potentially impacts access. The presence of the \"access card\" is throwing in the possibility that it is related to access. I am now evaluating the overlap between HR and Access and refining the categorization process further. I'm leaning toward a combined approach if possible.\n\n\n**Revising Categorization Focus**\n\nI'm now focusing on categorizing the ticket, specifically determining the primary and, if applicable, secondary categories. The ticket text's \"maternity leaver,\" \"access card,\" and \"maternity leaver form\" indicate the importance of HR Support. I'm prioritizing \"HR Support\" due to the core event being the leaver's departure.\n\n\n"
