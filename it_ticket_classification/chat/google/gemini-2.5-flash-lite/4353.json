I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project,\" but I want to ensure my judgment aligns with your expertise.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Project Scope**\n\nI've been analyzing the text closely, and the repeated mention of \"azure\" confirms a cloud-centric focus. Terms like \"merge SI\" and \"design lead\" clearly point towards a project environment. The \"ext\" term complicates the scope, but doesn't necessarily dictate it. Right now, \"Internal Project\" seems most fitting, though \"Miscellaneous\" is a strong backup.\n\n\n**Narrowing Project Focus**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on the core activities. \"Azure work\" and \"merge SI\" now clearly point toward an internal IT project. \"Design lead\" further cements the project aspect. The \"ext\" term introduces a small wildcard, but it doesn't shift the project focus, just adds a detail. My analysis now strongly leans towards \"Internal Project,\" although \"Miscellaneous\" is still a secondary consideration, given the open-ended nature of \"ext.\"\n\n\n"
