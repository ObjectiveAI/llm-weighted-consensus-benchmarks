The request to \"add as owner\" and the user's inability to do so themselves strongly point towards an \"Access\" category, dealing with permissions or system entry.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm narrowing down the category for this IT ticket. The core request to \"add as owner\" and the user's inability to do it themselves strongly indicates an \"Access\" related issue, focusing on permissions or system entry.\n\n**Selecting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the IT ticket content.
