Based on these, the primary focus seems to be onboarding related to HR, which appears to be a good fit. I will consider HR Support.\n\n\n**Determining HR Relevance**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in determining if this ticket truly falls under HR Support. The keywords are pointing strongly towards HR: \"new starter,\" \"starter november,\" \"starter form,\" \"hire,\" \"starting date,\" and \"starter forms attached.\" My initial thought process suggested HR was a good fit, and now it appears the evidence is overwhelming, reinforcing my initial assessment that this ticket is firmly within HR's domain.\n\n\n"
