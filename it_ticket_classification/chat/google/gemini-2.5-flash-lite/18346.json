I'm also considering potential overlaps and need to determine the primary concern to make the best assignment.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Primary Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Access\" as the most accurate category, given the explicit mentions of \"accounts closed,\" \"denied accesses,\" and the core IT function of account management. While \"HR Support\" has a tangential relevance due to the leaver process, the technical action described is purely access control. The focus is now on confirming that \"Access\" accurately captures the requested IT action.\n\n\n**Defining Precise Classification**\n\nI've carefully reviewed the text and concluded that \"Access\" is the most accurate category. While \"HR Support\" has an indirect link due to the leaver process, the core action is IT-based: account closure and access management. The key phrases clearly emphasize this IT function, making \"Access\" a precise fit. I'm satisfied that this classification accurately reflects the nature of the request.\n\n\n"
