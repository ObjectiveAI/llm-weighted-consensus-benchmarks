Seems clear this falls under hardware, since it involves a physical component failing. I'm focusing on the \"Hardware\" category.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've streamlined my categorization process.  My thoughts now center exclusively on the \"Hardware\" tag, given that the battery failure and its replacement are the core issues. It's a straightfoward case, and I'm confident in this classification.\n\n\n"
