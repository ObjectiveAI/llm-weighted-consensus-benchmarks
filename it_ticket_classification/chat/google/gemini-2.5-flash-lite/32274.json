Given the available options, I'm leaning toward a few possibilities. I'll need to consider the context of the location addition to narrow the possibilities further, and exclude some of the other categories.\n\n\n**Narrowing Access Considerations**\n\nI'm deep in the process of deciding between \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" The \"add location\" phrase keeps pulling me toward access control. The focus on assigning, deleting, changing ownership, and discussing locations strengthens this connection. I'm focusing on \"Access\" more since it is the more common use case.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Selection**\n\nMy focus is now firmly on \"Access.\"  The \"add location\" phrase keeps popping up, reinforcing the access theme. Location management, combined with user permissions, pushes me past \"Administrative Rights\" in favor of \"Access,\" which is more general and broader. The assignment of users to locations also heavily influences this choice.\n\n\n"
