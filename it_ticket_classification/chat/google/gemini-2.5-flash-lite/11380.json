The phrases \"owner change\" and \"responsible\" suggest an access control issue, rather than something like hardware or purchase. I'll need to confirm this assumption.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI've moved on from \"Access\" and am now considering \"Internal Project\" as the top choice. The repeated mention of \"bid squad\" and \"owner change\" strongly suggests a project team and responsibility reassignment. I'm weighing this against HR Support, but \"owner change\" feels less HR-centric and more project-related.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Category**\n\nI've decided on \"Internal Project.\" The \"bid squad\" and \"owner change\" language strongly points to a team and a role reassignment, solidifying my choice. I considered HR Support, but \"owner change\" feels more project-focused. I'm now certain this fits best.\n\n\n"
