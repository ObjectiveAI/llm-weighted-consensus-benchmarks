After careful review, \"Access\" seems like the strongest contender, considering \"leaver\" and \"mobile phone\". However, \"HR Support\" could also be relevant due to the \"leaver\" term. I need to resolve this ambiguity further. I might need to consider \"Miscellaneous\" if I can't find a better fit.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the keywords and their implications to accurately classify this IT ticket. \"Leaver\" is a crucial term, strongly indicating HR involvement and employee offboarding procedures. This, combined with \"mobile phone,\" \"subscription plan,\" and \"mailbox,\" suggests the ticket relates to multiple services that require both IT and HR coordination. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the primary category, given the employee departure aspect, although \"Access\" could also be relevant for managing associated services.\n\n\n**Focusing on Primary Category**\n\nI've been honing in on the most accurate IT ticket classification. After a closer look, the \"leaver\" keyword is a clear indicator, suggesting \"HR Support\" is the optimal category. The terms about the mobile phone, mailbox, and subscription are linked to the HR process. While \"Access\" could be relevant for deactivating services, it's secondary to the core issue of employee departure.\n\n\n"
