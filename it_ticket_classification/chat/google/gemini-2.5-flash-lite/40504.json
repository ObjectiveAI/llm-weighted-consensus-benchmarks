After analyzing the text, \"cannot open files from sent monday\" and \"cannot open files\", I am leaning towards identifying the core issue. I've considered potential categories, and I'm currently leaning towards \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" as the most appropriate fits.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Problem**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text and it keeps pointing me back towards \"Access\". The user is clearly struggling to open files and get a connection error, which strongly suggests some form of permission or network issue. While storage or administrative rights could play a role, the primary focus seems to be on gaining access to the files. It's becoming increasingly clear that \"Access\" is the most fitting category, with other options appearing less directly relevant.\n\n\n**Clarifying Access Issues**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the specifics of the access problem. The user's inability to open files and get a connection error, coupled with the \"connection secure\" message and different experiences among colleagues, has solidified my perspective. It's clear that the user needs help establishing proper permissions or resolving a network security problem.  \"Access\" is the most direct category.\n\n\n"
