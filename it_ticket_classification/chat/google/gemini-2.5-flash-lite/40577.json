The core issue appears to revolve around login problems within Oracle Fusion and other systems, with repeated mentions of \"single sign-on.\" This strongly suggests an \"Access\" category, though I'm considering if it might lean towards \"Hardware\" if the issue is device-related, or \"Administrative Rights\" if permissions are the root cause.\n\n**Focusing on Access Issues**\n\nI've determined the primary problem is a user's inability to log in to Oracle Fusion and other applications, with repeated references to single sign-on problems. This strongly indicates that the \"Access\" category is the most appropriate classification for this IT ticket.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Details**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the provided IT ticket text to pinpoint the most fitting category.
