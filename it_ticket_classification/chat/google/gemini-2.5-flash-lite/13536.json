It seems to have a new starter involved. I'm leaning toward HR Support, because of the phrase \"starter form\". I will need to consider whether it's more specific than that, like a request for access.\n\n\n**Analyzing Onboarding Needs**\n\nI've refined my thinking by further examining the keywords in the ticket text. \"New starter\" and the repeated \"starter form\" are central. Filling out this form suggests a strong HR Support need, though access might eventually be required. I've narrowed down the categories, and I'm dismissing options like Hardware and Storage, as they are not explicitly mentioned. HR Support seems most relevant, though I am considering potential connections to Access requests that may come later in the onboarding process.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Focus**\n\nThe ticket's keywords, like \"new starter\" and \"starter form\", are central to my updated thinking. Considering the limited options, \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate fit. It's the initiating action, not the access itself. The form is a trigger for IT action, and HR manages that process.\n\n\n"
