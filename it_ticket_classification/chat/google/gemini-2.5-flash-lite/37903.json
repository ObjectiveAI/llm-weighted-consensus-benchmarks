The provided description is quite sparse, which makes precise categorization a hurdle. \"issue several issues hi have few problems keep stuck can \" doesn't offer many clues. I need to make the best possible guess based on the limited information. My current focus is evaluating if any words or phrases hint at a specific category.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Root Cause**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket description to pinpoint the problem's nature. It's becoming clearer that the primary issue revolves around access and authentication challenges. While initial ambiguity existed, phrases like \"keeps asking for credentials\" and \"connection drops\" strongly suggest problems with access. The focus has sharpened towards understanding *why* access is being denied or repeatedly requested, and if the password issues are causing or connected to the connection difficulties. I am currently leaning toward Access or Miscellaneous.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket description, honing in on key phrases and their implications. \"Keeps asking for credentials,\" \"won't work,\" and \"connection drops\" are the most prominent indicators, and I'm cross-referencing them against the available categories. My revised focus is now weighing whether \"Access\" encompasses the full range of issues implied, including those potentially related to password expiration and connection stability.\n\n\n"
