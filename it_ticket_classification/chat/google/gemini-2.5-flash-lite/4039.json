The subsequent update to the ticket, involving deleting and password resets, further solidifies this. While HR might touch upon the process, the actual actions pertain to granting or revoking system access. I'm focusing on \"Access\" as the primary category, but will track any potential HR-related aspects that emerge to ensure precise classification.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket's Theme**\n\nI'm solidifying my classification of the latest ticket. The core request revolves around Active Directory user management - creation, deletion, and password resets. These tasks align perfectly with \"Access,\" as they directly relate to controlling user access to systems. HR might indirectly be involved, but \"Access\" captures the essence of the technical actions requested.\n\n\n"
