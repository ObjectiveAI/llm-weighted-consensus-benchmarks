The phrases \"amend tasks\" and \"project friday\" point strongly toward an \"Internal Project\" classification. While the wording is somewhat vague, the essence of task modification within a project context is clear, leading me to favor \"Internal Project\" over other possible categories.\n\n\n**Categorizing Project Tasks**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's text, identifying key phrases related to \"code,\" \"tasks,\" \"project,\" and supporting tools. The descriptions point towards modifying and improving project-related activities and code. Specific terms, like \"user acceptance testing,\" and \"documentation writing,\" indicate a focus beyond simple task adjustments. With the evidence at hand, I am confident in selecting \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate classification.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Scope**\n\nI've examined the ticket details, isolating crucial project-related activities. Key terms like \"code,\" \"tasks,\" \"user acceptance testing,\" and \"documentation writing\" firmly place this within an internal project framework. The focus on code modifications, tool integrations, and quality assurance processes solidifies my decision to categorize it as \"Internal Project,\" as it encompasses the broad scope of the work described.\n\n\n"
