The multiple mentions of \"virus\" and lack of other defining terms leans me towards a malware-related categorization. I'm hesitant to lock it in with just this data.\n\n\n**Revising Category: Final**\n\nI've refined the categorization process. Focusing solely on the repeated \"virus\" mentions, and the lack of other defining terms, I have decided to select \"Miscellaneous\". This captures the general nature of the ticket without forcing it into a potentially incorrect category.  I believe the ticket could describe a potential malware incident, but further detail is required to determine the exact nature of the problem, and a more specific category wouldn't accurately reflect what's known at this stage.\n\n\n**Reassessing Classification: Security**\n\nI'm reconsidering the classification. While I initially opted for \"Miscellaneous,\" the repeated mention of \"virus\" makes \"Security\" the most appropriate label, even if not explicitly listed. The ticket's brevity and lack of specific details necessitate this broad, yet relevant, categorization. It flags the issue correctly, paving the way for further investigation.\n\n\n"
