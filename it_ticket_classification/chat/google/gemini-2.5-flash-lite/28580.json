Therefore, I am leaning heavily towards classifying this ticket under the \"HR Support\" category.\n\n\n**Revising Classification Approach**\n\nI'm reconsidering my initial focus on \"HR Support\" after further analysis. While HR is strongly suggested, the emphasis on hardware within the text and the potential need to adjust access rights upon an employee's maternity leave necessitates a more nuanced approach. I'm now weighing the \"Hardware\" and \"Access\" categories more carefully, alongside \"HR Support,\" to arrive at the most inclusive and precise classification.\n\n\n**Defining Primary Classification**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's core intent. My current thinking is that while hardware and access management are relevant, they are likely subsidiary to the HR process triggered by \"maternity leave\" and the \"leaver form.\" This strongly suggests \"HR Support\" as the primary classification. The IT actions are in response to an HR event. I'm confident about this initial classification.\n\n\n"
