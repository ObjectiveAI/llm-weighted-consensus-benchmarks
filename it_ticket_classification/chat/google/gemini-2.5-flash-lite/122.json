My focus is on understanding the core request within the text to ensure accurate classification.\n\n**Identifying Core Ticket Theme**\n\nI'm currently refining my understanding of the IT ticket's core issue. The phrase \"new starter\" is key, and I'm weighing whether \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" better encompasses the likely underlying need given the limited context.\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Content**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the provided IT ticket description, \"new starter february dear colleagues going february starts starts starts starts forms attached great.\" My primary objective is to select the most appropriate category from the enum based on the keywords, with \"new starter\" heavily influencing my decision.\n\n**Selecting Best Fit Category**\n\nBased on the analysis of \"new starter\" in the ticket description, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support.\" This category best captures the overarching context and likely origin of the request, which typically stems from HR or business onboarding processes for new employees, rather than a specific hardware or access issue.\n\n**Finalizing HR Support Category**\n\nI've concluded that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category. This decision stems from the prominence of \"new starter\" in the ticket, indicating an onboarding process that is typically HR-initiated and managed, encompassing IT's role in setting up new employees.\n\n**Assigning Ticket to HR Support**\n\nI've completed the analysis of the IT ticket description. Considering the prominent \"new starter\" keyword and the overall context, I've determined that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category from the provided enum. This decision reflects the onboarding nature of the request, which typically originates from or is closely tied to HR processes.\n\n"
