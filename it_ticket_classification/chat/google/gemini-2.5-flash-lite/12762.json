The provided text, though concise, contains clues suggesting \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. I'm focusing on the keywords \"create new project codes\" and \"internal support.\"\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted towards the specific keywords, like \"project codes\" and \"planning analyst\". While \"Internal Project\" felt like the initial fit, the specific context now solidifies this choice. The terms \"Fusion\" and \"facility officers\" further strengthen the argument for Internal Project. This is starting to feel like a solved problem.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've been working on narrowing down the best category for this ticket. The initial leaning towards \"Internal Project\" continues to hold strong. \"Planning analyst\", \"facility officers\", and \"project codes\" all reinforce this conclusion. The system name \"Fusion\" and the phrase \"internal support\" strongly link the request to internal project management needs.\n\n\n"
