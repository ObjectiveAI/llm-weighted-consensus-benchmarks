My initial assessment leans towards the \"Access\" category, but I'm cross-referencing this against other keywords for additional verification. I will then use this assessment to improve classification logic going forward.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Access Problems**\n\nI'm zeroing in on this \"access\" theme. Reading through the tickets, \"cannot access\" is the recurring problem. Multiple browser attempts and credential checks solidify this. Despite clear instructions about troubleshooting, the problem persists. Access to either a website or an application, so the category is Access. I will now record this for later.\n\n\n**Classifying Access Issues**\n\nI've carefully examined the ticket content, and the recurring theme is clearly a user's inability to \"access\" a resource. Multiple attempts with different browsers, clearing cache, and credential checks confirm this. Despite the troubleshooting steps, the core issue persists. Based on the provided categories, \"Access\" is the best fit, as the problem is with accessing a website or application. I will now record this categorization.\n\n\n"
