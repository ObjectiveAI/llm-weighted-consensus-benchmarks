I'm examining the ticket's text, specifically looking for keywords related to timecards, absences, overtime, and submission deadlines. This seems to strongly align with \"HR Support\".\n\n**Refining Category Choice**\n\nI'm solidifying the categorization of the IT ticket. My analysis strongly indicates \"HR Support\" due to repeated mentions of timecards, absences, overtime, and payroll submission deadlines.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Details**\n\nI'm currently reviewing the ticket's content, focusing on keywords like \"timecards,\" \"absences,\" \"overtime,\" and \"payroll.\" This detailed analysis strongly reinforces my earlier conclusion that \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category for this ticket.\n\n"
