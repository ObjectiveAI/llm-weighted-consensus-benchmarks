Phrases like \"annual leave requests\" point strongly towards an HR-related issue. My goal is to accurately classify this ticket, and I believe I'm on track. I'll continue to analyze the text for any other relevant keywords that might influence the decision.\n\n\n**Determining the Category**\n\nI've refined my approach to categorize the IT ticket. After re-evaluating the content, including phrases like \"annual leave requests,\" and \"line manager,\" I'm now certain \"HR Support\" is the optimal category. The ticket primarily concerns HR-related functions. I'll stick with this categorization unless further analysis reveals conflicting information.\n\n\n"
