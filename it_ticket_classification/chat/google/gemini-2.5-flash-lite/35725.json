Currently, I'm analyzing the text for keywords and phrases that strongly indicate a category. My current process is to scan the text for words like \"broken,\" \"replace,\" or \"monitor\" for hardware, for example. I'll need to refine this based on your feedback to improve accuracy.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Text**\n\nI'm currently working to determine the correct category for this ticket. The text focuses on time card submission and approval issues, specifically addressing errors, rejections, and required corrective actions. Based on the provided schema, this appears to fall under \"HR Support\" due to the nature of the issue being related to employee processes. I'm building an algorithm to parse and categorize.\n\n\n**Refining Category Determination**\n\nI'm presently focused on accurately categorizing the IT ticket. After analyzing the ticket text about time card submission issues, I've concluded that \"HR Support\" is the best fit. My current logic highlights the HR-centric nature of the ticket's issues, dealing with time card approval and associated errors. I'm now fine-tuning the keyword list and analysis techniques to enhance future categorization precision.\n\n\n"
