I've noted keywords like \"block following domains\" and \"blocker\". My goal is to map this to one of the given categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. Currently leaning towards the most relevant category based on these clues.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Requests**\n\nI've been analyzing the text related to this IT ticket, focusing on terms like \"block,\" \"domains,\" and \"anti block list.\" Considering the available categories, \"Access\" appears to be the most appropriate fit. It aligns well with the request's emphasis on controlling domain access, a core function of access management. \"Miscellaneous\" remains a possibility but is less precise.\n\n\n"
