The \"change ownership,\" \"owner left,\" and \"graduates assign owner\" language strongly points towards employee management, making HR Support the most likely fit. I'm confident about this categorization given the phrasing used.\n\n\n**Confirming HR as the Primary**\n\nI'm solidifying my conclusion. While access changes are involved, the core issue stems from an employee lifecycle event. The phrasing in the ticket, particularly \"owner left\" and \"graduates assign owner\", drives me to HR Support as the primary category, with access modifications being a downstream consequence. This seems the most logical categorization.\n\n\n**Categorizing with Confidence**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's language, considering various categories, and confirmed my initial assessment. While access adjustments are present, the impetus stems from employee lifecycle events. The phrases \"owner left\" and \"graduates assign owner\" lead me to confidently categorize this as HR Support, with access changes following logically. This categorization is solid.\n\n\n"
