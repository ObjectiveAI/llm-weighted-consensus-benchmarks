The \"environment issue\" coupled with the browser's credential recognition problem strongly suggests an issue that is not strictly hardware, HR, access, storage, purchase, or internal project-related. It's looking more like a system-level glitch. This makes \"Miscellaneous\" the most likely landing spot, though further details might provide clarity.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Issue**\n\nMy thought process is now laser-focused on \"Access\" as the core issue. Analyzing the user's description, the struggle to reach a site with seemingly valid credentials, even after trying different workarounds, consistently points to access restrictions or problems with the access method itself. The specifics of the browser and \"environment\" further cement the Access category as the most accurate.\n\n\n"
