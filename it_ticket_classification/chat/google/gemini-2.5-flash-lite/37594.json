My primary objective is to pinpoint the most accurate category by analyzing keywords and the overall context of the issues presented, with \"Hardware\" appearing to be the most relevant classification given the recurring mentions of server issues and component replacements.\n\n**Selecting IT Ticket Category**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the IT ticket's description. My analysis confirms that the recurring mentions of server issues, RAM replacement, and memory errors strongly indicate a hardware-related problem. Therefore, I've categorized it as \"Hardware.\"\n\n"
