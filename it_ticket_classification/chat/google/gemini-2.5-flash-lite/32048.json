My focus is on understanding the core issue to accurately assign it to one of the predefined labels like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"\n\n**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently working to pinpoint the most fitting category for the IT ticket based on the provided description and the JSON schema. My analysis is focused on identifying keywords that align with specific categories such as \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" and system-related issues.\n\n**Resolving Ticket Category**\n\nI'm refining the categorization of the IT ticket. My latest analysis highlights that the \"working hours adjustment\" phrase strongly points towards the \"HR Support\" category, especially when considered alongside user submission problems and errors. I'm weighing this against potential \"Access\" or broader system issues.\n\n**Prioritizing HR Support**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket details, and the explicit mention of \"working hours adjustment\" strongly indicates \"HR Support\" as the primary category. While other phrases suggest access or system issues, the HR context appears to be the most specific and foundational element of the request.\n\n"
