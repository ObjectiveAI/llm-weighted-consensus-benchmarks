For example, the term \"re leaver\" could indicate an HR-related issue. My goal is to accurately map ticket text to the correct category.\n\n\n**Identifying Key Issues**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and the keywords therein to map it to the correct category. \"Re leaver\" and related phrases are dominant, pointing to an employee departure. My analysis suggests \"HR Support\" is the primary category, with \"Hardware\" also relevant due to the laptop return aspect. The focus now is weighing the relative importance of these categories and considering any secondary issues.\n\n\n**Assigning Primary Category**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the primary category. After reviewing the ticket text, \"HR Support\" clearly aligns with the core issue \u2013 managing the employee departure process. The multiple \"re leaver\" references, along with mentions of \"leaver form,\" \"leaving processes,\" and \"leaver notification,\" confirm this. While \"Hardware\" is relevant due to the laptop, it's secondary to the HR procedures. \"HR Support\" seems the most accurate initial designation, which is what I am focused on now.\n\n\n"
