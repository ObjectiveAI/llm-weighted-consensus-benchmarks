After careful consideration of the keywords, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Hardware,\" given the mentions of \"hardware allocation\" and \"starter form.\" I'm also considering the implications of \"new interns\" within this context.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR and Hardware**\n\nI'm now focusing on a combined Hardware and HR approach. The \"bulk starter form\" for new interns keeps steering me toward an HR process. However, the explicit mention of \"hardware allocation\" means I can't ignore the hardware aspect. I'm leaning toward a category that reflects the intersection of these two areas.\n\n\n**Focusing on Onboarding Context**\n\nI'm now focusing on the onboarding aspect.  The recent text makes it clear the primary concern is the process for new interns.  While the hardware allocation is important, it is a *consequence* of the onboarding process, which is why \"HR Support\" appears the correct primary category.  I'm digging deeper into how the starter form fits the need for hardware.\n\n\n**Deciding the Primary Driver**\n\nI've been working through the most recent ticket description and the list of categories. The user's goal involves \"new interns\" and \"hardware allocation.\" I've considered how HR support often triggers the hardware process. The \"bulk starter form\" for a school center makes HR Support appear the strongest, driving the hardware need.\n\n\n**Determining Onboarding's Role**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"HR Support\" as the primary category, despite the \"hardware allocation.\" The explicit context of the bulk starter form for new interns made me realize this is about the process, and not the hardware itself. The request is for the onboarding workflow, making HR the best fit.\n\n\n"
