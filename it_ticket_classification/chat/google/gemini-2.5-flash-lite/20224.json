These strongly suggest the \"Purchase\" category. However, I need to ensure there are no overriding factors, such as \"make\" implying software development, so I'm doing a final check for other potential matches.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI've honed in on the purchase angle. The phrases \"order phone,\" \"re order easier,\" and \"make purchase\" all solidify the \"Purchase\" category as the best fit. I've ruled out alternatives.\n\n\n"
