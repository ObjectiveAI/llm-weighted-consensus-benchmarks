The phrases \"lost card,\" \"access card,\" \"activated card,\" and \"assigned card\" are consistently present. This suggests the primary issue clearly revolves around access control, specifically physical access through the use of cards.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe ticket text, particularly the repeated phrases about cards, solidly places this request in the \"Access\" category. I am confident in this categorization and will proceed with this as the designated bucket. The repetitive card-related terms leave no doubt that access control is the central issue here.\n\n\n"
