However, I'm keeping the other options in mind, just in case there's an unforeseen nuance that changes the overall context of the ticket. The goal is accuracy for appropriate resolution.\n\n\n**Reaffirming HR Support Focus**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket description. \"Time reporting issues\" and \"irregular schedule\" are still key. The request seems tied to employee data, making \"HR Support\" the clear frontrunner. I've ruled out \"Access\" as the problem appears to be broader than simply granting or denying access. The other categories are irrelevant. Now, I am confident in selecting \"HR Support\" for its system/process handling.\n\n\n"
