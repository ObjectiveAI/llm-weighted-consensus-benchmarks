It's becoming apparent that this might be a complex task, and I'm still working out the best approach to extract the right meaning.\n\n\n**Identifying HR Support Need**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"HR Support\" category. Analyzing the ticket text, phrases like \"oracle hr support\" and \"career\" are prevalent. The schema confirms this categorization, and I've structured my output to produce a JSON object with \"HR Support\" as the assigned category. This approach ensures I meet the requirements for the specific ticket.\n\n\n"
