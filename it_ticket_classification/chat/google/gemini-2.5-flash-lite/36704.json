The text leans heavily towards access issues, specifically \"password reset\" requests. While other options exist, the prominence of these keywords strongly suggests the \"Access\" category is the most appropriate. I'm double-checking for any subtle clues that might point elsewhere, but so far, \"Access\" seems like the clear front-runner.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the keywords from the ticket text. Terms like \"password reset,\" \"invalid password,\" and \"expire\" all point decisively towards access management. Given the available categories, \"Access\" is the most fitting choice. I'm now confident in categorizing this ticket accordingly.\n\n\n"
