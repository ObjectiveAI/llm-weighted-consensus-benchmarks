My primary task is to assign each ticket to one of the predefined categories within the JSON schema. This involves carefully analyzing the ticket's description to accurately map it to the correct enum value, ensuring efficient processing.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Categories**\n\nI'm refining my process for assigning IT ticket categories. I've analyzed the keywords \"card,\" \"accessing building,\" and \"parking\" from the user's input, leading me to confidently categorize this request under \"Access\" within the provided JSON schema. This seems to be the most precise fit, distinguishing it from \"Hardware\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"\n\n**Processing Access Requests**\n\nI've finalized the categorization for the ticket. Based on the recurring keywords and the explicit mention of \"building\" and \"parking\" access, I've confidently assigned it to the \"Access\" category as per the JSON schema. This decision was reached after thorough comparison with other potential categories.\n\n"
