My initial assessment suggests it leans towards \"Hardware\" due to the mention of a \"video room\" and functionality issues, but \"Miscellaneous\" might also be a relevant fallback if the issue doesn't fit neatly into the other categories. I'm carefully considering the context to make the most accurate categorization.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nI've determined the ticket's text (\"video room not working sent tuesday video room working hi video meeting room floor does work can someone please take look\") aligns primarily with the \"Hardware\" category. The presence of \"video room\" and \"meeting room\" along with \"not working\" clearly indicates a problem with physical equipment. While \"Miscellaneous\" could apply, \"Hardware\" offers a more precise fit based on the schema and problem description.\n\n\n"
