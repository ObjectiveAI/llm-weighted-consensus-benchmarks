The text mentions issues submitting \"hours charged each Monday\", and re-submission errors. The likely categories, given the options, appear to be \"HR Support\", as it involves issues with hours entries, or possibly \"Access\" if there are access-related restrictions on entering the hours.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket Issue**\n\nI've determined that the ticket concerns time entry and submission. The core issue is an error preventing successful resubmission of weekly hours. \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate category, given the nature of the issue. Although access might be involved, the problem itself is not one of access restriction but incorrect time entries.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Ticket Priority**\n\nI've determined the ticket concerns issues with weekly time entry, highlighting the need for \"HR Support\". The phrase \"unpopulated\" entries further solidifies this, focusing the issue on the entry of hours. I've ruled out other categories, leaning strongly towards \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n"
