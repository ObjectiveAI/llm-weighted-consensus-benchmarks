My current thinking leans towards \"Hardware,\" as the phrase \"license upgrade\" indicates a potential need to update equipment.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter reviewing the ticket text again, I've solidified my decision. I'm focusing on keywords like \"wireless controller\" and \"license upgrade,\" which strongly suggest a hardware-related issue. The initial thought was \"Hardware\" and I am sticking with this decision. \"Internal Project\" felt like a possible fit initially, but the focus on the hardware itself, and the upgrade of licenses, cements \"Hardware\" as the most specific and accurate category.\n\n\n"
