The text is a bit sparse, but the keywords \"new starter,\" \"induction,\" and \"attached\" are jumping out. I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" because of the new starter reference, but the \"attached\" part is making me second guess. I'm trying to decide if it's more about HR needing technical help or vice versa.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Request**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided text and narrowed the possible categories down to \"HR Support\" or \"Access\". The core issue seems to be assistance with a new starter's form completion during induction. While access might be a secondary aspect, the ticket's focus appears more HR-centric. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" because of the strong connections to new employee onboarding and induction. I'm now working to make the final determination.\n\n\n**Defining the IT Ticket's Focus**\n\nNow, I'm focusing on why \"HR Support\" fits the best. The text emphasizes \"starter form\" and \"induction,\" indicating it's about onboarding support, which HR handles. The IT connection likely comes from supporting HR's processes. I'm confident \"HR Support\" captures the core of the issue, not needing a user's rights, specific hardware, or general projects.\n\n\n"
