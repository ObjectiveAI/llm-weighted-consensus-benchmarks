The wording seems to revolve around requesting an additional monitor. Initial thoughts lean towards \"Hardware\" because it directly references a physical device. I'm carefully considering other categories to ensure a proper categorization is achieved, but I'm leaning heavily towards Hardware at this time.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Request Details**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's language, focusing on keywords to determine the appropriate category. The words \"extra monitor\" and \"provide monitor\" strongly suggest \"Hardware.\"  The context supports this, as the location and programming need indicate using a physical device. While \"Purchase\" is a possibility, \"Hardware\" seems more direct for requesting the equipment. I think this will work well.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Optimal Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and meticulously comparing it against the available categories. The request clearly centers around obtaining a physical monitor, making \"Hardware\" the most fitting option. While \"Purchase\" is a potential fit, the primary action appears to be securing the monitor, not necessarily initiating a procurement process. Based on this deeper analysis, Hardware is the clear winner for now.\n\n\n"
