The ticket involves a \"new starter\" and \"hardware allocation,\" so I'm leaning toward \"Hardware.\" The presence of a \"starter form\" also makes me consider \"HR Support\" as a second possible category. However, \"Hardware\" seems the more accurate fit.\n\n\n**Deciding on Category Priority**\n\nI've been evaluating \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" further. While the \"starter form\" indicates some HR involvement, the core of this ticket revolves around \"new starter hardware allocation.\" It seems assigning \"Hardware\" as the primary category, with a potential secondary tag for \"HR Support\" if the system allows, would be most accurate.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Choice**\n\nAfter reviewing the ticket text and various categories, I'm now certain that \"Hardware\" is the most fitting. The phrase \"new starter hardware allocation\" directly aligns with this choice. Though \"HR Support\" has a peripheral relevance, the main task described in the ticket pertains to the provisioning of hardware, making \"Hardware\" the primary category.\n\n\n"
