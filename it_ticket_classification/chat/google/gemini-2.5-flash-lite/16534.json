The text strongly suggests a connection to \"maternity leave,\" leading me to consider \"HR Support\" as the most suitable classification. I'm focusing on the keywords and the overall context to make this determination, weighing each category carefully before settling on the optimal choice.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Context**\n\nI'm now deeply analyzing the ticket's text, identifying core themes. The phrase \"maternity leave\" appears repeatedly and forms the primary context. While \"monitor\" and \"mouse\" are mentioned, they seem secondary to the HR-related issue of \"maternity leave\". The language mix requires careful parsing to derive meaning.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm now carefully re-evaluating the ticket. Although \"monitor si mouse\" appear, the dominant theme is undeniably \"maternity leave\". After careful review, I believe \"HR Support\" best fits this IT ticket. The keywords, particularly \"maternity leave,\" outweigh the hardware mentions, suggesting an HR-related primary issue.\n\n\n**Finalizing Classification Decision**\n\nI've meticulously analyzed the ticket details. While \"monitor\" and \"mouse\" are present, the overriding theme is undoubtedly \"maternity leave\". The language mix, though complex, centers on an HR-related issue. After careful consideration, I'm confident that the \"HR Support\" category accurately reflects the ticket's primary purpose, despite the mention of hardware.\n\n\n"
