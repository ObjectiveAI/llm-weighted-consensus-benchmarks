After analyzing the text, my initial thought leans towards \"Access\" due to the user's inability to open documents. However, I'm keeping an open mind for alternative classifications, such as \"HR Support\" if there is an issue accessing confidential documents.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Root Cause**\n\nI've narrowed the focus, recognizing the core problem revolves around document interaction. The \"Access\" category is still a frontrunner, as the inability to open or add documents points directly towards permissions. However, \"Administrative rights\" is gaining traction, since this issue is a subset of Access. I'm leaning towards resolving the issue with a single, clear category.\n\n\n**Clarifying Access Concerns**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Access\" category. The user's inability to interact with documents, particularly opening and adding them, forms the crux of the problem. While administrative rights are a potential cause, the ticket's description is best described by the broader category, 'Access', because this encompasses any manner of limitation on interacting with documents, including permissions.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Symptom**\n\nI've decided \"Access\" is the best fit. The user's inability to interact with documents, highlighted by terms like \"document interface problems\" and \"cannot open/add documents\", makes this category a clear match. While \"Administrative rights\" is a potential root cause, the ticket's primary focus is the symptom: restricted access to documents. The broad scope of 'Access' covers permissions, system access controls, and other limitations on document interaction.\n\n\n"
