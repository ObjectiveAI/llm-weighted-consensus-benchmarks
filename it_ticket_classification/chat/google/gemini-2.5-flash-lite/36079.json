My analysis is zeroing in on a file storage issue. While other categories are possible, the wording points decisively to \"Storage\" as the primary concern. I'm building a stronger case to the user for this conclusion.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Root Cause**\n\nI'm deep in the ticket description again, focusing on the keywords \"upload files contracts\" and \"failed upload.\" The analysis systematically ruled out categories like Hardware, HR Support, and Purchase. Access is a possibility, but the *failure* is the key issue, not access itself. I've considered Miscellaneous as too broad and Internal Project, which doesn't seem to apply. Storage looks like the most relevant. While Administrative rights could be a factor *indirectly*, the issue seems centered on the storage process.\n\n\n"
