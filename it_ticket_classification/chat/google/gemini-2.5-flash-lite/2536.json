After examining the keywords (\"access cards\", \"order cards\"), it's clear the ticket concerns access management. Considering the options, \"Access\" seems the best fit. I'm finalizing this choice, keeping in mind the other categories.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Focus**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket's text, identifying key phrases such as \"access cards usage\" and \"order cards.\" The emphasis seems to be on managing or understanding the use and control of these cards, aligning perfectly with the \"Access\" category. I am now confident this is the most accurate fit and am preparing to proceed accordingly.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Categorization**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content, focusing on terms like \"access cards,\" \"order cards,\" and the need for usage control. The phrase \"access cards usage\" is a key indicator. Comparing these aspects with available categories, \"Access\" is clearly the most accurate fit, especially when looking at the core issue being physical access. This selection aligns best with the intent of the ticket, allowing for the correct resolution.\n\n\n"
