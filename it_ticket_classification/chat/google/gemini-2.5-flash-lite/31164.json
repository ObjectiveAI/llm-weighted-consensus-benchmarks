My next step is to perform this categorization.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's content, identifying recurring phrases like \"change password,\" \"expire days,\" and \"change pc.\" These strongly suggest a focus on user account management and system access. Therefore, I'm leaning towards classifying this as an \"Access\" related ticket.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Content**\n\nI've reviewed the IT ticket text, identifying key phrases like \"change password,\" \"expire days,\" and \"change pc.\" Based on this analysis, I'm confident in classifying this ticket under the \"Access\" category, as these terms predominantly relate to user account management and system entry.\n\n"
