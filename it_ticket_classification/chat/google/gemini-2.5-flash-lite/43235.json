My focus is on the mention of a \"feedback link does not load\" to accurately assign it from the available IT support categories.\n\n**Selecting Appropriate Category**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket details and considered the available categories. Based on the issue described \u2013 a \"feedback link does not load\" and \"fails load keeps loading but never loads\" \u2013 I believe \"Miscellaneous\" is the most fitting classification. This acknowledges the problem as a general IT functionality issue that doesn't directly align with hardware, HR, access, storage, purchases, internal projects, or administrative rights.\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI'm revisiting my classification of the IT ticket. While \"Miscellaneous\" felt appropriate for the \"feedback link not loading\" issue, I'm now considering if \"Access\" might be a slightly better fit, given the user's inability to reach the feedback functionality.\n\n"
