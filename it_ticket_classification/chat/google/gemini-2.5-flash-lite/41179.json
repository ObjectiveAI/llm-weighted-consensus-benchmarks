The key phrases are \"error when trying to submit\" and \"getting error.\" It seems the ticket relates to a system malfunction preventing a successful submission. My initial lean is toward \"Access\" or potentially \"Miscellaneous\" depending on the system involved, but further context is needed.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've decided to categorize this as \"Miscellaneous.\" The submission error reported doesn't clearly map to any other category.  \"Access\" was a potential, but the error seems more systemic than a simple access issue.  \"Miscellaneous\" provides the most flexible fit, given the limited information in the ticket text.\n\n\n"
