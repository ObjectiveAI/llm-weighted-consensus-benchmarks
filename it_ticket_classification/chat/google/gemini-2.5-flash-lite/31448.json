After analyzing the provided text, which seems related to a new employee's access card and internship, I'm leaning towards a specific category. My initial thoughts point towards \"Access\" but I'm still weighing it against other possibilities within the schema to ensure optimal routing.\n\n\n**Evaluating Category Options**\n\nMy current thinking is leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the primary category, while considering \"Access\" as a secondary classification. The request centers around enabling access, which often goes hand-in-hand with HR onboarding procedures.  I'm now assessing how to best tag the ticket to ensure it's routed appropriately for both access enablement and onboarding tasks.\n\n\n**Confirming Final Classification**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate categorization for the ticket. While \"Access\" is relevant due to the access card mention, the core request revolves around onboarding a new intern, aligning with HR's responsibilities. I'm now certain the ticket should be routed to the HR Support queue for prompt handling.\n\n\n"
