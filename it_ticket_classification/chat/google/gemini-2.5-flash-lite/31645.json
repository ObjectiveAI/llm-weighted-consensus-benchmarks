The text \"new starter ad him thursday pm starter form hello fill return both thank administration officer\" is proving tricky. I am working to identify the most relevant keywords to assign the ticket to one of the provided categories. It is difficult, but I am attempting to determine the intent and associated issues present in the text.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've determined \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category. Analyzing the keywords, \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"administration officer\" all point definitively toward an onboarding process. While \"Access\" could be relevant, the primary focus is the HR-driven setup, which I've decided confirms \"HR Support\" as the best choice.\n\n\n**Solidifying the Rationale**\n\nI've refined my reasoning for selecting \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category. The ticket text's focus on a \"new starter\" and the mention of a \"starter form\" clearly highlight the core HR-related nature of the request. The role of the \"administration officer\" further solidifies this association. I've concluded that this ticket is primarily concerned with the onboarding process rather than just access provisioning.\n\n\n"
