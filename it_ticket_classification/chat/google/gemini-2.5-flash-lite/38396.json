My focus is on identifying whether the described needs for equipment, such as an audio mixer and wireless microphones, alongside the mention of \"suppliers\" and \"quotations,\" best fit into a \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase\" category. The context of fitting out a meeting room also suggests potential \"Internal Project\" alignment.\n\n**Acquiring Necessary Hardware**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the latest IT ticket. My focus is on pinpointing the most accurate classification for a request involving specific equipment, quotations, and supplier sourcing for a meeting room fit-out. I'm weighing \"Hardware\" against \"Purchase\" and \"Internal Project\" to best represent the user's intent.\n\n**Determining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the nuances of an IT ticket, specifically focusing on classifying it.
