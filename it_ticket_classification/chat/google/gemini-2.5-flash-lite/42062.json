This clearly points towards a system or application-related problem. I'm leaning toward selecting a category that encompasses application access or functionality. I am now considering if this is a larger issue.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on the nuance between \"Access\" and \"HR Support.\" While access could be a contributing factor, the inability to *submit* timecards points more directly to an issue with the HR process or the application's functionality. The \"Oracle issues\" mentioned reinforces this application-specific context. I've ruled out all the other categories, leaving \"HR Support\" as the definitive choice.\n\n\n"
