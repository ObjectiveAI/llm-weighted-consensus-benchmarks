Currently, the most prominent keywords seem to point towards a potential \"Storage\" issue, perhaps related to data migration. However, I am still evaluating other options to make sure I am choosing the most appropriate one.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've honed in on the optimal category. After a meticulous review of the ticket text, considering keywords like \"migration,\" \"transfer files,\" and \"duplicate storage,\" \"Storage\" emerges as the most fitting label. While \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" might be secondary, the core activity revolves around data movement and management, definitively placing this ticket under \"Storage.\" I've ruled out \"Internal Project\" as less specific and dismissed other categories like \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" as completely irrelevant to the subject matter. \"Miscellaneous\" is too broad, given the specific nature of the problem.\n\n\n"
