After a first scan, the user's need doesn't feel like any of the categories are immediately obvious, given that the provided text is quite short. I am considering different options.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe initial analysis points to \"Access\" as the most suitable category. The user's inability to commit files and the mention of \"license restrictions\" strongly suggest an access or permission-related problem. Further refinement is necessary, but this seems the current path.\n\n\n**Confirming the Classification**\n\nI'm now certain that the \"Access\" category is the most appropriate. The user's struggle with file operations is directly linked to a license restriction and potential versioning discrepancies. These are both forms of access control, solidifying the choice of the \"Access\" category. The focus is not on hardware, storage, or internal projects, but the user's *ability* to perform file operations.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Root Cause**\n\nI've determined that \"Access\" is the right fit. It's not a storage or hardware problem, nor anything else. My thinking solidified on how the inability to commit files, combined with license restrictions and version differences, all point to a specific limitation in the user's ability to operate on the files. I'm now certain this isn't simply a storage limitation. It's very much about controlling and limiting *access* to functionality.\n\n\n"
