My analysis of the repeated phrases related to document access and browser functionality solidifies this classification.\n\n**Confirming the Category**\n\nI've finalized my assessment of the IT ticket. Based on the repeated references to document access and browser functionality issues, I am confirming that the ticket definitively belongs to the \"Access\" category, as this most accurately reflects the core problem described.\n\n"
