Based on the language used \u2013 keywords like \"card,\" \"access,\" and the context of needing something \"verified\" \u2013 I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access.\" However, the lack of clear context makes it a challenge, and I want to be certain before I finalize the classification. I'm carefully reviewing the text to confirm this.\n\n\n**Finalizing Access Classification**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the ticket text, and the consistent references to the \"card\" and its role in \"door opened\" functionality solidify my conclusion. \"Access\" is undoubtedly the most accurate category, reflecting the core issue. I've ruled out other categories like \"Hardware\" due to the language implying the card *is* working, and \"HR Support\" isn't a likely fit for access-related requests. The choice seems clear, and I'm ready to move forward.\n\n\n"
