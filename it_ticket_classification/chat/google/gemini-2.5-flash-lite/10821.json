The phrase \"stop missing time cards notifications\" strongly suggests a notification-related issue. My focus is on determining if this is a bug report, a feature request, or something else. I am further refining the specifics, it appears the \"stop\" part suggests a request for the notifications to cease.\n\n\n**Defining Scope: HR Ticket**\n\nI've considered the phrases \"stop missing time cards notifications\" and \"stop cards,\" determining the likely intent of the ticket. The term \"stop\" is key; the user wants the notifications to cease. After ruling out hardware, storage, purchase, and internal project, the ticket's scope appears to fall under \"HR Support,\" as time cards and notifications align with typical HR or payroll functions. I am now certain this is where it belongs, I am preparing my summary.\n\n\n**Refining the Focus: HR Ticket**\n\nI've examined the ticket description, \"stop missing time cards notifications stop cards,\" thoroughly. The phrase \"stop\" is central, indicating the user wants notifications halted. Given this, along with \"missing time cards\" and the term \"cards,\" my focus solidifies on \"HR Support.\" Time card notifications squarely fall into this category. Now I'll proceed with summarizing my findings.\n\n\n"
