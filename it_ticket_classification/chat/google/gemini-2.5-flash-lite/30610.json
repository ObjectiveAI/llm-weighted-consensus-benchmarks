The subject is complex, but \"new starter\" and \"access card\" are the most immediate priorities. I am considering different ways to map the information, focusing on the \"access card\" and how to link it to the correct department. I am trying to determine the most logical and efficient process to categorize this.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Ticket**\n\nI've carefully dissected the ticket subject, identifying \"new starter\" and \"access card\" as key. I've considered how these fit within the provided category schema, focusing on the request to *enable* the card.  I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the most specific category, though \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" are also relevant. I am now trying to finalize the primary classification.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've examined the ticket subject and categorized the request to enable the new starter's access card. I've broken down the key phrases and their implications. Initially, I thought that \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" were relevant, but \"Access\" is the most direct. \"Access\" perfectly captures the functional aspect of enabling the card.\n\n\n"
