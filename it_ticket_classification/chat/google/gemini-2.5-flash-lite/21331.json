So far, the context appears straightforward, and \"Hardware\" seems like the most fitting category. However, I'm still evaluating if the other categories fit or have relevance.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Decision**\n\nI've been evaluating the best category for this ticket, and the core term \"installation\" keeps pointing me towards \"Hardware\". I've considered that it *could* be a software installation within \"Internal Project\", but the absence of software-specific language and the clear presence of \"installation\" strongly suggests a hardware context. It feels like \"Hardware\" is still the most accurate and straightforward choice, aligning with the \"senior infrastructure engineer\" role. I'm focusing on the keywords and their implications.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Certainty**\n\nRight now, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Hardware\" as the best categorization. The term \"installation\" itself, combined with the job title of \"senior infrastructure engineer\", makes this a clear fit. I've re-evaluated \"Internal Project\" and \"Miscellaneous\", but they seem less accurate based on the text. Unless there is more specifics, \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate option. I'm satisfied that this is correct, but I'll make a note for additional context if the provided text changes.\n\n\n"
