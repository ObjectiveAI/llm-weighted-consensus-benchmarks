My focus is on determining the most appropriate category from the options provided. It appears quite cryptic with \"epic name\" repeated but I'll try to extract the core issue.\n\n\n**Classifying the Ticket**\n\nI've determined that the ticket text is strongly project-oriented, revolving around \"epic name\" and \"backlog\". My analysis suggests \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. While \"Access\" is a possibility for display issues, the core theme is project management and data tracking, strongly aligning with internal software/project tasks.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket. The repeated terms \"epic name\" and \"backlog\", along with the request to \"display,\" confirms its association with internal project management. The user's issue seems to stem from a missing or display-related problem with project artifacts within an internal system. Considering the available options, \"Internal Project\" is undoubtedly the most accurate categorization, solidifying the previous choice.\n\n\n"
