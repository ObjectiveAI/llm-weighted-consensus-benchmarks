My goal is to select the most appropriate category from the options provided.\n\n\n**Determining Best Fit Category**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket content, and the focus is on the inability to submit annual leave timesheets. Initially, I considered \"Access\" due to potential permission issues, however, I've decided \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category, given the nature of the issue. The current issue is the lack of a suitable task, leading me to focus on the annual leave process itself.\n\n\n**Selecting Proper Category**\n\nI've carefully reviewed the ticket content again. The user can't submit annual leave timesheets, and there's no available task. \"HR Support\" is the right fit, as the issue centers on the annual leave process within the system, not an access problem. The ticket mentions \"oracle time sheets,\" which indicates an HR or time-tracking application. I'm focusing on the functionality of annual leave submission, which aligns well with the \"HR Support\" category.\n\n\n"
