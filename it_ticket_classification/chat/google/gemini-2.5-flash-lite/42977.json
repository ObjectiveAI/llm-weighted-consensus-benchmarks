Considering the text, I've identified the key phrase, \"special leave request\". I think this points directly toward HR Support. Thus, I'll tentatively classify this as \"HR Support\". I'm ready to finalize the category now.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's content, focusing on the keywords and the potential categories. The initial \"HR Support\" seemed right, but after deeper analysis of the available text, I recognize that the phrase \"database be updated\" might suggest a connection to access or internal project. However, the keywords \"special leave request,\" \"lieu leave,\" and \"annual leave\" still strongly indicate an HR-related issue.  I'm now confident in \"HR Support\" as the most suitable classification and will proceed accordingly.\n\n\n"
