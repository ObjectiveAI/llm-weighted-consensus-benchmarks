The text is sparse, but I've noted a possible reference to a \"kale building\" and a time (\"friday pm\").  These clues are helping me weigh options. I'm focusing on keywords.\n\n\n**Analyzing Leaver Details**\n\nI have concluded \"HR Support\" is the best fit. While \"access\" could apply due to leaver procedures, \"HR Support\" encompasses the full scope. The key is \"leaver,\" implying a complete offboarding process, including access revocation. Other categories don't match the clear employee departure context. The \"mobile\" mention is vague, less relevant than the core HR trigger.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Scope**\n\nI'm now certain that the ticket relates to an employee departure. While \"Access\" is relevant due to potential account termination, \"HR Support\" appears the more holistic choice.  The term \"leaver\" is central, indicating an HR-driven process.  The \"mobile\" reference seems secondary to the core HR context. \"Cancelled\" could relate to access changes. Other categories are less specific and don't align with the primary context of a departing employee.\n\n\n"
