My process involves analyzing keywords to assign them to appropriate categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" or \"HR Support.\" The presence of terms such as \"leaver\" strongly suggests an \"HR Support\" classification.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm refining the classification of IT tickets. My current focus is on differentiating between \"HR Support\" and \"Hardware\" based on keywords. Terms like \"leaver,\" \"non starter,\" and \"re starter\" strongly indicate HR-related processes requiring IT involvement, while \"hardware allocation\" directly points to hardware provisioning.\n\n**Categorizing Employee Lifecycle Events**\n\nI'm continuing to refine my thought process for ticket categorization. My focus is now on the interplay between employee lifecycle events and specific IT actions, particularly concerning hardware. The keywords \"leaver,\" \"non starter,\" and \"re starter\" indicate scenarios that necessitate IT involvement, with \"hardware allocation\" pointing directly towards the \"Hardware\" category. I am leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the primary classification given the explicit mention.\n\n**Focusing on Hardware Allocation**\n\nI'm continuing to refine my thoughts on ticket categorization. My analysis of the recent input emphasizes \"hardware allocation\" as a key phrase. While \"leaver,\" \"non starter,\" and \"re starter\" indicate employee lifecycle events, the explicit mention of hardware suggests \"Hardware\" as the most fitting primary classification.\n\n"
