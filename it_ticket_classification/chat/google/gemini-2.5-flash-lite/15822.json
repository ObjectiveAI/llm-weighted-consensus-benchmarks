Despite the presence of \"order,\" the repeated mention of \"cord extender\" strongly suggests a hardware need. The user appears to require a physical extension solution for their workspace. I'm confident that \"Hardware\" is the most accurate categorization for this request, as it directly addresses the user's primary concern.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Optimal Category**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's text, focusing on the repeated \"cord extender\" references and the physical nature of the user's issue. Despite the presence of \"order,\" the core of the request is a hardware solution. I'm now certain that the best categorization for this ticket is \"Hardware,\" as it accurately reflects the user's need. I'm currently constructing the output in JSON format, ensuring the \"category\" key is properly assigned the value \"Hardware.\"\n\n\n"
