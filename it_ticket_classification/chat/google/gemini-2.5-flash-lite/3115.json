The ticket's content, mentioning \"oracle time tracking,\" \"leaver,\" and \"leaving,\" strongly suggests a need for HR Support. While other categories might be relevant in different contexts, HR Support seems most appropriate based on the current information. I am moving forward with this assumption.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on the ticket's core issue: an employee's departure and inability to submit their timecard. \"Leaver\" is a keyword. While access is a factor, the primary issue stems from the employee's departure status. Therefore, \"HR Support\" appears to be the most accurate category, with \"Access\" a secondary consideration. The other categories seem irrelevant given the provided ticket details.\n\n\n**Focusing on Leaver Status**\n\nI'm now focusing on the core issue: the \"leaver\" status and its impact on timecard submission. While \"Access\" is a factor, the root problem is tied to the departing employee's account and access related to their departure. \"HR Support\" appears the best fit, as their access issues are due to their employment ending. Other categories are less relevant.\n\n\n"
