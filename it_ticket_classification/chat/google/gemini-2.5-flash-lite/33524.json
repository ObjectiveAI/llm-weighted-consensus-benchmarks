While \"new project oracle fusion\" might suggest an internal project, the explicit mention of \"purchase requests\" firmly places this ticket under the \"Purchase\" category.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket description, specifically looking at terms like \"new project oracle fusion\" and \"purchase requests.\" My focus is on selecting the most accurate category from the provided options.\n\n**Focusing on Purchase Requests**\n\nI've narrowed down the potential categories, and the recurring mention of \"purchase requests\" strongly suggests this ticket belongs under the \"Purchase\" category, even with the context of a new Oracle Fusion project.\n\n**Focusing on Core Request**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket's keywords, and while \"new project oracle fusion\" suggests an internal initiative, the explicit mention of \"purchase requests\" points strongly towards the \"Purchase\" category as the primary classification.\n\n**Focusing on Project Scope**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket's fragmented description. While \"purchase requests\" appear, the strong emphasis on \"new project oracle fusion,\" \"code created per application,\" and \"write client level reports\" leads me to categorize this as an \"Internal Project.\"\n\n**Focusing on Project Context**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the ticket's description. While \"purchase requests\" are mentioned, the strong indicators of \"new project oracle fusion,\" \"code created per application,\" and \"write client level reports\" suggest this falls under the broader \"Internal Project\" category, with purchase requests being a supporting detail.\n\n"
