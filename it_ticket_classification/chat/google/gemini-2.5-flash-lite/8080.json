I'm sifting through terms like \"cloud infrastructure,\" \"additions,\" and \"planning\" to see how they best match the available options, aiming for a precise classification.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently reviewing the provided IT ticket text, focusing on keywords like \"cloud infrastructure,\" \"additions,\" and \"planning\" to align them with the available categories. My aim is to precisely classify the request.\n\n**Classifying Infrastructure Updates**\n\nI'm currently assessing the IT ticket, focusing on the \"cloud infrastructure additions\" and general \"infrastructure additions\" mentioned. My analysis is leaning towards classifying this as an \"Internal Project\" given the context of infrastructure modification and planning, though \"Miscellaneous\" remains a fallback.\n\n**Updating Cloud Infrastructure Additions**\n\nI'm continuing my analysis of the IT ticket, focusing on the core phrases \"cloud infrastructure list additions\" and \"infrastructure additions.\" My current thought process is leaning towards classifying this as \"Miscellaneous\" due to the general nature of the request and the lack of explicit project context, though \"Internal Project\" is still a consideration for significant infrastructure modifications.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently working on classifying the IT ticket.
