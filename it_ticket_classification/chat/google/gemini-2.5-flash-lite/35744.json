The text is quite technical, referencing \"connection,\" which is pushing me towards a more specific, likely hardware or access-related, category rather than HR or miscellaneous.\n\n**Diagnosing Network Faults**\n\nI'm focusing on diagnosing the network fault described. The technical jargon about \"connection flapping,\" \"dual neighbor down/up,\" and \"expired line protocol\" strongly suggests a hardware issue with network interfaces or physical cabling. This points me towards classifying it as a \"Hardware\" problem.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm working on classifying this technical ticket. The detailed description of \"connection flapping,\" \"dual neighbor down/up,\" and \"expired line protocol\" strongly suggests a network infrastructure issue, leaning towards classifying it as a \"Hardware\" problem due to the nature of interface and protocol status changes.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm finalizing the classification for this IT ticket. The detailed technical descriptors such as \"connection flapping,\" \"dual neighbor down/up,\" and \"expired line protocol\" strongly indicate a network infrastructure issue, leading me to categorize it as \"Hardware\" due to the inherent link to physical network interfaces and their stability.\n\n"
