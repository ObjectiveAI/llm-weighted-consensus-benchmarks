The user reported an error while trying to delete an upcoming leave request, suggesting a problem with a self-service portal or HR system. I'm leaning away from \"Miscellaneous\" and considering \"HR Support\" as a more fitting classification for this operational error.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm currently refining the categorization of an IT ticket. The user reported an error while attempting to delete a leave request. After considering the available options, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate classification, as the issue directly relates to leave management functions.\n\n**Classifying Leave Error**\n\nI'm currently deciding on the best category for an IT ticket. The user encountered an error while trying to delete a leave request. After reviewing the available options, \"HR Support\" appears to be the most fitting classification given the nature of the issue.\n\n"
