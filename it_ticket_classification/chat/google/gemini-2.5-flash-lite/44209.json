While other categories might be considered, the specifics strongly suggest a hardware-related problem with the display device.\n\n\n**Determining the Root Cause**\n\nI've just finished analyzing the ticket, and the \"Hardware\" category seems the best fit. I've considered other options, but the symptoms of a black second monitor and lost video signal point directly to a hardware issue. The switch between desktop and laptop further supports this.\n\n\n"
