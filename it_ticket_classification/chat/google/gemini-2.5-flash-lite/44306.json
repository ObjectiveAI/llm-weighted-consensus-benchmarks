It seems vague, possibly relating to internship issues, not standard IT support. Delving deeper into the text, I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous,\" pending further clarity. It lacks technical specifics, making a definitive assignment difficult without more context.\n\n\n**Identifying the Root Cause**\n\nThe ticket's phrasing is still a bit ambiguous. While \"internship period\" clearly points towards HR, it could be a system access problem tied to the internship. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" for now, but considering \"Access\" as a secondary possibility. The core issue seems related to duration or access privileges linked to the internship. Further context could solidify the proper classification.\n\n\n**Confirming the Classification**\n\nI'm now fully committed to classifying this ticket under \"HR Support.\" The \"internship period\" phrase is the key. The \"problem with over days\" strongly suggests a query about internship duration or related access, making HR the most likely party to handle the issue. No other category accurately captures the core concern.\n\n\n"
