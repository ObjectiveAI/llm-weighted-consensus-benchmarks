After a closer look, the keywords \"memory extension\" and \"additional memory\" suggest this falls under Storage. I am weighing that against the other choices, but the emphasis on memory usage makes Storage seem the most fitting. I'll need to confirm this.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Best Fit**\n\nI've re-evaluated the category, and \"Hardware\" is the strongest fit. Although \"Storage\" seemed plausible initially because of the memory focus, the core request centers on expanding RAM. \"Hardware\" is a more precise category for this request, and \"memory extension\" indicates physical hardware modification. I'm satisfied this is the most accurate classification.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Optimal Group**\n\nI've re-reviewed the ticket text. While initial thoughts considered \"Storage,\" the consistent emphasis on \"memory extension,\" \"expand memory,\" and \"additional memory\" strongly points to RAM upgrades. \"Hardware\" is the most apt category. It encompasses the physical nature of the request, making it a better fit than \"Storage,\" which could be broader. The JSON response is ready.\n\n\n"
