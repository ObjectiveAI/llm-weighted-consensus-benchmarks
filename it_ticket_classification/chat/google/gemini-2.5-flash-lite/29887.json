I've analyzed the ticket text, noting the strong indicators of HR involvement due to probation completion and role changes. I'm now weighing the closest fit amongst the options.\n\n**Finalizing HR Support Category**\n\nI've determined that the IT ticket strongly aligns with \"HR Support\" due to explicit mentions of probation completion and role changes, making it the most accurate classification.\n\n"
