Access seems like the most fitting category, given the nature of the request.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Access Request**\n\nI've been evaluating the optimal category for this ticket, and the available data leans heavily toward \"Access.\" The key phrases consistently suggest account deactivation and permission removal. While HR involvement is implied, the ticket's core focus is the technical execution of revoking access, making \"Access\" the most accurate categorization. I've ruled out other categories like \"Hardware\" and \"Storage\" because they are unrelated.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Scenario**\n\nThe focus remains on categorizing the IT ticket. I've re-examined the available options in light of the \"leaver\" context and emphasized \"Access\" as the prime candidate. I considered and eliminated other categories like \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative Rights\" due to their broader scope and indirect relevance. The phrases strongly point to account deactivation, and the associated actions fall squarely into access management.\n\n\n"
