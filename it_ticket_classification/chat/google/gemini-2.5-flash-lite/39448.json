My initial analysis indicates it falls outside of hardware, storage, or purchase categories. I'm leaning toward either HR Support or a more generalized 'Miscellaneous' tag. The specific mention of annual leave and the nature of the issue will guide my final categorization. I am double-checking to determine the best choice from the available list.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Context**\n\nI've determined the ticket pertains to HR support. The detailed review of its contents confirms the subject matter aligns closely with leave management within HR systems. Specifically, it involves the submission, notification, approval process for annual leave. These are all HR-related functions, and therefore, categorizing it as \"HR Support\" is the most fitting.\n\n\n"
