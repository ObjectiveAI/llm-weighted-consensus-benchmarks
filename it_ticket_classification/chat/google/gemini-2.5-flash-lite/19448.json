Initial assessment suggests \"Purchase\" might be relevant, given the mention of \"purchased.\" \"Installation\" indicates a potential \"Hardware\" angle. \"Mandatory\" could lean towards \"Administrative Rights\" or \"Internal Project\". I'll weigh all possibilities.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nThe ticket's keywords suggest a \"Purchase\" focus, especially with \"new po\" and \"purchased\" clearly indicating a buying action. While \"deep cool\" hints at \"Hardware\" and \"installation\" too, the core issue is the purchase process itself. The ticket's content doesn't lean towards \"Administrative Rights\" or \"Internal Project\" this time. Therefore, \"Purchase\" seems to be the most fitting classification based on the latest review.\n\n\n**Confirming Purchase Category**\n\nThe latest analysis solidifies \"Purchase\" as the primary ticket classification. While \"Hardware\" is a secondary consideration given \"deep cool\" and installation, the core action described revolves around the purchase order and receiving the item. The keywords and associated phrases confirm \"Purchase\" as the most suitable category.\n\n\n"
