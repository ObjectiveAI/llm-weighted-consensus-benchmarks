With keywords like \"leaver\" and \"mobile phone,\" I'm leaning towards classifying it under a more specific umbrella than just \"Hardware.\" The focus is on the management of a user's departure, particularly concerning their mobile services.\n\n**Assigning Mobile Leaver Tickets**\n\nI'm currently determining the best category for a ticket involving a departing employee and their mobile phone. Considering the keywords and available options, \"Hardware\" seems the most appropriate to capture the management of the device itself as part of the offboarding process.\n\n**Assigning Leaver's Mobile**\n\nI'm currently categorizing an IT ticket concerning a departing employee and their mobile phone. Given the provided options, I've identified \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category to encompass the management of the device during the offboarding process.\n\n"
