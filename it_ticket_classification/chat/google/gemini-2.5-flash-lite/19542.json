The text heavily features \"switch configuration,\" and mentions \"switch.\"  I'm leaning towards \"Hardware,\" but I will review the other categories for any potential overlap.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket.  The switch configuration and installation details suggest hardware, but the prominent \"PO\" and related purchase details make \"Purchase\" the primary category.  I'm now leaning heavily towards \"Purchase\" because it encapsulates the financial aspect more accurately than the pure technical side. I'll need to confirm that this is the best fit.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Purchase Details**\n\nI've made a final category selection. After considering both \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase,\" the PO details and cost specifics made \"Purchase\" the most accurate fit. It's clear the core of the ticket revolves around the ordering and procurement process. The configuration/installation will be handled after the items are received, so \"Purchase\" encompasses the primary focus.\n\n\n"
