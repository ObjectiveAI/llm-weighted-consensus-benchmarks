The constant mention of \"file share access\" and \"access to\" in the ticket content strongly points towards \"Access.\" I'm confident that this is the most relevant and accurate classification.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've just concluded my analysis and have decisively landed on \"Access\" as the ideal categorization. The pervasive references to \"file share access\" and granting access leave no room for doubt. Though \"Storage\" could be considered tangentially, the core issue is fundamentally about gaining *access*, solidifying my final classification.\n\n\n"
