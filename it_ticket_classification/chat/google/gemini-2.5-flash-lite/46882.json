I am analyzing the ticket details to determine if it pertains to Hardware, Access, or another relevant area.\n\n**Refining Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've analyzed the IT ticket and pinpointed that the core issue revolves around authentication failures and connection problems preventing application access. Based on this, I'm assigning it to the \"Access\" category as it most accurately reflects the user's blockers.\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Classification**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the ticket's details, confirming that the issues described \u2013 connection failures and authentication roadblocks preventing application access \u2013 squarely fall under the \"Access\" category. This classification accurately represents the user's immediate need and the nature of their blockers.\n\n"
