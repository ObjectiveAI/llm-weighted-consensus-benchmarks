Initial analysis indicates the provided text leans heavily towards an HR support category. The keywords strongly suggest a new employee setup scenario, justifying the initial HR focus. I'm focusing on validating this assumption against other keywords to establish a robust categorization system.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the central issue: onboarding a new employee. While access setup is likely involved, the root of the request stems from HR's need to facilitate this new hire. The \"new starter\" theme is consistent, the keywords are related to an employee's process to start work, so the best fit is definitely HR Support. I'm prioritizing the main *purpose* of the ticket rather than potential secondary actions.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Focus**\n\nI've been examining the keywords, specifically \"new starter\" and \"joining,\" which clearly point towards an onboarding process. While access is a likely outcome, I'm focusing on the *purpose* of the ticket, which is facilitating the new employee's entry, rather than a subsequent action. Comparing all the categories, HR Support is the most appropriate.\n\n\n"
