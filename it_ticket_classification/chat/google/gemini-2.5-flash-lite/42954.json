It's a storage issue prompting a user request for more space. I'm leaning toward \"Storage\" as the primary category, but I'll make a note that it's user-driven and might also touch on an admin's role. Perhaps I could add a secondary tag too.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Ticket Content**\n\nI've carefully examined the ticket. The core issue is undeniably storage; the mailbox's capacity is the central point. The user seeks more space and proposes deletion as a solution. Based on the available categories, \"Storage\" is the most precise descriptor. I will now create the output.\n\n\n"
