The text mentions \"upgrade,\" \"install,\" and \"push,\" which seem related to system updates. I'm leaning toward either \"Hardware\" or \"Internal Project,\" but I need to consider the context more carefully to determine the best fit. I'll need to examine if this is a general system update that affects everyone or part of a more focused internal project to narrow it down.\n\n\n**Defining the Project Scope**\n\nThe \"Internal Project\" classification seems most accurate, given the phrases \"upgrade automatically pushed assets\" and \"remaining locations two weeks.\" This clearly describes a scheduled system-wide initiative. I've eliminated other categories, such as \"Miscellaneous,\" as too vague and the others as completely unrelated to the core request.\n\n\n"
