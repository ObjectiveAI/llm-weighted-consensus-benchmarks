Initially, \"Access\" seemed likely due to \"rights,\" but I'm now cross-referencing this with other potential matches. It appears to strongly relate to access rights, so I'm finalizing that category. I'm taking the keywords into consideration to support this conclusion.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Administrative Access**\n\nI've decided to prioritize \"Administrative rights\" over \"Access.\" The keywords clearly point towards elevated permissions for editing and downloading, which aligns better with administrative functions. Although access is a good match, \"Administrative rights\" specifies the type of access needed. I'm confident in this choice.\n\n\n**Defining Administrative Access**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Administrative rights\" as the correct category, with \"Access\" as a fallback. The focus on editing and downloading, specifically for leadership, solidifies the requirement for permissions beyond standard user access. I'm prioritizing \"Administrative rights\" based on the implications of elevated control.\n\n\n"
