I'll need to confirm that this is indeed the best fit.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Ticket Text**\n\nI've further analyzed the ticket text: \"request for second monitor friday october pm second monitor hi starting moving tower please provide monitor similar had tower thank test lead.\" The mention of \"second monitor\" and \"tower\" solidified my initial \"Hardware\" categorization. The request is clearly for physical equipment. I've ruled out all other categories, as they do not apply to this request.\n\n\n"
