However, I'm still considering all other categories to ensure the best possible match.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Hardware's Relevance**\n\nMy analysis concluded that \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category. I assessed all options based on their relationship to \"network connection issues\". While \"Access\" had a slight potential link, \"Hardware\" directly addresses the core problem. The description strongly implies issues with network infrastructure or network components. Therefore, I settled on this one.\n\n\n"
