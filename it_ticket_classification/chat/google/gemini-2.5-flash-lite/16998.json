Given the options, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the most relevant category. It doesn't seem to be a hardware, HR, storage, purchase, project, or administrative rights issue. I'm focusing on the nature of the request, which seems to revolve around access control for a meeting room.\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Requirements**\n\nI've solidified my thoughts on the ticket's category. The key here is access restriction; the user wants to limit who can use these rooms. Considering this and the available options, \"Access\" is the most fitting. I'm confident in my categorization, as all aspects of the ticket point toward managing who can enter the restricted meeting rooms. This is now closed.\n\n\n"
