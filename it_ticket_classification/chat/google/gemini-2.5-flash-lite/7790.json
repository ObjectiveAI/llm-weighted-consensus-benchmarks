My initial thought is to associate this with either \"Internal Project\" or \"Purchase\", though further analysis is needed to differentiate between the two. The \"new\" aspect suggests a project initiation, but the scope remains unclear.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. While \"Internal Project\" still seems fitting, the focus on \"oracle and pas created\" and the mention of \"excel files\" and \"data management\" lead me to lean towards \"Access\". This category encompasses the system setup aspects, data access, and user permissions that are likely needed for these new projects. However, I want to clarify with the user if the primary intent is access provision or the overarching project itself.\n\n\n**Clarifying Project Scope**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category. The details about \"oracle and pas created\" and the need for accurate customer names strongly suggest project setup and data management tasks. The mention of \"excel files\" and the \"weekend planning analyst\" further reinforce the idea of a structured internal project. My analysis leads me to the conclusion that this request centers on the initial phase of these \"new projects,\" rather than access provisioning or purchasing.\n\n"
