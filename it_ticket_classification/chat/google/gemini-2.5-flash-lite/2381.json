I've identified \"new purchase\" and \"PO.\" My initial thought is to categorize this under \"Purchase,\" but I'll need to consider other factors within the ticket's text to determine if a different category is more appropriate, and to confirm this is not an internal project.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"Purchase\" category, given the prevalence of purchase-related keywords: \"new purchase,\" \"PO,\" \"ordered,\" and \"receive item.\" The ticket also references \"receipts,\" which supports the purchasing theme. While \"Hardware\" is possible, it's less direct than the overarching \"Purchase\" context. I am considering potential connections to other categories.\n\n\n**Defining Purchase Focus**\n\nI've examined the ticket's text and, after reviewing keywords like \"new purchase,\" \"PO,\" \"ordered,\" and \"receive item,\" I've confirmed that \"Purchase\" is the ideal category. The consistent mention of \"receipts\" further reinforces this. While \"Hardware\" is a possibility, the overall context strongly favors the broader \"Purchase\" category, encompassing the entire transaction.\n\n\n"
