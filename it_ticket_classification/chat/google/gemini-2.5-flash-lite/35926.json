Parsing this string, I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" due to the mention of \"absences,\" but the brevity makes the call tricky. I'm also assessing if other keywords within the categories could provide further clues.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Context**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"HR Support\" as the most likely category. The repeated \"absences\" is a key indicator. Additionally, the request to \"extract\" or \"display\" data, likely pertaining to absences, further strengthens this classification. I'm moving forward with this assumption, but I'll remain open to re-evaluating if more information emerges or the provided text gets updated.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Scope**\n\nI've refined the categorization to \"HR Support\" based on the ticket's text. The recurring \"absences\" leaves little doubt, and the request for data \"extraction\" further solidifies this choice. The focus now is on confirming this through contextual understanding, since the message implies someone will have to dig into text filters, potentially to pull data.\n\n\n"
