I'm leaning toward this category, but need to consider the context of migration. The repetition of \"documentation migrated\" supports the \"Internal Project\" classification. However, I will remain open to alternate considerations.\n\n\n**Narrowing Access Considerations**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Access\" as the primary category. The initial analysis of \"project documentation migrated\" led to a potential \"Internal Project\" classification. However, the additional details regarding \"issues accessing site\" and \"change permission levels\" clearly indicate an access issue. The user is struggling to get at important documentation, so \"Access\" seems to encompass both the storage and the access-permission side of this. This is looking good.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Issue**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on the core problem: getting to the migrated documentation.  While \"Storage\" played a role, \"Access\" is clearly the winner. The user's inability to find spreadsheets and their need for permission changes seals the deal.  Now, I'm confident in classifying this ticket.\n\n\n"
