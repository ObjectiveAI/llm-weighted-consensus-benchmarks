Given the text \"oracle time cards cards dear please help with below seems\", I'm leaning toward either \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" because of the mention of \"time cards\". I am still analyzing the verbiage to make the best choice.\n\n\n**Evaluating HR Support Need**\n\nI've reviewed the provided ticket text and further clarified the category options. The phrase \"oracle time cards\" strongly suggests an HR-related system. The user's description of doubled cards and the request to delete them clearly points to a data issue within the time card system, which falls squarely within the purview of \"HR Support.\" I'm confident in categorizing this ticket accordingly.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've closely analyzed the provided text and considered each category option. The mention of \"oracle time cards\" coupled with the data duplication issue solidifies my decision. The user requires assistance with a time card system, which directly falls under the umbrella of HR Support. I am thus finalizing the categorization of the IT ticket as \"HR Support\".\n\n\n"
