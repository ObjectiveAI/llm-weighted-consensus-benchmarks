The phrase \"non starter\" and the mention of \"New Jersey Friday July PM\" seem irrelevant to the categorization.  I'm focusing on keywords to determine the problem area, and the short nature of the description makes this a challenge. I need more information.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Categories**\n\nOkay, I've filtered the initial options and I'm leaning heavily towards HR Support. The keywords \"starter form,\" \"joining,\" and \"hired replacement\" are dead giveaways. While \"access\" *could* be involved in onboarding, the core issue seems to be HR-related processes. The mention of \"cost center form\" further solidifies this direction. This is coming together well, despite the messy input text. I feel confident I can categorize this with the next step.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, focusing on the core problem. The repetitions of \"starter form\" and \"joining\" are clearly central, pointing towards an onboarding issue. \"Hired replacement\" also solidifies this direction. Access is still a potential aspect, but HR process seems the dominant theme.\n\n\n"
