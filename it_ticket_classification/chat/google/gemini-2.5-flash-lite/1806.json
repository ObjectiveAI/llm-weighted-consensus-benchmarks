My focus is on matching keywords and context to one of the established enums: [\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", \"Administrative rights\"].\n\n**Determining Employee Offboarding Category**\n\nI'm zeroing in on the most accurate classification for the IT tickets. The frequent mentions of \"leaver form,\" \"leaving date,\" and managing associated accounts and rights strongly indicate an employee offboarding scenario. I'm evaluating whether this falls under \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" primarily.\n\n**Refining Offboarding Category**\n\nI've refined my categorization focus. While \"Access\" is definitely relevant due to account and rights management, the explicit \"leaver form\" and \"leaving date\" point more strongly towards \"HR Support\" as the primary classification for this employee offboarding scenario.\n\n**Identifying IT Ticket Focus**\n\nI'm currently reviewing the provided IT ticket text. My primary goal is to determine the most suitable category from the available options: [\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", \"Administrative rights\"]. I'm focusing on the recurring themes related to an employee's departure.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"HR Support\" category due to the recurring explicit mentions of \"leaver form\" and \"leaving date,\" as these clearly indicate an employee offboarding process initiation, which is typically overseen by HR.\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI'm currently prioritizing \"HR Support\" as the primary category. The repeated mentions of \"leaver form\" and \"leaving date\" strongly suggest the initiation of an employee offboarding process, which typically falls under HR's purview.\n\n**Categorizing Leaver Ticket**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket to determine its primary classification. The repeated mention of \"leaver form\" and \"leaving date\" strongly indicates an employee departure process, leading me to prioritize \"HR Support\" as the most fitting category.\n\n**Categorizing Leaver Ticket**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the IT ticket text.
