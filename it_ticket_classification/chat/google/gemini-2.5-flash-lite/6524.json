I see \"approve requisition\" repeatedly, suggesting a potential tie to \"Purchase,\" but \"monitors\" could point toward \"Hardware.\" I'm weighing these two, and I'm also considering other possibilities to ensure accuracy. My focus now is honing in on the most fitting category, even if multiple apply.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests the ticket falls under \"Purchase.\" Though \"Hardware\" has merit due to \"monitors,\" the core issue is requisition approval. I've ruled out all other categories based on the provided text analysis, especially \"Administrative Rights\" which is not a factor.  Therefore, \"Purchase\" aligns perfectly with the requisition and ordering process.\n\n\n"
