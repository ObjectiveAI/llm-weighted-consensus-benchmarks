I've broken down the keywords and terms used in the access request to determine its core function. There are several mentions of \"library\" and \"access\" which is suggesting a category of either access or storage. I'm leaning toward Access, since the user is requesting specific access, and the description does not mention the need for purchasing storage.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Scope**\n\nCurrently, I'm trying to narrow down the ticket's category from \"Access\" and \"Storage\". The ticket description repeatedly mentions \"library\" and \"site,\" indicating a platform for storing and sharing information. The language around collaboration, working together, and information sharing suggests the primary function is indeed access to these resources. The repeated \"access request\" strengthens the argument for focusing on the Access category. While storage is also relevant, it seems secondary to the user's need for access to information.\n\n\n**Reiterating Access Relevance**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the initial category assessment, considering the abundance of access-related language in the ticket. While \"Storage\" remains pertinent due to \"central storage\" mentions, the request's core is getting access to the collaboration tools. It seems the user isn't directly seeking *storage*, but rather requesting permissions to utilize those resources for team interaction and information sharing. This repeated emphasis on \"access request\" further solidifies the \"Access\" category as the most appropriate choice.\n\n\n"
