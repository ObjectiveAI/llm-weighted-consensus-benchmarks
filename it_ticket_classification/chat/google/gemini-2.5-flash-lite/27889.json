My focus is on deciphering the core issue to select from the available options like Hardware, HR Support, or Access.\n\n**Classifying IT Tickets**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket text and identified keywords pointing strongly towards access management. The phrases \"granted members site,\" \"delete access,\" and \"assigning key person members delete add docs\" all solidify this classification. Therefore, I'm confident the appropriate category is \"Access.\"\n\n**Refining Access Classification**\n\nMy recent analysis confirms that the ticket text heavily leans towards access management. Phrases like \"granted members site\" and \"delete access,\" coupled with the mention of \"assigning key person members delete add docs,\" solidify my decision. I am confident classifying this under \"Access.\"\n\n"
