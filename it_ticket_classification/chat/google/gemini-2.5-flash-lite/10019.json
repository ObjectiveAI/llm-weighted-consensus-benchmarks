Initial analysis leans towards \"Hardware\" due to mentions of \"workstation\", \"monitor\", and \"cable\". I will explore the text for other contextual clues to confirm this assessment. I'm looking at potential negative keywords now to rule out any other categories.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Cable Request**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text with the available categories in mind. While \"Purchase\" was considered, the focus is on provisioning hardware. I've ruled out all other options, confirming \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate category based on the cable request, workstation upgrade, and monitor connection references. My assessment is now complete.\n\n\n**Defining Hardware Context**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text: \"cable request cable hello recently had workstation upgraded model cable order plug monitor please help regards\". The focus is undoubtedly hardware-related. The cable request, workstation upgrade, and monitor connection all strongly point towards the \"Hardware\" category. While \"Purchase\" was considered, the emphasis is on the physical hardware needed for setup, not the procurement process. All other categories are irrelevant based on the provided information. I am happy with my final assessment.\n\n\n"
