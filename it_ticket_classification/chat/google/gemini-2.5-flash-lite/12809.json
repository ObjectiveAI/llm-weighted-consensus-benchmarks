After a quick look, the terms \"card leaver\" and \"tower\" make me lean towards either \"Access\" or \"Hardware\". I'll analyze the details further to ensure the most accurate classification.\n\n\n**Assessing Access Requirements**\n\nI'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the primary category. The phrase \"card leaver\" is a strong indicator of access control or revocation, possibly related to physical access or system access tied to an access card. This seems to be the main point of the ticket. The additional context around confidentiality further strengthens this categorization, as access control is essential for maintaining information security. I will confirm this by further review.\n\n\n**Reviewing Ticket Context**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the ticket's language, considering the various keywords. The phrase \"card leaver\" continues to be a central focus, as the implication seems directly related to either physical or system access control. The mention of confidentiality reinforces this, as access management is essential for preserving data security. I am currently honing in on \"Access\" as the primary categorization.\n\n\n"
