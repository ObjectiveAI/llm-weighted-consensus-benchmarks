                    "reasoning": "**Defining Categorization Logic**\n\nI'm currently focused on defining the categorization logic for the IT ticket. I've analyzed the text \"to project on shared folder thursday pm va ii la si shared folder conform design lead ext\" and am considering the keywords and their potential mappings to the provided categories. I'm leaning toward \"Storage\" due to the mention of \"shared folder,\" but also considering \"Access\" because of the possible permission-related implications of the wording. My goal is to create a robust rule that's accurate and efficient for this and similar tickets.\n\n\n**Revising Category Priorities**\n\nI've revised the categorization priorities after further analysis. While \"Access\" and \"Internal Project\" are potential options, the phrase \"shared folder\" appears to strongly favor the \"Storage\" category. I am now refining the rules to better capture the specific nuance of \"shared folder\" requests, and am comparing the text against the examples provided to ensure a robust classification.\n\n\n**Analyzing Category Relevance**\n\nI've further analyzed the text and am solidifying my categorization approach. The mention of \"shared folder\" remains central, definitively guiding me toward \"Storage.\" I'm now fine-tuning rules to discern whether the \"project\" aspect warrants an additional category. The emphasis is on the storage mechanism, though the project context is acknowledged. This will ensure my rule is precise.\n\n\n**Determining the Primary Category**\n\nI'm now honing in on the most fitting category, given the ambiguity of the text. While \"Access\" and \"Internal Project\" are still in consideration, the central phrase \"shared folder\" continues to strongly steer me toward \"Storage.\" I'm carefully analyzing the nuances of the phrasing to decide if \"Access\" or \"Internal Project\" might merit a secondary categorization. The aim is to create a decision that accounts for the potential double meaning of the ticket text and categorize the text appropriately.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm now carefully distinguishing between \"Storage\" and \"Access.\" The \"project on shared folder\" wording strongly implies Storage, as it describes the fundamental resource being requested or utilized. While access is inherently part of using a shared folder, the ticket's focus appears to be on the storage medium itself. I will therefore classify it as \"Storage\".\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've carefully considered the nature of the request, prioritizing clarity in the category selection. While \"Access\" and \"Internal Project\" remain in the back of my mind as possible secondary associations, the term \"shared folder\" is now clearly driving the choice towards \"Storage.\"  The ticket's emphasis is not on accessing the folder *per se*, but on utilizing it as the fundamental storage element for the project. Thus, \"Storage\" is the best primary fit.\n\n\n**Defining Initial Categorization**\n\nI'm now prioritizing \"Storage\" as the main category. While \"Access\" is still considered, the phrase \"shared folder\" strongly indicates a storage-related request. My revised rules will focus on capturing the nuances of storage allocation.\n\n\n"
