The user's request, however, seems related to a specific user change request, which could be access or administrative rights, which are available options. I'm leaning towards \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but need more context to refine this further.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Categories**\n\nMy focus is now on the most suitable category for this ticket. The phrases \"maternity leave\" and \"change pm code\" are key. After initial analysis, I've eliminated \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase.\" The \"PM code\" suggests both \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights,\" but the explicit mention of maternity leave strongly points towards \"HR Support.\" It seems the user is requesting an update to access or configuration due to a personnel change.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Origin**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best fit for this ticket. The \"PM code\" alteration stemming from maternity leave keeps directing me toward \"HR Support\". While changing a \"PM code\" could imply access or administrative rights, the root cause--maternity leave-- makes \"HR Support\" the better option. The user's request is a consequence of an HR event, not just an access modification.\n\n\n"
