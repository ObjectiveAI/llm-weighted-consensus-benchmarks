After careful examination of the text provided, I am leaning towards \"Access,\" as \"git\" often pertains to access control and repository management. The other terms, \"sonar\" and \"members\", reinforce this conclusion. I am now confirming to ensure there is no other possibility.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the text and am strongly inclined towards \"Access\" as the appropriate category. The prominent presence of terms like \"git repository,\" \"sonar,\" and \"members\" points towards issues related to user permissions and access control within the development environment. I'm actively comparing this option with the other available categories to ensure it's the most accurate fit and considering the implications of the \"instance\" keyword in relation to access configurations.\n\n\n**Assigning Ticket Priority**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and the available categories. The keywords \"git repository,\" \"sonar,\" and \"members\" all point toward access-related concerns. Specifically, managing user permissions within the \"git repository\" and \"sonar\" environments aligns with the \"Access\" category. While \"Internal Project\" is a possibility, the core issue seems to be about granting or restricting access, rather than the project's overall management. Therefore, I am confident that \"Access\" is the most appropriate choice. I'm now verifying my selection before finalizing the priority.\n\n\n"
