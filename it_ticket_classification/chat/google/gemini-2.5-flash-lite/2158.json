Therefore, I'm leaning toward the \"HR Support\" category, as the primary concern appears to be an HR process.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's text, focusing on the user's request. While there's a mention of the computer and developer, the key element is the employee leaving for maternity leave. This strongly indicates an HR-related issue.  I'm confident in categorizing it under \"HR Support.\" The \"computer\" mention appears ancillary to the main concern.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating the Options**\n\nI'm now thoroughly reviewing the category choices, especially in light of the new information. \"HR Support\" still feels like the strongest contender, given the employee's maternity leave and the linked computer asset. The \"computer\" mention complicates things a bit, but is likely a resource hand-off connected with the leave. It's not the primary issue.\n\n\n"
