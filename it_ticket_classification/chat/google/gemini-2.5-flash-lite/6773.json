My process involves analyzing the provided text and mapping it to the appropriate category like \"Hardware\" or \"Access\". I'm making progress in understanding the required mappings, but I need to refine the logic to handle the nuances of the requests. I'm building out a system for classifying common requests, to improve accuracy.\n\n\n**Defining Appropriate Category**\n\nMy initial analysis suggests the \"Storage\" category best fits the ticket's focus. The keywords point strongly towards data backup, management of virtual machines, and potentially decommissioning, all core aspects of storage management. While \"Miscellaneous\" is a fallback, I'm confident \"Storage\" provides a more precise classification given the emphasis on backup and related data operations.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Request**\n\nMy analysis now focuses on the \"Storage\" category, given the ticket's emphasis on data backup, virtual machine management, and decommissioning. I've considered other categories, but \"Storage\" best encapsulates the core functions requested. I've begun to build the categorization logic by prioritizing actions, like data backup or removal, to determine the most appropriate class.\n\n\n**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI've determined that the \"Storage\" category is the best fit for this IT ticket. The request's main focus is data backup, virtual machine management, and decommissioning or deletion of data, all of which are primary functions of storage. My focus is now on implementing the classification logic, ensuring these keywords lead directly to the \"Storage\" category. I am refining my model to account for these specific nuances.\n\n\n"
