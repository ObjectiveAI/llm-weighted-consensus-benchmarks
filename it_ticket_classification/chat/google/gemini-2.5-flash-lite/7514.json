My focus is on its description, aiming to assign it to the most fitting category from the list provided. Keywords like \"annual leave\" and \"administration officer\" are helping me narrow down the options.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm refining the categorization of this IT ticket. After considering keywords like \"annual leave\" and \"administration officer,\" I've concluded that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate classification. This decision stems from the core nature of annual leave as an HR function, even with surrounding technical context.\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the ticket description, weighing keywords like \"annual leave,\" \"administration officer,\" and \"upcoming.\" While technical terms like \"oracle\" and \"cod developer\" are present, the core intent revolves around HR processes. Therefore, I've confidently settled on \"HR Support\" as the most accurate classification, as annual leave administration is a direct HR function.\n\n"
