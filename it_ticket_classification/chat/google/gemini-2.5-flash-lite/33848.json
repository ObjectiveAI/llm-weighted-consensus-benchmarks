I'm leaning heavily towards \"Purchase\" as the dominant theme, but I'm checking to make sure it's the *only* relevant aspect. No other context clues are present.\n\n\n**Determining the Core Theme**\n\nI've just finished the deep dive on this ticket's content and found strong evidence leaning me to the \"Purchase\" category, as the phrases \"purchase request,\" and the recurrence of \"purch\" appear more than anything else. I am now confident this is the dominant theme of this particular ticket.\n\n\n"
