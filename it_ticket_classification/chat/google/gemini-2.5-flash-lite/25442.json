The repeated mention of \"change\" and \"november\" is a bit ambiguous, so I need to carefully interpret the context.  I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" since the text implies some sort of update or modification related to a project. However, the lack of specific IT-related terms makes this challenging.\n\n\n**Determining HR Relevance**\n\nI've shifted my focus to the HR aspect, since the details point to an employee leave request. The phrases like \"approve her vacation\" and \"review annual leave\" are quite telling. I'm now certain that the ticket falls under the category of \"HR Support\".\n\n\n"
