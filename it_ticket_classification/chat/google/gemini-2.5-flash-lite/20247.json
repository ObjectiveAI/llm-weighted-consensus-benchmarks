There's a request for a \"return back date\", which sounds like a personnel form. Based on this, I'm leaning toward the \"HR Support\" category as the most accurate fit. I'll need to double-check to make sure it's the best option.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Text**\n\nI've examined the ticket content further. \"New starter\" still points towards an onboarding process typically managed by HR, and the request for a \"return back date\" strongly suggests paperwork. While access might be needed, the core of the request seems to be about HR documentation, not direct access setup, solidifying \"HR Support\" as the primary category. I'm now certain this is the best fit.\n\n\n**Revisiting the Context**\n\nMy analysis of the ticket content continues. The phrase \"return back date\" still suggests some form being filled out, likely as part of the onboarding. While access and hardware might be indirectly related, the core request seems centered around the new employee's paperwork or forms. This strengthens the case for \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate category, rather than a more direct IT function. I'm confident in this choice now.\n\n\n"
