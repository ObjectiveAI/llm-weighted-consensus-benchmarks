Considering the options provided (\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", etc.), I believe \"Access\" is the most fitting category. This aligns with the user's inability to connect and gain access to the client.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Root Cause**\n\nThe ticket analysis now centers on the physical connection issues. While \"Access\" was initially considered due to the inability to connect, deeper inspection reveals the core problem is likely hardware or cabling. \"Hardware\" emerges as the most suitable category, as the client connection problem seems rooted in physical connectivity, not access permissions.\n\n\n"
