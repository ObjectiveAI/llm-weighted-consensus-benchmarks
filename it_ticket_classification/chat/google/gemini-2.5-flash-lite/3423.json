The text, \"new project pas and oracle hi guys tried raising via self afraid find relevant templates,\" seems to involve a new project and potential access issues.  I'm weighing the schema options of \"Access\" and \"Internal Project\" to find the best fit.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the possible categories. The phrase \"new project\" keeps standing out. I've ruled out Hardware, HR Support, Storage, and Purchase. Access is a possible, but the need for \"relevant features\" and \"code name\" leans me towards \"Internal Project\". The \"tried raising via self afraid find relevant templates\" part makes me think this project will deviate from the existing standard process.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text and all available categories. Keywords like \"new project,\" \"create relevant features,\" and \"code name\" definitely point towards an \"Internal Project.\" Although initial thought was on access, the context shifts more towards a new project and associated development. Furthermore, the request for assistance with features and code name solidifies the decision to categorize this as an \"Internal Project\". The \"pas and oracle\" components also strongly suggests that the ticket will require a development or system configuration effort, further solidifying this thought.\n\n\n"
