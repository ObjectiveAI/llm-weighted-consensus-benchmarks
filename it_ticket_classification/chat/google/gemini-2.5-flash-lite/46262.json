The text suggests an access issue related to a password change, but I need to be more precise. \"Access\" seems most relevant given the inability to log in, but I'm considering if \"HR Support\" could be relevant if password reset policies are involved. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" for now.\n\n\n**Narrowing Access Issue**\n\nI've refined my thinking, zeroing in on an access problem tied to password changes. The repeated \"cannot enter\" statements, particularly after the password reset, point directly to this. While administrative rights are a possibility, the core issue is the immediate inability to log in to Oracle. The text clearly indicates a failure in the login process following a password update. Therefore, I'm confident \"Access\" is the most fitting category.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the text to pinpoint the relevant IT ticket category. The recurring \"cannot enter\" phrases, particularly in conjunction with the password change and specifically regarding \"Oracle,\" firmly establishes the core issue as an **Access** problem. This is a direct login failure linked to a password update, and therefore the perfect fit.\n\n\n"
