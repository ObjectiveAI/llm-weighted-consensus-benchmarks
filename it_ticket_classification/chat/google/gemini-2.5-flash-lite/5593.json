I need to fit each text snippet into one of the following categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. So far, the text seems to relate to report access or details. I have \"career added to the reports\", \"added reports\" and \"reports prod details\" to classify.\n\n\n**Revising Category Assignments**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the initial category assignments, specifically focusing on the ticket texts mentioning \"reports\" and related actions. Considering the broader context of \"add adjustments\" and \"add column\" requests, I'm now leaning towards categorizing many of these under \"Miscellaneous\" or potentially \"Internal Project,\" depending on the nature of the requested changes and whether they represent new feature development or system configuration. The emergence of \"storage report\" clearly indicates \"Storage\". I'm still weighing the best fit for reports dealing with benefits; could be \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n**Analyzing Category Relevance**\n\nI'm now carefully analyzing the ticket text and their relevance to each category. The prominence of \"storage report\" strongly indicates the \"Storage\" category.  The recurring theme of adding columns and adjusting reports suggests a focus on data management and presentation, which could also fall under \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" I need to determine if these modifications relate to new feature development (Internal Project) or general IT system support (Miscellaneous), to decide the assignment.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Assignments**\n\nI'm now concluding the category assignments, with \"Storage\" being the most appropriate for this IT ticket text due to the frequent mentions of \"storage report\" and the overall focus on modifying and generating reports, which often relates to data storage and management. The phrase \"add column\" and adjustments further supports this categorization.\n\n\n"
