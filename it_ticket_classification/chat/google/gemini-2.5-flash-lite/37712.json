Keywords like \"error,\" \"submit,\" and \"approval\" are key. While \"Access\" is a possibility, the issue appears more procedural than access-related. I need to determine if \"Purchase\" or \"Internal Project\" is a better fit. Currently, it seems that the submission is linked to an internal process.\n\n\n**Identifying Root Cause**\n\nI've been going through the ticket's details again.  The key phrase \"needs be approved today but get error when try submit\" keeps jumping out. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Purchase\" because of the financial transaction and approval aspects, though \"Administrative rights\" is a potential secondary consideration if permissions are blocking the process.  The mention of \"costs\" solidifies \"Purchase\" as the primary categorization.\n\n\n**Revisiting Ticket Context**\n\nNow re-evaluating, the jumbled ticket text necessitates a deeper dive. While \"Purchase\" remains a strong contender due to the \"costs\" and \"approved\" clues, the specific error is still unclear. I'm focusing on \"update costs\" as a potential link to an accounting system or budgeting process, which is why \"Purchase\" still seems most accurate. \"Administrative rights\" is now less likely because the core issue appears procedural, not access-related. The \"error\" could stem from an incorrect form field related to purchase approval, or similar. The \"need approval by today\" deadline is also consistent with the concept of a purchasing request.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Refinement**\n\nNow, I'm integrating the new information and reconsidering the ticket's nuances. The \"urgent issue\" nature alongside the phrase \"update costs\" strengthens the \"Purchase\" link, especially given the deadline. I'm focusing on \"update costs\" in the context of a potential purchase order change requiring approval. The \"error\" is most likely related to the purchase submission, not a broader access issue.\n\n\n"
