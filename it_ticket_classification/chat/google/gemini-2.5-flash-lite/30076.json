After carefully reviewing the provided ticket content, I'm leaning towards a specific category, but I want to be certain before finalizing the classification. The options are quite broad, so I need to carefully consider the core issue presented in the text to make the right choice.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket Focus**\n\nI've been evaluating the ticket content, and while \"Internal Project\" is a possibility due to the PM change, I'm now leaning toward \"Administrative rights.\" The repeated requests for approval and the PM change seem to revolve around permissions and roles. This is a more precise fit than the broader \"Internal Project.\" I'm now cross-referencing this choice to be sure.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Focus**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket content, and the core issue revolves around changes to project management roles. The phrase \"change the project manager\" appears repeatedly, solidifying my understanding. Considering the provided schema, I've concluded that \"Internal Project\" is the most precise category. It aligns perfectly with the central theme of the ticket. Even though \"code issue\" is also mentioned, that is a minor component.\n\n\n"
