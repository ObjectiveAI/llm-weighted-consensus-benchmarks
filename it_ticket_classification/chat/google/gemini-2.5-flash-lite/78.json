The ticket details a critical router failure and mentions things like \"router module replacement,\" \"shipping a replacement router,\" and \"faulty hardware modules.\" These all strongly point to physical hardware issues and replacements.\n\n\n**Defining the Solution:**\n\nI've confidently solidified the \"Hardware\" category. The ticket's content is rife with keywords like \"router module,\" \"replacement,\" \"faulty hardware,\" and \"motherboard,\" all unequivocally signaling a physical hardware malfunction requiring replacement. My confidence in this categorization is rock-solid. Consequently, I will output the following JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"category\": \"Hardware\"\n}\n```\n\n\n"
