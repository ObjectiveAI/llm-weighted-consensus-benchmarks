My aim is to accurately pinpoint the core issue to facilitate the categorization. This may include filtering out terms that contribute little to the ticket's classification.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe initial focus on keyword extraction has evolved into analyzing the core problem. Identifying \"screen errors\" and \"display driver issues\" points clearly towards a \"Hardware\" category. Although software-related mentions exist, the primary issue manifesting is hardware-based. This categorization prioritizes the direct impact described in the ticket text over potential underlying causes.\n\n\n**Defining the Root Cause**\n\nThe analysis continues, with a focus on discerning the ticket's central problem. The phrase \"screen errors\" coupled with \"display driver issues\" highlights hardware-related malfunctions. While software aspects like \"docker\" and \"vagrant\" are mentioned, they're secondary to the core issue. I am choosing \"Hardware\" because it directly addresses the user's primary concern as stated.\n\n\n"
