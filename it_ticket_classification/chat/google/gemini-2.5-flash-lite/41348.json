The repeated mention of \"manager change\" is significant. I am considering how this context maps to the possible categories. I am also mindful of any further details that might sway my assessment.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Access Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the recurring \"access\" themes, and am now confident in assigning the ticket to the \"Access\" category. The manager change appears to be the indirect catalyst, but the core issue lies in permissions and access validation.  I've eliminated other categories. The user's goal of \"view tasks\" and \"log requests\" directly correlate with appropriate access.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Origin**\n\nI'm now certain the ticket belongs squarely in the \"Access\" category. The text consistently points towards permission issues and the need for access confirmation. Although the manager change initiates it, the root of the problem is access-related. I eliminated the other categories because they don't encompass the key concerns in the text.\n\n\n"
