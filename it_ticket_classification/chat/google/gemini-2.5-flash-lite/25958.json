So far, I've identified \"annual leave request\" as a key phrase. I also noted \"people\" in the text, which hints at an HR-related topic. I'm carefully weighing whether this is primarily an HR matter or if there are other angles to consider.\n\n\n**Identifying Optimal Category**\n\nI've examined the ticket content in detail and now feel confident the most appropriate category is \"HR Support.\" It's centered on \"annual leave requests,\" which aligns perfectly with HR processes. The phrases around approval and rejection, plus the roles of \"requestor\" and \"approver,\" further reinforce this conclusion. The other categories don't seem like they'd fit.\n\n\n"
