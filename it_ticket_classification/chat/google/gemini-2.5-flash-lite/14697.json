Given the repeated emphasis on cards, I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the most suitable category.  This seems to align with the provided text's central theme.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Text**\n\nI've further analyzed the ticket's text, focusing on the consistent references to cards and passes. The context strongly implies a need for physical entry and visitor authorization. I'm solidifying my assessment that \"Access\" is the most appropriate category. The recurring phrases related to obtaining these items supports this conclusion.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nI'm now fully confident that \"Access\" is the correct category. The consistent use of terms like \"cards,\" \"passes,\" and their direct relation to obtaining entry strongly points to this. After ruling out other options, \"Access\" is clearly the best fit for this IT request. The primary focus lies with physical entry, not any of the other categories.\n\n\n"
