My analysis of the keywords and context points towards a need to manage employee setups, potentially related to onboarding or system access, making \"HR Support\" a strong candidate.\n\n**Classifying Employee Setups**\n\nI've analyzed the provided ticket description, focusing on keywords like \"employees,\" \"setup,\" and \"employee ID.\" My current assessment strongly suggests that this pertains to user onboarding or management processes, making \"HR Support\" the most fitting category.\n\n**Confirming HR Support**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket description, noting the emphasis on \"employees,\" \"setup,\" and \"employee ID.\" My current assessment strongly indicates that the core issue relates to user provisioning or management processes, thus confirming \"HR Support\" as the most fitting category.\n\n"
