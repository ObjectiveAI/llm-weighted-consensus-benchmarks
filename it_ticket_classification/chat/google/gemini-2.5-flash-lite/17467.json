Initial analysis suggests a connection to onboarding, so I'm leaning toward HR Support or Access, though the lack of explicit system access requests is making me hesitant. I'm carefully weighing the available categories to make the most precise assignment.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Category**\n\nI've refined my thinking and landed on **HR Support** as the primary category. While initially considering Access, the emphasis on the new employee's onboarding, start date delay, and appointment leans heavily toward HR processes. It's about an employee starting, which involves HR. Access is certainly needed, but seems a secondary request based on the text. I've ruled out the other options because they didn't align with the provided ticket information.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Ticket Further**\n\nI'm now fully committed to **HR Support** as the appropriate category. My reasoning centers on the new employee's onboarding, which is the core of this ticket. While access will eventually be needed, the initial request revolves around scheduling, start dates, and paperwork, typical of HR processes. The content points directly to onboarding, and the ticket's emphasis is not on a technical issue. Access and hardware, for example, are a second level concern.\n\n\n"
