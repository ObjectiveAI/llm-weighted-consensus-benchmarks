I am parsing the wording to extract the key issue within the ticket, and trying to identify any potential keywords. The user's goal is to categorize the ticket, and the available categories are provided.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Options**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text, \"oracle from have not been approved none submitted have approved,\" and the potential categories. After considering each option, \"Access\" appears to be the most accurate fit. It aligns well with the \"not approved\" aspect of the ticket, which implies a request or process related to gaining access. My analysis leans toward \"Access,\" but I'm open to further refinement.\n\n\n**Revisiting the Choice**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket, \"oracle from have not been approved none submitted have approved,\" and the category options. Although \"Access\" still seems like the primary fit, the phrase \"none submitted\" adds a nuance. It hints at a possible problem with the submission process itself. This prompts me to consider whether the problem is with the access request's *creation* or the *approval* of the existing request. However, I believe \"Access\" still captures the core issue: the ultimate goal is gaining the ability to *access* something related to Oracle.\n\n\n"
