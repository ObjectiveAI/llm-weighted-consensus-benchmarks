I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Storage,\" but the mention of a \"new starter\" could also hint at \"HR Support.\" Need to weigh these factors.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've refined my initial analysis and discarded \"HR Support\" as the primary focus is IT-related. \"Storage\" is still on the table, but \"Access\" is looking increasingly suitable, especially given the \"file share\" and \"joiner\" context. I'm focusing now on confirming if access to the file share is the core issue for a new hire.\n\n\n**Confirming the Core Issue**\n\nI've honed in on \"Access\" as the prime category. While \"Storage\" is relevant, providing file share access is the central issue for this new employee. My analysis confirms the ticket focuses on granting access to IT resources, aligning directly with the \"Access\" category. I am prepared to apply this classification.\n\n\n"
