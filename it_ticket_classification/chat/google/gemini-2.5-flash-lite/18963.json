I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" or potentially \"Access\" depending on further context, but need to refine this.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm currently working on classifying the ticket. Based on the phrases \"unwanted calls\" and \"male voice he looking person,\" it doesn't appear to fit into Hardware, HR Support, Access, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative Rights. Miscellaneous is emerging as the most fitting category for these call-related, non-technical issues.\n\n"
