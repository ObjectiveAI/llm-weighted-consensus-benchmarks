The presence of \"new project\" and \"travel needed\" alongside \"form\" makes this somewhat complex. While \"Internal Project\" is a possibility, \"Miscellaneous\" might also be applicable if the form is not for the project, and is separate. I'm leaning toward the latter for now, though further analysis will be needed to be sure of the final classification.\n\n\n**Refining Classification Approach**\n\nI've decided to refine the category based on the ticket's keywords. The \"new project\" aspect seems to be the core, with travel and user assignment as supporting components. I considered that while the \"form\" details and \"add both users\" could lean towards access or HR, these are likely related to the overall project. With this in mind, I am confident that \"Internal Project\" is still the optimal categorization.\n\n\n"
