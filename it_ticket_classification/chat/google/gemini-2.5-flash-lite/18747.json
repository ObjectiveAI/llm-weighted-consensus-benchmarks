I am leaning towards \"Access\" as the primary category, while \"HR Support\" appears as a secondary consideration. The context clarifies that it concerns role-based permissions, not general administrative rights.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text, identifying \"approver change\" as the central action.  \"Oracle\" and \"approve times\" clearly point toward system access modifications. \"Recruiting\" is now less of a focus, making it evident that the request involves managing who has the authority to approve time within the Oracle system.  I've decided \"Access\" is the primary category.\n\n\n"
