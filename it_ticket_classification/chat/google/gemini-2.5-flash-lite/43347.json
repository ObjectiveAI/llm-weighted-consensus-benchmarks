The description mentions a \"new starter\" and \"imported successfully,\" which could indicate an access or HR-related issue. My goal is to select the most appropriate category from the given list: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights.\" This needs to be done with accuracy.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Issue**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the ticket description, particularly the phrase \"new starter.\"  While \"access\" is a possibility, my focus has shifted towards the initial onboarding process, which is often handled by HR. The \"imported successfully\" part may be related to user provisioning, but the overarching context points toward a new employee's setup. This leads me to lean toward \"HR Support\" as the primary category, with access-related tasks being a potential secondary concern.\n\n\n**Identifying the Root Cause**\n\nI'm now fully convinced that \"HR Support\" is the optimal category for this ticket. The key phrase \"new starter\" and the vagueness surrounding the \"imported successfully\" part further solidify this choice. After reviewing all the available options, I feel the \"new starter\" context takes precedence. While access might be a downstream concern, the root issue is almost certainly related to onboarding.\n\n\n"
