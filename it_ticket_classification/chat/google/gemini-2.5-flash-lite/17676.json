The text \"leaver for thursday pm two leavers hi forms two leavers were terminated effectively additional information please let best regards\" doesn't immediately suggest a clear category. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" due to the mention of \"leaver\" and \"terminated,\" but I want to be certain before I finalize the classification. I'm exploring if there are any subtle indicators of other categories.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Ticket**\n\nI've solidified my initial hunch. The keywords \"leaver\" and \"terminated\" are decisive. While the \"hi forms\" mention is ambiguous, it doesn't change the HR support context established. Therefore, I will categorize this ticket as \"HR Support\". I'm ready to proceed with the next task.\n\n\n"
