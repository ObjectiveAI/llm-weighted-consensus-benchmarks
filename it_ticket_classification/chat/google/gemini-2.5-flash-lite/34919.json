I'm weighing these to make the best classification.\n\n**Categorizing the Oracle Error**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the IT ticket, which describes an \"oracle error\" encountered while submitting an \"expense report.\" My focus is on determining the most appropriate category from the provided list to ensure it's routed effectively for resolution.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the IT ticket describing an \"oracle error\" in an \"expense report.\" My focus is on selecting the most fitting category from the provided options to ensure efficient routing for a resolution.\n\n**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI'm currently classifying an IT ticket.
