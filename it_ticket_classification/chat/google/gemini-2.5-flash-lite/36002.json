While storage is mentioned, the core problem articulated points strongly towards an \"Access\" categorization.\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI've reviewed the text and identified keywords indicating an \"access issue\" and concerns regarding Active Directory account deletion and document ownership. While storage is mentioned, the overarching theme points to access-related problems and user account management as the primary concern.\n\n"
