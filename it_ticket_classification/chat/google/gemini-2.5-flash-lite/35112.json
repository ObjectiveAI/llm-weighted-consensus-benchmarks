After analyzing the provided text snippet, I'm working to correctly classify it according to the pre-defined categories. The text \"issues encountered when trying\" is not offering much detail. Based on limited text, I can not yet confidently assign a category. I need more information to discern the nature of the issue.\n\n\n**Classifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've just finished evaluating the provided text. The phrase \"issues encountered when trying to submit timecards\" is key. My analysis of the text points towards \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category. The link between timecards and HR functions is very strong. I discounted \"Access\" because the problem centers on submission, not logging in. I am confident in this classification.\n\n\n"
