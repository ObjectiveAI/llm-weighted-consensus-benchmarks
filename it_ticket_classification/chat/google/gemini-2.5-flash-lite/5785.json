My primary goal is to reliably map input text to the predefined categories within the required JSON format. I'm actively considering different text analysis techniques to improve the accuracy of category assignments and reduce ambiguous results.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text from the IT ticket, particularly the keywords \"leaver,\" \"mailbox,\" and \"ad rights,\" to pinpoint the primary category. While \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" are relevant, the context leans heavily towards \"HR Support,\" as the ticket describes tasks tied to employee departures. I'm focusing on the \"leaver\" process to accurately classify the ticket and provide the correct JSON output.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nNow, I'm reconsidering the initial categorization. While \"HR Support\" seemed right because it focuses on the \"leaver\" process, I'm now leaning toward \"Access.\" The ticket explicitly mentions \"ad rights\" and \"mailbox\" management, which are core components of access control. My recent focus is now the specific tasks outlined in the ticket.\n\n\n"
