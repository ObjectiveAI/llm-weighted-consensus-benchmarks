Reviewing the provided text, the phrase \"access to information\" strongly suggests a specific classification within the available options. I'm weighing this against the defined enum to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Classification**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket details and pinpointed the core issue as managing user permissions for information and files. This aligns clearly with the \"Access\" category within the provided enum. I'm confident this classification accurately reflects the user's request.\n\n**Refining Access Classification**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the provided ticket text, and the repeated emphasis on \"access to information,\" \"permissions,\" and managing user restrictions for files solidifies my classification. The \"Access\" category, as defined in the enum, is the most accurate representation of the core request.\n\n"
