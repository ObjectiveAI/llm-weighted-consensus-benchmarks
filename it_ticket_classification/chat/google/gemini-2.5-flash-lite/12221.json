So far, I have been evaluating how best to analyze the text provided and match it to a predefined list. This needs to determine the optimal approach for identifying the right category, and this is where I am focused now.\n\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nThe ticket's recurring keyword is \"restart controller,\" strongly pointing to hardware infrastructure. I've analyzed the description, noting similar phrasing, which solidified \"Hardware\" as the best category. It is a more precise match compared to other options like \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project.\" Currently, my process correctly maps repeated phrases to their corresponding category.\n\n\n"
