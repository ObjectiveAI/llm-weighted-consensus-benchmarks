While initially considering \"HR Support,\" the nuances of data deletion and potential recreation lead me to believe it strongly aligns with managing employee records within HR systems.\n\n**Resolving Timecard Issues**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's details regarding deleted timecards and data reconstruction. Based on the focus on employee work records and data integrity, I've determined that \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category for this issue.\n\n"
