My goal is an accurate and consistent classification.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text focusing on access problems and password-related issues. The symptoms include inability to receive client requests and general access difficulties, specifically with Outlook. After considering the potential categories, I've narrowed it down to \"Access\" being the most accurate fit. This aligns with the described symptoms.\n\n\n"
