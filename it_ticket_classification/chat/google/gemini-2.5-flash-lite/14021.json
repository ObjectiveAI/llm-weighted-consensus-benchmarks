Based on the words provided, the \"HR Support\" category seems like the closest match. The words suggest something related to a new employee, specifically with the term \"former intern\". I need to keep evaluating the text, but that seems the most likely classification so far.\n\n\n**Evaluating Onboarding Context**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"HR Support\" category, given the strong onboarding cues. The recent text analysis highlighted \"new starter,\" \"internship,\" and account changes, solidifying the HR connection. It's becoming increasingly clear the request deals with the administrative process of bringing in new team members, particularly related to the \"starting engineer grade\" role, further indicating onboarding and related HR tasks. This leads me to believe \"HR Support\" is the correct classification.\n\n\n**Assessing HR Onboarding**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the connection to the \"HR Support\" category is becoming quite clear. The repeated phrases like \"new starter\", \"former intern\", and \"starting engineer grade\" point directly to onboarding. The account change request is a direct result of these onboarding tasks, solidifying my belief that this ticket relates to supporting the HR process for new hires. The request strongly implies HR initiated tasks, not that IT needs additional tasks.\n\n\n"
