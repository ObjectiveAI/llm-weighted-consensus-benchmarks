It seems the core issue revolves around a system restriction preventing the submission of hours, possibly in Oracle. I am leaning towards \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" as potential fits. The issue appears to be related to time entry or access to a system to do so. I'm carefully weighing which is most applicable to the nature of the submitted text.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Oracle Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's language, identifying the core issue as a data submission problem in Oracle. While \"HR Support\" seemed initially plausible, the focus on Oracle and the specific error message (\"hours per instead existing hours\") makes \"Access\" look more fitting. The user isn't locked out, but they are unable to submit hours due to a system restriction likely related to the data format.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR System Bug**\n\nI've decided \"HR Support\" is the best fit. While it's an Oracle issue, the problem *is* about submitting hours, which is an HR function. The system seems to be a time tracking/timesheet system. I believe this issue is a functional bug in Oracle, affecting the time submission process directly related to HR workflows.\n\n\n**Solidifying the HR Connection**\n\nI've been going through the ticket and narrowed down the issue to time submission within Oracle. Considering the function of submitting hours, which usually falls under HR, and the nature of the error message, \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate. The user's inability to submit, requiring \"hours per\" input instead of the \"existing hours,\" seems to be a functional glitch related to HR workflows and time tracking. The core of this issue clearly involves the HR processes being implemented by this Oracle system.\n\n\n"
