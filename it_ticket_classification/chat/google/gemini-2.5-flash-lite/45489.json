This indicates a focus on an internal process or system. I'm leaning towards categorizing this as either \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Administrative rights,\" as it could involve access or permissions tied to managing time entries.  Further refinement is necessary.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the initial category. While \"Internal Project\" seemed plausible, the focus on approval processes and line manager responsibilities strongly suggests \"HR Support\" is the more accurate fit. The issue isn't primarily about the project's time tracking system itself, but the *process* of managing employee time entries and approvals, which aligns better with HR functions.\n\n\n**Choosing Final Category**\n\nI've carefully weighed the options and have solidified my decision. Although \"project time entries\" initially pointed me toward \"Internal Project,\" the core issue centers on approval workflows and line manager responsibilities. This points to the process of managing employee time entries, which aligns squarely with HR's domain. The focus isn't a technical project glitch, but rather an HR-related workflow requiring resolution.\n\n\n"
