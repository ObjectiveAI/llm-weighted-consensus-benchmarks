The text mentions \"digital signature,\" \"signing messages,\" and \"certificate details\" in Outlook. Based on these clues, I believe it probably falls under \"Access\". However, I'm considering other possibilities, just in case.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've been analyzing the text further, focusing on the \"access\" and \"administrative rights\" categories. While access seems like the strongest initial fit, I'm now trying to distinguish whether the root issue is broader access to features, or a problem more specific to the configuration of access-related digital signature components. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" because the problem centers on the signature process, which is inherently about controlling who can sign and how.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've carefully re-examined the ticket details, concentrating on the \"digital signature\" and \"certificate\" aspects in Outlook. I'm now certain \"Access\" is the most accurate category, as the issue fundamentally concerns controlling access to secure email signing and verifying the digital certificate and who receives it. While administrative rights might be involved in initial setup, the current problem appears to be broader access and functional within the application.\n\n\n"
