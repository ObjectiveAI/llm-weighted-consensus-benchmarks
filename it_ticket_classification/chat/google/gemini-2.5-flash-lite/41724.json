I'm noting key phrases like \"password change,\" \"logged out,\" and \"accounts.\"  My goal is to effectively categorize this ticket based on those observations. The challenge is narrowing down the best fit among the possible options. It seems Access or HR Support might be relevant, however the ticket is lacking further details.\n\n\n**Refining Classification Approach**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"Access\" category. The text indicates login troubles tied to password changes and lockouts. While the initial analysis considered other options, the repeated mention of password reset and lockout problems makes \"Access\" the most logical fit. I am considering this category as definitive at this stage.\n\n\n"
