My focus is on mapping the ticket's content to the predefined enum values: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm actively analyzing the ticket's textual content, looking for keywords that align with the available categories. My current thought process is focused on the HR Support and Access categories, as terms like \"leavers,\" \"left,\" and \"reports\" suggest employee lifecycle actions and data management.\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Data**\n\nI'm processing the IT ticket data, focusing on classifying it into the most relevant category from the provided enum. My analysis of keywords like \"leavers,\" \"left,\" and \"reports,\" along with the mention of \"oracle,\" strongly points towards the HR Support category, as it involves employee lifecycle management and data handling.\n\n"
