My task is to assign it to one of the provided categories: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", or \"Administrative rights\". Given the mention of \"access\" and password issues, \"Access\" seems like a strong contender.\n\n**Resolving Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've determined the most appropriate category for the ticket. The keywords directly relate to user login and system entry issues, making the \"Access\" category the best fit. I've bypassed less specific options like \"Miscellaneous\" to ensure accurate classification.\n\n"
