I'm leaning towards categorizing this as an \"Access\" issue.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe evidence from the ticket is clear: access is the central problem. The issue is persistent even after initial steps, which points directly to the \"Access\" category. The focus revolves around an ongoing inability to access Confluence, despite access attempts and troubleshooting. This suggests a systemic access issue, and I'll categorize it as such.\n\n\n"
