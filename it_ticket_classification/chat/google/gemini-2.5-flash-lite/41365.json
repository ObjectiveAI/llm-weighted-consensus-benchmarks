The text about \"oracle timecard error,\" and removing hours strongly suggests an Access issue, although HR Support could also apply. I'm leaning toward Access as the primary concern, given the user's focus on timecard manipulation. I need to make a final call shortly.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've determined that HR Support is the best fit. While Access issues were initially considered due to the timecard context, the core issue seems to revolve around an error impacting time tracking, a function managed by HR. My analysis systematically eliminated the other options, narrowing it down to HR Support as the most accurate classification for this ticket. The timecard error aligns with HR responsibilities.\n\n\n"
