My initial assessment leans towards an issue related to Access or HR Support.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Timecard Issue**\n\nI'm now focusing on the detailed ticket content. The phrases \"timecards for approval,\" \"resubmit errors,\" and \"annual leave\" strongly suggest an HR Support issue. While \"Oracle\" might hint at access to an Oracle system, the core problem is a timecard approval process malfunction related to leave, firmly placing it within HR Support.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Issue**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket \"error oracle sent monday re please action submit your cards for approval hi top  your priority list but why these timecards have come back wanting be submitted for approvals when were submitted before also when try resubmit generate multiple errors think where have taken annual leave think changed these stuck can resubmit since change thanks.\" Key phrases such as \"timecards,\" \"approval,\" and \"annual leave\" continue to point decisively toward HR Support. The mention of \"Oracle\" is likely related to the Oracle system used for HR or payroll, rather than a system access issue. I'm now certain this falls within the purview of HR Support.\n\n\n"
