I've analyzed the text provided, and network connectivity is coming up as the clear area. I'm leaning toward selecting the most suitable category from the options.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've considered the provided text and available categories, leaning towards \"Hardware\". Network issues usually stem from underlying hardware malfunctions. I have to think about \"Access\" though, as this refers to connectivity. Ultimately, the priority is to categorize the issue so the ticket can be assigned, and Hardware seems the most fitting.\n\n\n**Deciding on Final Category**\n\nI've carefully weighed the options and their nuances. Initially, I thought \"Access\" might be a good fit, since the issue concerns connecting to the network. However, on further reflection, the description of \"connection issues\" implies a deeper underlying problem, often related to hardware or infrastructure like routers and network cards. I'm now confident that \"Hardware\" best encapsulates the described problem. The aim is to get this ticket routed to the right team, and now I have a sound rational for my choice.\n\n\n"
