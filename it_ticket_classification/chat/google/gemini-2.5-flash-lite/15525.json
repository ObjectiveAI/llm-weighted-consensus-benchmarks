The recurring mention of \"user active directory contractor\" strongly suggests an access-related issue, leading me to lean towards the \"Access\" category.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Details**\n\nI'm refining my understanding of the ticket's intent. The consistent references to \"user active directory contractor\" and related onboarding terms like \"signed\" and \"induction\" solidify my inclination towards the \"Access\" category, as the core IT task appears to be facilitating a contractor's system entry.\n\n**Categorizing Access Needs**\n\nI'm solidifying my categorization for this ticket. The repeated emphasis on \"user active directory contractor,\" alongside onboarding terms like \"signed\" and \"induction,\" overwhelmingly points towards \"Access\" as the primary IT function required.\n\n"
