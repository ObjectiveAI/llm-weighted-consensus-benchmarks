Based on the keywords, I initially leaned towards \"Access\" or potentially \"Miscellaneous,\" but I'm now leaning more towards \"Access\" because of the mention of \"Outlook\" and the need for access modification after the office move. I'll need to confirm that this choice aligns best with the intent of the request.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR Scope**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on the core issue: the office move. While Outlook is mentioned, it's a secondary concern. The phrases \"moved offices\" and \"relocated\" clearly indicate HR involvement. I'm confident HR Support is the best fit, superseding initial Access considerations. The garbled text makes analysis trickier, but the core issue prevails.\n\n\n**Clarifying HR Focus**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"HR Support\" categorization. While the initial mention of \"Outlook\" nudged me towards \"Access,\" the core phrase, \"moved offices,\" clearly establishes this as an HR-driven issue. I've ruled out all other categories, and the physical relocation is the dominant factor. The text's garbled nature doesn't detract from the primary HR focus.\n\n\n"
