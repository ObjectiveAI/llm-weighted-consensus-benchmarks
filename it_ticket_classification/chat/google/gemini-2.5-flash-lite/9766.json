                    "reasoning": "**Determining the Category**\n\nI'm currently focused on the best way to categorize this IT ticket. After a close read, I'm thinking the keywords suggest a need for access or HR support. The mention of a \"starter form\" is leading me to believe it is either an HR support ticket or a request for user onboarding access. I'll need to weigh the context to be certain.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR and Access**\n\nI'm now leaning heavily towards a dual categorization of \"HR Support\" and \"Access\". The emphasis on the \"starter form\" strongly suggests HR involvement, likely triggering an IT onboarding process. While \"Access\" is a clear secondary need, the initial request stems from HR's requirements. The use of \"contractor\" also helps clarify the likely needs.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI'm now settling on a primary category of \"Access,\" with a secondary designation of \"HR Support.\" The phrasing of the ticket indicates a need for access, specifically for a new contractor, which aligns well with the IT role in onboarding. However, I recognize the importance of the HR-initiated \"starter form.\" Both categories are relevant, but granting the required access is the core, immediate task.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Need**\n\nI'm now settling on a dual categorization: \"HR Support\" as the primary, with \"Access\" as the secondary. Initially, I felt \"Access\" was most direct, but reflecting on the workflow, the \"starter form\" indicates the ticket's root is HR-driven. Even if IT handles access, the underlying requirement stems from HR's initiation.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Task**\n\nI'm now settling on a primary category of \"Access\". While the \"starter form\" indicates HR involvement, the explicit need is for the new contractor to \"join,\" implying system access is the direct IT task. The phrasing suggests a request for immediate provisioning of access, so I am going to choose Access first, and consider if HR is also needed.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Onboarding Task**\n\nI'm now settling on \"Access\" as the primary category and \"HR Support\" as the secondary. While the initial request stems from the HR-driven \"starter form\", the core IT action involves provisioning access for the contractor to \"join.\" The IT ticket seems to be focused more on granting access than other HR support activities.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Choice**\n\nI'm now settling on a primary category of \"HR Support\" with \"Access\" as a secondary. While the phrasing implies an immediate need for system access, the core requirement stems from the HR-initiated \"starter form.\" The ticket's origin lies in the HR onboarding process, even though IT will execute it.\n\n\n**Analyzing Onboarding Request**\n\nI'm now settling on a dual categorization: \"HR Support\" as the primary, and \"Access\" as the secondary. Initially, the ticket's phrasing focused my thoughts on \"Access\" due to the core IT task of provisioning, but reflecting on the workflow, the \"starter form\" is at the center of this IT ticket. Even though IT handles \"Access,\" the initial request stems from HR.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR's Involvement**\n\nNow, I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\" as the primary category, with \"Access\" as secondary. The focus on the \"starter form\" solidifies its HR origin. Even if IT handles the access, HR's initial trigger is crucial. The ticket's phrasing guides this new direction.\n\n\n"
