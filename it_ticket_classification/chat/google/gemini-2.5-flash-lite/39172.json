After analyzing the text, my initial thought is leaning towards the \"Access\" category, as the issue seems to be document-related and the user is unable to *open* the \"work instruction\". I'm still weighing other options, but \"Access\" appears to be the most fitting at this point.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've solidified my selection as \"Access\". The core issue is the user's inability to open the work instruction, stemming from a changed link. The keywords and the nature of the problem clearly point to an access-related issue. This seems to be the best and most appropriate classification for this ticket.\n\n\n"
