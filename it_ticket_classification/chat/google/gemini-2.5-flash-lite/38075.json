I've ruled out hardware, access, and storage as irrelevant. I'm leaning toward either HR support or miscellaneous, since the text doesn't directly mention other categories.\n\n\n**Categorizing Expense Tickets**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on a precise category. While \"HR Support\" seemed promising, reflecting again on the core problem \u2013 a rejected expense \u2013 I'm leaning heavily towards it. This type of request is commonly associated with HR processes or even finance-related support, as it pertains to internal financial procedures, not necessarily HR policies.\n\n\n**Selecting Primary Category**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket text concerning the rejected expense report.  Considering the options, \"HR Support\" appears the most precise. While \"Miscellaneous\" remains a possibility, the strong association of expense reports with HR or Finance processes, even within an IT ticketing system, makes \"HR Support\" the preferable choice for this particular request.\n\n\n"
