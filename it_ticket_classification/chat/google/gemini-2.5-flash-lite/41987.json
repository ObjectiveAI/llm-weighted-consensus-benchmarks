My initial impression is that the ticket is related to a reporting issue. Given the limited information, I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous,\" but need more context to be sure. It could also fall under \"Storage\" or \"Internal Project.\" Let's see what further clues can be pulled out.\n\n\n**Defining Problem Parameters**\n\nMy analysis of the ticket has deepened, focusing on the configuration aspect. The phrase \"your end can have rights\" is crucial. The need for admin rights to configure columns and resolve report discrepancies clearly points to an access or configuration-related issue. This seems to be the core of the problem.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Root Issue**\n\nMy analysis indicates that the root of the problem lies in the need for administrative rights. The user needs elevated permissions to configure columns and resolve discrepancies in a reporting system. While the initial issue involves the report itself, the solution explicitly requires administrative actions, leading me to focus on \"Administrative rights\" as the most accurate categorization.\n\n\n**Clarifying Configuration Requirements**\n\nMy understanding has solidified. The user's request centers on configuring a report or system. I've ruled out \"Access\" as the primary focus is not about *gaining* access, but *using* administrative access to configure. The user's explicit need for someone with \"rights\" to \"configure columns\" points directly to the core issue, which is enabling administrative action to resolve a reporting problem.\n\n\n"
