It's a bit tricky since the description is a little vague. \"Changing people manager\" could potentially fall under \"HR Support,\" but it's not immediately clear. I need to consider all the options and look for any hidden clues. I'm focusing on keywords and phrases that might align with the given categories.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Relevance**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket description, recognizing keywords like \"changing people manager\" and \"person leaving,\" which clearly suggest an HR-related issue.  While access modifications might follow, the core focus is the management change itself. I'm prioritizing \"HR Support\" as the primary category, given the strong alignment with the provided schema.  Generic phrases are deemphasized.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Origin**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket, and it's looking like \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate. The description is rich with HR keywords. The core of the issue, \"changing people manager,\" paired with the mention of \"person leaving,\" firmly anchors it to an HR process. I'm carefully discarding the generic phrases which don't help in categorization.\n\n\n"
