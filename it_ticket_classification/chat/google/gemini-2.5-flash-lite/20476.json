My process involves analyzing the text of each ticket to determine the best fit from the available options. The most recent focus has been on parsing ticket text and deciding on the best category. I've been considering how to weigh different keywords and phrases to ensure accuracy.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Best Fit**\n\nMy analysis of the ticket's text, specifically focusing on \"new starter\" and related phrases, leads me to believe the primary category is HR Support, given the context of onboarding and account setup. Hardware allocation is part of the broader HR process and should be considered subsidiary. While access management is involved, HR Support captures the overall function of IT in this onboarding case.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nNow I'm focusing on the specifics of ticket text related to \"new starter.\" I'm rethinking my initial categorization, weighing the importance of phrases like \"hardware allocation\" and \"create ad.\" Although \"Access\" is a component, I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" because the ticket's core function is about onboarding. I've considered that the IT tasks are subservient to this bigger process and am refining my criteria for choosing the best fit.\n\n\n"
