The mention of \"annual leave\" seems to strongly point towards the HR Support category, especially since Oracle systems are often tied to HR functions. The technical aspects, while present, feel secondary to this HR-related function.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Categories**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the IT ticket details. The phrase \"submit annual leave\" is a significant indicator, strongly suggesting the \"HR Support\" category is the most fitting classification for this issue, even with mentions of Oracle system problems.\n\n"
