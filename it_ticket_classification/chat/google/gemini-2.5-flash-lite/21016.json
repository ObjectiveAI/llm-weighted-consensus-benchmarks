                    "reasoning": "**Identifying Ticket Type**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the ticket content: \"oracle problem tuesday february problem hi kindly help please notice\". My focus is on determining the appropriate category from the options: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights\".  So far, the vague nature of the ticket makes a precise categorization challenging. I will need to consider the keywords \"oracle\" and \"problem\" to determine the focus of the request.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI've been drilling down on the ticket details, specifically focusing on the phrase \"oracle problem\" and other related technical terms. After further evaluation of the provided text, the phrase \"update entries\", \"delete button\" and \"code\"  suggest that the underlying problem is associated with the functionality of a software system, likely relating to data manipulation, which narrows down our scope. Given the context, it seems like a core function of the system has issues.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Culprit**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket content, and the focus is firmly on the technical aspects. The recurring keywords, such as \"Oracle,\" \"error,\" \"update entries,\" and \"delete button,\" point unequivocally towards a software issue. I've eliminated categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others that don't align with the problem's functional nature. While \"Internal Project\" is a possibility if Oracle is project-related, the precise functional errors suggest a more specific issue with the software itself. I will further refine this conclusion.\n\n\n**Revisiting Ticket Categories**\n\nMy thinking has moved toward a more refined view of the \"Miscellaneous\" category, given the nature of the issue. Though it's still about an application (\"Oracle\"), the lack of a specific \"Software\" or \"Application\" category makes \"Miscellaneous\" a necessary, but generic, fit. The language related to \"code\" and \"tasks\" has led me to re-examine the potential fit for \"Internal Project.\" The user seems to be working within the application to resolve errors. While the ticket doesn't make this explicit, it seems the functionality, not a generic \"Oracle\" issue, is the key point.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Oracle Issue**\n\nThe focus has shifted from the initial assessment of \"Miscellaneous\" to giving further consideration to \"Internal Project\" as the better category. The technical details, especially regarding \"code,\" \"tasks,\" \"save,\" and data errors, imply a custom application layer on top of Oracle, possibly created or managed internally. I am leaning toward the hypothesis that the issue is within software developed as part of an internal project using the Oracle platform, as opposed to a generic Oracle database or application issue.\n\n\n**Defining the Root Cause**\n\nThe ticket analysis now considers the ticket content, focusing on the combination of \"oracle problem,\" code mentions, and data errors, to determine the core of the issue. I am now leaning strongly towards \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category. The details suggest a custom application or module that's part of an internal project rather than a generic Oracle problem. The reference to code and tasks reinforces this, suggesting a functional issue with custom-built software on the Oracle platform.\n\n\n"
