The user's struggle with time card entries and submission points directly to an HR system problem, not general access or hardware concerns.\n\n**Determining Ticket Classification**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's content, focusing on keywords like \"time card,\" \"entries,\" and \"submit.\" My assessment strongly indicates the issue falls under \"HR Support,\" as it directly pertains to employee time tracking and payroll system functionality, rather than hardware, general access, or other categories.\n\n"
