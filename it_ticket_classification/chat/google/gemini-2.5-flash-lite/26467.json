I need to map \"new starter tower thursday november pm\" to one of these categories: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", \"Administrative rights\".  Initial assessments suggest it leans towards hardware, but further context is needed to confirm definitively.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on refining the best category fit for the IT ticket. While initially \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" seemed plausible, I've noticed a stronger lean toward \"Access\". The ticket focuses on setting up a new employee with the necessary credentials. This includes changing credentials and making the access permanent, which is the crux of \"Access\" type tickets. It's essentially about provisioning and modifying system permissions.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Focus**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket and now lean towards \"Access\". While initially, \"HR Support\" seemed right because it's for a new employee, the key action is about changing and making credentials permanent. This is more of an access-specific task and aligns better with the focus on access provisioning for system resources.\n\n\n**Deciding the Final Category**\n\nI've been going back and forth, but I'm now leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\". The phrase \"new starter\" triggers an onboarding process, and even though \"Access\" is involved, it's a *task* within that broader \"HR Support\" process. The ticket's ultimate goal is to enable an employee's access, but the context is rooted in an HR-driven event.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Choice**\n\nAfter further analysis, I've concluded that \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category. While \"Access\" is integral, the ticket's core revolves around onboarding a \"new starter\" and establishing \"permanent status\". These are HR-driven events, with the \"credentials change\" being an IT task within that context. Thus, \"HR Support\" better encompasses the overall purpose of the request.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Criteria**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the ticket, giving significant weight to the \"credentials changed\" and \"permanent status\" phrases. While the \"new starter\" aspect initially suggested \"HR Support,\" I'm now leaning heavily toward \"Access,\" as the central request centers around modifying and ensuring permanent credential access, which is the direct function of an Access ticket.\n\n\n"
