This solidifies my conviction that \"Access\" is the most appropriate category for this ticket.\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket details concerning \"collateral files,\" \"layouts,\" and \"libraries,\" alongside the specific error \"server address could not be found\" and the mention of \"remote access.\" These elements strongly confirm that \"Access\" is the definitive category.\n\n"
