I need to pick a category from the given list: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. The text, \"problems with oracle fusion time card pm re problems card hi also card assist kind,\" doesn't quite fit any of those.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted towards the specific aspects of the time card submission issue. The keywords \"cant submit card\" and \"error cannot submitted\" clearly point to a process problem.  Analyzing this further, I'm leaning heavily towards HR Support as the core issue, as it's the HR systems that manage this kind of function. The access issue is there but seems a consequence, not a primary driver of the problem.\n\n\n**Defining the Root Cause**\n\nThe ticket text analysis is complete. My primary focus narrowed to the core issue: the \"cant submit card\" and \"error cannot submitted\" phrases clearly indicate a process failure. Considering all the aspects, I've concluded the most relevant category is HR Support. It encompasses the time card function, and the submission difficulty points to an HR system issue.\n\n\n"
