The phrases \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"joined\" strongly suggest an HR-related issue, leaning toward needing to grant access or configure their account. I'm carefully weighing HR Support and Access as the most fitting choices and will make my final determination shortly.\n\n\n**Defining the Best Fit**\n\nI've refined my thinking and believe \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category. The phrases about a \"new starter,\" a \"starter form contractor,\" and them having \"joined\" strongly point towards an onboarding process. Although \"Access\" could be related, the primary focus is the initial setup, best addressed through HR. This leads me to conclude the best category is HR Support.\n\n\n"
