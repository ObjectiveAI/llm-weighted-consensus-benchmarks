My initial assessment is leaning towards a category related to access or perhaps a system update. The phrases \"contact info changed\" and \"ext hub\" suggest a possible need for access adjustments or a hardware configuration change. I need to make sure my final choice is the most accurate reflection of the information, and make sure it is not related to HR or financial processes, as the provided content does not provide any hints in that direction.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI've further examined the ticket content, and the repeated mention of \"contact info changed\" and \"information was changed\" strongly suggests an update to employee details.  My analysis now leans firmly towards \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category. The mention of \"colleagues Belgrade\" reinforces this, indicating a possible change in contact information for an employee or team. I'm confident my choice now appropriately categorizes this ticket.\n\n\n"
