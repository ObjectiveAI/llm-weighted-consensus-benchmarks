The text indicates a recurring issue related to submitting information, possibly due to annual leave. I'm cross-referencing this with the available categories to ensure an accurate classification.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've reviewed the IT ticket description and identified the core issue as a submission problem, specifically mentioning \"annual leave\" as a cause for difficulty submitting for previous weeks. Based on this, I'm leaning towards classifying it under 'HR Support' due to the strong implication of employee-related processes, though 'Miscellaneous' remains a possibility if the submission itself is system-wide rather than HR-specific.\n\n**Determining Category Focus**\n\nI'm currently assessing the core issue within the ticket's description. The recurring theme of \"submitting issue\" linked with \"annual leave\" for previous weeks strongly suggests a process tied to employee administrative functions, making 'HR Support' a highly probable category.\n\n"
