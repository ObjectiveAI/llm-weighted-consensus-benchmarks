I'm leaning toward \"Access\" but want to rule out any HR-related implications before finalizing my decision. I need to consider if \"Administrative rights\" is relevant here.\n\n\n**Analyzing All Data Points**\n\nI've finished my analysis of the ticket content, focusing on the various keywords and their implications. \"Leaver\" processes clearly trigger a need for both HR Support and Access management. I've considered several factors, including whether the ticket pertains to the user's role or the overall impact, and the need to include Purchase and Storage as potential factors as well.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Categories**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best fit. While \"Access\" encompasses several aspects, the broad nature of the \"leaver\" process suggests a primary \"HR Support\" category, as they initiate and manage the offboarding. The overlapping areas like access management are included within HR's domain here.\n\n\n**Deciding on Main Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and am inclined toward \"HR Support\" for the primary category. The \"leaver\" context and related processes are the central theme. While \"Access\" is integral, the offboarding lifecycle is usually owned by HR. I've re-examined keywords like \"leaver form,\" \"leaving date,\" and the implied \"leaver process,\" reinforcing the \"HR Support\" perspective.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Details**\n\nI'm now solidly focused on categorizing this ticket. The \"leaver\" context consistently points toward \"HR Support\" as the primary category. While \"Access\" is crucial, the ticket's underlying driver is the employee's departure, handled by HR. I've considered all keyphrases to confirm.\n\n\n"
