My goal is to accurately classify it based on these textual clues.\n\n**Assigning IT Tickets**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket's text, specifically noting recurring phrases like \"days logged,\" \"days off,\" and the mention of \"oracle.\" My current thought is to prioritize the core issue of managing time off or leave, with \"oracle\" potentially being a secondary contextual element.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Content**\n\nI'm currently refining my categorization logic. The phrases \"days logged\" and variations of taking \"days off\" strongly indicate an HR-related issue, likely concerning leave or attendance tracking. \"Oracle\" appears to be a secondary system context rather than the primary problem.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the ticket's content, with phrases like \"days logged\" and \"days per off\" strongly suggesting an HR-related issue. My focus is on prioritizing these keywords to classify the ticket, while considering \"oracle\" as secondary context.\n\n"
