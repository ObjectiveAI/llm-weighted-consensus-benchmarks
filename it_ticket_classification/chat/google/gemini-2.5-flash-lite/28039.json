The terms \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" are the most prominent, indicating a strong possibility this relates to onboarding. I'm carefully cross-referencing these phrases with each category. Based on the clues, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" but considering other categories. I'm weighing up the potential for overlap, too.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"HR Support\" as the primary category, with \"Access\" as a secondary consideration. The ticket's strong emphasis on the \"starter form\" solidifies its connection to HR onboarding processes. I'm taking a more decisive stance on the primary category while acknowledging access is crucial, this is primarily an HR-related event. I am confident in this categorization now.\n\n\n**Solidifying Categorization Decision**\n\nI've determined that the ticket belongs to \"HR Support,\" with \"Access\" as a secondary. The phrases \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" are directly linked to onboarding, a core HR function. While granting access is a critical part of the process, the \"starter form\" itself strongly suggests an HR-driven initial step. Based on the analysis, I'm confident \"HR Support\" is the primary category.\n\n\n"
