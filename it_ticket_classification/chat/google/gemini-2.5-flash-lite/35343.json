The input text is proving challenging; the user's description is vague.  I'm leaning towards \"Hardware,\" given the mention of a broken PC. However, the lack of detail makes me question this, so I will continue reviewing for any other clues before I commit to a final assignment.\n\n\n**Concluding the Classification**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text: \"pc broke pc broke hello would kindly ask you provide pc turning anymore since yesterday shut down middle working process though physical or software actions were taken could harm pc thank you.\" The repeated phrases \"pc broke\" and \"pc turning anymore\" are key indicators. The shutdown during a working process further solidifies the hardware issue. Based on this evidence, I've concluded the correct category is \"Hardware\".\n\n\n"
