I need to categorize this. Considering the options, it leans towards \"Hardware\" as the camera is a physical component. This seems the most logical fit. It's a key piece of equipment preventing work completion. I'm double-checking, but \"Hardware\" looks best.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've solidified my thought process. The analysis clearly points to \"Hardware\" as the appropriate category. The malfunctioning camera is the central issue, directly impacting the application development. While there are related aspects, the core problem's root is the hardware failure. This classification best represents the ticket's essence and enables focused troubleshooting.\n\n\n"
