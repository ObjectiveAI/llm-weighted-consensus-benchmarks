The phrase \"reactivate leaver account\" points directly to an access issue. Identifying the words that point to \"access\" is critical here. It seems like phrases related to account management are significant.\n\n\n**Defining the Key Indicators**\n\nI've identified crucial phrases: \"reactivate leaver account,\" \"recent leaver,\" \"left December,\" and \"returning,\" pointing toward user account management. My analysis leads me to \"Access\" as the most suitable category. I've ruled out \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The focus is on the direct technical act of account reactivation and access.\n\n\n"
