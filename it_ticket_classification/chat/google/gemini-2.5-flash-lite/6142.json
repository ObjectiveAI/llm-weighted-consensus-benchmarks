After careful consideration, I think the phrases \"create project\" and \"create job\" suggest an **Internal Project** classification. The other options don't seem applicable. I'm confident in this choice.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Request**\n\nI've dived deeper into the ticket text, refining my initial analysis. While \"Internal Project\" still seems like a good fit given the \"create project and job\" phrase, I'm now considering the context further. The repeated use of \"create job\" alongside the other phrases does strongly imply an **Internal Project** classification. I'm satisfied with this as the best match.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted slightly, considering the impact of \"please rise tickets per assign.\" It subtly hints at task management within a project, further bolstering my conviction in \"Internal Project\". The request seems less about a simple job creation and more about the infrastructure setup for a coordinated effort, reinforcing that the best fit is **Internal Project**.\n\n\n"
