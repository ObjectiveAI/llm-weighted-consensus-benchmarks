The keywords \"owner,\" \"leave,\" and potentially \"annual\" suggest the category is likely related to HR Support. However, \"access\" and \"administrative rights\" may need further consideration, as \"owner\" could be related to these. I'm carefully weighing all the possibilities before reaching a conclusion.\n\n\n**Deciding on Ticket Category**\n\nI've just finished analyzing the ticket text, focusing on the keywords and their implications. \"Planned annual leave\" is a clear indicator, solidifying \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category. The other elements are less specific, and the key determinant in this case is the clear relationship to employee leave. Based on the categorization schema, I believe the output of `\"HR Support\"` is the most fitting choice.\n\n\n"
