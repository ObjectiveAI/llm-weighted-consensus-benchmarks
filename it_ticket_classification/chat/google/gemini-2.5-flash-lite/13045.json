The keywords \"new starter\" suggest a possible HR or Access issue, but the remaining text is ambiguous. I'm leaning towards narrowing it down to Access or HR Support, but need more context to make a definitive choice. I'll need to carefully consider the limited information available to choose the most fitting category.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Request**\n\nI've further refined my initial analysis. While \"Access\" was a contender, the focus on onboarding new employees and their account status changes definitively points toward \"HR Support.\" The phrase \"new starter\" and the implied need for account modification solidify this choice. Therefore, the ticket should be categorized under \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n**Confirming the Category**\n\nI've evaluated the ticket text and focused on phrases like \"new employees,\" \"accepted job offers,\" and \"change accounts.\" This confirmed my initial instinct, and led me to decisively categorize this as an \"HR Support\" issue. The request directly relates to the employee onboarding process, and the necessary account modifications are a direct result of these HR changes. I'm now certain this belongs within the HR Support category.\n\n\n"
