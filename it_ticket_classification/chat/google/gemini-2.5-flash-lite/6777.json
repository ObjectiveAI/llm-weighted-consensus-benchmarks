After careful consideration, I've tentatively assigned it to \"Access\" since the user is requesting permissions to shared folders. I'm double-checking to ensure this aligns with the provided categories.\n\n\n**Defining Access Requirements**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket, breaking down the user's request. It's about gaining access to project shared folders and potentially other systems, like \"maxim\". Considering the categories, \"Access\" is still the most fitting, though \"Internal Project\" felt relevant initially. The user isn't asking to manage storage, just *access* it.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket to pinpoint the fundamental issue. It clearly revolves around obtaining permissions to shared folders and potentially other systems like \"maxim.\" While \"Internal Project\" felt relevant initially due to the \"project shared folder\" mention, the focus is undeniably on *accessing* resources. Therefore, I'm confident \"Access\" is the most accurate classification.\n\n\n"
