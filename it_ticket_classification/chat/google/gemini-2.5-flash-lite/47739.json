The goal is to accurately map incoming IT ticket descriptions to a predefined schema. Current progress involves a deeper dive into keyword extraction and rule-based assignment. I'm testing several approaches, and the system is being tuned by looking at outputs and expected values.\n\n\n**Defining Problem Space**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket content and identified a core issue: new users encountering difficulties entering data, specifically for their initial period of work. The recurring themes revolve around data entry problems, accessibility (browser), and potential process/workflow snags. While some suggest browser-related troubleshooting, the root cause appears to stem from either system access or HR-related processes. Based on that I will now determine the category.\n\n\n**Identifying Correct Category**\n\nMy analysis indicates this ticket's core issue is restricted access or system functionality for entering data related to specific time periods. Though onboarding might involve HR, the reported difficulty is technical. While a broader view suggests \"HR Support,\" the most accurate category appears to be \"Access.\" I've ruled out others like Hardware and Storage, as they're irrelevant.\n\n\n**Selecting The Best Fit**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text, prioritizing its core meaning. It outlines new employee difficulties with logging work hours, suggesting a system issue tied to HR processes. While \"Access\" could apply, the context leans toward a problem within an HR system's functionality. This makes \"HR Support\" the most accurate classification. I'm focusing on the nature of the *system* as it relates to employees, particularly new ones.\n\n\n"
