Based on the \"leaver form\" and \"leave dates\" being mentioned, I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR.\" While there's a slight possibility of hardware involvement if the form is digital and not accessible, the core issue seems personnel-related. I need to make sure the category chosen best reflects the core problem.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the optimal category for the IT ticket. The keywords \"leaver form\" and \"leave dates\" are central, pointing squarely to HR processes. While there's a peripheral link to access or hardware depending on the digital form, HR is undoubtedly the root issue. Now I'm preparing to finalize the categorization and move on.\n\n\n"
