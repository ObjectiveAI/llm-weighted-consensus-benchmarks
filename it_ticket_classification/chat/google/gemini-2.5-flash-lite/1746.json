My focus is on analyzing the ticket's content, specifically the mention of \"sand\", to determine the most appropriate classification from the provided enum list: [\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", \"Administrative rights\"].\n\n**Determining the Category**\n\nI'm actively analyzing the ticket's content, focusing on the \"sandpit\" context and resource limits mentioned. My current assessment points towards \"Storage\" as the most fitting category, given the discussions around object management and creation quotas within the sandbox environment.\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI'm currently processing an IT ticket and have analyzed its content, specifically noting mentions of \"sand pit,\" \"objects,\" and creation limits. My current assessment strongly suggests \"Storage\" as the most appropriate category, as the issues described revolve around resource management and quotas within a sandbox environment.\n\n**Processing Ticket Details**\n\nI've completed my analysis of the IT ticket's content, specifically examining terms like \"sand pit,\" \"objects,\" and creation quotas. Based on this, I've concluded that \"Storage\" is the most accurate classification for this ticket, as the issues described relate directly to resource management and capacity within the described environment.\n\n"
