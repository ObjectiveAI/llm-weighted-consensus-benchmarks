After analyzing the text, I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" due to the mentions of needing a \"bigger pc\" and the user running out of it. However, I want to double-check if any other category, like \"Storage,\" might also be relevant given the mention of running out of space. I'll continue to analyze the context more to make sure that I choose the most appropriate category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Options**\n\nI'm now further refining my analysis of the IT ticket categorization. While \"Hardware\" remains a strong contender due to the explicit mention of needing a larger PC, I'm carefully considering \"Storage\" as a possible secondary category. The phrase \"ran out\" suggests a potential issue related to available disk space. However, considering the context of a software developer and the explicit mention of the PC, I'm leaning towards Hardware as the primary category. I will examine whether both Hardware and Storage are appropriate.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Hardware Needs**\n\nI've examined the ticket text in detail, focusing on the keywords. It's clear the primary request is for a larger PC, making \"Hardware\" the most fitting category. While the phrase \"ran out\" initially raised the possibility of \"Storage,\" the context of the explicit PC request and the software developer's role strengthens the case for hardware as the main issue. The need for a \"bigger\" PC overrides any potential storage concerns.\n\n\n"
