The ticket text \"set work location to ad for december pm location hello please\" doesn't give a clear indication of the issue. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" since it mentions \"work location\" and an \"ad,\" which could imply access to a specific system or location. However, it's not a definite conclusion yet.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text and the available categories. My earlier leaning towards \"Access\" was premature. Focusing on the keywords \"work location\" and \"meal tickets,\" it's clear this is an HR-related issue. \"HR Support\" is the most precise fit, given the context. The ticket's subject matter aligns with HR responsibilities more so than the other categories, making my final classification \"HR Support\".\n\n\n"
