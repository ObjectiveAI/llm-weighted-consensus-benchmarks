I'm carefully considering how best to map this phrase to the provided categories to ensure the correct categorization. I'm leaning towards \"Storage,\" but I want to be certain before finalizing the classification.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the central issue, which is clearly storage-related. The phrase \"increase folder size on server,\" along with related statements, leaves little doubt. My analysis solidifies the need for more storage. The user's repeated emphasis on storage implies that I'm correctly identifying the key issue. I've ruled out other categories based on the specific wording.\n\n\n"
