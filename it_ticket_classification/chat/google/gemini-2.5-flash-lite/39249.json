Further analysis is required to finalize the classification.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Relevance**\n\nI've solidified my initial assessment: \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category. The phrases confirm a user management issue related to personnel changes. Considering the given options, this is a perfect fit, and I don't see any ambiguity. The terms \"line manager\" and \"change manager screen\" further support the HR connection.\n\n\n"
