This strongly indicates the ticket falls under the 'Purchase' category due to the nature of requisitions and associated costs for requested items like developer Macs.\n\n**Assigning IT Ticket**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text, noting keywords like \"approve requisition\" and \"cost.\" My current assessment strongly points towards the 'Purchase' category given the focus on requisitions and the implied financial implications for requested resources such as developer Macs.\n\n"
