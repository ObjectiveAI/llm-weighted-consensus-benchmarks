Phrases like \"re provost new starter\" and \"re\" strongly suggest a link to HR processes, potentially involving new employee onboarding or HR system access.\n\n**Assigning IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the ticket's content, which heavily features terms like \"new starter,\" \"joiner,\" and mentions of needing a \"cell phone\" and having one \"ordered.\" These indicators strongly point towards the \"HR Support\" category, as it directly relates to onboarding new personnel and their associated needs.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm continuing to refine my assessment of the ticket's core issue. While \"new starter\" and \"joiner\" clearly point to HR-related context, the explicit mention of needing and ordering a \"cell phone\" strongly suggests that \"Hardware\" is the most precise category for this specific request.\n\n"
