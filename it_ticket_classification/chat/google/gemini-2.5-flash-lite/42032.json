Based on the limited text provided, it's proving tricky. \"Error\" could point to technical issues, but \"submit your cards for approval\" suggests a process or purchase. I need more information to confidently assign a category. My current focus is refining how to categorize incomplete or ambiguous ticket descriptions effectively.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've honed in on the \"Purchase\" category as the most probable fit. The phrases \"submit your cards for approval,\" \"submitted several cards,\" and the request to \"resubmit them\" strongly suggest a procurement or expense-related issue.  I am actively working on an algorithm now to better manage the categorization of incomplete or ambiguous ticket descriptions effectively.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter reviewing the ticket text, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Purchase\" again. The language strongly suggests an expense-related approval process. The phrases \"submit your cards,\" \"submitted several cards,\" and \"resubmit them\" are key. While \"Miscellaneous\" is always an option, the specifics point more directly to procurement or expense management, making \"Purchase\" a better, more appropriate category.\n\n"
