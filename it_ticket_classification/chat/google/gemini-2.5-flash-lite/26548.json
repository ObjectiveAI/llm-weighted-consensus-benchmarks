Analyzing the text, \"new starter wednesday november pm re starter form ext\", I've identified the keywords \"new starter\" and \"form\". This indicates it falls under HR support, though it's not absolutely clear. I need to make sure this is the best match. I'm exploring the nuances to be certain. I've ruled out hardware, access, and storage as a bad fit.\n\n\n**Revising Categorization Focus**\n\nI'm reconsidering the HR support classification. Analyzing the phrase \"new starter wednesday november pm re starter form ext\", I see the core focus as onboarding. While HR is strongly linked, there's a strong case for \"Access\" as the primary need is related to setting up permissions. I've eliminated \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase.\" I'm also considering the \"Administrative Rights\" categorization, since a new employee needs those as well.\n\n\n**Assessing Ticket Details**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the ticket details. The phrase \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" make HR Support the most relevant. The time is not relevant. Hardware, storage, and purchasing are definite no-gos. I'm focusing on why it's a better fit than Access or Administrative rights. \"Starter form\" suggests the overall HR onboarding flow is the primary issue, which often *includes* access, but is bigger than it.\n\n\n"
