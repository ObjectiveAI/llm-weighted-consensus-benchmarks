My current hypothesis leans towards a hardware-related issue. This seems to be the best match in the list of categories I was provided. I'm double-checking to confirm.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket \"cable cable hi had borrow cable keep record giving back person today thanks\" and the potential categories. Based on keywords like \"cable,\" \"borrow,\" and \"giving back,\" I'm now confident that \"Hardware\" is the correct classification. The focus on a physical IT asset and its temporary use makes it the best fit among the available options.\n\n\n"
