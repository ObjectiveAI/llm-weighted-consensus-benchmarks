My process involves identifying key terms within the ticket descriptions to match them with predefined categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The goal is to accurately and efficiently categorize each ticket.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket, which describes difficulties connecting Outlook to a mailbox. While \"Storage\" and \"Administrative rights\" could play a secondary role, the core problem is clearly access. After evaluating each keyword category against the ticket details, I determined \"Access\" to be the most accurate classification.\n\n\n"
