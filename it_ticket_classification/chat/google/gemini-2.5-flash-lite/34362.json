After careful review, I believe the emphasis on launching a \"management tool for projects\" makes \"Internal Project\" the most fitting classification. It encapsulates the core activity described in the ticket, which pertains to the implementation of a new internal tool. Further analysis is complete.\n\n\n**Defining Project Scope**\n\nThe data shows this is more than just about a \"management tool\" - it's about a replacement system for managing project risks and issues. Considering the former employee involvement and demo recordings, the scope seems broader than initially thought. My focus is now on confirming that the primary goal is a new Internal Project for an internal system.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've just concluded my analysis and am confident in assigning the \"Internal Project\" category. The focus on a new project management tool, replacing an existing system, and involving internal development aligns directly with this classification. The tool's capabilities and intended use are clearly internal, solidifying my decision.\n\n\n"
