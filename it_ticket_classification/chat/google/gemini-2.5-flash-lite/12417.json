The key phrase \"missing time users left\" suggests this is related to time tracking or employee records. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the best fit from the categories, as it seems like an HR-related issue involving employee data. I'll need to confirm that, though.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe evidence solidly favors HR Support. The text deals primarily with employee departures, absences, time submissions, and updating personal records, all falling under HR. No hardware, access, storage, purchases, internal projects, or administrative rights are mentioned. The evidence consistently supports this conclusion.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've carefully examined the ticket text again. The common threads, which are now even clearer, are time reporting, employee departures, and record updates. These all strongly suggest the underlying problem is rooted in employee management and HR processes. The user's description of missing time and leave information perfectly aligns with an HR-related concern.\n\n\n"
