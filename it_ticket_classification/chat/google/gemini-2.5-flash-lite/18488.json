I've narrowed it down to a few possibilities, but I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" due to the mention of a \"new starter\" and a form. I'm double-checking the other categories to be sure.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Match**\n\nI've been analyzing the text \"new starter friday march pm starter form ext\" and am now leaning towards \"HR Support.\" The \"new starter\" aspect strongly suggests an onboarding process, and the \"starter form\" indicates a document likely managed by HR. While \"Access\" is a possibility, \"HR Support\" appears more comprehensive as it encompasses the entire onboarding procedure, including potential IT actions. I'm focusing on the context to confidently finalize the appropriate category, and HR Support resonates with the essence of the ticket text.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text, \"new starter friday march pm starter form ext,\" and concluded that \"HR Support\" remains the most suitable category. My reasoning centers on the ticket's description of a \"new starter\" and a \"starter form,\" indicating an HR-driven onboarding process that, while requiring IT involvement, is initiated by HR. While access provisioning will likely be required, the core request seems broader than access alone. I believe HR Support best captures the entire scope of the ticket.\n\n\n"
