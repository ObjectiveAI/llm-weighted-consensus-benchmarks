                    "reasoning": "**Examining Ticket Details**\n\nOkay, I'm now analyzing the ticket description \"oracle fusion expense report approval flow change\". Currently, my thought process is focused on identifying key terms related to the provided categories. I'm considering \"expense report approval flow\" and its potential fit within the existing schema. My current focus is refining this analysis.\n\n\n**Defining Approval Workflow**\n\nI've been drilling down on the \"Oracle Fusion expense report approval flow change\" ticket.  My focus is zeroing in on workflow configuration aspects and how this impacts expense report processing. I'm actively comparing the request's intricacies to the categories, specifically ruling out \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support.\" It seems like \"Internal Project\" could be a viable fit. I'm currently leaning towards that.\n\n\n**Refining Workflow Rules**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the specifics of the change request. My analysis of \"oracle fusion expense report approval flow change\" is leading me towards understanding the precise adjustments needed to the approval *rules* or *behavior* within Oracle Fusion. I'm focusing on how the requested changes will alter the steps and conditions of the approval process. I'm less focused on the \"Internal Project\" classification now, as this feels more like a configuration adjustment.\n\n\n**Defining System Modification**\n\nI'm now thinking this ticket pertains to a functional system change. The focus is on *modifying* Oracle Fusion's approval workflow, affecting how the system processes expense reports. This seems like a configuration alteration of the Oracle Fusion system itself, not necessarily an \"Internal Project\". I am currently trying to find if there is a more explicit category for these system-level adjustments in the provided schema.\n\n**Analyzing System Configuration**\n\nI'm now honing in on the core of the request. My current thoughts are that the ticket clearly concerns a system configuration within Oracle Fusion, specifically its expense report approval process. While \"Internal Project\" seems like the most fitting category, I am still evaluating if a better fit exists. The emphasis on \"adjustments,\" \"approval flow,\" and \"changes becoming active\" reinforces the idea of a system-level modification.\n\n\n**Defining System Configuration**\n\nI'm now concluding that the ticket pertains to a system *configuration* change.  My analysis of the \"oracle fusion expense report approval flow change\" request points toward a modification of the approval process within the Oracle Fusion system.  This is a system-level adjustment, not necessarily a large-scale project. I'm leaning toward the belief that \"Internal Project\" best encompasses this functional system change.\n\n\n**Refining System Modification**\n\nI'm now revisiting the \"Internal Project\" classification. My current thought is that while a system modification is evident, the work required to adjust the Oracle Fusion approval flow might be substantial enough to constitute an internal IT project. I'm focusing on the implied complexity of the task and its potential resource requirements. This seems more in line with the \"Internal Project\" category now.\n\n\n**Defining Solution Scope**\n\nThe \"oracle fusion expense report approval flow change\" ticket highlights a need for a detailed solution. I've pinpointed an \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category based on the required Oracle Fusion workflow modification. I now need to consider the scope of the change and if there will be significant dependencies or implementation requirements.\n\n\n"
