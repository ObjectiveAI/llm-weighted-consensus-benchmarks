My focus is on whether it leans more towards a network/access issue or a general system malfunction.\n\n**Accessing Remote Resources**\n\nI'm currently refining my categorization of the IT ticket, leaning towards \"Access\" due to the recurring themes of \"remote,\" \"disconnected,\" and \"connection with resources.\" The technical details about \"tun\" and \"cipher\" further suggest a network connectivity problem, fitting this category well.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Issues**\n\nI'm currently finalizing my categorization of the IT ticket, concluding that \"Access \" is the most appropriate classification given the recurring themes of \"remote,\" \"disconnected,\" and \"connection with resources,\" supported by technical terms suggesting network connectivity challenges.\n\n"
