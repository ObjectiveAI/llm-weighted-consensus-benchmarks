After reviewing the available categories: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights,\" I'm leaning toward \"Access\" because password resets typically fall under access management. I'll need to further analyze the full text to confirm this.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've zeroed in on the phrase \"password reset for external user\" as the defining element of this ticket. While \"user directory update\" and other phrases exist, \"password reset\" is the most direct clue. Given the available IT ticket categories, \"Access\" seems like the undeniable match, especially considering the \"external user\" aspect, which implies access control outside the immediate organization.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket Type**\n\nI've taken the ticket text, \"password reset for external user,\" and analyzed its core meaning. The phrase \"password reset\" is the most significant clue, clearly pointing towards an \"Access\" related issue. While I considered other options like \"user directory update,\" \"Access\" remains the best fit.\n\n\n"
