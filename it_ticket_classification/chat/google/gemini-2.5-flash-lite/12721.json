The user's text, while brief, hints strongly at an access issue. I'm carefully analyzing keywords like \"locked out\" and \"unlock\" to see if they decisively place it under the \"Access\" category. I'm also considering the context and the urgency implied by \"asap\". The other categories do not appear as relevant.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've meticulously analyzed the ticket details and categories. The consistent mention of \"account locked out\" and the request to \"unlock\" the account strongly point to an access-related issue. \"Access\" is the most direct and accurate category. The additional information, like \"consultant mobile,\" provides context but doesn't change the core access problem.\n```json\n{\n  \"category\": \"Access\"\n}\n```\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe ticket's text, \"account locked out\", keeps jumping out at me, along with the request to \"unlock.\" \"Consultant mobile\" is context, but the access issue is primary. I've ruled out Hardware, HR, Storage, and other categories based on the language. It's a clear-cut case of an Access issue. I've reevaluated based on the original category options.\n\n\n"
