I'm focusing on the \"Access\" category to proceed.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nI've determined the primary focus of the IT ticket. The problem description, with \"no access\" and \"password incorrect,\" clearly indicates an access issue. \"Access\" is the most direct and accurate categorization, and I've ruled out the other possibilities. This allows me to confidently move forward.\n\n\n"
