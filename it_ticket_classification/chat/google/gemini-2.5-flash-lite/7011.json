The keywords \"new starters,\" \"interns,\" and \"employees,\" combined with \"old cards\" and \"assigned card,\" point toward an access-related issue. My thought process is narrowing in on \"Access\" as the likely classification, but I'm cross-checking against other categories to ensure accuracy.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter reviewing the keyword breakdown, I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\". While \"Access\" is relevant, the core issue seems rooted in employee onboarding and status, functions typically handled within the HR domain. The keywords regarding \"new starters,\" \"interns,\" and card management point directly towards HR processes that IT assists.  I am still evaluating whether \"Access\" overlaps enough to warrant a secondary classification.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Focus**\n\nMy current thinking is firmly anchored on \"HR Support.\" The recurring themes of \"new starters,\" \"interns,\" and card assignments, especially when coupled with their employee status, clearly align with HR's onboarding and offboarding responsibilities. While \"Access\" is a component, the primary focus seems rooted in employee lifecycle management. I'm satisfied that this is the best classification after a thorough review.\n\n\n"
