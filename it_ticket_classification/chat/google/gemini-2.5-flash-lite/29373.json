After analyzing the phrase \"requisition was rejected,\" I'm leaning toward \"Purchase\" as the most suitable category. The wording strongly suggests an issue related to a procurement request.\n\n\n**Analyzing Purchase Details**\n\nI've further delved into the ticket's language. The consistent presence of \"requisition\" solidified my initial assessment. Each phrase points toward a failed procurement request. My analysis of the provided options confirms \"Purchase\" is the most apt category, considering the rejected status. There's no indication it relates to hardware, HR, access, storage, internal projects, administrative rights, or general miscellaneous issues.\n\n\n"
