The limited information suggests a potential \"Access\" issue, given the mention of a password reset. However, the disjointed sentence makes it difficult to definitively rule out other possibilities like \"HR Support\" or \"Miscellaneous\". More information would be ideal.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Classification**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on the phrase \"expired he mentioned he logged his user\". This clarifies the problem as an access issue due to an expired credential.  Given the text \"password reset request\", the \"Access\" category is still the best fit. I've eliminated \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights\" as less relevant. \"Miscellaneous\" remains too broad. The core is regaining user access.\n\n\n"
