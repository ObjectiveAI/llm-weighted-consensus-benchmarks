Device mapping, adapter connection, IP address, subnet mask, and gateway configuration are mentioned. The user needs help regaining access. I'm leaning toward a category.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe focus is now on the user's issue. Network connectivity is the main problem, not hardware malfunction. While considering various categories, I've eliminated \"hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. My analysis suggests \"Access\" as the best fit, as the user clearly wants to regain network access after changes. This seems like the most appropriate classification, moving forward.\n\n\n"
