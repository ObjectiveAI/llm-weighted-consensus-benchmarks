The keywords \"new interns\" and \"bulk starter form\" point toward \"HR Support\". However, the inclusion of \"school center\" and \"school\" is throwing me a bit. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" but still considering \"Miscellaneous\" as a potential fallback, given the broader scope implied. I'll need to further analyze how it relates to the given categories.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've honed in on the HR Support category. The phrases \"new interns\" and \"bulk starter form\" strongly align. While \"school center\" adds context, it doesn't change the core function of the request. I've ruled out \"Miscellaneous\" as HR Support is a better fit and the other categories don't apply. I'm now confident assigning this ticket to HR Support.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, focusing on \"new interns\" and the \"bulk starter form\" context. While \"school center\" provides background, the core request is still HR-related. \"Access\" is a possibility but a secondary consideration. I've eliminated the remaining categories. Based on the analysis, I'm fully committed to classifying this ticket under \"HR Support\".\n\n\n"
