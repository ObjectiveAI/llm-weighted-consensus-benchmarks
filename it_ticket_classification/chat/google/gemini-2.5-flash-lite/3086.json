At this point, I'm leaning toward an HR-related category, specifically based on the mention of \"maternity leave.\" I'm cross-referencing this against other keywords for additional certainty.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI've been examining the ticket text and the possible categories. While there are elements suggestive of reassignment, the \"maternity leave\" context is a clear signal.  My focus has shifted towards confirming that this indeed falls under HR support or related processes. I'm exploring the implications of reassignment in this context further.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been evaluating the ticket text, considering the possible categories. While the \"reassigning\" aspects are present, the definitive clue is \"maternity leave.\" My analysis centers on the implication of this keyword, alongside the context of task rerouting. My current leaning is towards confirming this as \"HR Support\" with access or duty reassignment implications, considering it fits the most with the ticket content.\n\n\n"
