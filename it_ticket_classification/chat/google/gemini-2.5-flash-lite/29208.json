My approach involves analyzing the text content of each ticket against the established schema to identify the most fitting category. I am working through the schema to find the best match. I'm focusing on the keywords and phrases within the schema to develop rules.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Purchase Intent**\n\nI've honed in on the ticket's core request: a backpack purchase. Analysis of phrases like \"backpack purchased,\" \"receipts,\" and \"log storing\" solidified my inclination toward the \"Purchase\" category. While \"Storage\" was a contender, the context indicates logging the purchase, not IT data storage. I am now confident in this decision.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Purchase Request**\n\nI've determined the ticket's core to be a request for a backpack purchase. My analysis pinpointed keywords like \"backpack purchased\" and \"receipts,\" making \"Purchase\" the most relevant category. While \"Storage\" was considered due to \"log storing,\" the context is about documenting the purchase. The schema was analyzed to confirm a fit. Now, I am confident with the categorization decision.\n\n\n"
