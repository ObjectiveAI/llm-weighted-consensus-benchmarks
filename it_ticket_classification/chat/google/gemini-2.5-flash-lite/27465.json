The text mentions things like a \"new starter\" and a \"starter form\". This strongly suggests I should categorize the ticket under \"HR Support\". I'm still weighing this against the other options, but the evidence is compelling. I'll need to double-check that this is the best fit, but so far I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n**Reviewing HR Context**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's text, focusing on the \"starter form\" and \"new starter\" aspects. These phrases strongly point towards HR processes, making \"HR Support\" the leading category. Although IT might be involved in setting up access or resources, the primary issue stems from an HR-related onboarding procedure. I'm solidifying my assessment; the origin is distinctly HR-driven.\n\n\n**Assessing Onboarding Context**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's text, now analyzing the \"new starter\" context as a potential lead. I'm focusing on the onboarding process. Although IT might provide hardware or access, the core requirement revolves around a \"starter form,\" indicating that the ticket's root is HR-driven. The specifics of the text don't definitively exclude other categories, but the \"starter form\" indicates the ticket's initiation is clearly HR related.\n\n\n**Identifying the Primary Request**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the essence of the IT ticket. I've broken down the text, focusing on keywords like \"starter form\" and \"new starter.\"  My analysis shows that, despite IT's likely involvement in the overall setup, the primary action stems from an HR-initiated onboarding process. The \"starter form\" is the initial trigger. I'm confident \"HR Support\" is the optimal category.\n\n\n"
