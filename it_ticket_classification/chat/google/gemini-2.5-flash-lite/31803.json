The phrase \"cannot upload\" suggests access issues might be relevant. The term \"contract\" could hint at various possibilities, potentially leading me to lean toward HR support or purchase issues, so I will investigate further.\n\n\n**Assessing Ticket Details**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the ticket text, searching for clues. The user's inability to upload something, combined with the mention of \"contract,\" points me towards a possible \"Access\" issue. However, I'm also considering implications for HR support, perhaps related to contract access and upload, so I'll review further for more specific context.\n\n\n**Identifying the Root Cause**\n\nThe ticket text still suggests an \"Access\" issue because the contract cannot be uploaded or viewed, and its storage location is inaccessible. I am carefully considering if the \"Storage\" category also applies, but at this stage \"Access\" seems to be more applicable. Specifically, the \"document section\" inaccessibility and proxy mention are adding to my thinking.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category: \"Access\". The user's inability to upload and the inaccessible storage location are the crux. \"Storage\" is relevant, but it's the lack of *access* that's the primary problem. This aligns with the \"cannot add/view\" statements, pointing to broader access issues, not just storage failure.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Root Problem**\n\nI've just finished analyzing the ticket, focusing on keyword matching to identify the best fit. Given the recurring mentions of upload failure, inaccessible storage, and the inability to view the document, it's clear the primary issue is about *access*, not storage per se. \"Access\" encompasses the problem more completely, including both the inability to upload and the inaccessibility of the file location, and I am confident that is the category to utilize.\n\n\n"
