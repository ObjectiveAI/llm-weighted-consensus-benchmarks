I've noted \"maternity leaver hardware\", \"maternity leave\", \"timecards,\" and \"administration officer\". The goal is to map this to the correct category: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\". My initial hunch leans towards HR Support or possibly Access, but I'm being thorough.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Request**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. Analyzing the ticket content, the combination of \"maternity leaver,\" \"timecards,\" and \"administration officer\" steers me toward \"HR Support.\" The \"hardware\" mention is likely incidental, related to the person's current hardware access needs before leave. The administrative form further cements this as HR-related, rather than Access or Hardware.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Scope**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket content, focusing on the context of the user's upcoming maternity leave. The \"hardware\" mention is contextual, not the central issue. \"Timecards\" and \"administration officer\" solidify the HR nature of the ticket. After eliminating the options, I am certain \"HR Support\" is the correct categorization.\n\n\n"
