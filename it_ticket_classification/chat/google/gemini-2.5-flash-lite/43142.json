It seems like the text points to connectivity issues, so I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Hardware.\" I'm also considering the possibility that it could be more general, fitting under \"Miscellaneous\". I'm still weighing the best fit.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've been honing in on the best category for this ticket, and the \"Access\" option keeps standing out. The phrases \"keeps trying to connect but fails\" and \"requests password every few minutes\" really solidified this. I've ruled out \"Hardware\" as the text doesn't explicitly refer to hardware problems, and \"Miscellaneous\" feels too broad when \"Access\" seems so specific. The other categories are clearly irrelevant to the described issue. Access looks like the most relevant fit.\n\n\n**Assessing Ticket Details**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on classifying the IT ticket. After re-evaluating, the phrases \"keeps trying connect but fails\" and \"requests password every few minutes\" remain critical. I initially considered \"Access,\" and that feels even more accurate now. The text doesn't explicitly point to \"Hardware,\" so I'm moving away from that. \"Miscellaneous\" seems too broad given that \"Access\" appears highly relevant, considering the symptoms. The other categories seem irrelevant.\n\n\n"
