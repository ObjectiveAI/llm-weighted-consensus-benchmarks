My current focus is on extracting keywords and phrases to map them to the predefined classifications.\n\n**Determining Employee Access Issues**\n\nI've been examining the user's request regarding a \"missing employee\" and an employee \"showing under.\" My current analysis points strongly towards an access management or employee data synchronization problem, likely requiring a category within IT support that deals with user accounts and system presence.\n\n**Categorizing User Data Issues**\n\nI've refined my understanding and concluded that the user's query most closely aligns with an \"Access\" category. The phrases \"missing employee\" and \"employee showing under\" directly suggest problems with user account provisioning, status, or visibility within IT systems, all of which fall under access management.\n\n**Classifying Employee Status Issues**\n\nI've analyzed the user's input, specifically the phrases \"missing employee\" and \"employee showing under,\" and have concluded that these directly relate to access management. My current thought is that this falls squarely under the \"Access\" category, as it implies issues with user accounts, their presence in systems, or their associated permissions.\n\n"
