I'm carefully analyzing the provided text to pinpoint the central problem and then categorize it. My focus is on effectively mapping the identified issue to the most fitting category from the defined list: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\".\n\n\n**Focusing on Categorization**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and I think the main issue is related to submitting time cards for approval, which clearly falls under HR processes. There's nothing physical or particularly related to access. It's really about the function of submitting the time card and the issues related to that process. \"HR Support\" seems like the most fitting category for these problems, rather than miscellaneous, as this seems quite specific.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Problem**\n\nI've been going through the text, and the main issue seems to be the repeated rejections of submitted time cards and difficulties with their submission process. I'm carefully trying to interpret the different error messages and reported behaviors to determine the underlying technical or procedural glitch. The text implies a core problem is an HR-related system malfunction.\n\n\n"
