I'm considering \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" as potential matches, but I'll need to consider other keywords as well.\n\n\n**Defining Access Issues**\n\nI've refined my initial analysis, recognizing the primary concern revolves around \"documentation rights\" within Confluence. The term \"members\" strongly suggests a group access issue. Therefore, the \"Access\" category appears to be the most accurate fit. I am now considering the sub-context of 'documentation' within the scope of \"Access\" to pinpoint the problem.\n\n\n**Determining Category Selection**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and the available categories. The core issue is clearly about \"documentation rights\" in Confluence, which I think points to the need for specific permissions for 'members'. While \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility, I'm leaning toward the broader \"Access\" category because the ticket's language doesn't explicitly state it is specifically an administrative permission request. I'm focusing on why a user would require access to Confluence, so I'll go with \"Access.\"\n\n\n"
