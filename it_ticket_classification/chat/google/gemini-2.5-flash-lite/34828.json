It leans towards a software glitch, but could also be a system-wide issue. Need to refine the definition of \"issue\" to accurately match it to the provided categories. Might need to expand my understanding of \"Miscellaneous\" to encompass this.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Categorization**\n\nI've been honing in on the \"Miscellaneous\" category. The pop-up issue's vagueness makes it a tricky fit elsewhere. While a software glitch is likely, the text doesn't explicitly link it to any specific hardware or access needs. Considering the breadth of \"Miscellaneous,\" it now seems the most logical landing spot for this ticket, unless further details arise.\n\n\n"
