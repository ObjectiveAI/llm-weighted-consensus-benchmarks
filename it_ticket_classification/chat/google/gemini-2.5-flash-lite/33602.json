I am cross-referencing this assessment with other potential categories to refine the classification. The goal is to ensure the ticket is accurately categorized for the user. I'll need to carefully review the provided categories.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Category Match**\n\nI've closely analyzed the ticket text, repeatedly seeing \"approve requisition\" in various contexts. The supporting details \u2013 \"amount,\" \"requester,\" \"justification,\" and the mention of \"mice\" \u2013 solidify the \"Purchase\" category as the most appropriate. I'm confident in this classification, given the strong evidence pointing towards a purchasing request.\n\n\n"
