The ticket's content, \"annual leave request\" and \"annual leave pm,\" suggests it falls under the \"HR Support\" category.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text more deeply. While there are mentions of platforms and technical aspects, the core focus consistently circles back to managing annual leave. The detailed descriptions of leave requests, balances, and approval processes solidify the \"HR Support\" category as the most accurate fit. Even system updates related to leave are fundamentally HR administrative tasks.\n\n\n"
