The repeated phrase and the absence of any other subject confirm this. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the most appropriate category since it involves authorization. Considering the brief description, I am seeking more information if it is needed.\n\n\n**Determining the best fit**\n\nI've determined that \"Access\" is the most fitting category for the ticket. The description centers around \"changing password,\" which is fundamentally tied to user access control. The solved status suggests it was an access issue. I am now finalizing the categorization based on this direct linkage to access management.\n\n\n"
