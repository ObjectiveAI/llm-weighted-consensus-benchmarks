I've categorized it initially as \"Access\" because it seems related to permission or display issues within the application. I'm exploring whether the \"Internal Project\" label could also be relevant if this team is associated with a specific project.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've re-evaluated the categorization. While the initial focus was on the \"outlook pm\" feature, the recurring \"manager change\" theme is more central. The actions mentioned (\"approve request,\" \"assigning manager\") strongly suggest an HR-related process. This leans towards \"HR Support\" being the primary category, with \"Access\" as a secondary concern given the feature visibility issue.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. While the \"outlook pm\" visibility initially suggested an \"Access\" or \"Internal Project\" angle, the constant thread of \"manager change\" is more prominent.  The actions described, approving requests and assigning managers, scream HR-related process. Consequently, I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\" as the primary category, with \"Access\" playing a secondary, supporting role due to the feature visibility problem.\n\n\n"
