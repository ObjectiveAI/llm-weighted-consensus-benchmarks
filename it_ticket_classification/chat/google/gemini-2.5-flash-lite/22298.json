Considering the user input, \"Access\" seems the most fitting category for now. I'm carefully analyzing the text to ensure no other aspects warrant a different classification before finalizing.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Focus**\n\nI've determined the central issue is access, specifically to restricted files, as highlighted in the ticket text. While administrative rights are intertwined, the explicit request centers around file accessibility. I'm prioritizing \"Access\" based on the user's need. I'm proceeding by confirming my conclusion via the provided information.\n\n\n**Confirming Ticket Type**\n\nI've examined the ticket content more closely, focusing on phrases like \"access to restricted files.\" My analysis rules out Hardware, HR Support, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project and Miscellaneous. Though Administrative Rights is related to access, the primary issue is file access, leading me to pick \"Access.\" I'm now drafting the JSON output.\n\n\n"
