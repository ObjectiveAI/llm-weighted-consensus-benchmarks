The phrases \"secure the floor\" and \"restricted resources\" point me toward access-related issues. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" for now, but I will double-check to ensure no other category better fits before confirming.\n\n\n**Defining Access Controls**\n\nMy current thinking centers on solidifying \"Access\" as the appropriate category. Reviewing the ticket's language, such as \"secure the floor\" and \"restricted resources,\" reinforces this categorization. The request details point to restricting physical entry to specified areas. Even the mention of \"meeting rooms\" and booking reflects access management needs. I've ruled out other categories, and \"Access\" appears to be the most accurate fit.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Access Request**\n\nI've determined that \"Access\" is the most accurate category for the ticket. The phrase \"secure the floor tower\" clearly indicates an access-related concern. Further text reinforcing the importance of restricted resources solidified the decision. I've considered other categories, such as \"Internal Project,\" but the core requirement centers on managing physical access. I'm ready to move forward.\n\n\n"
