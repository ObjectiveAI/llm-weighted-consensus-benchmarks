The wording suggests access-related issues due to \"approver\" and \"requests members.\" I'm carefully considering how to frame this within the provided list. Is \"Access\" the right category? I'm weighing it against other options.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've decided to categorize this as \"Administrative rights\". The phrases \"approver for team\" and \"change approver\" clearly point towards a request for role-based access adjustments. While \"Access\" could be considered, \"Administrative rights\" is more precise, indicating the management of permissions which is central to changing an approver. I've ruled out the other categories as irrelevant to the core issue.\n\n\n"
