The ticket's content suggests a problem, but the specific nature of the error remains unclear. I'm carefully analyzing the provided text to uncover clues that will help pinpoint the most relevant category. So far, the phrases \"error trying use reports\" and \"getting error\" have jumped out, so I'll be sure to search for more phrases.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket's Fit**\n\nI've finished categorizing the ticket as \"Miscellaneous\". While I initially considered other options like \"Access\", the descriptions and details presented in the ticket point towards a generalized software error related to generating reports. It appears there may be an issue with reports which does not fit in other categories. It seems that \"Miscellaneous\" is the most apt choice. The user attempted some basic troubleshooting, suggesting the problem is beyond a simple access problem or configuration.\n\n\n"
