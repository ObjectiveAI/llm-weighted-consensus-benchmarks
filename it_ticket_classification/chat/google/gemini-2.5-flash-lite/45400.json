I've parsed the text, focusing on recurring phrases, and the \"main door\" keeps popping up. This seems crucial. I'm actively determining if this relates to access, hardware, or another category. Currently leaning towards access, but still analyzing the full context.\n\n\n**Confirming the Category**\n\nI've validated that \"Access\" is the correct category. The evidence is clear. The ticket consistently refers to a main door malfunctioning and opening without proper card authentication. This points firmly to an access control issue, eliminating other potential categories like hardware or HR support.\n\n\n"
