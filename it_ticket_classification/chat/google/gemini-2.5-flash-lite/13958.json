My aim is to accurately map the described issue to one of the available categories, ensuring precise categorization for efficient resolution.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket details, and the recurring themes of \"lost cards,\" \"disabling cards,\" \"assigning cards,\" and \"doors\" strongly indicate that the core issue relates to access control and management. Based on this, I've concluded the most appropriate category is **Access**.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the provided text, focusing on recurring terms like \"lost cards,\" \"assigning cards,\" and references to \"doors\" and \"facility.\" These elements collectively point to issues centered around access control and management. Therefore, I've definitively assigned the ticket to the **Access** category.\n\n"
