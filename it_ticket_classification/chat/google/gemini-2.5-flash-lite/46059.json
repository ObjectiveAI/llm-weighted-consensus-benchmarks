The initial text suggests an Outlook problem, which needs a more precise classification. I'm carefully considering the available options: \"Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, Administrative rights.\" The goal is pinpointing the most fitting category for efficient resolution.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've determined that the appropriate category for this ticket is \"Access.\" The text consistently points to a permissions problem, with repeated mentions of \"access denied\" and \"permission issue.\" Although \"Administrative rights\" is related, \"Access\" is a more direct match, reflecting the user's immediate concern about directory access. This categorization streamlines resolution by directly connecting the ticket to the relevant department.\n\n\n"
