I'm focusing on those keywords: \"new access\" and \"visitors\", to try to find the proper category, I believe it is \"access\".\n\n\n**Analyzing the Text**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the potential categories. The user's request is quite clear, focusing on \"new access\" and \"members.\" I'm honing in on the keywords to determine if the ticket relates to HR Support, Access, or Miscellaneous. My thoughts are focusing on the implications of \"access\" for visitors or members.\n\n\n**Identifying the Core Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the fundamental issue. While \"new access\" and \"members\" remain central, the process of getting this access (filling out a form) has come into focus. I'm carefully comparing the keywords against the defined categories to pinpoint the best match. This highlights the process for access, not just the access itself. The \"Access\" category feels even more fitting, given it encompasses the procedural element.\n\n\n"
