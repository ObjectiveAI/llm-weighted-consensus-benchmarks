So far, the description mentions \"server performance issues during update procedure.\" I'm mentally comparing this to the possible categories: \"Hardware,\" \"Internal Project,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Administrative Rights,\" as well as the other options. This seems like it could fall under a few categories, but I'm leaning toward hardware, storage, or internal project issues. Need more information to confirm.\n\n\n**Assessing Server Performance**\n\nI've got a clearer picture of the IT ticket now. The repeated phrasing \"server performance issues during update procedure\" makes \"Hardware\" the most obvious category. Increasing CPU and disk resources confirms this diagnosis. The issue directly stems from hardware limitations during the update process, as I can see it. It is not an access or HR issue.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nMy focus is narrowing in on the optimal category. The updated details confirm the \"Hardware\" diagnosis as the primary issue. The symptoms described \u2013 servers struggling during update procedures, requests for increased CPU cores and disk \u2013 point squarely towards hardware limitations. While \"Storage\" is relevant, the overall server performance problem encompasses more than just disk space, so I'm choosing hardware.\n\n\n"
