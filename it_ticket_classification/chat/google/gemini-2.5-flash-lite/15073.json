Identifying the core issue seems key. Keywords like \"mailbox\" and \"increase\" are standing out. I need to determine if it's about storage, access, or perhaps something else entirely, like an administrative request.\n\n\n**Determining the Category**\n\nI've analyzed the expanded ticket text, specifically focusing on \"mailbox increase space\" and similar phrases. The priority is to match these keywords with the provided categories. \"Hardware,\" \"HR,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative Rights\" are all clearly off-target. However, \"Storage\" emerges as the perfect fit for this specific resource issue, as the user needs to enlarge the email storage capacity.\n\n\n"
