I'm carefully examining phrases like \"issues accessing systems\" to accurately map them to predefined categories such as \"Access,\" \"Hardware,\" or others. My goal is to develop a reliable and efficient classification process for IT support requests.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nI've determined the ideal classification for the ticket. After analyzing phrases indicating trouble with access, such as \"issues accessing systems\" and \"cannot access application\", the correct categorization is now fixed as \"Access.\" The phrases strongly suggest issues with accessing systems or applications. I think this approach is promising.\n\n\n"
