I've analyzed the text, specifically noting mentions of \"changing security\" related to \"caps pilot.\" I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the most relevant category because of these security-related keywords. However, I am still reviewing to ensure this is the best fit.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating Category Options**\n\nMy analysis has evolved. I've been debating between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The core of the issue is managing security and permissions, therefore, controlling who and what has access. While both categories are relevant, I'm leaning more towards \"Access.\" This is because the text explicitly references \"changing security\" related to access, which seems to fit it best. I'm focusing on the nature of access changes.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nMy thinking has sharpened. While \"Administrative rights\" initially seemed suitable, I've concluded \"Access\" is more precise. The ticket's focus on \"changing security\" and \"allow running nodes\" points directly to access control. The core issue is managing system permissions and who has access to the \"caps pilot.\" \"Access\" encompasses both the user's ability and the system's security settings.\n\n\n"
