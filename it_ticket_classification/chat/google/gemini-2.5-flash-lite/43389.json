The repeated mentions of \"book meeting rooms offices\" strongly suggest an access or permissions issue related to meeting room scheduling. I'm leaning toward \"Access/Permissions\" as the primary category, but I'll double-check for any conflicting clues before finalizing.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus remains on \"Access\" as the most suitable category. The ticket text's repeated emphasis on \"permissions\" for booking meeting rooms solidifies this. I've ruled out the other categories like \"Hardware\" or \"HR Support\" because they don't align with the core issue described. The issue is purely about the ability to perform a specific action \u2013 booking a room \u2013 which is an access control problem.\n\n\n"
