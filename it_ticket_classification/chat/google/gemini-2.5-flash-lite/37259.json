While \"Access\" could be loosely relevant, I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support.\" It aligns perfectly with the core problem: managing time entries and dealing with submission errors, which are clearly HR-centric tasks. I'm focusing on ensuring this classification is accurate and that overlaps with other categories are minimal.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm now completely decided on \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate category. The time card and submission entry problems make it a perfect fit. I've re-examined \"Access\", but it doesn't quite match the core issue of system functionality, as it isn't an explicit access *request*. I believe this focus on HR Support is the right path to accurately classify the issue, and avoid overlap with other possible ticket categories.\n\n\n"
