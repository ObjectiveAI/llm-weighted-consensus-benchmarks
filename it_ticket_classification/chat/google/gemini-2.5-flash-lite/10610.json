Based on the keywords, it looks like they want access rights. I need to make sure this fits the \"Access\" category because the ticket mentions \"preparer rights\" and \"requester preparer rights\". It seems to me this is about granting or changing permissions.\n\n\n**Identifying the Core Request**\n\nI'm focusing on the user's intent. The ticket's content clearly centers on \"preparer rights,\" specifically mentioning \"procurement,\" \"requester,\" and general \"preparer\" rights. It's about access levels in a system, which leans strongly towards the \"Access\" category. The keywords \"rights\" and \"access\" clinch it. The presence of \"procurement\" is noted.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've been further dissecting the user's request. It's become even clearer that the emphasis is on \"preparer rights,\" a type of permission within a system. Although \"procurement\" is mentioned, the core need is to enable someone to *do* something, rather than acquire something. After careful analysis, I've re-affirmed that \"Access\" is the most precise category.\n\n\n"
