I've noted \"blocked\" and \"status error,\" which strongly suggest an \"Access\" or potentially \"HR Support\" issue, depending on what's being blocked. I will continue my investigation.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the central problem: a blocked time card, leading to a status error and a request to unblock. This definitively points towards \"Access\" as the prime category. \"HR Support\" remains a secondary possibility, but the primary issue is the access restriction. The language itself, \"blocked\" and \"unblock,\" strongly reinforces this.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nMy focus has shifted to the explicit language of the ticket. \"Blocked card\" and the request to \"unblock\" decisively point to an \"Access\" issue. While HR might be tangentially involved, the core problem is access restriction, not a HR-specific process. I've ruled out the other categories as less relevant based on the ticket's phrasing.\n\n\n"
