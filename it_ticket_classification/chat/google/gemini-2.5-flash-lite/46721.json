The mention of \"upgrade\" is a key indicator, and I'm considering how it best fits within the available options like \"Hardware\" or potentially \"Miscellaneous\" depending on the broader context.\n\n**Determining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm focusing on assigning the most fitting IT ticket category. The presence of \"upgrade\" and \"failed\" in the text strongly points towards issues with system enhancements. I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the primary classification, considering it often encompasses system-level software upgrades that encounter problems, but I am still evaluating if a more specific category might be overlooked.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI'm narrowing down the IT ticket category. The terms \"upgrade\" and \"failed\" strongly suggest a problem during a system enhancement process. I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the most probable classification, considering that system-level upgrades and their failures are often managed within this domain.\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Data**\n\nI'm currently processing the provided text to determine the most fitting IT ticket category.
