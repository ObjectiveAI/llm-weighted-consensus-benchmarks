I see the text mentions password expiration and needing a reset, which immediately points toward an access-related issue. The \"importance high\" tag also informs the process. I will consider further factors.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI've closely examined the provided ticket text, noting the repeated phrases around password expiration and the user's inability to reset their password independently. My analysis considered each potential category: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. While other categories might touch on related aspects, the core issue is clearly user access management, leading me to definitively select \"Access\" as the most suitable classification for this specific IT ticket.\n\n\n"
