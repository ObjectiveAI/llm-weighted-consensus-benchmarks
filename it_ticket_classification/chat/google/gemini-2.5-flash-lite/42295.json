I'm focusing on \"Access\" and \"Internal Project,\" as they appear to be most relevant based on the phrases: \"cannot seem find any codes,\" \"include joining our records,\" and \"submit part his one projects codes.\" I am considering also if a \"thank you\" indicates a closed ticket, which might mean a ticket is mis-categorized. I will update the category accordingly.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm now identifying keyword phrases in the text. \"Access\" and \"Internal Project\" remain primary contenders, but the presence of \"joining our records,\" \"transfer formalities,\" and the need to \"add member\" are pulling me toward \"HR Support.\" There seems to be a significant element related to project codes and permissions, so I will now consider whether \"Access\" and \"Internal Project\" are also applicable.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket Focus**\n\nI'm now identifying the most relevant keywords. While \"Access\" appears, the emphasis on project codes and member addition makes \"Internal Project\" the primary category. \"HR Support\" also feels appropriate given the mention of \"joining our records,\" but the project-related aspects are more central. The ticket seems focused on adding someone to a project and assigning them codes.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nThe ticket's core focus is now crystal clear. While \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" are present, I've confirmed that the critical need is related to a project, as emphasized by \"submit part his one projects codes\" and \"cannot add him our forecast.\" This firmly places it within the \"Internal Project\" category.\n\n\n**Categorizing Project-Related Tasks**\n\nI'm now focusing on the core issue: the inability to add someone to project forecasts. The phrase \"cannot add him our forecast\" strongly implies a project resource management problem, solidifying \"Internal Project\" as the primary category, while the mention of \"Access\" might represent the pathway to a solution.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Focus**\n\nMy focus has shifted.  I'm now zeroing in on the \"Internal Project\" classification.  The core issue stems from difficulty with project resource allocation, as highlighted by \"submit part his one projects codes\".  Although \"Access\" comes up, it's more of a facilitator to the main goal of integrating someone into project planning.\n\n\n"
