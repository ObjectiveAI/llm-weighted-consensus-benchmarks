The core action is clearly \"access,\" but the specific mention of \"people operations\" strongly suggests that the target system or function falls under an HR domain, leading me to consider \"HR Support\" as a highly relevant category.\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Request**\n\nI'm currently processing the ticket's core intent. The explicit phrasing \"wants to access people operations\" strongly suggests the primary need is for granting system access, making the \"Access\" category the most fitting choice given the direct action requested.\n\n**Analyzing HR Access Needs**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the ticket's intent. The explicit mention of \"people operations\" strongly suggests a need related to HR functions, and the desire to \"access\" this area points towards provisioning specific permissions within HR systems.\n\n**Categorizing HR Access**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the ticket's intent.
