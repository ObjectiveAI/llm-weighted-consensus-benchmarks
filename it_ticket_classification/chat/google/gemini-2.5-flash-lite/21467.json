Keywords like \"folder reports\" and \"folders across different sectors\" are giving me strong indicators. I'm leaning toward \"Storage\" as the primary area of concern, but I need to make sure there are no other conflicting keywords before finalizing that thought.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and the provided categories to determine the best fit. Given keywords like \"folder reports,\" \"move files,\" and \"store related document,\" \"Storage\" still feels like the most accurate choice. I've ruled out other categories like \"Access\" and \"HR Support\" because the focus is on file management, not user permissions or human resources. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too broad when \"Storage\" provides a better match.\n\n\n"
