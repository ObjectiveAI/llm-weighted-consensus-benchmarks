The phrases \"remove,\" \"take out,\" and the mention of \"leaders\" and \"resource\" strongly suggest access control or a modification of permissions. Initially, the wording is vague, but the context points towards Access. I am going with the category \"Access\".\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've been further refining my thinking. While \"Administrative rights\" seems plausible, the phrase \"remove from the team\" leans more strongly toward the broader concept of \"Access\". It seems to imply revoking access or membership within a group, not just specific administrative privileges. The multiple mentions of \"leaders\" support this. I'm solidifying my conclusion that \"Access\" is the most fitting category.\n\n\n**Defining the Scope Further**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best fit. While \"Administrative rights\" remains a consideration, the overarching action centers on access management. The ticket's emphasis on removing someone from the \"team\" tilts me toward the more inclusive category of \"Access.\" This removal suggests modification of access privileges within a group. The context supports that \"Access\" covers both basic and administrative functions.\n\n\n"
