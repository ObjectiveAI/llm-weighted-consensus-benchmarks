The persistent \"expired certificate\" keyword strongly indicates an \"Access\" issue, as these directly impact system and service authentication.\n\n**Assigning IT Tickets**\n\nMy current task involves categorizing IT tickets. The repeated mention of \"expired certificate\" strongly suggests this ticket pertains to an \"Access\" issue, as certificate expiration directly impacts secure system and service accessibility.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI'm focused on categorizing the IT ticket. The repeated mention of \"expired certificate,\" especially in conjunction with a \"build machine\" and an urgent \"install asap,\" strongly points towards an \"Access\" related issue, as certificate expiration directly impacts secure system functionality and potentially prevents access to necessary resources for development processes.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Root Cause**\n\nI'm actively processing the ticket content. The repeated emphasis on \"expired certificate\", coupled with the context of a \"build machine\" and urgent \"install asap,\" strongly suggests that the core issue relates to system functionality and secure communication, making \"Access\" the most fitting category.\n\n**Resolving Access Issues**\n\nI'm categorizing the IT ticket. The repeated mention of \"expired certificate\" strongly suggests this ticket pertains to an \"Access\" issue, as certificate expiration directly impacts secure system and service accessibility.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the IT ticket's content to assign it to the most suitable category. The repeated mention of \"expired certificate\" strongly indicates an issue with system or service \"Access\", as certificate expiration directly impedes secure authentication and functionality.\n\n"
