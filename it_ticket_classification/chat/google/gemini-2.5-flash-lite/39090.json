I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" because of \"maternity leave,\" but the technical aspects complicate things.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nIt looks like I'm still weighing my options. While \"Storage\" is relevant because the mailbox is full, the root cause is the user's absence due to maternity leave.  \"HR Support\" seems more accurate, as the issue stems from HR-related policy (leave) and requires a process that likely involves HR. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" because it encompasses the broader context and the need for a solution related to an employee on leave. I am still considering \"Access\" as a possibility but think \"HR Support\" has a slight edge.\n\n\n**Revisiting the Choice**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket, focusing on the root cause and impact. While \"Storage\" and \"Access\" were initially considered, the context of \"maternity leave\" shifted my perspective. The undeliverable messages are a symptom of an HR-related issue. The core problem revolves around managing an employee's IT resources during a leave of absence, which suggests a need for HR coordination. It seems like the best fit is \"HR Support\". The keywords like \"maternity leave\" and the user needing help with a problem that is clearly connected to the employee's leave supports this choice.\n\n\n"
