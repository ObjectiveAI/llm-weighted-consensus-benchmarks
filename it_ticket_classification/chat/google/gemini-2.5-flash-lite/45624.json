However, I need to evaluate the context carefully to rule out other options like \"HR Support\" or \"Internal Project,\" which could potentially overlap. The focus is to make sure this is correctly categorized, to ensure that the user can get their issue resolved appropriately.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nMy current thinking is zeroing in on a few possibilities. While \"HR Support\" seems relevant due to the annual leave requests and employee welcome messages, there's a strong undercurrent of access-related issues impacting the approval flow. \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" are in the running since there are recurring issues with developers not being able to make the requests. The core problem appears to be that requests are not going through the correct channels or that people don't have access.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Classification**\n\nThe problem seems to be centred on the annual leave requests and new employee onboarding. Although the user has referred to access, my primary focus is on how it impacts the approval flow. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate category, since the core issue revolves around HR processes like leave management and new hire onboarding, even though these are related to access control. The next step is to further investigate access as the root cause of why annual leave is not being properly approved.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Annual Leave Request**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on why annual leave requests aren't going through. \"HR Support\" keeps coming up as I focus on the employee onboarding and annual leave requests in the approval flow. Though access is mentioned, the core problem is about the HR workflow failing, not necessarily a lack of access. The ongoing issues of new hires and the approval process keeps coming back.\n\n\n"
