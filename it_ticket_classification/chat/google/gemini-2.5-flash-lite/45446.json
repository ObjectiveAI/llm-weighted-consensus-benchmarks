                    "reasoning": "**Identifying the Core Issue**\n\nI'm currently focused on the challenge of accurately categorizing this IT ticket. The text, \"add to sent monday december secure documents\", presents a brief, potentially ambiguous, request.  My immediate thought is that it concerns data security or access, given the presence of the word \"secure\". I'm weighing whether it implies a need for access, or perhaps storage, related to secure documents.\n\n\n**Categorizing Secure Documents**\n\nI'm now thinking the text is best categorized under \"Access,\" though it's a close call. My initial focus on \"secure\" and the frequent mentions of \"documents\" and their transmission is leading me to favor this category. While \"Storage\" was considered, the emphasis is more on the *secure handling* and *communication* of the documents, rather than long-term storage. I've also eliminated \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Miscellaneous\" as they are clearly less relevant. The goal is to classify the nature of the *request*, and it seems that requesting a secure handling of documents would fall within the \"Access\" category, as it relates to how one is granted access and protection of the confidential files.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket's Purpose**\n\nI'm now focusing on whether the nature of the request, with the focus on \"add to sent monday december secure documents\" is about a reporting or logging function related to secure documents. The numerous mentions of security, confidentiality, and document transmission strengthen the idea of a procedural or informational ticket, best suited for \"Miscellaneous.\" The initial focus on \"Access\" now seems less fitting, considering the core issue is the handling and tracking of already-secure documents, and not obtaining access.\n\n\n\n**Revising Category Scope**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's core function. The ticket's primary goal isn't to grant or restrict access, but to ensure secure and confidential document handling and transmission. The frequent mention of \"secure documents,\" \"confidentiality,\" and the action of \"add to sent\" point towards the procedural aspects of handling sensitive information. It seems a \"Miscellaneous\" category would best cover the request for procedural clarification/issue related to secure document forwarding, not any other existing category. The json output is as shown below.\n```json\n{\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}\n```\n\n\n"
