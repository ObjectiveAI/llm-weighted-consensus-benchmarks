After analyzing the keywords, \"service recovery\" and \"restore,\" I'm leaning toward \"Storage\" as the primary category. The phrase \"annual service recovery test service name restore location confirmed test expected\" clearly suggests issues related to data restoration or storage functionality, making \"Storage\" the most suitable choice.\n\n\n**Evaluating Category Fit**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the best category for this ticket. While \"Storage\" seemed plausible initially, the comprehensive testing and procedural nature make \"Internal Project\" a better fit. The recurring, annual testing and related documentation suggest a planned internal process, not solely a storage issue. This shifts my focus away from the data itself and towards the execution of a recovery plan, including code and template.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Decision**\n\nI've been drilling down on this ticket's core function. I'm now certain \"Internal Project\" best captures the essence. The emphasis on testing, the annual nature of the recovery procedure, and the explicit mention of documentation, code, and work instructions solidify this. It's not just about restoring data; it's about a well-defined process. This shifts the focus from a singular storage issue to a broader, internally managed project.\n\n\n"
