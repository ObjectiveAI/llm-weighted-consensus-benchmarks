Based on the keywords \"internal transfer\" and \"remove from,\" I'm leaning towards \"Access\" or potentially \"Administrative rights,\" considering what the user needs removed during their transfer.\n\n**Assigning IT Ticket Categories**\n\nI'm processing an IT ticket focused on an internal transfer. The text mentions removing users from groups and mailboxes, along with roles being adjusted. This suggests \"HR Support\" as a primary category due to the transfer context, with \"Access\" being a strong secondary consideration due to the permission-related actions described.\n\n**Refining IT Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm currently refining the categorization of an IT ticket related to an internal transfer. While \"Access\" is a strong candidate due to actions like removing users from groups and mailboxes, the overarching \"internal transfer\" context points towards \"HR Support\" as the primary classification, with \"Access\" remaining a crucial secondary consideration.\n\n**Categorizing Employee Transfers**\n\nI'm refining my categorization for an IT ticket. Given the emphasis on \"internal transfer,\" \"remove from groups,\" \"mailboxes transfer,\" and \"roles removed,\" I've landed on \"HR Support\" as the primary category, as this process typically originates from HR. \"Access\" remains a critical secondary consideration for the specific actions involved.\n\n"
