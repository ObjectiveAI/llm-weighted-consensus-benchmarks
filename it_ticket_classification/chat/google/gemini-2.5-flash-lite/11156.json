I'm focusing on keywords and phrases that will help me choose one category among these choices: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", or \"Administrative rights\".  The current text isn't very helpful for a concrete selection at this moment, but I am still actively looking.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and am leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category. The repeated references to \"project setup\", \"setup form\", and \"details\" make this the best fit. I've ruled out other categories like \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", and \"Administrative rights\" based on the absence of relevant keywords. Now I want to focus my thoughts on if there is any evidence it would be anything but \"Internal Project\".\n\n\n**Concluding the Classification**\n\nI've carefully reviewed the ticket text, and now I'm certain that the \"Internal Project\" category is the best fit. I'm basing this on the consistent presence of project-related keywords and phrases like \"project setup\" and \"setup form.\" I've ruled out all other categories after thorough consideration of each's criteria and the provided text. The use of \"template\" and \"details\" also solidifies this classification. Therefore, I can confidently select \"Internal Project\" as the final category.\n\n\n"
