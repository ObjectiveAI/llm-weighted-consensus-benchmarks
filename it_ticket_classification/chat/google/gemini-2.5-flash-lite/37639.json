I've broken down the request into key components like \"Oracle,\" \"time,\" and \"card.\" I'm determining which category best encompasses these elements: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\". My primary goal is to accurately categorize \"oracle time card issues\" and \"card issues.\"\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Issues**\n\nI've examined the ticket details, including \"oracle time card issues\", \"card issues\", and problems with submission and approval. My focus is narrowing down the best category. \"HR Support\" appears most applicable because the issue stems from time card functionality related to HR processes like tracking employee hours and payroll. Though \"Access\" might seem relevant, the core problem is functionality, not being locked out. \"Miscellaneous\" is a fallback, but not best.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've carefully dissected the new ticket details. The common thread amongst the \"oracle time card issues\" is a consistent functional problem with \"card\" issues, particularly around submitting and approving time sheets. The details also discuss that working hours are less than minimum and that an approval option is missing from timecards. Based on all the details provided, HR Support aligns best because these time card issues are inextricably linked to HR processes.\n\n\n"
