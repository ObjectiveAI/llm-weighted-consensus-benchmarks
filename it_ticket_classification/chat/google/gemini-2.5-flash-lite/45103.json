After analyzing the text (\"oracle submission issue report time issue for the new starters sent\"), I'm leaning towards \"Access\" or \"HR Support\". The phrase \"new starters\" suggests an HR-related element, but \"oracle submission\" hints at potential access issues. I'll need to weigh these factors carefully before making a final decision.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe initial analysis of \"oracle submission issue report time issue for the new starters sent monday submission issue hi could you please check why can log when tries submit different form displayed than usual one one requires details about type also seem have submit button available might be related fact recently joined also could you also assign projects vacation request get for approval thank you manager mobile next vacations th\" indicated Access or HR Support as the most likely categories.  Further examination, including phrases like \"new starters,\" \"recently joined,\" and \"vacation request,\" confirms that this ticket requires a hybrid approach. The core issue revolves around onboarding access difficulties, linking HR and Access, or HR support.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text again, considering all aspects. My focus now is solidifying the categorization. The \"new starters\" aspect still heavily leans toward HR, specifically onboarding support. While the \"submission issue\" hints at Access, I think it's ultimately rooted in the broader onboarding experience. \"Vacation request\" further cements this as an HR-centric issue. Therefore, \"HR Support\" still feels like the most comprehensive and accurate fit. The \"assign projects\" could be a cross-functional task after determining the specific job role, so HR support could encompass this as well.\n\n\n"
