Initial analysis strongly points towards \"HR Support,\" given the recurring themes of leave requests and approvals. However, I'm cross-referencing this against other phrases to ensure complete accuracy, and to avoid overlaps with the other categories. I aim for the most precise categorization.\n\n\n**Finalizing Categorization Decision**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the definitive category for this IT ticket. The leave-related phrases (\"annual leave request,\" \"approve holiday,\" etc.) unequivocally align with HR functions. No other category, such as \"Access\" or \"Hardware,\" seems relevant. This ensures streamlined ticket routing.\n\n\n"
