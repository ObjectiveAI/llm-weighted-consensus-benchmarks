The keywords \"leaver interns,\" \"bulk leaver form,\" and \"leaver form\" are prominent. Based on these terms, I'm leaning toward a category. I need to consider all the possibilities and make sure my choice is the best one.\n\n\n**Choosing the Best Fit**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text, and it's clear the primary focus is the departure of employees, specifically interns. Keywords like \"leaver interns,\" \"bulk leaver form,\" and \"leaver form\" point decisively to this.  While access and hardware are potential elements, the overall context aligns best with \"HR Support.\" It's more comprehensive and captures the essence of the process: managing an employee's exit from an HR perspective. I've ruled out other categories as they are either too narrow or irrelevant to the core issue.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI'm now fully confident that \"HR Support\" is the optimal category for this ticket. After thoroughly reviewing the ticket's text and evaluating all possible categories, the keywords strongly indicate the primary concern is the departure of interns and the associated processes. While IT tasks like managing access and hardware return are involved, the core issue aligns perfectly with the HR-related processes. I've considered all alternatives and am certain this is the best fit.\n\n\n"
