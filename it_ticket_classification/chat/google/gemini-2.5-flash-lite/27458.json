Initial tests show challenges in handling ambiguous phrases like \"change job title\". I'm experimenting with keyword matching, semantic analysis, and context-based interpretation to improve accuracy. I'm also considering using a machine learning model for pattern recognition.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket descriptions, focusing on keywords like \"change job title,\" \"discipline,\" and various job titles. The recurring phrases point toward changes in employee data or roles. While some initially suggest \"Access\" due to potential system updates, the context of job roles and discipline changes leans heavily toward \"HR Support.\" It seems the key is to recognize that \"discipline\" refers to a job-related area, and the requests center around employee information.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Requests**\n\nI'm now fully focused on categorizing these recent tickets, which primarily involve changes to employee data and job roles, explicitly asking for \"discipline change\" and title updates. Phrases like \"addition discipline change transfer\" point definitively towards HR-related tasks, not hardware or access issues. It's clear \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category, given the nature of the requests.\n\n\n"
