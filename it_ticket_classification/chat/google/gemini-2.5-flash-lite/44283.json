I'm examining the scenario closely to isolate the root cause, focusing on the urgency of the board meeting. The provided information suggests a previously configured access point that has since been revoked, therefore requiring immediate attention.\n\n\n**Isolating Core Problem**\n\nI've just refined the ticket's categorization to \"Access\" based on critical keywords. The analysis pinpoints the root cause as access revocation. The client director's urgent inability to access the site for a board meeting further solidifies this classification. I'm moving toward solutions now.\n\n\n"
