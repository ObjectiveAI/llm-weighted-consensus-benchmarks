It's difficult because the text is incomplete. Right now, I can't be certain. The phrases \"approval flow\" and \"line manager\" suggest it could be related to HR or access rights, but it's not clear. I'm focusing on those possibilities but will consider other categories too.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories. \"Approval flow\" and \"line manager\" are crucial. While \"HR Support\" seems plausible due to potential workflow overlap, the core is a process adjustment. It's not straightforwardly about hardware, storage, or purchases. \"Access\" is possible but less direct. I'm focusing on \"HR Support\" due to the likely workflow element, but considering that this may not fit a singular category. This seems to be about resolving a workflow problem.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on \"HR Support\" as the primary category for this ticket. The phrases \"approval flow\" and \"line manager,\" coupled with the mention of \"sheets,\" strongly indicate an HR-related workflow. While \"Access\" could be a secondary concern, the root problem seems to be the approval process itself. I'm confident that this fits best within \"HR Support\" given the context.\n\n\n"
