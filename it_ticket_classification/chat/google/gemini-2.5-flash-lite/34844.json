The text is quite cryptic, mentioning \"oracle,\" \"logging in,\" and a \"screen displayed.\" My initial thought is it relates to \"Access,\" perhaps with an issue logging into a system. However, I'm considering other possibilities like \"Hardware\" if the login issue is linked to a specific device, or even \"Miscellaneous\" if it remains unclear.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text: \"can into oracle can into hello have problem while logging into after introducing name password following screen displayed place take look advice how can problem be solved thank you tester.\" It's clear that the primary issue is with logging into Oracle. The keywords \"logging in\" and \"password\" point directly to access issues, making \"Access\" the most appropriate category. My JSON output is now finalized as: {\"category\": \"Access\"}. I feel confident in my categorization, though further details might surface during resolution.\n\n\n"
