My focus is on discerning whether the issue relates to permissions, general system access, or another specific function, based on keywords like \"add expenses\" and \"get error\".\n\n**Classifying Ticket Data**\n\nI'm currently processing the IT ticket information, focusing on the description \"can add expenses oracle can add hi employee starting trying add but when open icon get error please attached please advise regards\". Based on this, I'm leaning towards \"Administrative rights\" as the most fitting category, as the user is trying to add data and encountering an error, which typically relates to permissions or access privileges within the application.\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Access**\n\nI'm currently refining the categorization of the IT ticket. Based on the user's attempt to \"add expenses\" and encountering an error when interacting with an icon, I believe \"Administrative rights\" is the most precise fit, as it directly addresses potential permission issues for performing data entry actions.\n\n**Determining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm currently refining the categorization of the IT ticket.
