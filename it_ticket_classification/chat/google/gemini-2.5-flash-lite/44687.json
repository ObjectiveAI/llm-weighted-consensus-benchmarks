Specifically, the phrases like \"unable to permissions\" are highly suggestive. I'm leaning heavily towards categorizing this as an \"Access\" issue, given the consistent keywords. I'm double-checking to ensure this aligns perfectly.\n\n\n**Defining the Access Problem**\n\nI'm solidifying my initial assessment: the repeated mentions of \"permissions\" and \"access\" across the IT ticket's text make an \"Access\" issue the obvious and best fit category. The evidence is overwhelming. Each phrase highlights a restriction or denial. I'm satisfied this is the correct classification.\n\n\n"
