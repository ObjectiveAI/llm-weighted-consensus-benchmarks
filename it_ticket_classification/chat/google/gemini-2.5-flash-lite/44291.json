The \"backup jobs\" suggests a potential storage or hardware issue, but \"log incident\" and \"assign\" also bring other categories to mind. I'm carefully weighing each keyword against the schema to make the best decision.\n\n\n**Determining the Root Cause**\n\nI've narrowed the IT ticket's issue down to a likely \"Storage\" problem. The keyword \"failed backup jobs\" is the main indicator. Although a server restart is mentioned, the core issue is the backup failure. I've ruled out other categories like \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" after careful consideration.\n\n\n"
