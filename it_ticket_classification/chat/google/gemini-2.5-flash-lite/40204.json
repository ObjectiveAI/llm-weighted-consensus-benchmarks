I am leaning towards categorizing this as \"HR Support,\" but I'm still weighing the other options to ensure a precise classification before finalizing.\n\n\n**Finalizing Classification of the Ticket**\n\nNow I have determined that the ticket should be classified as \"HR Support\". The phrase \"time cards\" and the fact that the issue is the inability to submit cards, is clear evidence that the user needs HR system access or support.  My analysis of the ticket text indicates an HR process problem, not a hardware, storage, purchase or internal project issue. It is also not a request for administrative rights. Thus I can conclude \"HR Support\" is the correct classification.\n\n\n"
