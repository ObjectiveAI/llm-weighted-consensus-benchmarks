My current focus is determining if \"Hardware\" best represents the core action, considering the implications of retiring physical assets.\n\n**Focusing on Hardware Decommissioning**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the ticket's keywords, prioritizing terms like \"decommissioning\" and \"physical\" to determine the most accurate category. My current assessment points towards \"Hardware\" as the best fit, given the explicit mention of physical asset retirement.\n\n**Identifying Core Action**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the ticket's keywords, with \"decommissioning\" and \"physical\" being the most prominent. My current focus is on determining the primary action to assign the most accurate category from the provided list.\n\n**Focusing on Physical Decommissioning**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket's keywords, with \"decommissioning\" and \"physical\" being the most prominent. My current focus is on mapping these terms to the \"Hardware\" category, as it most directly aligns with the decommissioning of physical IT assets.\n\n"
