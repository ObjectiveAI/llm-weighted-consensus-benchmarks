After analyzing the description (\"unable to connect to via cable\"), I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" or potentially \"Access\" due to the connectivity issue. I need to weigh the options carefully and avoid a miscategorization.\n\n\n**Analyzing Connectivity Issue**\n\nMy current analysis points strongly to \"Hardware\" as the appropriate category. The ticket description focuses heavily on the cable's inability to establish a connection. While the lack of connectivity hinders access, the root cause remains a physical hardware problem. The key phrase \"unable to connect to via cable\" makes the \"Hardware\" option the best fit. I'm focusing my attention now on that.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Hardware Issue**\n\nAfter thoroughly reviewing the \"unable to connect\" ticket, my analysis firmly prioritizes \"Hardware\" as the correct category. While access is impacted, the root cause lies in the malfunctioning cable. I've ruled out all other categories due to their lack of relevance to the reported issue. The emphasis on cable functionality directs the classification toward the \"Hardware\" domain.\n\n\n"
