I've considered the potential categories, but I'm leaning towards \"Hardware,\" as the request centers around a physical access device. I'll need to confirm that this is the best fit, ensuring it aligns with the system's defined categories.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted from \"Hardware\" to \"Access\". The ticket clearly revolves around a lost access card and the need for a replacement. This aligns perfectly with the \"Access\" category, and after re-reading the details, I'm confident in this choice. This feels like the most logical categorization.\n\n\n"
