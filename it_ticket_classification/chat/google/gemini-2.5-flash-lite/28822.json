                    "reasoning": "**Determining the Category**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the text, \"oracle fusion non chargeable task to,\" to accurately categorize the IT ticket. So far, the phrase doesn't lean heavily towards any specific category. I'm considering possibilities like \"Internal Project\" or perhaps \"Miscellaneous\" due to the vague nature of the request. I will need more context.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the core request within the ticket. The text, after closer examination, indicates a need related to task management within the Oracle Fusion system. My primary focus now is differentiating between the request being about adding, modifying, or managing tasks, and whether it requires assistance or guidance. The mention of \"chargeable\" and \"non-chargeable\" suggests a possible billing or project assignment aspect, which needs clarification before I finalize the categorization.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Oracle Task**\n\nI've been analyzing the text further, focusing on the request to \"add chargeable task\" within Oracle Fusion. This strongly suggests a focus on the system's project management or resource allocation modules. The user's need for guidance solidifies the \"Internal Project\" possibility, as it could relate to the setup or management of a project-related feature within the software. The need for clarification is still there, but \"Internal Project\" now seems a strong candidate given the software's nature and the implied workflow.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the core of the issue. I've re-examined the phrasing, particularly \"add chargeable task,\" and the request for \"guidelines.\" This suggests a need for functional help or configuration of a new feature within Oracle Fusion. I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project,\" as managing \"chargeable\" tasks likely falls under project workflows, or \"Administrative Rights\" if it requires setting up permissions. I'll need to confirm with the user.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket's Focus**\n\nI'm now focusing on the phrase \"add chargeable task,\" which implies a project or resource allocation scenario within Oracle Fusion. The request for guidelines suggests a need for functional assistance. Considering the options, \"Internal Project\" now seems most relevant, as the ticket seems tied to project task setup. I'll need to confirm this with the user to make a conclusive decision.\n\n\n**Focusing on Internal Project Context**\n\nI'm now focusing on the connection between \"add chargeable task\" and internal projects. The request highlights the need for configuration or guidance related to tasks within Oracle Fusion, which often aligns with managing internal projects. The \"chargeable\" aspect further strengthens the possibility that this is a project-related need, making \"Internal Project\" a stronger candidate. The user seems to be seeking assistance or guidance on a project-related activity.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket's Focus**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the ticket as \"Internal Project\" as the text explicitly discusses \"chargeable\" tasks within Oracle Fusion. I believe the user needs help setting up or modifying a chargeable task within a project context. This strongly suggests that the issue is within the context of an \"Internal Project.\"\n\n\n"
