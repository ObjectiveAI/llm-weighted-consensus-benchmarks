It seems to revolve around access cards, specifically their usage.  I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the primary category, but I'm keeping an eye out for any clues that might push it towards \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights\" if the context subtly suggests something different. I'm carefully sifting through to exclude the other unrelated categories.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket text \"access cards usage belgrade friday march pm\" alongside the full details, which includes card assignment, usage control, and evidence requests. After careful consideration, I'm confident that \"Access\" is the most appropriate category. While \"Hardware\" or \"HR Support\" touched peripherally, the emphasis is definitively on the management and utilization of access credentials. The \"Access\" category encapsulates the core issues far better than the others.\n\n\n"
