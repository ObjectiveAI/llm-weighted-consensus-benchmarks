The text about \"timecard deletion assistance\" and \"deleting entries\" is pointing me towards HR Support, but I'm keeping the other options in mind. I'm carefully reviewing the context to make a definitive classification.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy analysis now firmly points to \"HR Support\". The keywords like \"timecard,\" \"rejection,\" and \"entries\" all strongly suggest that HR processes are at the heart of this ticket. I've ruled out the other options because they simply don't align with the content. It appears to be a matter of time card issues specifically, not a wider IT problem. This makes \"HR Support\" the clear best fit.\n\n\n"
