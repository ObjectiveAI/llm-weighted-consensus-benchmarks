After careful consideration of the text, I believe the focus is on a process change related to annual leave approval. Therefore, I'm leaning toward the \"HR Support\" category, as it aligns with the request for a change related to employee leave management.\n\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the provided ticket text, concentrating on key phrases like \"annual leave approver change\" and \"approve his requests.\" This analysis definitively links the issue to leave management and approval processes. With this in mind, I've concluded the ticket should be assigned to the \"HR Support\" category, given its alignment with employee leave management and approval needs.\n\n\n"
