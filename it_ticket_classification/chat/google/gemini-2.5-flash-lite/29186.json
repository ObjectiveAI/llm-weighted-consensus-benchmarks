Analyzing keywords like \"new starter\" and considering the available categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The phrase \"new starter\" suggests this might be related to onboarding or HR, possibly falling under \"HR Support\". The other words do not suggest specific categories.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Process**\n\nI've been further refining my categorization approach for the IT ticket. I'm now zeroing in on the phrase \"new starter form\" within the text \"new starter thursday starter form ext,\" which strongly indicates an onboarding process. While \"thursday\" is likely a date and \"ext\" remains ambiguous, the core focus is clearly on onboarding a new employee. Given the categories, \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" remain strong contenders.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nNow, I'm reconsidering the best fit for this ticket. The initial focus on \"HR Support\" still feels right, but I'm leaning toward combining it with \"Access\" given the likely IT tasks involved in onboarding. The ticket's lack of specificity makes it tricky, yet the phrase \"starter form\" indicates IT is part of this HR process. Since \"ext\" could mean anything, I'm focusing on \"new starter\" and \"form\" pointing toward the broader HR onboarding ecosystem. Thus, the category should consider access/permissions.\n\n\n**Selecting a Primary Category**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"HR Support\" as the primary category, given the nature of the ticket. After careful reconsideration, the focus of \"new starter form\" aligns best with overarching HR processes, especially since \"ext\" is vague. The ticket itself seems more about the onboarding *initiation* rather than any specific IT task.\n\n\n"
