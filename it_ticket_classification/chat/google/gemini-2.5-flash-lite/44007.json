The issue with an \"error oracle when submitting expense report\" leans towards HR Support, since this directly relates to an HR process (expense reports) and involves a system (Oracle).\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Type Further**\n\nI'm solidifying the ticket categorization, focusing on the core issue. I've re-evaluated the user's description, and it directly points to an error within the expense report system. While Access remains a consideration, the functionality error overrides it. The best fit is HR Support, given the process and related system.\n\n\n**Clarifying Ticket Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the crux of the problem. It seems the user can't submit their expense report. This malfunction strongly indicates a support requirement. Expense report errors are not isolated incidents but represent a larger HR process issue. The mention of \"Oracle\" is less critical than the inability to complete a crucial HR task. The error strongly aligns with \"HR Support\".\n\n\n"
