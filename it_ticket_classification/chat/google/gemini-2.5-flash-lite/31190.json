The phrases \"new system,\" \"floor installed,\" and \"Tuesday PM\" are key here. I'm leaning toward either \"Hardware\" or \"Internal Project\" based on that. I'll need to confirm that this is a system install.\n\n\n**Defining the IT Issue**\n\nI've carefully dissected the ticket text, isolating keywords and phrases. \"New system,\" \"installation,\" \"configuration,\" and \"networking\" are prominent. The emphasis points strongly towards a hardware-related issue, possibly a new system deployment or infrastructure upgrade. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category, though \"Internal Project\" could be a secondary consideration. The context of the installation being on the floor cements this idea.\n\n\n**Finalizing IT Ticket Category**\n\nI've considered all the clues and now I'm certain. I've re-read the ticket text, and it's crystal clear: the core issue revolves around a \"new system,\" \"installation,\" \"configuration,\" and \"networking.\" While \"Purchase\" is implied, the main focus isn't acquiring the hardware, but its setup. \"Internal Project\" is a possible secondary thought, but ultimately \"Hardware\" accurately captures the heart of the request, encompassing the physical equipment and its associated setup. I'm going with \"Hardware.\"\n\n\n"
