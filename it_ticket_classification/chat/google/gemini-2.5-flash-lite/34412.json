My initial thought is to categorize this as \"Access\" or potentially \"Hardware\", given the focus on a wireless connection. I'll need to look at other ways to determine what is the best categorization.\n\n\n**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nThe wireless issue centers around network access to servers. Given the information, my initial assessment strongly favors \"Access\" as the most suitable category. The text clearly states that users can't access servers wirelessly, implying a connectivity problem. While a hardware element might be present, the focus is on achieving access.\n\n\n**Evaluating Access Problems**\n\nI've re-evaluated the IT ticket text, focusing on the core issue: wireless network connectivity. My analysis highlights that users can't access servers wirelessly, while wired connections are fine. Considering the provided categories, \"Access\" still seems most suitable because the problem is about gaining or restoring network access. Although hardware could be implicated, the description focuses on the connection itself rather than a device fault.\n\n\n"
