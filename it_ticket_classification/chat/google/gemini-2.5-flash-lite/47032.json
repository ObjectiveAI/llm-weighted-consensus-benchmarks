The user's struggle with \"adding new people to forecast\" points strongly towards an issue with granting system access.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently processing the provided ticket text, focusing on mapping the user's request about adding individuals to a \"forecast\" system to the most suitable JSON schema category. My analysis indicates \"Access\" is the strongest contender, as the core issue appears to revolve around provisioning user permissions.\n\n**Granting System Permissions**\n\nI've analyzed the latest ticket information and concluded that the user's request regarding adding individuals to the \"forecast\" system most accurately falls under the \"Access\" category. This aligns with issues related to user provisioning and granting system entry.\n\n"
