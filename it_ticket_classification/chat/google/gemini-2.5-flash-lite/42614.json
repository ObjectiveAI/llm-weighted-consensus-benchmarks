The terms \"active access card\", \"starter access card enabling\", and \"problem with card\" all point strongly towards an access-related issue. This seems to be the primary focus of the ticket.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Content**\n\nI've honed in on the ticket's core issue: access card management. Phrases like \"assign for one cards\", \"suspend card number\", and \"activate card number\" confirm this. Considering all the collected phrases, the ticket clearly falls under the \"Access\" category, not anything else.\n\n\n"
