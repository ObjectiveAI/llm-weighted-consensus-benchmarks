It appears to relate to onboarding a new employee, specifically regarding their setup and access.  I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" or \"Access\", but I need to ensure a correct categorization. I may need to request clarification on the exact needs. I'm considering if it is related to any purchasing.\n\n\n**Focusing on HR Integration**\n\nThis ticket leans heavily towards HR Support. The consistent mentions of \"new starters\", \"starter forms,\" and \"hiring\" solidify this.  I've cross-referenced and confirmed that the focus is on the onboarding process, not a hardware request. The \"developer\" role further supports this conclusion. The need for access or specific rights seems implied, but the core issue revolves around getting the new hire properly set up within HR systems and documentation.\n\n\n**Clarifying Onboarding Needs**\n\nI've examined the ticket again, focusing on the core issue. I'm now certain the ticket concerns the setup of new employees. The emphasis on \"starter forms\" and \"starting dates\" solidifies this. Though there might be a need for access down the line, the immediate priority is processing the new hire's onboarding, which falls under \"HR Support\". The keywords like \"starter\" and \"hiring\" all point towards the HR domain.\n\n\n"
