The user's inability to hear the client points away from hardware malfunction, and a purchase is irrelevant. Access and administrative rights don't quite fit either. HR support and internal projects are also less likely. It's looking like this falls into the catch-all \"Miscellaneous\" category, or perhaps \"HR Support\" if there is an HR-related system used for calls.\n\n\n**Focusing On Hardware Issue**\n\nI've revised my thinking about the appropriate category for this audio issue. While I initially considered \"Miscellaneous,\" I'm now leaning heavily toward \"Hardware.\" The multi-device, multi-connection nature of the problem, along with the symptom of the user only hearing the client, makes me suspect faulty hardware or possibly driver-related problems. My initial assessment of HR Support, access, and administrative rights has been revised as they are unrelated.\n\n\n"
