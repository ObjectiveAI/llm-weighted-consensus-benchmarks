My goal is to structure a JSON response adhering to the defined schema:  `{\"category\": \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\"}`.  I'm currently focused on dissecting the ticket text to identify the most relevant category.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\". The keywords strongly suggest issues with an employee offboarding process, specifically with a leaver form.  I'm now focusing on how the form's functionality directly relates to HR tasks. The errors seem directly connected to the location data and the form's ability to be submitted, all part of an HR process.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Categorization**\n\nI've finalized my categorization and I'm confident in \"HR Support\". The leaver form errors and data inconsistencies are fundamental to HR operations. I've considered other categories, like \"Internal Project,\" but the issue is a process, not a new project. My primary focus is the malfunctioning leaver form, which directly impacts HR's ability to complete its tasks.\n\n\n"
