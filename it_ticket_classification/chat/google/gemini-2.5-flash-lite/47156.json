                    "reasoning": "**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently focused on the challenge of accurately categorizing this ticket. Analyzing the text \"not approved oracle sent friday october approved hi week work completed sheet\" I'm leaning towards a few possibilities, given the lack of clear context. I'm exploring if \"oracle\" hints at \"Access\" or if the terms could suggest an \"Internal Project\". I need more information to be sure.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Possibilities**\n\nI'm now focusing on Access, given the phrases \"not approved,\" \"try submit again receive error,\" and the nature of the workflow issue. The mention of \"Oracle\" strengthens this hypothesis, as Oracle often relates to systems requiring specific access levels. However, internal projects are also in consideration as a backup.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Considerations**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the potential categories. The system approval workflow mentioned, coupled with the error message and \"not approved\" status, still points heavily toward either \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" Given the focus on completing a task within Oracle, the general 'Access' seems like the primary concern. I'm leaning toward this, but still evaluating if \"Administrative rights\" might be more precise. Further clarification of the user's role is needed.\n\n\n**Focusing on Permission Issues**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text and the potential ticket categories.  The system workflow and error messages still point decisively toward an \"Access\" issue.  Given the submission errors, it appears a user lacks sufficient permissions within the system, potentially with the Oracle system. While \"Administrative rights\" is related, \"Access\" is a broader and more accurate description of the core problem.\n\n**Confirming Access Focus**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Access\" category. The text indicates a system approval issue within Oracle, and the inability to submit/update suggests a lack of permission. \"Administrative Rights\" is too specific; the core problem is simply gaining the right to *perform* the necessary actions. \"Access\" encompasses the precise nature of the ticket's concern.\n\n\n"
