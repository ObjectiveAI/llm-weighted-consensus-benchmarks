It seems to involve issues with links and requisitions, suggesting it falls under \"Miscellaneous\" or potentially \"Purchase\" depending on the context of the requisition. I'm evaluating further to pinpoint the most accurate classification.\n\n**Refining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm refining my classification of the IT ticket. Given the explicit mention of \"requisition\" and the problems with links related to its creation and sharing, \"Purchase\" appears to be the most accurate category. I'm considering if \"Access\" might be a secondary consideration if the link sharing failure stems from permissions.\n\n**Categorizing Requisition Links**\n\nI'm focused on classifying an IT ticket. It clearly involves link issues stemming from requisition creation, strongly suggesting \"Purchase\" as the primary category. I'm also considering \"Access\" as a secondary possibility if permissions are the root cause of the link failures.\n\n"
