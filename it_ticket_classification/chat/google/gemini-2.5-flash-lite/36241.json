My initial thought is to categorize this under \"Storage,\" but I'm considering if there's a more precise category. It seems straightforward, but I want to ensure this assignment is accurate for the user. I'll focus on similar past tickets to refine the decision.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Scope**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"Storage\" category as the most accurate. The ticket's repeated emphasis on mailbox capacity issues, including phrases like \"mailbox almost full\" and requests to \"increase size,\" solidified this. Though simple, I want to ensure that this is the best fit, despite the lack of other clues. I'm satisfied that this is the only correct answer.\n\n\n"
