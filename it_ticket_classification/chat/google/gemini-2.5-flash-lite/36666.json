I've broken down the key phrases: \"time card report time issue\" and \"cannot log usually.\" This points towards potential issues with access or HR-related systems. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or potentially \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate categories. I'm focusing on the login issue in particular, and the time card issue might be a symptom of access issues.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been drilling down further, and the access problem seems tied to a specific requirement (\"fill assignment number type\") within the time card system. This strongly suggests the core issue lies within the timekeeping application itself, which is managed by HR or, potentially, falls under Access due to login requirements. Considering that HR manages the systems and processes related to time reporting, \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate category. \"Access\" is still relevant, but secondary. The employee's time card is the central problem here.\n\n\n**Determining Primary Focus**\n\nI'm now thinking the core issue is the assignment number type field within the time card system, preventing the user from completing their weekly submission. This points more directly to \"HR Support\" rather than a general access issue, as it's a process requirement inherent to the timekeeping system. The login problem is a symptom, but the root cause lies within HR's domain and systems.\n\n\n"
