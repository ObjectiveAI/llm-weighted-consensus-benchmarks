The user reports intermittent audio dropouts during calls and meetings, regardless of their connection method or recent hardware changes. This points towards a potential issue within the communication software or network, rather than a hardware malfunction. I'm leaning toward eliminating \"Hardware\" from the list of possible categories.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Root Cause**\n\nI've been analyzing the IT ticket further. The audio dropouts, irrespective of connection type or recent hardware changes, solidify the likelihood of a software or network-related problem. While the user's headset update is mentioned, this seems more of a data point, so I'm investigating the \"Hardware\" option. I'm leaning toward the \"Miscellaneous\" category as the main issue seems more software-focused.\n\n\n"
