After analyzing the phrase \"annual leave request,\" I've determined the best fit to be \"HR Support.\" It seems like a simple task, but I'm thinking of how I might incorporate more complex phrases and better identify the category from the list. I'm almost ready to move on.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been drilling down on this ticket's core function. I'm seeing \"annual leave request,\" \"approver,\" and \"rejection reason,\" all HR-related keywords. After assessing those and the context, I'm confident categorizing this as \"HR Support\" is the right call.\n\n\n"
