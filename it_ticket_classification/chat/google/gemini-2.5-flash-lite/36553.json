After careful review, \"Access\" seems like the strongest fit, as the issue centers around employee difficulties utilizing a specific referral tool, strongly suggesting configuration or access problems.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Root Cause**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the root cause. While \"HR Support\" seemed initially promising, the focus is increasingly leaning toward \"Access\". The core problem is employee *inability* to use a tool, suggesting permissions or configuration as the likely culprits. It's a functional issue preventing action, fitting \"Access\" better than a general HR support inquiry. This choice aligns with the ticket description's emphasis on tool *usage* blockage.\n\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the best category, focusing on the specific wording of the IT ticket. I initially leaned towards \"HR Support,\" but now I'm considering \"Internal Project\" due to the technical nature of the issue. The key is \"employees experiencing issues with referral tool cannot add referral.\" This points to a functional bug or access problem within a project-based application, rather than a general HR process question.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Choice**\n\nI'm now further refining my decision. Though \"HR Support\" has strong initial appeal, I'm considering \"Access\" as a more precise fit. \"Employees cannot add referrals\" hints at a *functional* access issue, either due to permissions or a configuration glitch within the \"referral tool.\" While HR owns the *process*, the *problem* appears technical, pointing me towards \"Access\" as the most specific and accurate categorization. This aligns with the ticket's technical nature, and the implied lack of functional *access* to the \"add referral\" feature.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Choice**\n\nI've been meticulously considering the best category. Though \"HR Support\" still holds appeal, I now think \"Access\" is the most direct fit. The core problem, \"employees experiencing issues... cannot add referral,\" strongly suggests a functional access limitation, whether due to permissions or a bug.\n\n\n"
