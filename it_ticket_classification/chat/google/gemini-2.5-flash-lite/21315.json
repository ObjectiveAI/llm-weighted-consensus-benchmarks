This was a relatively straightforward deduction based on the ticket's description. My current focus is to refine the criteria I use to automatically categorize tickets, considering edge cases and potential ambiguities in the descriptions. I'm exploring how to handle requests that might overlap multiple categories, such as a hardware request related to a new internal project.\n\n\n**Expanding Category Rules**\n\nI am now delving into the more nuanced aspects of categorization. While \"install device meeting room\" was a simple case for hardware, I'm now crafting rules that handle more complex requests. For instance, I'm figuring out how to categorize tickets related to \"setting up a new laptop for a new employee\" - is it hardware, HR support, or potentially access? I need to build a system that prioritizes the most relevant category given a specific request and its available data.\n\n\n"
