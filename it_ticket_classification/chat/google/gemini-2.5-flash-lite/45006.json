I'm ruling out hardware and HR support as unrelated to the described problem.\n\n**Classifying Notification Anomalies**\n\nI'm delving into the details of an IT ticket involving duplicate notifications and instances where different senders delivered them twice. My initial thoughts lean towards a system-level anomaly within the notification framework or its email delivery channels. I'm actively excluding hardware and HR support as potential culprits.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently working to categorize an IT ticket detailing duplicate notifications and messages received twice from different senders. Given the available options, \"Miscellaneous\" appears to be the most fitting classification as it doesn't align with hardware, HR, access, or other specific functional areas.\n\n"
