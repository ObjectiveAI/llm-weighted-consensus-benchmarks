Based on the description \"check users service management,\" I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the most relevant category. It seems to imply a need to review or manage user access rights.\n\n\n**Assessing Ticket Details**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the ticket description for definitive keywords to pinpoint the correct category. \"Service management team\" and \"opened order members\" are general, but \"role assigned\" and \"visibility over folder\" point me strongly toward access management. Storage, although present, seems secondary to access control in this scenario.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's keywords. While several categories were possible, \"Access\" best captures the core issue. I've focused on \"accounts\", \"role assigned\", and \"visibility over folder\" to support my decision. Though storage is present, the key issue is controlling *access* to that storage.\n\n\n"
