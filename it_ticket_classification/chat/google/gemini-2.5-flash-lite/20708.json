I'll need to re-evaluate the provided categories to see where the phrases fit best.\n\n\n**Refining Access Categorization**\n\nI've honed in on \"Access\" as the prime category based on the ticket's language. Phrases like \"allowed across,\" \"controls side,\" and \"where belong\" strongly indicate access requests. I've considered other categories, but \"Access\" aligns best with the identified needs related to networks, applications, and team-based resources.\n\n\n"
