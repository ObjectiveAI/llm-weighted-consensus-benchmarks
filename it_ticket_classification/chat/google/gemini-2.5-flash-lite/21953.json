The mention of auditing, removing, and disabling accounts, particularly for those who \"recently left,\" points towards HR processes and access management. I'm weighing \"HR Support\" against \"Access\" for the most precise classification.\n\n**Categorizing Account Management**\n\nI'm refining the categorization of the recent ticket. The core request involves auditing, removing, and disabling accounts for users who have \"recently left.\" This strongly indicates a connection to offboarding procedures, aligning it with either \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" due to the explicit mention of departed employees.\n\n**Assigning IT Ticket**\n\nI'm categorizing the ticket focusing on user account management and offboarding processes, specifically for individuals who have recently departed. This strongly aligns the request with \"HR Support\" due to the direct link between employee departures and the need to manage their accounts.\n\n"
