After careful consideration of the provided text, the phrase \"change rights\" is making me lean towards \"Access\". However, I'm still evaluating if other categories, like \"Administrative rights\", are also applicable. My focus is on achieving the most accurate classification.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI'm zeroing in on the best category. The \"change rights\" phrase is key, making \"Access\" a strong contender. I'm also considering \"Administrative rights,\" as it could be applicable. The \"discipline reports\" aspect is less clear; it could involve HR or an internal project, but doesn't override the access focus. I'm prioritizing the primary request.\n\n\n**Evaluating Ticket Classification**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket text, and the phrases \"access to\" and \"change rights\" clearly indicate the primary focus is access-related. While \"discipline reports\" initially raised a question about HR or an internal project, the core request revolves around modifying access levels. Considering the given options, 'Access' feels like the most appropriate classification, as it encapsulates the essence of the user's need. I'm satisfied that 'Access' is the right choice.\n\n\n"
