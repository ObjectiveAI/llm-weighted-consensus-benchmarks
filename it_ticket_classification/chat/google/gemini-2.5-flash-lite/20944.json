My process involves carefully analyzing the ticket's description and mapping it to the most appropriate category from the provided list: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\"\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm refining my categorization for the IT ticket. Based on the text mentioning \"documentation,\" \"migration,\" \"Confluence,\" and \"Oracle Fusion,\" with keywords like \"stored\" and \"libraries,\" I'm leaning towards \"Storage\" as the primary category due to the focus on where documents reside. \"Internal Project\" is a secondary consideration for the migration aspect.\n\n**Refining Storage Focus**\n\nI'm refining the categorization of the IT ticket. My current analysis indicates that while the migration aspect suggests an internal project, the core of the request revolves around the \"storage\" of documentation and access to it on the new platform.\n\n**Finding Documentation Storage**\n\nI'm focused on locating where documentation is stored after a migration. My analysis suggests the core of the request centers on managing and accessing data on the new Confluence platform, making \"Storage\" the most fitting category.\n\n**Identifying Storage Needs**\n\nI'm continuing to analyze the IT ticket. My current assessment, based on the mention of documentation migration and the need to locate stored files on a new platform, leads me to categorize this as a \"Storage\" issue.\n\n"
