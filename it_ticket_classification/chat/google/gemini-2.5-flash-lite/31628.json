My initial analysis suggests that \"expense reports issues\" relates to \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Miscellaneous,\" but I need to ensure a clear distinction between the two. The mention of \"Saturday\" is irrelevant. I will need to consider whether the phrase \"expense reports\" alone is sufficient, or if it needs more context.\n\n\n**Refining HR Categorization**\n\nI've honed in on \"HR Support\" as the primary category for this ticket, given its focus on expense report creation and submission problems. The \"expense reports\" keywords strongly point towards an HR or finance-related issue. \"Miscellaneous\" could be a fallback, but the content feels best aligned with a dedicated HR support function. Further refinements will likely involve clarifying specific subcategories within \"HR Support\" if the system allows.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Focus**\n\nI've determined this ticket requires HR support due to the recurring focus on \"expense reports\". The symptoms - inability to submit, add items, or use templates - point squarely toward functional issues within an HR or finance-related system. \"Miscellaneous\" is too broad, and the other categories are irrelevant to the described problems. I'm satisfied \"HR Support\" captures the essence of this ticket.\n\n\n"
