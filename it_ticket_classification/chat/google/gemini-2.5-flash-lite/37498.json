The term \"joiners\" suggests a strong link to onboarding, while \"card manager\" introduces another possible angle. I'm exploring how these phrases, and the context of IT support tickets, might influence a potential match.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"new joiners\" phrase, which points to HR support, like onboarding. While \"card manager\" introduces an access element, the onboarding context is more dominant in this specific ticket. I'm focusing on \"HR Support\" as the initial, best-fit category, although \"Access\" remains a secondary consideration.\n\n\n**Confirming HR as Primary**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text with the repetition of \"new joiners\" and \"card manager.\" The persistent emphasis on onboarding pushes \"HR Support\" to the forefront as the primary category. While \"card manager\" suggests a possible access element, I'm focusing on the dominant onboarding context. I'm now certain that \"HR Support\" is the best fit, even if it might encompass access-related tasks, like employee ID cards.\n\n\n"
