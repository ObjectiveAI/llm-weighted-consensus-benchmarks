I'm building a system to map these phrases to the valid categories I've identified. It's an interesting challenge to ensure accuracy and relevance in the mappings.\n\n\n**Mapping Key Indicators**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided ticket text and identifying key phrases that point towards the appropriate category. Phrases like \"new starter service\" and \"completion starter form\" clearly lean towards an HR-related request. Considering the other valid categories, I'm finding that \"HR Support\" best encompasses the described onboarding process, while \"Access\" might be a related step but not the primary focus.\n\n\n**Defining Onboarding Context**\n\nNow, I'm diving deeper into the nuances of this ticket. I'm focusing on the keywords and phrases that paint a picture of the overall request. It's becoming clearer that the request centers around onboarding, encompassing setting up accounts and other related HR processes. This analysis solidifies my earlier assessment: \"HR Support\" remains the most appropriate category, and I am mapping those relevant phrases to it. This ticket involves tasks related to employee onboarding, not just access or hardware.\n\n\n"
