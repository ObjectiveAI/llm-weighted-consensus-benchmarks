I'm cross-referencing this with the available categories to identify the best fit. I'm leaning toward hardware, but I'm keeping an open mind.\n\n\n**Identifying the Core Problem**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the heart of the matter. The repeated \"poll CPU status down\" points to a monitoring issue. The CPU load, linked to authentication failures and potentially a phone/supplicant, seems to be the root cause. My analysis suggests this issue is a hardware performance problem, likely related to CPU utilization and authentication processes on a specific device. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category, considering the performance degradation.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Hardware Diagnostics**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket data, and the recurring \"poll CPU status down\" phrase is the crux of the matter. My investigations strongly indicate a hardware issue centered on CPU load impacting authentication. The authentication process's link to the device's CPU and port status leads me firmly toward \"Hardware.\" The phone/supplicant connection suggests an underlying hardware bottleneck. I'm focusing on confirming the device type, and that this problem isn't related to a device misconfiguration.\n\n\n**Determining Hardware's Role**\n\nMy analysis indicates a hardware issue is paramount.  Authentication failures triggered by CPU overload on a device points directly to hardware.  I will confirm device specifications to categorize the root cause.\n\n\n"
