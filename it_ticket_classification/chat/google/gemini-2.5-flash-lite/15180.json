The text is brief, but the keywords \"enable accounts\" strongly suggest an access-related issue. My thought process is narrowing the choices to ensure the most accurate categorization for this request.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Access Issue**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket text: \"enable accounts,\" \"rollout phase,\" and \"share files.\" My focus has honed in on **Access** as the most accurate category. Although storage and internal projects are touched upon, the primary request is about access control and how associated files are managed, not the storage medium or the overall project. The request seems very directly related to enabling user accounts.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Request Details**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the ticket's keywords and context to finalize the categorization. Considering all aspects, the request revolves around enabling user accounts and explaining the process for sharing associated files, strongly suggesting an access management issue. While the \"rollout phase\" hints at a project context, the core action remains account enablement and file access, making \"Access\" the most accurate primary category for this ticket.\n\n\n"
