My final decision is imminent.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's keywords. While \"contract ending,\" \"leaver form,\" and \"mobility officer\" initially pointed me toward HR Support, the mention of \"contract extended\" warrants a second look.  I'm now considering how the extension impacts my previous categorization. I'm carefully weighing whether this context subtly shifts the emphasis or if HR Support remains the most fitting choice.\n\n\n"
