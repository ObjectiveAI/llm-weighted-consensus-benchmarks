My goal is to accurately assign the ticket to one of the predefined categories, ensuring efficient routing and resolution.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR and Access**\n\nI'm now leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the primary category for this ticket. While \"Access\" is relevant, the root cause seems to stem from HR events (employee departures, vacations) that necessitate access adjustments. I'm focusing on the *reason* for the access change to make the best category decision.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket's Primary Focus**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text, identifying keywords that strongly point towards an HR-driven event. While \"Access\" is a relevant secondary aspect, the core issue stems from employee departures and vacation-related delegation, making \"HR Support\" the most fitting category. I'm prioritizing the root cause \u2013 the HR event itself \u2013 to determine the best categorization, aiming for efficient routing.\n\n\n"
