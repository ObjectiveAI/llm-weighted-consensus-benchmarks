However, I'm leaning toward HR Support given the simplicity of the text and lack of technical keywords. I need to make sure I don't confuse similar tickets, however.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR Scope**\n\nI'm now fully focused on the \"new starter\" aspects. The \"starter form\" and \"administration officer\" elements solidify this as an HR-related inquiry, perhaps onboarding or a similar process. I'm prioritizing the human element, rather than purely technical setup. My current thinking is that this leans decidedly towards an HR Support issue, with access needs a secondary consideration, if even relevant.\n\n\n**Focusing on Form Details**\n\nI am now focusing on the ticket text. The terms \"starter form\" and \"fill starter form\" are very strongly suggesting HR Support. While a new starter will *eventually* need access, the current issue seems to be about the initial paperwork and onboarding, which is strongly HR-driven. The \"working location\" piece seems peripheral, a possible location matter that may be relevant to the HR process.\n\n\n"
