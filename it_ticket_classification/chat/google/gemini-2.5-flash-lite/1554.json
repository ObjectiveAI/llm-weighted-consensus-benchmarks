My initial assessment is leaning strongly towards a Hardware or Purchase category, given the keywords. I'm actively considering the context, especially the term \"allocation,\" to make the final call. The simplicity of \"transfer\" makes this a slightly easier task.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket: Hardware**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket data. The dominant keywords are \"transfer\" and \"allocation\" in conjunction with \"hardware.\" This strongly points toward hardware management. There is mention of returning equipment. Based on this, I've concluded that the ticket falls squarely into the \"Hardware\" category. The decision is now finalized and I have categorized the ticket as such.\n\n\n"
