While \"starter form\" could fall elsewhere, the context of access cards makes \"Access\" the most likely fit.  I'm now refining the logic to account for different access requests.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been homing in on the crux of this ticket: a new intern needing an access card and the associated onboarding forms. \"Access\" is looking like the winner, given the explicit \"access card\" mention. \"HR Support\" keeps bubbling up, but I'm leaning toward \"Access\" for its direct relevance to the physical and logical permissions requested. I'm now testing the criteria with variations in wording.\n\n\n**Finalizing Access Determination**\n\nI'm now completely set on \"Access\" as the right category. I've reevaluated, and while \"HR Support\" has its merits for the broader onboarding context, the explicit \"access card\" detail seals the deal for \"Access.\" The forms for interns are a secondary aspect to getting their access enabled. The phrase \"new starter access card\" makes \"Access\" the central focus. I'm now documenting my reasoning to justify the selection.\n\n\n"
