The task involves analyzing the text of each ticket and assigning it to a predefined category. My initial approach is to perform a keyword analysis. I'll need to define how to handle ambiguous cases and decide on which specific keywords to use for each category.\n\n\n**Identifying Access Issues**\n\nI've been examining these IT tickets with a keen eye toward identifying access-related issues. The recurring keywords like \"cannot access,\" \"access,\" and \"granted\" are proving instrumental. My current strategy centers on refining these keywords to capture nuanced scenarios and ensure accurate category assignment. I'm also considering how to handle phrases or the context of the words to determine the category. My next step will be to finalize the logic rules.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've determined that all the provided tickets are related to access issues, based on the prevalence of keywords like \"cannot access,\" \"access,\" and variations of \"contributor rights.\" The context makes the \"Access\" category the most appropriate, as it encompasses requests for, and problems with, obtaining permissions to resources. I've ruled out other categories like \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" because the text doesn't indicate any issues related to those areas.\n\n\n"
