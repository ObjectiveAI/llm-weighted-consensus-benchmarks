The language used, particularly \"annual leave,\" \"vacation days,\" and \"leave approval,\" clearly indicate an HR-related inquiry. While there's a mention of a \"submit button,\" this is likely incidental to the HR process itself. Therefore, HR Support is the most appropriate classification.\n\n\n"
