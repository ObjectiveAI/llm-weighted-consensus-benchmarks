The user's text strongly suggests an \"Access\" issue, given the frequent mentions of \"access,\" \"approve,\" and file-related terminology. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the primary category, but I'll continue reviewing for any nuances that might indicate a secondary category is relevant.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Needs**\n\nI've honed in on \"Access\" as the dominant category, given the recurrent terms like \"approve\" and \"file maps.\" The user's need for access is clear. I've been carefully reviewing the ticket's language to confirm my assessment. I want to make sure I'm capturing the essence of the request accurately. Currently, I'm confident that Access is the most suitable, primary classification.\n\n\n"
