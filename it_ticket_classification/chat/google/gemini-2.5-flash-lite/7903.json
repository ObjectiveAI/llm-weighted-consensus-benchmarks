The phrases \"maternity leaver hardware\" and \"disable her\" suggest it might fall under \"Hardware\" or \"HR Support\", but I need to consider all the nuances to be certain. Right now, I am leaning toward a combination of hardware and support for this case.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Core Issue**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on the *reason* for the ticket, not just the actions. \"HR Support\" clearly aligns because the prompt stems from a maternity leave, triggering account deactivation and related actions, the core of the issue. While access rights and hardware are mentioned, they are supporting details tied to the HR policy for employee departure. This perspective makes HR Support the most appropriate category.\n\n\n"
