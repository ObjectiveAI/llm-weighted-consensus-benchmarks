I'm also considering the context surrounding the transfer requests, as that could provide valuable insight.\n\n\n**Identifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the HR-related nature of the ticket. The phrases \"transfer request,\" \"salary,\" \"probation period,\" and \"work location\" are key indicators. Considering the provided categories, \"HR Support\" appears to be the most accurate classification. I'm now certain of this.\n\n\n"
