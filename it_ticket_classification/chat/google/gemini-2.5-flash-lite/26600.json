My goal is to map the content to one of the predefined categories like Hardware, HR Support, Access, or others, by identifying key terms and recurring themes.\n\n**Mapping IT Requests**\n\nI'm continuing to refine my understanding of the IT ticket's content. By identifying keywords like \"credentials\" and \"create,\" I've concluded the request aligns most closely with the \"Access\" category, as it pertains to account setup and permissions.\n\n**Processing Ticket Details**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the ticket's content, focusing on recurring phrases like \"create,\" \"add owner,\" and \"ad credentials.\" This leads me to believe the request primarily concerns user account setup and permissions, strongly pointing towards the \"Access\" category.\n\n"
