I'm carefully considering which category aligns best with the available information.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've just finished analyzing the ticket text, and the HR category is definitely the best fit. I've considered each of the potential categories, but the phrases regarding absences and annual leave submissions make \"HR Support\" the clear choice. The technical error seems to be a symptom of a problem within an HR-related system, rather than an underlying hardware issue.\n\n\n"
