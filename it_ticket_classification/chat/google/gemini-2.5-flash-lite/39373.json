The options are: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I need to make a solid call.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text describing the lost connection and weighed the provided category options. Initial instincts leaned towards \"Hardware\", which still seems most appropriate. While \"Access\" could be relevant, the emphasis on connection loss suggests a hardware or network infrastructure issue. After a thorough review, \"Hardware\" remains the definitive answer, aligning perfectly with the core issue described in the ticket.\n\n\n"
