While initial analysis suggested \"Hardware\" due to repeated mentions of laptop replacement and screen issues, I'm giving further consideration to the \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" categories due to the references to renaming devices and permissions. My aim is to select the most precise category for accurate routing.\n\n**Selecting IT Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket description, noting the recurring themes of laptop replacement and hardware issues like screen flickering and hard drive swaps. While some mentions relate to device renaming and permissions, the overwhelming focus points to hardware as the primary category.\n\n"
