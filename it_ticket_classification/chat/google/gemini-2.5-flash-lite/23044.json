Keywords like \"locations\" and \"job search selector\" initially suggest \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access,\" but the context is unclear. I need to refine the analysis to determine the most fitting category, considering the limited information and potential ambiguity. I may need further clarification.\n\n\n**Analyzing Internal Project Scope**\n\nI've determined that this ticket likely falls under \"Internal Project.\" While the initial keywords pointed toward \"HR Support\" or \"Access,\" a closer look at the task reveals its technical nature: adding locations to a job search selector. I'm focusing on \"Internal Project\" as the best fit, a task pertaining to development, configuration, or enhancements to an internal system, as supported by the keywords \"adding\", \"activate\", and the general context. I am avoiding all of the other options because they do not fit the evidence.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Scope**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Internal Project\" categorization. The ticket's focus on \"adding new locations\" to a \"job search selector\" confirms this. While other options were considered, the technical nature of the request, centered around internal system modification and enhancements, clearly points towards an internal development or configuration project. The keywords all point to a technical task.\n\n\n"
