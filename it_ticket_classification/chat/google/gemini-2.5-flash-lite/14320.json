                    "reasoning": "**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently trying to assign the correct category to this IT ticket, and I've started by examining the text provided. The key phrases I see are \"change of line managers,\" which might relate to HR or access, and \"oracle wednesday pm,\" that suggests some technical configuration. I'm leaning toward HR Support, however I'm also considering Access as a possibility given that this ticket mentions both users and system-accessing software.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and the potential categories. The \"change of line managers\" aspect initially pointed toward HR Support, however, the \"submit button unavailable\" issue seems like a crucial technical problem. I'm focusing on \"Access\" as the primary category because the inability to submit suggests a restriction in system access or functionality, which may or may not include administrative rights. I'll need to further analyze the context to make a definitive choice.\n\n\n**Prioritizing the Technical Problem**\n\nI'm now focusing on the \"submit button unavailable\" issue in this IT ticket. Although the ticket includes the context of \"change of line managers,\" the core problem appears to be a functional system issue. This points toward \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" if the submit button is part of an HR system, but \"Access\" is more relevant to the direct issue. I've considered that the issue could be a bug. I need to get further confirmation to determine whether it is an HR system problem or a standard functional issue.\n\n\n**Clarifying Ticket's Nature**\n\nI'm now focusing on the ticket's core intent. I'm reassessing whether the \"change of line managers\" aspect is the primary concern, or if the \"submit button unavailable\" is the main issue. I'm finding that if the issue is a bug within an HR-related system, \"HR Support\" becomes the more appropriate category, even though it's technically a system problem. The issue is likely the user trying to perform a workflow action within an HR system.\n\n\n**Categorizing IT Ticket Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories. The primary concern is the \"submit button unavailable\" problem. While the context relates to a \"change of line managers\" and Oracle, the central issue is that the user can't perform an action, which can be interpreted as an access restriction or, more likely, a bug in the HR system's process. Given the IT support structure, I've decided this fits under HR Support, implying the IT team is responsible for fixing issues within the HR system to enable the user to perform their line manager change.\n\n\n**Determining the Ticket Focus**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories. The primary concern is the \"submit button unavailable\" problem, in relation to a \"change of line managers.\" I'm now leaning more towards \"HR Support\" because the IT team might be responsible for addressing IT problems in the context of the HR workflow within the Oracle system. While \"Access\" is still relevant, the root issue is an inability to perform a core HR function.\n\n\n**Identifying the Core Problem**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the essence of this ticket. While the \"change of line managers\" aspect hints at HR, the key issue is the user's inability to submit. The context, being within an Oracle system, suggests that it's a software malfunction. Based on the fact the user cannot perform an essential HR-related action, I'm now leaning more towards classifying it under \"HR Support\".\n\n\n**Defining Ticket's Purpose**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories. The core issue is the user's inability to submit, stemming from the HR workflow. The \"change of line managers\" is clearly an HR function and the submit button is part of that process. Therefore, I'm now certain that this IT ticket is best categorized as \"HR Support\".\n\n\n"
