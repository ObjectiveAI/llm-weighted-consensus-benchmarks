I am cross-referencing this to find an obvious category.\n\n\n**Analyzing Keywords: Refined**\n\nI've honed in on the keywords within the ticket, particularly \"new project codes\" and their connection to \"annual special and public holiday\" and \"absences.\" My current thinking leans heavily towards \"Internal Project\" as the primary category, but I'm still considering the potential HR implications. The connection between \"project codes\" and scheduled holidays and absences suggests a project setup that requires HR considerations. I'm weighing whether to select Internal Project as the primary and HR support as a secondary.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category: Resolved**\n\nI've made the final call, and \"Internal Project\" is the primary category. The initial keywords, plus my analysis, solidified the project setup nature of the request. The emphasis on \"project codes\" for holidays/absences confirmed the need for a project-focused, rather than purely HR, categorization.\n\n\n**Revisiting Criteria: Confirmed**\n\nI've re-examined the core request. Although \"absences\" and \"holidays\" are linked, the crux is establishing \"project codes\" to manage these. It's less an HR query and more a project requiring this new system. This strongly reinforces \"Internal Project\" as the key categorization. I've ruled out the more generic categories in favor of the more detailed \"Internal Project\". The \"annual special and public holiday\" and \"absences\" now form a use-case for the project codes.\n\n\n"
