At first glance, \"HR Support\" seemed right, but now I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" The \"job title change\" phrase keeps recurring, which could signify access level changes are required. I'll need to dig deeper into the actual permissions the user is requesting.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Core Issue**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the best fit for this ticket. The title's repeated phrases about \"job title change\" and \"grade\" solidify this conclusion. While \"Administrative Rights\" is relevant to the process, the *core* issue falls squarely within HR's domain, requiring their assistance or action.\n\n\n"
