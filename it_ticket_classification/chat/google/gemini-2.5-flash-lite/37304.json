Considering the provided categories, \"Access\" seems like the most fitting, given the security implications of managing physical access. However, I want to confirm I'm not overlooking a nuanced aspect; perhaps \"HR Support\" has related processes.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've determined that \"Access\" is the most accurate category for the ticket. The core concern revolves around the security breach resulting from the lost ID card. Deactivating access is a fundamental aspect of access control. While HR might be involved in ID management, the primary IT action is direct control over access rights, making \"Access\" the best fit.\n\n\n"
