I must refine these to map accurately to the specified options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" or \"Administrative rights.\" My goal is to select the category for this ticket.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Details**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket content, which includes phrases like \"oracle app details\" and \"change password\". This leads me to believe the crux of the issue revolves around application access. Upon considering the options, \"Access\" emerges as the most suitable category. The user's query centers on obtaining login information and instructions for an Oracle application, making this the most fitting classification.\n\n\n"
