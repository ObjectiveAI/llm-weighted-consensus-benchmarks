The phrase \"new starter\" and the presence of a form suggest a possible link to HR processes or onboarding. I'm carefully considering each available category to find the best fit, while also looking for any other subtle clues within the text.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and the available categories. \"New starter\" and the attached form point strongly towards either HR Support or Access. I'm leaning toward HR Support as the primary category since it encompasses the broader onboarding process. I'm focusing on the form-related aspect, and attempting to determine if the form is primarily for granting access or for other HR functions.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content, focusing on keywords. The \"new starter\" phrase, combined with the presence of a \"completed form,\" points directly to onboarding. While access provisioning is a possibility, the form's general nature and request to \"fill date\" make HR Support the most fitting primary category. The other categories are less relevant.\n\n\n"
