I'm leaning toward categorizing it as \"Access\" based on this initial assessment.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's language, identifying key phrases such as \"permissions,\" \"visibility,\" and \"shared folders,\" and their relation to \"add people.\" The focus seems to be on data accessibility. While \"Storage\" is relevant, \"Access\" encompasses the broader problem of controlling user permissions and data visibility. It's a finer-grained categorization that better reflects the user's need.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Key Components**\n\nNow, I'm diving deeper into the nuances. While \"Storage\" is relevant because files are involved, the core problem revolves around controlling *who* can access those files and folders. The phrases about \"add people,\" \"permissions,\" and \"visibility\" all scream \"Access\" management. I'm focusing on the user's need to control data access, making \"Access\" a more accurate descriptor than \"Storage,\" which is more the system *where* they're stored.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the essence of the issue. The repeated mentions of user addition, permissions, group management, and visibility, coupled with the file retrieval challenge post-migration, strongly indicate that the central concern is *access control*. While \"Storage\" is undeniably involved (files *are* lost), the user's immediate need is to restore and manage who can *access* what. This is a crucial distinction.\n\n\n"
