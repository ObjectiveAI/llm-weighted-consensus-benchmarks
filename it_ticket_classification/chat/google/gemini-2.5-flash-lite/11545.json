Considering the available categories, it seems like \"Access\" or potentially \"Miscellaneous\" might be most relevant. I need to determine the specific access type that is affected to categorize this ticket.\n\n\n**Defining Access Issues**\n\nI've been going through more details now. The consistent theme is certificates, expiry, and their impact on system access. The text confirms the initial inclination towards \"Access\" is correct, based on the descriptions of inaccessibility due to expired certificates and the related management procedures. It also seems this is not a one-off issue, but more of a systemic issue that might be solved with a new process.\n\n\n"
