Considering the request involves access provisioning for an external user to a shared folder, I'm leaning toward 'Access Management' or 'Permissions Request.' The specifics indicate file upload and viewing privileges, further solidifying this direction.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Requirements**\n\nI've refined the ticket categorization process. My current assessment leans heavily toward 'Access' as the primary category. The external user's need to upload and view files within a shared folder dictates this, along with the request to establish share credentials. Although 'Storage' is relevant because of the file storage aspect, the central issue revolves around granting initial access. This categorization addresses all requirements in a focused manner.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Priority**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best fit: \"Access\" remains the frontrunner. The request centers on granting an external user upload and view access to a shared folder. Creating share credentials underlines this. \"Storage\" is relevant, but the core issue is the granting of permissions, so I'm finalizing my decision on \"Access\". It is the most encompassing and directly reflects the ticket's primary objective: establishing access for the external designer.\n\n\n"
