I've analyzed the keywords and phrases within the provided text, and I'm leaning toward selecting the best fit from the allowed categories.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on differentiating between \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" While the \"add to confluence\" aspect could imply admin privileges, the phrase \"users share\" leans me toward a more general access grant or collaboration setup. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" as the primary category, but I'm open to further refinement. I'll need to confirm that \"share\" isn't a term specific to internal admin rights.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Optimal Choice**\n\nI've examined the ticket text again, honing in on \"add instance\" and \"users share.\" My gut still points to \"Access,\" given the core function is granting someone the capability to interact with Confluence. I'm scrutinizing \"add instance\" in detail; it could involve some administrative actions. But, \"users share\" keeps emphasizing that core collaborative access is central. The \"Access\" category is still the best fit. I've ruled out \"Administrative rights,\" but want to be absolutely sure this doesn't involve elevated permissions.\n\n\n"
