The brevity and jargon (\"starter form\") point toward \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access,\" but the complete lack of context is a challenge. I need a more robust method for handling such short, ambiguous entries. Focusing on keyword matching is proving insufficient.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"HR Support\" as the primary category for this ticket. The core request, \"filling out starter form,\" combined with \"new starter,\" points directly to the onboarding process that IT assists HR with. While \"Access\" is relevant, the initial form request leans more heavily towards the broader HR-centric workflow. I'm building more sophisticated rules to differentiate between access requests and broader HR setup tasks.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Issue**\n\nI've examined the ticket text (\"new starter tuesday pm starter form hello please help by filling out starter form thank ext\") and available categories, concluding \"HR Support\" is the most fitting. \"New starter\" and \"starter form\" clearly indicate onboarding, where IT often assists HR.  While \"Access\" is relevant, the core action is form completion, placing it firmly within the HR workflow. The rules are now weighted towards HR-centric onboarding tasks.\n\n\n"
