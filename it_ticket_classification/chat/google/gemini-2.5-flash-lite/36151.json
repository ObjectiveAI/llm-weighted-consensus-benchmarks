I'm carefully considering the context, but the core issue seems to be an access problem. I will soon be ready to identify the best category.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted towards the most salient keywords, now that I have parsed through the user's text. This has quickly led me to the conclusion that access is the root of the problem. After a thorough review, I've confirmed that the primary task is to reset a password, so my final assessment remains the same.\n\n\n"
