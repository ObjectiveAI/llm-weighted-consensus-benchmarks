While it could touch on aspects of access, the core issue seems related to an HR system or potentially administrative rights within that system.  I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the primary category, but I'm keeping \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" as possibilities to consider. I'm carefully reviewing the options.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI've honed in on the HR Support category. The issue, centered around timecard processing and the \"empty displayed\" message, strongly points to an HR system problem. Access is a secondary concern; the core issue lies in the system's functionality. I am confident in my categorization, though I will keep an eye on potential sub-categorizations within the HR sphere.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've determined that the \"empty displayed\" message points directly to an HR system malfunction related to timecards. While access might be implicated indirectly, the primary issue is the system's inability to render or process timecard data. This strongly reinforces the \"HR Support\" categorization, perhaps necessitating a more specific sub-category within it. I'm exploring potential solutions.\n\n\n"
