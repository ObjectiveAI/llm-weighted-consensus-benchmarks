I need to select from categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The clues strongly suggest \"Access\" as the appropriate classification.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket Classification**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nI've refined the keyword analysis, focusing on \"password reset,\" \"expire,\" and \"change.\" The phrase \"urgency: high\" pops out, highlighting the immediate need.  I've systematically eliminated other categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others, confirming \"Access\" as the precise fit. The ticket's emphasis is squarely on user access and authentication.\n\n\n"
