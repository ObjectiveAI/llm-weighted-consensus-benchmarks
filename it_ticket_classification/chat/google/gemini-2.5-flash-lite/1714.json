After a close read, the key phrase \"internship program\" suggests this relates to new employee onboarding. The most suitable category seems to be \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n**Evaluating Onboarding Context**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text, identifying key phrases such as \"new starter,\" \"internship program,\" and \"change accounts credentials.\" I am zeroing in on onboarding a new employee, specifically the process of setting up their account. The phrases strongly suggest this is the core function of the ticket, which leads me to believe the most suitable category is \"HR Support\", with the possibility of \"Access\" being secondary, although less relevant.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Focus**\n\nAfter further analysis, I've confirmed that \"HR Support\" remains the most accurate categorization. While \"Access\" is indirectly involved due to credential changes, the underlying trigger is the new employee's onboarding process. The phrases \"new starter,\" \"internship program,\" and \"accepted job offer\" all point to HR initiating the IT request.\n\n\n"
