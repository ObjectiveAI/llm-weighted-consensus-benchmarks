The text \"interns to borrow books from library\" is my primary data point. This one seems straightforward, I think I've got it. I'm almost there.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the context surrounding the library access request. The core of this appears to be an internal policy or onboarding question related to interns, leaning heavily towards \"HR Support.\"  I'm weighing that against \"Miscellaneous,\" but the strong emphasis on interns and their experience is solidifying my original intuition. I'm focusing on the nuances of \"HR Support\" to finalize my decision.\n\n\n**Confirming the Classification**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"HR Support\" as the definitive category. I have reviewed all the examples and compared them meticulously to the options. My analysis shows that several clues, such as the use of the word \"interns\" and the phrases, directly point towards this area, rather than any others. Specifically, the various ways the library access request is phrased (\"interns to borrow books,\" \"interns raised issue,\" etc.) consistently suggest an HR-related concern.\n\n\n"
