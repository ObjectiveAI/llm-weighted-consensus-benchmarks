The keywords \"security headers,\" \"cookie,\" and the mention of a \"compliance officer\" strongly indicate a focus on web security and regulatory compliance, leading me to consider \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" as the most fitting options.\n\n**Setting Security Headers**\n\nI'm continuing to analyze the IT ticket, focusing on keywords like \"security headers,\" \"cookie,\" and \"compliance officer.\" My current assessment leans towards classifying this task under \"Access,\" interpreting it as the configuration required to ensure the secure interaction and operation of the site for its users.\n\n**Configuring Website Security**\n\nI'm currently focused on classifying this IT ticket.
