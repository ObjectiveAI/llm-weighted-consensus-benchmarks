The mention of \"careers web,\" \"search jobs,\" and \"make change\" suggests it likely pertains to a web-based system or application modification, rather than hardware or HR issues.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm focusing on mapping the specific elements of the IT ticket to the most fitting category. The recurring themes of \"careers web,\" \"search jobs,\" and \"make change\" strongly point towards a web application modification, making \"Internal Project\" or potentially \"Miscellaneous\" the most likely candidates, with a leaning towards the former due to the specific nature of the change requested on a functional component.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI've been examining the IT ticket, and based on keywords like \"careers web\" and \"search jobs,\" I'm leaning towards classifying it under \"Miscellaneous.\" While it touches on job postings, the request is specifically for a change to the web interface, which doesn't neatly fit other technical or support categories provided.\n\n**Categorizing IT Request**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the IT ticket content, focusing on keywords like \"careers web\" and \"search jobs\" to determine the best category. Given the specific nature of the requested change on a web feature, and the absence of a more precise category, \"Miscellaneous\" appears to be the most fitting option to accurately reflect the request.\n\n"
