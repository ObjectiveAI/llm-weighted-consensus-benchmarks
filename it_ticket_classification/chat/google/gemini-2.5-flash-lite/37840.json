After carefully analyzing the text, my initial instinct points toward \"Access\" as the most relevant category. The user's inability to \"see\" something suggests a permission or access problem. I'm double-checking this against other potential categories, but \"Access\" remains the leading contender.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Relevance**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. While \"Access\" was a strong contender, the context points more definitively to \"HR Support.\" The issue revolves around viewing information related to a line manager and potentially career development, strongly aligning with HR-related systems. The problem isn't just about general access, but specifically what the user can see within an HR context. I'm moving forward with this categorization.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter reviewing the ticket again, my analysis strengthens the 'HR Support' category. The user's inability to view information about their line manager and concerns about career progression are central. Although an access element is likely involved, the issue's *nature* aligns more closely with HR-related systems and data. Therefore, I believe the appropriate category is HR Support.\n\n\n"
