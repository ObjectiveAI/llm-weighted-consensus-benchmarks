The request to \"get cleared out\" and understand the process further solidifies this.\n\n**Determining HR Support**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the ticket's content, and the repeated references to employee leavers, historical data, absence reports, and the desire to \"get cleared out\" strongly point towards the HR Support category. My analysis confirms this is the most appropriate classification for the user's request.\n\n"
