The text, \"new starter wednesday november hello please fill starting thank,\" strongly points towards a request related to onboarding a new employee. However, none of the existing categories seem to be explicitly about this. I'm considering if it could fall under \"HR Support\" or if a more specific category is needed.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Choices**\n\nI've refined my thinking by closely analyzing the available categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket's content, \"new starter wednesday november hello please fill starting thank,\" decisively points toward onboarding. While \"Hardware\" and \"Access\" are pertinent aspects of onboarding, \"HR Support\" appears most encompassing, as onboarding falls squarely within HR's purview. Therefore, I believe \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate primary category.\n\n\n**Determining Primary Fit**\n\nI'm now certain that \"HR Support\" is the primary category for this ticket. My reasoning centers on the strong connection between \"new starter\" requests and HR's role in the onboarding process. Even though \"Access\" and \"Hardware\" are pertinent aspects, the ticket's core intent aligns most directly with HR's responsibilities.\n\n\n"
