I've ruled out HR Support, Access, and Administrative Rights. The focus seems to be on a technical process, leaning towards either Hardware, Storage, or possibly an Internal Project related to server decommissioning. The word \"duplicate\" is intriguing, and I'm further analyzing the phrase \"it ops tasks\" for a final determination.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Selection**\n\nMy thinking has moved beyond initial keyword identification. I've analyzed the ticket content, focusing on phrases related to server decommissioning. The keywords point strongly towards \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category. Although \"Internal Project\" is a possibility, \"Hardware\" aligns better with the core action of server removal. The presence of \"duplicate\" suggests potential process inefficiencies.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Choices**\n\nI've refined my category selection based on the elaborated ticket content, which focuses more on the technical tasks involved in server decommissioning. The phrases point strongly toward the removal of servers. \"Hardware\" is the most precise match, as the core activity is tied to a physical asset. I've considered \"Internal Project,\" but \"Hardware\" better captures the action.\n\n\n"
