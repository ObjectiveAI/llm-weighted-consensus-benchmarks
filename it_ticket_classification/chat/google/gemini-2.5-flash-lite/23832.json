The phrasing regarding \"delete the yammer analysis discipline\" and \"owner rights\" is giving me some clues.  It's leaning towards access or administrative rights. I'm focusing on the context to make the final determination.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm solidifying my choice of \"Access\" as the appropriate ticket category. The keywords \"delete,\" \"owner rights,\" and \"permissions\" are all pointing in that direction. The focus is on who can do what, especially deletion and ownership, within an analysis site. \"Administrative rights\" remains a possibility, but \"Access\" is the most direct fit considering the granular nature of the described actions.\n\n\n"
