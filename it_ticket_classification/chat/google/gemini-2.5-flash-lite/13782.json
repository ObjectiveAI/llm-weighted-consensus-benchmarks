The text is a bit garbled, but I've identified key terms like \"maternity leave,\" which strongly suggests an \"HR Support\" issue. While other categories might be considered, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the primary categorization. I'll need to consider how the other categories could apply, if at all.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choices**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's contents. The initial categorization of \"HR Support\" appears sound, given the emphasis on leave, resignations, and employee record updates. While the mention of reports could tangentially touch \"Access\" or \"Storage,\" they seem secondary. My focus remains on the core HR-related aspects; I'm satisfied with \"HR Support\" as the definitive primary category.\n\n\n"
