The approval process reinforces that. I've ruled out the hardware, access, and storage options, as they don't seem applicable. Internal project doesn't fit either. I'm focusing on \"HR Support\" as the likely fit.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've solidified my choice as \"HR Support.\" The recurring theme of leave management and approval workflows confirms it. I've eliminated the remaining possibilities by cross-referencing against the ticket content. The administrative processes described are key to HR functions, not hardware, storage, or access. The information provided points decisively toward this category.\n\n\n**Identifying Key Elements**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided text and pinpointing crucial keywords. The focus is on annual leave, approvals, and allowances, confirming an HR angle. Terms like \"requestor,\" \"authorize,\" and \"rejection reason\" support this. I've narrowed it down to HR Support based on this targeted assessment. The system interface description also reinforces the HR nature of the task.\n\n\n"
