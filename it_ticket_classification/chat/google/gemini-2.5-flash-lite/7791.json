I'm focusing on identifying the core issue and determining the right category. I believe the ticket clearly describes an HR Support related issue.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI've been analyzing the text \"new starter intern sd hello please fill thanks upcoming annual leave administration officer\". The initial focus was on keywords like \"new starter\" and \"annual leave.\" I've narrowed down the potential categories based on this analysis, carefully considering how each term relates to the options available. After a thorough review, I've concluded that \"HR Support\" is the most apt choice, given the strong presence of onboarding and leave-related keywords, making it the most suitable category.\n\n\n**Deciding the Ticket Category**\n\nI've been going through the ticket details, keeping the available categories in mind. After weighing all the factors, I've decided HR Support is the most sensible. Onboarding a \"new starter\" and dealing with \"upcoming annual leave\" are core HR functions. While aspects of access might apply, HR encompasses the most critical requirements outlined in the ticket.\n\n\n"
