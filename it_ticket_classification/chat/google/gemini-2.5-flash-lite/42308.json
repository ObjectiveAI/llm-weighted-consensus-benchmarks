I see the text relates to project forecasting, but none of the existing categories seem to perfectly fit. Should I classify this as \"Internal Project\" due to the project-related nature? Or maybe it's \"Miscellaneous,\" since it doesn't align with the other, more specific categories? I am leaning toward Internal Project because the issues seem to revolve around open and closed project forecasting.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided text and eliminating unsuitable categories. \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", and \"Purchase\" can all be confidently ruled out. The ticket's content, which includes terms like \"forecasting,\" \"budgeting,\" and \"project cycles,\" aligns perfectly with \"Internal Project.\" I'm now certain this is the best categorization.\n\n\n"
