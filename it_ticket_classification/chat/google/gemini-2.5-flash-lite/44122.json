I'm leaning toward a hardware or potential storage problem, given the technical nature of the wording.\n\n\n**Evaluating Connectivity Issues**\n\nI'm now honing in on the network connectivity issues presented in the ticket.  The symptoms\u2014frequent disconnections, manual reconnections, and the inability to submit drafts\u2014strongly suggest a problem with either the Wi-Fi or general internet access.  I've compared the provided options. Access seems like the best fit, as the user is unable to access services, but hardware should also be considered.\n\n\n**Assessing Access Problems**\n\nI'm now evaluating the issue, leaning toward \"Access\" as the core problem. The erratic disconnections, the need for manual reconnection, and the inability to submit drafts all strongly suggest the user is experiencing intermittent access to necessary services. While a failing Wi-Fi card is possible, the problem's nature seems to be network instability. \"Access\" is the most fitting broad category considering the options. If there was a more specific \"Network\" category, that would be ideal.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Selection**\n\nMy thinking has shifted slightly. While \"Access\" still seems appropriate, I'm now leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the primary categorization. The \"fails every few hours\" and \"moving between floors\" details strongly suggest a failing Wi-Fi card or inconsistent network connection caused by a hardware problem. While network instability could cause these symptoms, the intermittent nature, combined with the movement element, suggests a device-specific hardware issue. The user's experience is a loss of connection, which is a symptom of failing hardware.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Problems**\n\nI've revised my thought process and now believe the primary category should be \"Access,\" given the user's explicit struggle to maintain a connection and submit work. Despite earlier consideration of \"Hardware,\" the focus is now on the user's ongoing inability to utilize resources due to disconnections. It's not a definitive hardware failure, but rather, a consistent access problem.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nAfter revisiting the categorization, I'm now certain that \"Access\" is the most accurate classification. The user's trouble with frequent disconnections, manual reconnections, and the inability to submit their work all directly indicate an access issue. \"Hardware\" might seem relevant, but the problem isn't a definitive hardware failure, but an inability to maintain consistent access due to underlying network issues.\n\n\n"
