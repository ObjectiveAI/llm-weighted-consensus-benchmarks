The \"he has left\" detail, coupled with \"m\", suggests a potential HR-related issue, but the \"oracle info\" and \"reports\" language throws a wrench in that. I'm leaning towards \"HR Support,\" but I'll need more context to be certain. The user's field expertise will be crucial in clarifying if this is a handover issue, or something else.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on the \"HR Support\" category, given the strong signals regarding personnel changes and record updates. While \"Access\" could be relevant as a secondary concern, the ticket's core seems centered on the impact of an employee leaving and the need to process related information, like access revocation or updated reports. The \"oracle info\" and \"managing director germany\" aspects suggest a need for HR-related reports generated from some information system which needs updates. I'm prioritizing \"HR Support\" as the most direct match.\n\n\n"
