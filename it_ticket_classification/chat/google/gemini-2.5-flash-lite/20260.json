I'm identifying recurring themes within the tickets to determine the appropriate category. I've begun noticing frequent requests for \"access for\" specific applications or resources. My goal is to streamline the categorization process and improve accuracy.\n\n\n**Identifying Key Themes**\n\nI've been drilling down on the content within the IT tickets, specifically those pertaining to \"Access.\" Key phrases like \"external users,\" \"password changes,\" and \"AD users\" are surfacing repeatedly.  These clearly point towards access management tasks, solidifying the \"Access\" categorization for these tickets. My analysis now zeroes in on refining these access-related distinctions.\n\n\n"
