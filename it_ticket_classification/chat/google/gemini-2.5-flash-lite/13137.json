Recent analysis highlights a strong association between terms like \"leaver\" and \"termination\" with an HR Support category, but I need to make sure the model can accurately distinguish between related but different topics.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Relevance**\n\nI've determined that the \"HR Support\" category is the best fit for this ticket. The core theme of the text revolves around an employee's departure, specifically mentioning terms like \"leaver\" and \"termination,\" which strongly suggests HR-related processes. I've ruled out other categories like \"Access\" because while it's a consequence of the process, it's not the primary focus of the request.\n\n\n"
