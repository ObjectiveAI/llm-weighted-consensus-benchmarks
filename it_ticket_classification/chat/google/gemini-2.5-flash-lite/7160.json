This strongly suggests an access-related issue. The \"sudden\" aspect may indicate urgency but doesn't point to a specific category. My initial leaning is towards \"Access\", but I'm cross-referencing this with all provided context to be sure.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Possibilities**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Access\" as the most likely category. The phrases \"buyer role employees\", \"ensure role removed\", and the request to \"provide again employees buyer rights\" all point directly to a permissions issue. While the \"sudden\" aspect introduces a temporal element, the core problem is clearly access-related.  I've eliminated other categories based on their lack of direct relevance.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've carefully considered each category, and the evidence continues to point strongly to \"Access\". The phrases \"buyer role employees,\" \"ensure role removed,\" and the request to restore those permissions clinch it. While \"Administrative rights\" is close, \"Access\" encompasses the broader management of specific roles like \"buyer,\" making it the more accurate choice. I'm now completely confident in classifying this ticket as an \"Access\" issue.\n\n\n"
