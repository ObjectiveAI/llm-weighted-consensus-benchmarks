                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI'm currently focused on categorizing this IT ticket. After analyzing the text, \"oracle add and vised pm there too the list\", I'm leaning toward selecting a category. The keywords suggest a need for access or perhaps a system modification. However, the details are unclear, and further context would be beneficial to assign a more precise category. I must choose from \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\".\n\n\n**Analyzing Cost Management**\n\nI've been drilling down on the ticket's cost-related aspects. While \"Access\" seemed initially relevant, the deeper dive into phrases like \"manage costs,\" \"export excel,\" and \"posted codes\" steers me towards a more finance-focused category. The \"add vised pm\" elements still hint at access within that financial context, but the emphasis is undeniably on cost tracking and reporting. I'm reassessing the best fit among the categories I've got, considering \"Access\" as a secondary aspect of the broader financial focus. I'm ruling out \"Purchase\" too; there's no evidence of procurement requests here.\n\n\n**Defining the Scope**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on defining the scope for categorization. \"Internal Project\" remains a strong contender. The repeated phrase \"add vised pm\" hints at access within project management. The \"manage costs\" and \"export excel\" elements further solidify the financial project context. The key challenge lies in balancing \"Access\" with \"Internal Project\" as the primary focus. I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" because the cost management aspect seems central to the request, but I'll consider it a subsidiary facet of an access request. My analysis is focusing on aligning these two considerations. I'm continuing to fine-tune the category choice.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category. The analysis reinforces that the ticket encompasses both access and project management functions. Phrases like \"add vised pm\" reflect access requests but are embedded within the project management context. The financial elements, such as \"manage costs\" and \"export excel,\" further solidify the focus on project-related cost control and reporting. It's essentially access within the scope of managing an \"Internal Project\". The request goes beyond access; it includes project configuration, financial oversight, and perhaps financial administration within an existing project. I am completely content that \"Internal Project\" best encompasses all these considerations.\n\n\n**Selecting Project Focus**\n\nI've determined \"Internal Project\" best suits the ticket. After analyzing the provided text and eliminating less relevant categories, the project focus on \"Internal Project\" emerges. The request clearly emphasizes the addition of a project manager (PM) within an existing project structure, coupled with financial elements related to cost management, reporting, and exports, all of which fall squarely within the scope of internal project operations. Considering all details \"Internal Project\" encompasses both, access and financial focus; and is thus the most appropriate category.\n\n\n"
