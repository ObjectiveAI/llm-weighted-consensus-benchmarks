I am leaning towards the 'Internal Project' classification.\n\n\n**Confirming Project Context**\n\nI've further refined my assessment of the IT ticket's categorization. Keywords like \"location,\" \"grade,\" \"days,\" \"total,\" \"proposal,\" and \"cost recovery\" have solidified my inclination towards \"Internal Project.\" While \"Purchase\" was considered due to the financial elements, the project's core activities, like creating forms and codes, place it firmly within the \"Internal Project\" category. The presence of these terms, combined with the project names, overshadows the possibility of HR support, administrative rights, or other less relevant categories.\n\n\n"
