I'm leaning towards the \"Access\" category, but need to confirm no other factors are at play before making a final determination.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the central issue, fueled by ticket phrases indicating a need to assign ownership and provide permissions. Words like \"site owner,\" \"give write,\" and \"requested contribute\" cement my belief that \"Access\" is the right category. I'm ready to categorize.\n\n\n"
