The keywords \"new starter,\" \"starter forms,\" \"joiners,\" and \"former\" strongly suggest an HR-related issue. However, I'm also considering the potential for overlap with other categories, such as Access or Administrative Rights, depending on the specifics of the forms or permissions involved. Further refinement will be needed to pinpoint the most appropriate designation.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the optimal category for this IT ticket. The keywords \"new starter,\" \"starter forms,\" and \"joiners\" are the strongest indicators. While \"Secure ID\" hints at access-related needs, the core issue is clearly related to employee onboarding, a function generally handled by HR. The \"former employee\" reference, though relevant, is secondary to the new starter focus.\n\n\n"
