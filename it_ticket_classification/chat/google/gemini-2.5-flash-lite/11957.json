I'm carefully reviewing the text to distinguish which category is the best fit.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've honed in on the \"Miscellaneous\" category, leaning toward this as the best classification. My assessment is that the core issue revolves around the ticket system's operational glitches, notably in managing resolution statuses and backlog display. The text suggests discrepancies in status updates and visibility, indicating an internal system malfunction rather than a domain-specific problem. I'm confident in this choice.\n\n\n"
