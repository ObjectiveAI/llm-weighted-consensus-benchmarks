The text indicates \"display issues,\" specifically regarding \"laptop display resolution\" and \"drivers software.\" Based on this, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Hardware,\" as the issue seems to be directly related to the physical component or its associated software drivers. I need to make sure this is the most accurate.\n\n\n**Validating Hardware Fit**\n\nI've determined that \"Hardware\" is the strongest fit. The issue is display-centric, linked to resolution and drivers. Given the options, \"Hardware\" aligns best with the ticket's focus, as it pertains to the physical display component and its software. The other options are irrelevant to the described problem.\n\n\n"
