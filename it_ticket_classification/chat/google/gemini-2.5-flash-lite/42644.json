The ticket details a problem related to leave requests, which falls squarely within the scope of human resources-related inquiries, even if there's a technical glitch involved. I'm confident in this classification.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've solidified my initial categorization to \"HR Support.\" The issue is centered on a leave request and a discrepancy in displayed annual leave, which aligns perfectly with HR-related inquiries. Despite the technical aspect of the display error, the core problem is related to HR policy and processes.\n\n\n"
