Based on keywords like \"new starter\" and \"starter form,\" I'm leaning towards the \"HR Support\" category.\n\n**Granting User Access**\n\nI'm refining the classification of this IT ticket. The presence of \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" strongly suggests an \"Access\" request, as these typically precede account creation and permissions being granted for new hires.\n\n**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nI'm currently classifying an IT ticket. Given the keywords \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"joining,\" I'm prioritizing the \"Access\" category, as these terms strongly suggest a need for account provisioning and system permissions for a new employee.\n\n**Classifying Onboarding Ticket**\n\nI've determined that the primary IT action indicated by \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"joining\" is the provisioning of user accounts and permissions. Therefore, I'm categorizing this ticket under \"Access.\"\n\n**Categorizing Onboarding Ticket**\n\nI've concluded that the primary IT action implied by \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"joining\" is the provisioning of user accounts and permissions for a new employee. Therefore, I am categorizing this ticket under \"Access.\"\n\n**Classifying New Hire Onboarding**\n\nI'm classifying the IT ticket. Given the explicit mentions of \"new starter,\" a \"starter form,\" and the context of someone \"joining,\" my analysis strongly indicates the ticket pertains to the provisioning of user accounts and system access. Consequently, I am categorizing it under \"Access.\"\n\n"
