After careful analysis, I've narrowed it down to either a hardware or network issue, most likely a cable. The evidence points to hardware, a network cable, as the primary culprit.\n\n\n**Classifying the Ticket**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content, focusing on the core problem: a non-functional network cable. The symptoms, including cable functionality descriptions and past wireless issues, all point back to this hardware component. Analyzing the available categories, \"Hardware\" clearly stands out as the best fit, accurately reflecting the nature of the primary issue.\n\n\n"
