Based on the phrases like \"upload size available,\" and \"limitations uploading files,\" and the general desire to \"store\" something, I believe the category \"Storage\" is the most fitting. It aligns with the user's apparent need to manage and potentially increase storage capacity for files.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Selection**\n\nMy thinking has shifted slightly. While \"Storage\" remains relevant, the phrase \"restrictions uploads\" has prompted me to consider \"Access\" as a secondary possibility. The user might be facing permission-related issues preventing them from uploading files, rather than a pure storage limit. I'm now weighing which category best captures the core problem, possibly both.\n\n\n"
