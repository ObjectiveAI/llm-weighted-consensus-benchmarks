My initial assessment suggests that \"Access\" is the most fitting category, given the user's issue with accessing a particular team or menu. I'm exploring the nuances of the text to ensure complete accuracy.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm now considering the context of the issue. While HR support is a possibility given \"Oracle Hello Career,\" the core problem seems to be missing functionality. The user *can* access the system. \"Access\" still seems most appropriate. Although, the user does have access to the system, but not all features within it. I am refining my classification to account for this nuance.\n\n\n**Revisiting Ticket Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted to re-evaluating the \"Access\" category. While initial thoughts leaned towards it, I'm now honing in on the nuance of *feature* access within the Oracle Hello Career system. The user can access the system, but a \"team\" element is absent. It's becoming clearer that the problem is rooted in *permissioning* or feature availability rather than total system access.\n\n\n"
