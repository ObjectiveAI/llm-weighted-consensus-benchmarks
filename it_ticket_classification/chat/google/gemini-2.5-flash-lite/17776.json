The content, specifically mentioning \"bulk leaver form,\" \"interns,\" and \"school of testing,\" requires careful consideration in relation to the provided schema. I'm exploring the best fit, keeping in mind the available categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. My goal is to pinpoint the most relevant categorization.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category for the IT ticket. My thought process involved analyzing the content, considering the available schema, and weighing the relevance of each category. \"Leaver form\" is a key element that strongly aligns with HR processes, thus solidifying my choice. I'm satisfied that this is the best categorization option.\n\n\n"
