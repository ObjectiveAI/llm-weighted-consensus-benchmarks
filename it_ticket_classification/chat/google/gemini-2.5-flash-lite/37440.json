The list isn't a perfect fit, but I'm narrowing down my choices to the most relevant.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted towards the specific nature of the problem: time logging and approval. Although \"HR Support\" appears the strongest match, I'm taking a moment to eliminate any potential overlap with the other categories. I'm focusing on the keywords of \"time logging\" and \"approval\" to solidify the most relevant category.\n\n\n"
