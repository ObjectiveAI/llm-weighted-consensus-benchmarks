I'm carefully weighing the phrases and their implications against the schema's options.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket's Core Need**\n\nI'm now focusing on the core need expressed in the ticket, which seems directly related to onboarding a new employee. Phrases like \"new starter\", \"form complete,\" and \"administration officer\" all point toward HR processes. It's becoming evident that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category, encompassing the various onboarding tasks described.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've determined that the ticket concerns employee onboarding, clearly indicated by phrases like \"new starter\" and \"form complete.\" The presence of \"administration officer\" also supports this. Considering the provided categories, \"HR Support\" emerges as the most fitting, encompassing the described HR-related tasks and processes.\n\n\n"
