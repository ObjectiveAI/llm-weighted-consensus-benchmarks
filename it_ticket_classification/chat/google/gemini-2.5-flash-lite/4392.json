My initial thinking suggests \"Hardware\" might be the most appropriate, given the mention of \"disk memory\" and \"installation\". However, I'm also considering if \"Purchase\" might be relevant, as an order seems to have been placed. I'll need to analyze the language closely to determine the precise classification.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket: Update**\n\nI've re-evaluated the categorization. While \"Purchase\" is relevant because of the order, the emphasis is on installing the \"ram\" and \"disk memory\". Therefore, \"Hardware\" remains the primary category. The text indicates a request for the physical installation of new components, making \"Hardware\" the most fitting classification.\n\n\n**Revising Ticket Classification**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text, focusing on the core request. Although the phrase \"ordered disk memory\" hints at \"Purchase\", the emphasis is clearly on the physical *installation* of \"ram\" and \"disk memory\". Since \"Hardware\" comprehensively covers both RAM and disk memory and directly addresses the installation, I'm confident that it's the optimal category. \"Storage\" is too restrictive, as it omits the key RAM component. Therefore, my categorization remains \"Hardware.\"\n\n\n"
