The initial focus is on the ticket text to discern the user's need. I'm carefully analyzing the provided text and comparing it against the available categories, aiming for the most accurate classification.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've just finished analyzing the ticket text, and based on the provided details, \"Storage\" seems the most appropriate category. The ticket describes a full mailbox, indicating a storage capacity problem. I've concluded this after considering the different facets of the problem. It is essential to ensure this information is communicated clearly and accurately, hence I'm working to output this as a JSON object, following the stipulated schema, specifically including \"Storage\" as the selected category.\n\n\n"
