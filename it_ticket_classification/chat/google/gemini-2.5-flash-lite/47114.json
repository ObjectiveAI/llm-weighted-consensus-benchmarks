I've noted that computer files are affected and immediate action is needed, which points towards several possible categories. I am analyzing the available options, particularly considering \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" My objective now is to precisely determine which best aligns with the provided information.\n\n\n**Identifying the Root Cause**\n\nThe problem seems centered on corrupted or inaccessible files, and I've narrowed it down. Analyzing the data, the focus now is on understanding *why* files become inaccessible post-save.  I've ruled out Hardware, HR Support, Access, and Purchase.  Storage issues are becoming a leading candidate because the ticket describes files failing shortly after being saved.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI am now leaning heavily toward \"Storage\" as the definitive category. File corruption and immediate inaccessibility, especially after saving, are textbook indicators of storage-related issues. While other categories were considered and dismissed based on the provided details, this choice aligns most precisely with the presented symptoms. The focus will now shift toward investigating potential storage malfunctions.\n\n\n"
