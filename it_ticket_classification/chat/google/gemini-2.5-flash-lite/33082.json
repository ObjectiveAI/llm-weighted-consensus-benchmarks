After analyzing the text, I'm leaning towards \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" due to the mention of \"change pm\" and \"officer mob center\". I'll consider these options, keeping the other categories in mind as potential fallbacks if further analysis warrants a shift.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket Type**\n\nI'm now considering the context of \"PM\" within \"Oracle,\" recognizing it could mean \"Project Manager\" within an internal project. While \"Access\" still seems possible given the \"change\" request, \"Internal Project\" is gaining traction. I need to clarify if \"PM\" refers to a project role, which would determine the final classification.\n\n\n\n**Clarifying the 'PM' Context**\n\nI'm now exploring the potential meanings of \"PM\" in the \"Oracle\" context. My initial assessment leans towards \"Project Manager\" or potentially a specific Oracle project or module. To classify the ticket definitively, I need to know if \"PM\" refers to a job role requiring access changes (Administrative rights), an internal project needing configuration changes (Internal Project), or some other configuration. I'm focusing on the \"change\" request and its implications for user access or system settings.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Options**\n\nI'm now considering the context of \"PM\" within \"Oracle,\" recognizing it could mean \"Project Manager\" within an internal project. However, the ticket text's repetition of \"change pm\" suggests a more direct alteration. I'm focusing on \"Administrative rights\" if the user has a PM role to be updated, or \"Internal Project\" if it is a configuration. It's becoming clearer that \"change pm\" points towards a system-level modification.\n\n\n**Determining the Final Classification**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the possible meanings of \"PM\" in the Oracle context, and I've focused on the implication of requiring administrative access for the requested changes. After considering all the categories, it's clear that \"Administrative rights\" is the most likely categorization, given the user is requesting something be *changed* within Oracle that likely involves elevated privileges.\n\n\n"
