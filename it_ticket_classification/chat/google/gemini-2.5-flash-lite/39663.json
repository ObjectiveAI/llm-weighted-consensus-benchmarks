I've considered several categories, but am leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" given the lack of specific technical details and the referral aspect. I'm carefully reviewing the options to ensure the selection accurately reflects the content.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI'm now focusing on the \"cannot upload\" issue within the provided ticket text. While HR implications might be present due to the referral, the core technical problem seems primary. I am carefully weighing the \"Storage\" option, as an upload failure could indicate a storage limit, but it isn't certain. I still need to see if it aligns with the overall context.\n\n\n**Evaluating HR Implications**\n\nI've re-evaluated the \"HR Support\" category, and it seems to best encapsulate the problem. The core issue is the \"cannot upload\" concern, but the context points towards uploading a resume for a referral, an HR-related task. The \"Miscellaneous\" category felt too vague, and other technical categories didn't fully fit the context of the referral process and resume upload. Even if the underlying tech is at fault, HR processes are impacted. I am therefore prioritizing the HR angle here.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Context**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"HR Support\" classification. Despite the apparent upload failure, the \"resume\" and \"refer friend\" context firmly establishes the ticket's core function within the HR process. I've re-evaluated \"Storage\" and other technical possibilities, but the human resources element remains dominant. Even if the technical cause is a storage limit, the process being disrupted is HR-focused.\n\n\n**Confirming the HR Focus**\n\nThe \"HR Support\" category continues to be the best fit. I'm prioritizing the context of a \"resume\" upload linked to a \"refer friend\" initiative. While \"cannot upload\" is the technical problem, it disrupts an HR-driven process. The core function is to facilitate employee referrals through resume submissions, firmly placing it within HR support. Technical aspects are secondary.\n\n\n"
