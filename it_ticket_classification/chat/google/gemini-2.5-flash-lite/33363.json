The current text hints at an issue involving a \"new starter\" and a \"user account,\" suggesting a potential need for access or HR support. I'm leaning toward Access at the moment, but still considering HR Support, given the context.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the correct category. The \"new starter\" and \"user account\" elements point strongly towards Access, but the repeated \"starter form\" mentions introduce the strong possibility that this issue is more broadly related to HR onboarding, which involves requesting and processing HR documentation. \"Hardware sections\" also suggests IT involvement in providing equipment.\n\n\n**Revising the Classification**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's text, focusing particularly on \"starter form\" and \"hardware sections.\" While initial assessments considered \"Access\" a possibility due to the \"user account,\" the repeated references to the \"starter form\" strongly indicate this is primarily an HR-driven process. The \"hardware sections\" mention hints at some IT involvement, but the central request clearly originates from HR onboarding procedures.  After further reflection, I'm now certain \"HR Support\" is the most fitting classification, capturing the ticket's core function: processing information and providing equipment based on HR onboarding requirements.\n\n\n"
