My focus is on the recurring themes of \"moved,\" \"deleted,\" and inquiries about where \"documents\" and \"folders\" are \"stored\" within the \"employee hub.\" Based on these keywords, \"Storage\" appears to be the most accurate classification.\n\n**Finding Document Locations**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's text, focusing on the repeated inquiries about document and folder locations within the \"employee hub.\" The keywords \"moved,\" \"deleted,\" and \"stored\" strongly suggest this request pertains to data management and where files are being kept, leading me to classify it under \"Storage.\"\n\n"
