I've broken down the description to identify key phrases like \"cleaning staff access cards,\" which seem critical. I believe the core issue involves access, possibly permissions, and card reassignments, suggesting a potential security or access management angle. Now I'm trying to determine whether this is a routine request or a more urgent issue.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Needs**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"Access\" category. The ticket's focus on \"cleaning staff access cards,\" \"reassign cards,\" and \"card switch\" leaves little doubt. While HR support might touch on staff changes, the heart of the issue is the access card management itself. It's a direct request regarding physical access permissions, solidifying \"Access\" as the ideal classification. I'm satisfied with this categorization.\n\n\n"
