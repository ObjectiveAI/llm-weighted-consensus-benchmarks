Considering the slow machines, frequent downtimes, and need for increased capacity, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Hardware\" or potentially \"Storage.\"  I'm evaluating if it's solely a hardware issue or if storage capacity plays a crucial role in these performance problems.\n\n\n**Focusing on Hardware Needs**\n\nI've determined the issue falls squarely into the \"Hardware\" category. The ticket's symptoms\u2014slow machines, downtimes, and resource demands\u2014all point to hardware limitations.  Expanding to the storage category isn't necessary, as there are no direct indications. \n\n\n"
