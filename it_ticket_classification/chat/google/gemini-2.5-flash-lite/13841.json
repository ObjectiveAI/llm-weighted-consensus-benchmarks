The repeated mention of \"access cards\" and \"assign order cards\" strongly suggests \"Access\" is the most relevant category. However, I'm carefully reviewing the context to confirm it aligns with the overall scope. I need to make sure there are no other subtle implications of a different category.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Requests**\n\nI've examined the ticket's text more closely. While \"access cards\" and \"assign order cards\" are primary indicators for \"Access,\" I'm now exploring nuances. The phrase about \"control\" and \"days cards\" suggests potential auditing or expiration aspects. This doesn't change my primary categorization, but it adds a layer of depth.  I'm now satisfied it doesn't indicate any other category.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI'm now fully confident in classifying this ticket under \"Access.\" The recurring themes of access cards, ordering, and control solidified my decision. I considered \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase,\" but the focus remains on the *management* of access, not the physical item or transaction itself. The final review confirms that \"Access\" accurately reflects the user's primary concern, making it the most appropriate category.\n\n\n"
