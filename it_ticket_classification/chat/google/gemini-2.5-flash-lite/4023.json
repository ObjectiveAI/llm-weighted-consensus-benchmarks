These terms strongly suggest an HR-related issue, specifically concerning employee departure. Therefore, I believe the appropriate category is \"HR Support\".\n\n\n**Narrowing the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted from initially identifying the \"leaver\" context to analyzing the specific sub-categories. While \"HR Support\" remains central, \"Access\" and \"Storage\" are proving relevant due to the account and data handling aspects. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the primary category, with potential sub-categorization for \"Access\" and perhaps \"Storage\", to fully encompass the ticket's scope.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Category**\n\nI've solidified my thinking and selected \"HR Support\" as the primary category for this IT ticket. Although \"Access\" and \"Storage\" are clearly involved, they are subordinate elements within the broader process of managing an employee's departure. The \"leaver\" context and the associated tasks point definitively toward HR-driven support. Therefore, I believe HR Support is correct.\n\n\n"
