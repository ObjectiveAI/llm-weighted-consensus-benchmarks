                    "reasoning": "**Identifying the Ticket Type**\n\nI'm currently trying to determine the correct category for this IT ticket. After analyzing the text, my initial instinct is leaning towards a category related to a technical issue, potentially involving database functionality. The phrases \"oracle error\" and \"error code\" are very suggestive, and \"project code\" further reinforces that line of thought. I'm focusing on \"Hardware\", \"Storage\", and \"Access\" as the most likely options, with \"Internal Project\" as a long shot.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Culprit**\n\n\\n\\nI'm still circling the IT ticket problem, now focusing on Access versus Internal Project. The \"oracle error\" points to a database-related access problem. However, the resubmission issues and project code point towards an internal project workflow hurdle. I'm leaning toward Access, considering the repeated error messages and rejection.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Workflow Issue**\n\n\\n\\nI'm now focusing on whether the \"project code\" relates to a specific internal project, or if it's a more generic identifier within a broader submission process. The repeated errors suggest a systemic problem, so my analysis leans towards an \"Internal Project\" issue, linked to workflow. I'm considering \"Miscellaneous\" as a backup, in case the problem is more generalized. The \"oracle error\" seems incidental to the core problem of submission and approval failure, which could be categorized under the \"Internal Project\" heading.\n\n\n**Categorizing the System Failure**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories. The repeated issues with submission, approval rejections, and the \"project code\" point towards a systemic problem. While the \"oracle error\" could be a symptom, the core issue is an application workflow failure. I'm choosing \"Internal Project\" as it encompasses the system's breakdown in a project-related context.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Project Workflow**\n\n\\n\\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate classification.  Although an \"oracle error\" is present, the repeated submission failures, the project code, and the automatic rejections point to a systemic issue within an internal project workflow or related application, such as budget allocation or time management. The focus is on the broken workflow, not specifically on the technical root of the \"oracle error\".\n\n\n**Analyzing Project Submission Errors**\n\n\\n\\nI'm now focusing on the core problem: submission failures and automatic rejections tied to a \"project code.\"  The text clearly indicates a broken workflow. While an \"oracle error\" is present, it's a symptom, not the root cause. My analysis centers on whether this is a general system error or something specifically tied to internal project workflows, so I can choose the best category to assign to the ticket.  The ticket seems to imply a system error *within* the context of an internal project's workflow (e.g., submitting time, expenses, or resource requests against a project code), then \"Internal Project\" is appropriate. If the \"project code\" is not  intrinsically tied to the  *management* of internal projects directly, then \"Miscellaneous\" might be considered. Given the phrasing, \"Internal Project\" feels more direct.\n\n\n"
