The ticket discusses active vs. leaver AD accounts and accounts that should have been disabled. I'm carefully considering all possible choices. \"Access\" seems relevant, given the AD account context. I'm also briefly considering other options.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the correct category**\n\nI've determined that \"Access\" is the most fitting category. This decision stems from the ticket's focus on Active Directory account management. Issues related to leavers, disabled accounts, and employee access clearly align with access control and permissions. The ticket is not about hardware, HR, storage, purchasing, internal projects, or administrative rights.\n\n\n"
