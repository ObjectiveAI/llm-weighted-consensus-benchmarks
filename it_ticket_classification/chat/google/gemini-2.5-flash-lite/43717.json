It seems to be about an issue with time entry, possibly related to an internal system. The keywords are a bit jumbled, but I'm thinking about \"hours\", \"unable\" and \"Oracle\". I am considering \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" as possible categories, but I'm unsure which is correct.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choices**\n\nI've re-evaluated the categories based on the ticket content. The initial \"Access\" categorization felt weak, as the issue seems centered on *submitting* hours rather than general system access. Now, I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\". The keywords \"hours,\" \"shifts,\" and the mention of work schedules strongly suggest this is the correct classification. Although it could be an \"Access\" issue, I still believe HR is the primary focus.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Focus**\n\nAfter further analysis, I've confirmed that \"HR Support\" remains the best fit. While \"Access\" could be a contributing factor to the user's struggle to log hours, the ticket's primary focus is on submitting work shifts, which falls directly under HR processes. I've ruled out all other categories as unrelated to the issue described in the ticket.\n\n\n"
