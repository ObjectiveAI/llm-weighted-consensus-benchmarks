I've reviewed the provided text, looking for keywords that might point towards a specific category. Based on the limited information, the task is proving challenging, but I'm diligently cross-referencing against the available categories to make the best possible assignment. I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" at this stage, but I'm keeping my options open.\n\n\n**Analyzing Onboarding Needs**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"HR Support\" as the most likely category. The phrase \"new starter\" strongly suggests an onboarding process, making it a key trigger. Given the options, HR Support encompasses the initial steps required for a new employee, including potential IT setup. Access issues could fall within \"Access\" or \"HR Support\", but I'm opting for the broader support category as the best fit.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI'm now revisiting the \"new starter\" ticket, leaning back towards \"HR Support\". While access could be a part, the entire setup process falls under HR's purview during onboarding. The ticket text's communication style further supports a broader HR context. This includes provisioning their systems and granting initial access, making \"HR Support\" the most inclusive category.\n\n\n"
