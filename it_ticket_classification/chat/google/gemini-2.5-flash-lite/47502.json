                    "reasoning": "**Identifying the Ticket Type**\n\nI'm currently trying to pinpoint the most fitting category for that ticket. The language points towards a technical issue, but it's not immediately clear-cut. \"Error\" is a key term, but where does the issue lie? I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" or \"Access\", but the context is still a bit ambiguous. I need to consider all available information before confirming a category.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Culprit**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the potential categories. The user's trouble adding documents indicates a possible issue with permissions, storage capacity, or both. Initially, \"Storage\" and \"Access\" seemed most relevant. Now, I'm considering \"Administrative rights\" for a more precise fit, given the error's nature. More information is needed to definitively choose among \"Access\", \"Storage\", or even the vague \"Miscellaneous\".\n\n\n**Defining the Problem's Nature**\n\nI'm now focusing on the 'Storage' and 'Access' categories. The error's vague nature prevents a definitive choice. The core act is \"adding documents,\" which could involve various IT processes. While \"Storage\" remains a strong candidate due to the functional nature of the error, I can't rule out \"Access\" if the user lacks write permissions. I need more information on how the documents are being added before categorizing.\n\n\n**Defining the Error's Origin**\n\nI'm now focusing on the ticket's core issue: \"error when adding documents.\" It seems  functionality-related rather than a permission problem, leaning me towards 'Storage' or a more general 'Miscellaneous'. The act of adding documents could encompass any number of IT processes, making this a complex classification.\n\n\n**Focusing on Root Cause**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the root of the \"error when adding documents.\" My options are limited. Considering \"Storage\" addresses the system's ability to handle the addition, I am starting to lean that direction. \"Access\" is still in the mix, particularly if the error relates to write permissions. Though, given the vague nature of the error I am still considering \"Miscellaneous\".\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket's Focus**\n\nAfter more deliberation, the ticket's phrasing, \"error when adding documents,\" keeps pointing me towards 'Storage' as the primary category. While access could be a factor, the emphasis is on a functional failure during the addition process, not solely permission. This leans me towards a storage-related issue.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Error Message**\n\nI'm now focusing on the vagueness of the ticket, specifically the \"error when adding documents\" phrasing. While 'Storage' and 'Access' are still in the running, the lack of specifics makes 'Miscellaneous' increasingly appealing. The issue's functional nature implies a problem during the upload, but without more context, it could be anything.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe phrase \"error when adding documents\" is consistently pointing me towards the 'Storage' category. The functional nature of the problem aligns best with this category, as it relates to the system's ability to store the document, as opposed to permission. It seems to be a failure in the document persistence process.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket's Focus**\n\nAfter reviewing all options, I'm now certain. The vague error phrase \"when adding documents\" points directly to the functionality of the system's storage capacity or its upload processes, making \"Storage\" the best fit. I've ruled out \"Access\" as there's no mention of permissions. The ambiguity reinforces \"Storage\" as the key.\n\n\n**Defining the Issue's Origin**\n\nI've decided to prioritize 'Storage' as the main category for this ticket. The phrasing \"error when adding documents\" highlights a functional problem rather than a permissions concern. While access could be a factor, the focus is on the failed act of document addition.\n\n\n"
