The keywords \"new starter\" and \"annual leave\" initially point towards HR Support, but \"administration\" makes me lean towards Administrative Rights. Further context might be needed, as \"intern\" could also relate to access. I am deliberating between Administrative Rights and HR Support.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on the keywords. \"Upcoming annual leave\" is a major clue, directly pointing to HR Support. While \"new starter\" and \"intern\" could suggest Access, the core request seems HR-related. I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\" now, disregarding the initial leaning towards Administrative Rights.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted again. I've broken down the keywords, and \"upcoming annual leave\" is clearly the strongest signal, definitively landing this ticket in the HR Support domain. The context of \"new starter\" and \"intern\" further supports this conclusion, reinforcing that it's an onboarding or leave-related request. While administrative rights and access are possible, they're secondary to the core HR need. I feel strongly about \"HR Support\" now, disregarding any earlier considerations.\n\n\n"
