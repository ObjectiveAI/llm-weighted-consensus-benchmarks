It seems the content is vague, but the mention of \"Oracle\" hints at a potential \"Access\" issue or possibly even \"Storage\". I'm still weighing the best fit. I'm focusing on keywords.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe text analysis is moving forward, and I've honed in on the key terms. While \"Oracle\" initially pointed toward \"Access\" or \"Storage,\" the phrases concerning employees and their weekly \"view\" strongly indicate an \"HR Support\" issue, or possibly an \"Access\" one related to employee data within an HR system. The \"administration officer\" further solidifies this direction.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Category**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"HR Support\" category, given the employee focus and mention of weekly viewing and exemptions. The Oracle aspect is now seen as the *system* used for HR tasks, rather than the core issue. I'm focusing on \"effective employees\", \"exempt\", and the administrative role as the most indicative factors.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Categorization**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket text extensively. Considering the focus on employee status (\"effective,\" \"exempt,\" \"view\"), the administrative role, and the weekly nature of the request, \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate. The Oracle aspect is the tool, but the core issue revolves around HR-related employee data management.\n\n\n"
