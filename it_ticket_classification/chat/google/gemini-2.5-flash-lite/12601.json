My current focus is on analyzing the ticket's description against the provided JSON schema, specifically identifying the correct value for the `category` field from the allowed enum options.\n\n**Categorizing Offboarding**\n\nI'm working on classifying the IT ticket. My analysis of the description suggests it pertains to employee offboarding processes, specifically involving user accounts and system access. This leads me to believe the 'Access' category is the most appropriate fit.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've completed the analysis of the provided IT ticket description. Based on keywords like \"leaver form,\" \"ad rights,\" and \"mailbox,\" I've determined that the most accurate category, from the provided enum, is \"Access.\"\n\n**Processing Ticket Details**\n\nI'm now focusing on the details of the IT ticket provided. My analysis confirms the presence of keywords strongly indicating offboarding procedures, such as \"leaver form,\" \"ad rights,\" and \"mailbox management.\" This directs my classification towards the \"Access\" category, encompassing user account and permission handling.\n\n"
