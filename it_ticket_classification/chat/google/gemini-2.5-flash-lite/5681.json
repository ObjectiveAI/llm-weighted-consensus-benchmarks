                    "reasoning": "**Considering Categorization Options**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the best fit for this IT ticket. The keywords \"new starter,\" \"hardware allocation,\" and \"join tomorrow\" strongly suggest a focus on onboarding. Given the available categories, \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" seem most relevant. However, the mention of \"contractors\" adds a layer of complexity. Further refining the categorization might be needed.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Primary Purpose**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best single category. While both \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" seem relevant due to the \"hardware allocation\" and \"starter forms,\" the overarching goal appears to be the seamless onboarding of a new individual. \"Join tomorrow\" and \"completion\" point toward the onboarding workflow. Categorizing this as an HR-related task seems most appropriate to address the broader process.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Action**\n\nI'm now considering the fundamental nature of this request. While both \"hardware allocation\" and \"starter forms\" are present, the primary objective appears to be facilitating the new hire's commencement.  The \"join tomorrow\" deadline emphasizes the importance of a swift and efficient onboarding process, pointing towards HR Support as the most fitting category. I'm focusing on the overall process rather than the individual tasks.\n\n\n**Selecting Primary Focus**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the keywords and available categories, concluding that \"Hardware\" best represents the ticket's core intent. While \"starter forms\" and \"join tomorrow\" are present, the fundamental request centers on \"hardware allocation\" for a new employee. This assignment emphasizes the *IT* responsibility to ensure that the hardware is supplied for a new starter. I'm choosing \"Hardware\" as the most directly related category for this ticket.\n\n\n**Choosing Initial Category Priority**\n\nI've decided to prioritize \"Hardware\" as the primary category for this ticket, given the emphasis on \"hardware allocation.\" While \"starter forms\" are mentioned, the core action seems to revolve around provisioning IT assets for a new starter. \"Join tomorrow\" highlights the urgency, indicating IT needs to act promptly. I'm choosing \"Hardware\" assuming it's an IT ticket.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories again.  \"New starter hardware allocation\" points directly to \"Hardware\". While onboarding is a broader process, the specific task here seems to center on IT provisioning. The attached forms are probably necessary to complete the IT task, but they do not make this an HR Support ticket. The IT nature of the request, with the IT team's responsibility with \"hardware allocation\" for a \"new starter\" and the immediate need for the provision, makes \"Hardware\" the superior choice.\n\n\n**Determining the Ticket's Primary Function**\n\nNow, I'm analyzing the core purpose of this IT ticket. Although both HR support and Hardware seem relevant, I'm leaning toward selecting \"Hardware\". The phrase \"new starter hardware allocation\" appears to be the most critical action. This indicates that the core *focus* of this ticket centers on the provisioning of IT assets for a new hire.\n\n\n"
