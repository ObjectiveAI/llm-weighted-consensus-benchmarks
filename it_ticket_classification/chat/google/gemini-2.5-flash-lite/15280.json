The phrases \"virtual mapping\" and \"host side\" suggest a focus on storage or possibly access related to storage configurations. \"Details needed\" is a pretty vague but is more consistent with a technical storage issue. I'm leaning toward \"Storage\" as the primary category.\n\n\n**Categorizing the System Request**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the best ticket category. The phrasing \"virtual mapping configured\" and \"recently added host side\" initially led me to think \"Storage\", but \"Internal Project\" now seems more accurate. The mention of \"design lead\" and the comparison of configurations suggests this is a request about system design within an ongoing project. It's not about hardware, HR, or access control. My top choice is now \"Internal Project\".\n\n\n**Clarifying Project Scope**\n\nI'm now revisiting the \"Internal Project\" categorization. The phrases about \"virtual mapping\" and a \"recently added host\" still imply a configuration or infrastructure focus. Thinking further, I should consider if the \"design lead\" involvement places this primarily in a project or system architecture domain. The comparison aspect also suggests a design choice or decision is at play, solidifying \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate classification.\n\n\n"
