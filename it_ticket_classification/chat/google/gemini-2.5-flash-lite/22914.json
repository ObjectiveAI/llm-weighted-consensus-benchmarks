After analyzing the provided text, the key themes of maternity leave and related administrative processes are clear. The repeated mentions of \"maternity,\" \"leave,\" and \"form\" are very strong indicators. I'm leaning towards categorizing this as related to HR/Payroll processes.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR and IT**\n\nI'm now refining the categorization of this ticket. While hardware appears, it relates to a \"leaver\" scenario and decommissioning, not the core issue. The recurring themes of \"maternity,\" \"leave,\" and \"form\" firmly place it within HR's domain. My focus has shifted, solidifying the need to classify this as HR Support, with IT playing a secondary role in hardware return.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Core Issue**\n\nI've further assessed this IT ticket's true nature. Focusing on the content reveals its heart lies in managing an employee's leave and contract status, clearly an HR function. Although hardware decommissioning exists, it's ancillary, not the primary concern. My final decision firmly prioritizes categorizing this as \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n"
