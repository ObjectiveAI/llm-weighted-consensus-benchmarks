The problem centers on document access through a portal, with error messages reported. My initial thought is to exclude \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\". \"Access\" seems relevant, though \"Storage\" might be involved if the portal itself has storage problems. \"Miscellaneous\" feels too broad, \"Purchase\" and \"Internal Project\" are likely irrelevant, and administrative rights seem unlikely in this case.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nMy focus is now firmly on \"Access\" as the primary category. The document sharing issue and error messages directly point to access-related problems. Additionally, the phrase \"owner configured their improperly\" strengthens this categorization by highlighting potential access control misconfigurations.\n\n\n"
