Initial assessment indicates a potential mismatch between the system's displayed annual leave allowance and the user's expected correct number. I'm leaning toward an issue that falls under either HR Support or Access, given the nature of the inquiry. Need to clarify the access element of annual leave.\n\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nMy immediate focus is determining the appropriate category for this IT ticket. The user's query about incorrect annual leave displays points decisively toward \"HR Support.\" I've carefully ruled out other options such as \"Access,\" \"Hardware,\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" finding them less relevant. \"HR Support\" perfectly captures the essence of this employee leave-related issue.\n\n\n"
