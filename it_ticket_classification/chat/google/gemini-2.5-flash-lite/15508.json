The repeated mention of \"monitor\" and the specifics about adjustability strongly suggest a need for \"Hardware.\" I'm carefully considering how to definitively exclude other categories, such as \"HR Support\" or \"Access\", based on the available information. The choice seems clear, but I want to be certain.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Hardware as the Best Fit**\n\nI'm confident in \"Hardware\" now. The \"monitor\" references and focus on adjustability sealed it. While \"Purchase\" was considered, the central issue is the *item* itself, not acquiring it. \"Miscellaneous\" felt like a generic fallback. I can definitely rule out the others: \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Storage\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights\" are clearly irrelevant.\n\n\n"
