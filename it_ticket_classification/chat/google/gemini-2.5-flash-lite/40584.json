I'm reviewing the available categories to find the most appropriate one.\n\n**Finding Best Category Fit**\n\nI'm currently focusing on selecting the most accurate category for the IT ticket. The issue involves a functional problem with a \"referral tool,\" specifically upload failures. I'm weighing options like \"Miscellaneous\" against other possibilities based on the tool's nature and the reported error.\n\n**Classifying Software Issues**\n\nI'm currently determining the best category for an IT ticket. The ticket highlights an upload failure within a \"referral tool,\" which points to a functional issue with a specific application. I am carefully considering the available options, leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" due to the lack of a more precise software-specific category.\n\n**Classifying Referral Tool Issue**\n\nI'm still refining the categorization for this IT ticket. The core issue involves an upload failure within a specific \"referral tool,\" which strongly suggests a functional software problem. I'm weighing \"HR Support\" against \"Miscellaneous,\" considering whether the tool's domain leans more towards HR processes or if it's a general application bug.\n\n**Selecting Appropriate Category**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the provided categories to best fit an IT ticket concerning upload failures within a \"referral tool.\" My focus is on determining if the functional error points more towards \"HR Support,\" given the tool's likely domain, or if \"Miscellaneous\" is the more accurate general classification for this type of software issue.\n\n**Selecting Best Category Fit**\n\nI'm currently assessing the best category for an IT ticket detailing an upload failure in a \"referral tool.\" My analysis leads me to believe \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate classification, considering the tool's likely function within HR processes.\n\n**Choosing HR Support Category**\n\nI'm currently finalizing the categorization for an IT ticket. The issue concerns a \"referral tool\" experiencing upload failures. Considering the tool's likely function, I've decided \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate classification.\n\n"
