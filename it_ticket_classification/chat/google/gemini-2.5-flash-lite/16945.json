Initial assessment suggests \"Purchase\" might be relevant, given the \"submit cards\" mention. However, \"Miscellaneous\" remains a possibility due to the vague nature of \"rejected inquiry.\" Further analysis of the context is required to definitively place it within the approved categories: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\".\n\n\n**Analyzing Card Submission Issues**\n\nI've further analyzed the ticket details. The common thread is the repeated \"rejection\" linked to \"submitted cards.\" While \"Purchase\" was considered, the rejection aspect steers me towards a more general category. The phrases don't neatly fit any other predefined category; therefore, \"Miscellaneous\" is looking increasingly suitable.\n\n\n"
