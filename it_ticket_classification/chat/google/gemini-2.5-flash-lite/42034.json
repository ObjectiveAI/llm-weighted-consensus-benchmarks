My focus is on identifying keywords that align with the available options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights.\n\n**Resolving Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've processed the ticket's description, and it appears to be primarily a submission problem. While access or administrative rights might be underlying factors, the immediate issue described points towards a functional failure within a system rather than a permission-based one. I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the most fitting category given the current information.\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI'm currently refining my categorization for the IT ticket. Based on the user's description of a \"submission issue\" with a \"sheet,\" and the absence of specific categories like \"software\" or \"application support,\" I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the most fitting classification. The problem seems to stem from a functional failure in the submission process itself.\n\n"
