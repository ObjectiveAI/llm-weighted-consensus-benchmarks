The core issue seems to be a hardware replacement, based on the description. I need to select the most fitting category from the list provided. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware,\" but I'm giving a close look at all options to be certain.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's description (\"workstation does not start workstation was replaced with another one\") and the available categories. While \"Purchase\" is tangentially relevant to the workstation replacement, the primary issue and action taken is focused on hardware, making \"Hardware\" the most precise and fitting choice. The \"Hardware\" category directly addresses the problem's core.\n\n\n"
