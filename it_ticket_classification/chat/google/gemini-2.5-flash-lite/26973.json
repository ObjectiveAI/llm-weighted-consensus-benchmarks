The user reports a mailbox consistently nearing capacity, prompting daily email deletions and a request for increased storage. While \"Storage\" is an obvious contender, I'm also considering \"Access\" because the problem directly affects the user's access to their email. I'm leaning towards \"Storage\" as the primary issue, but the \"Access\" aspect is influencing my thinking.\n\n\n**Revising the Classification**\n\nI've refined the initial category selection.  After careful consideration, \"Storage\" emerges as the most accurate descriptor. While \"Access\" had an initial appeal due to email access being impacted, the core problem is undeniably storage capacity. The ticket's emphasis on mailbox limitations solidifies \"Storage\" as the definitive choice, aligning with the primary issue.\n\n\n"
