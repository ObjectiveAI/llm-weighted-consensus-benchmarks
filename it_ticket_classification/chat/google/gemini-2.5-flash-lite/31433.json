I've begun analyzing the provided text which mentions a new project and specific technologies. My initial focus is on keywords to match against the available categories. Based on the words, I'm thinking I might be able to narrow it down, but I'll need to consider the context more.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI've refined my thinking by examining the specific phrases within the ticket text. \"New project code\" and \"create code\" strongly point towards an \"Internal Project\". Considering categories, the phrases match this choice closely, and the other categories seem far less relevant to this particular request.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Assignment**\n\nI've determined that \"Internal Project\" is the most accurate category. After reviewing the phrases, specifically \"new project code\" and \"create code,\" I concluded it's the best fit. I've also considered \"Administrative rights\" as a possible secondary, but given the strong focus on project setup, \"Internal Project\" is the primary choice.\n\n\n"
