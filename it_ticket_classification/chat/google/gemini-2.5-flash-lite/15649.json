                    "reasoning": "**Identifying the Ticket Type**\n\nI'm currently trying to determine the correct category for this IT ticket. I've begun analyzing the provided text, focusing on the core request: a \"port for project Tuesday PM.\" My initial thought is to identify the request's primary intent, but I need to ensure it aligns with one of the predefined categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. The keywords I see are \"port\" and \"project\", which seem to indicate access or internal project related. I will evaluate more keywords and ensure my reasoning is accurate before classifying it.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket's Scope**\n\nMy focus has shifted to pinpointing the exact nature of the \"port\" request within this IT ticket. After parsing the provided text, I've identified several key elements, including port openings, instance requests, and automated shutdown schedules. These diverse elements suggest a complex interaction, but the central theme appears to revolve around system access and operational management. This complex overlap has me leaning towards \"Access\" or \"Internal Project,\" depending on the broader context of the \"project\".\n\n\n**Prioritizing Project Needs**\n\nI've been analyzing the text closely, and the emphasis on \"port for project\" continues to be a central clue. The repeated mentions of opening ports, requesting an instance, and scheduling automatic shutdowns all point toward setting up infrastructure for an internal initiative. Considering the context, I'm now leaning heavily towards \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category. The other options seem less precise, and I am working to define how this fits into the overall scope.\n\n\n**Categorizing Project-Specific Requests**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Internal Project\" as the primary category, given the clear focus on setting up infrastructure for a specific initiative. The requests for port openings, instance provisioning, and automated shutdowns strongly suggest the need for project-specific resources. While \"Access\" is still relevant because of the port requests, \"Internal Project\" encapsulates the broader context of creating and managing a system specifically for a project's needs, and this seems to be the primary driver.\n\n\n"
