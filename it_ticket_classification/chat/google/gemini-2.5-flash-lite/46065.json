I'm leaning toward the \"HR Support\" category, but I want to ensure my decision is robust before finalizing the categorization. I need to confidently ascertain the context.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm getting closer to the best category. Analyzing the full ticket content, especially phrases like \"working hours,\" \"days off,\" and the potential payroll connection, solidifies my initial \"HR Support\" hunch. I've ruled out other categories like \"Hardware\" and \"Access.\" The \"working hours\" issue screams HR-related processes.\n\n\n"
