The text mentions \"pm approved\" multiple times and \"paid overtime,\" which are key clues. I'm carefully analyzing these keywords in the context of the allowed categories to narrow down the possible matches.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Approval**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best fit. While \"Purchase\" is tempting given the payment aspect, \"HR Support\" seems like a better match. The approval of \"paid overtime work\" aligns with HR processes. The request to \"explain myself\" also suggests a need for justification, often routed through HR.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"HR Support\" category. The mention of \"paid overtime work\" and \"sheets sat waiting\" solidified it for me. It points directly to a process related to employee compensation. While \"Purchase\" was a contender, the focus on work hours and payment aligns better with HR functions.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Category**\n\nI've made the final determination! The focus on \"paid overtime work\" and its subsequent approval process strongly points towards \"HR Support.\" The phrase \"sheets sat waiting\" further reinforced my choice, suggesting a timesheet or payroll-related request. The \"commercial\" context hints at the implications of \"work carried out.\" While there was a fleeting consideration for \"Purchase\", the core of this ticket revolves around employee compensation, a function primarily managed by HR.\n\n\n"
