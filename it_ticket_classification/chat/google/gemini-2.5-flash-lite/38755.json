After reviewing the available options, I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the most fitting category, as the problem doesn't clearly align with hardware, access, or other more specific designations.\n\n**Refining IT Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm continuing to refine the categorization of this IT ticket. Given the context of a software developer encountering issues with screen sharing during a client video call, and the absence of a specific \"Software\" or \"Network\" category, I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the most appropriate designation. This seems to be the best fit among the available options.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm finalizing the classification of this IT ticket.
