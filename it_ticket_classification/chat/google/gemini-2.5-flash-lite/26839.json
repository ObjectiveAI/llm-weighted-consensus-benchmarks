My current assessment points towards HR Support and potentially Hardware provisioning.\n\n**Focusing on Onboarding**\n\nI'm actively processing the recent updates, noting the repeated emphasis on \"new starter\" and \"starter form complete.\" This strongly suggests the ticket's core purpose is related to the initial onboarding of an employee, encompassing hardware and potential purchase requests as part of that process.\n\n"
