Despite the IT context, the content points strongly towards \"HR Support.\" I'll need to carefully consider any other factors that might suggest a different categorization before finalizing.\n\n\n**Determining the Category**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"HR Support\" category for this ticket, and the rationale is straightforward. The text is saturated with phrases like \"annual leave,\" \"absences,\" \"HR procedures,\" and \"leave requests.\" These points decisively point to a need for human resources rather than any of the other options I was given. No other aspect or context presents an equally strong case for one of the other choices.\n\n\n"
