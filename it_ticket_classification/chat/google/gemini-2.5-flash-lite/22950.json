Initial assessments leaned towards \"HR Support\" due to the mention of a \"starter form.\" However, the ticket's brevity has led me to re-examine the context, as the language used could also hint at an \"Access\" or potentially \"Miscellaneous\" issue. I'm focusing on keywords to refine the classification.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Relevance**\n\nI've determined that the ticket's core issue focuses on the onboarding process, specifically a \"starter form.\" Although an access request could be involved, the primary need seems to be guidance on the form itself. This strongly points towards \"HR Support,\" aligning with HR's common role in employee onboarding and associated IT needs.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nMy focus has shifted to directly assigning the correct category, given the keywords. After analyzing the context, I've concluded that \"HR Support\" best reflects the ticket's core issue, the \"starter form.\" The language signals an HR-driven onboarding process, making it the most logical fit, even if some IT access might eventually be needed. I'm now certain of the category and ready to generate the final JSON.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Decision**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" remains the most accurate category, based on the keywords and the onboarding context. While IT involvement is likely, the ticket's core relates to the \"starter form\" and is fundamentally an HR process request. I'm now fully confident in this classification and preparing the JSON output.\n\n\n"
