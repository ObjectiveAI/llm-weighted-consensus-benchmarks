Initially, the presence of \"development\" hints strongly at \"Internal Project,\" but I'm cross-referencing this with \"access\" and \"granted\" to ensure a precise fit. I'm building a more robust keyword library, considering semantic variations, to capture nuances that might indicate \"Access\" as well. This aims for accuracy and to avoid overlooking related ticket types.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Scope**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Access\" as the primary category. The keywords \"access,\" \"development,\" and \"granted\" strongly point in this direction. However, I'm carefully evaluating the context of \"development project\" to ensure it's not misclassified as \"Internal Project.\" My focus remains on distinguishing the underlying access request.\n\n\n"
