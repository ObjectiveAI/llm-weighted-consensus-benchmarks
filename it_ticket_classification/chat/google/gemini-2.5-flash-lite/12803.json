Initially, I leaned toward \"Miscellaneous,\" given the diverse topics. Now, I'm considering \"Internal Project\" due to the survey and dashboard mentions, suggesting a broader initiative. The \"import errors\" are a wrinkle, but potentially a symptom, not the root cause. This requires further analysis, so I'll stay mindful.\n\n\n**Defining Core Problem Scope**\n\nNow, I'm digging deeper into the ticket's core issue. I've ruled out several categories like \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support.\" The import errors, although present, might be a symptom rather than the primary problem. Considering the \"dashboard\" and \"survey campaign,\" I'm leaning heavily towards \"Internal Project,\" as it directly affects internal processes.\n\n\n**Confirming Internal Project Category**\n\nI've narrowed the scope and am confident in \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate classification. The key is to see if the issue revolves around general internal tools (\"Miscellaneous\"), or is tied to a specific project (\"Internal Project\"). While there are error issues, the focus is about the functioning and monitoring of the app, and the survey campaign itself, making it an *Internal Project*. I'm ruling out broader categories and concentrating on aligning the issue with the most accurate classification.\n\n\n"
