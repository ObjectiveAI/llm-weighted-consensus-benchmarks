The repeated mentions of \"sticker\" and its discovery location suggest it falls under \"Miscellaneous\" as it doesn't align with typical IT categories like hardware or access.\n\n**Assigning IT Ticket**\n\nI'm continuing to categorize the IT ticket. Given the mentions of \"sticker found\" near a door, it strongly suggests a lost item scenario that doesn't fit standard IT classifications, making \"Miscellaneous\" the most logical designation.\n\n"
