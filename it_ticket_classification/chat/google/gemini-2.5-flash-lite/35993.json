The keywords are numerous, but I think \"not working\", \"reconnecting\", and \"print screen\" are the most critical. I'm leaning toward a hardware or potential access issue. I will need to consider whether it's an external issue or internal device.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted towards the \"keep reconnecting\" aspect of the ticket. This strongly suggests a hardware or network connectivity problem. The phrases \"not working\" and \"print screen\" are secondary now, but they still add context. I've narrowed it down to potential hardware or access-related causes, the description gives a good starting point.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choices**\n\nI've re-evaluated the categories, given the keywords and my recent thoughts. \"Keep reconnecting\" and \"not working\" strongly suggest a hardware problem or potentially network connectivity. While \"access\" might be relevant, it's secondary to the core problem. The description leans towards either a hardware malfunction, or a driver issue. I've ruled out storage, HR, and other categories. My top choice remains hardware, with a small possibility of \"Access\".\n\n\n**Analyzing the Ticket Further**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Hardware\" categorization. The phrase \"keep reconnecting\" is the strongest indicator of a hardware issue, especially when considering the description \"computer used before worked\". My analysis has solidified my conviction that the core problem stems from a hardware malfunction or a hardware-related driver issue. \"Access\" is a possibility but feels less likely given the context.\n\n\n"
