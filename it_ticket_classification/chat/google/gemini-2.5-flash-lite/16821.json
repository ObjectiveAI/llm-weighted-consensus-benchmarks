My focus is on accurately mapping keywords like \"storage accessible\" and \"connect wired wireless error\" to the most fitting enum value. I'm leaning towards \"Storage\" due to the repeated emphasis, but \"Access\" is also being considered for network connection issues.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the IT ticket, and my primary objective is to assign the most fitting category from the provided schema. The repeated mentions of \"storage accessible\" strongly suggest \"Storage\" as the most relevant classification, though network connectivity issues are also present.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the IT ticket provided. My focus is on identifying the most appropriate category from the given schema. The repeated mention of \"storage accessible\" and related actions like accessing storage paths makes \"Storage\" the most fitting classification.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the IT ticket provided.
