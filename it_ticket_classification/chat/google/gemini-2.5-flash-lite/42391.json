Considering the \"disk failure\" and \"raid operating with degraded\" mentions, my initial assessment leans strongly towards \"Hardware\". It appears to be a clear hardware issue. I'm focusing on the nature of the technical problem.\n\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. The provided ticket details, especially the mentions of \"disk failure,\" \"raid degradation,\" and \"spare disks,\" point decisively towards a \"Storage\" issue. It's no longer just a hardware problem; it's a specific storage system malfunction requiring targeted action. This aligns perfectly with the problem keywords.\n\n\n"
