I am currently building the rules for categorization.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Text**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"Purchase\" category as the most probable fit. The recurring theme centers around approvals, requisitions, and justifications, solidifying the connection. The phrasing suggests a financial aspect and a request process. I'm carefully analyzing the nuances in the text, to confirm this is the right choice, rather than a system change or HR support.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI have carefully assessed the ticket text and determined the user is seeking purchase approval. Phrases like \"approve requisition\" and \"accommodation justification\" point strongly towards a financial acquisition process. After a comprehensive review against all categories, this is the most accurate fit.\n\n\n"
