The text is a bit unclear, but keywords like \"new starter\" and \"myself\" seem to lean towards either HR Support or Access issues. I'm carefully weighing the phrases to decide which category is the best fit. I'm considering all options, including \"Miscellaneous\", but I am trying to categorize with the most precision.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR connection**\n\nI've honed in on the HR Support category. While phrases like \"change leader\" and \"change date\" raised possibilities, \"new starter\" remains the most compelling clue. I'm leaning heavily towards HR Support due to this strong indicator, and I'm further analyzing the context for confirmation. The \"myself\" part, I'm finding is not offering strong evidence either way.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating ticket context**\n\nMy analysis has solidified my choice of \"HR Support.\" The \"new starter\" phrase remains the most salient indicator. While the others seemed to point towards a project, the HR connotation feels more accurate. I'm focusing on the employee-centric nature of the request, and the additional phrases seem to fit.\n\n\n"
