It seems the problem centers around malfunctioning access cards for a specific building, impacting two individuals. Considering the available categories, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the most suitable, given the described symptoms and nature of the issue. The \"Hardware\" category could be applicable, but it seems that the access card being non-functional is only the symptom of a larger issue.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've solidified my initial categorization decision. After further contemplation, I'm confident \"Access\" is the most accurate category. While \"Hardware\" was briefly considered, the issue seems rooted in access permissions or the system, not the card itself. \"Access\" is the most direct and relevant choice, reflecting the core problem of restricted physical entry. I'm now structuring the output in JSON format, ready for submission.\n\n\n"
