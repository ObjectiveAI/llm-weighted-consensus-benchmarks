I've re-read the ticket, which seems related to file transfer issues. I am evaluating if this falls under Access, Storage, or a more general Miscellaneous category. The file size limitation is intriguing. The shared documents aspect also adds complexity.\n\n\n**Assessing File Transfer Concerns**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and I am leaning towards \"Storage\" as the correct category. The user's main concern is sending files and the size limitation likely points to a storage-related issue. The comment about sharing large documents seems to imply a potential storage solution is needed. I'm still weighing the \"Access\" option but the file transfer problem feels like it relates to storage limitations.\n\n\n**Revisiting Ticket Categories**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the \"Access\" vs. \"Storage\" categories. While access could be a factor, the fundamental issue appears to be file transfer constraints, which leans toward Storage. The user is experiencing a generic issue with small file sending and the desire to share larger files highlights storage or transfer limitations. My assessment still favors Storage.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Focus**\n\nI'm now honing in on the \"Storage\" categorization. The user's trouble with file sending, coupled with the size limitation and the desire to share large documents, solidifies \"Storage\" as the primary area. While \"Access\" could be a factor, the core issue appears centered on the mechanism of sending and storing files. I'm focusing on why a file-sending issue might point to network bandwidth.\n\n\n**Pinpointing File Transfer Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and I have concluded that the IT ticket should be categorized as **Storage**. The user's problem involves sending files with size limitations. Even the ability to share the large docs implies a possible storage related bottleneck. The mention of less than MB implies a need to troubleshoot which again relates to file transfer and the storage of files.\n\n\n"
