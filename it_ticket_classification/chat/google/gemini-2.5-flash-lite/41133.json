The timecard errors point strongly toward \"HR Support,\" but I'm checking to be absolutely certain this isn't an overlap with other areas. I'm focusing on the core issue raised in the ticket description.\n\n\n**Solidifying HR Classification**\n\nI've determined that HR Support is the best fit. While there's a slight possibility access is involved, the primary problem is timecard errors and retroactive adjustments, which falls squarely within HR's domain. The user's description focuses on timekeeping and absence issues, strongly supporting this categorization.\n\n\n**Clarifying HR Focus**\n\nI'm solidifying my assessment. The ticket's emphasis on time card errors and retroactive absence adjustments firmly places this within the HR Support category. While potential access issues exist, the core problem revolves around timekeeping discrepancies. The phrasing in the ticket itself, referencing time and absences, strengthens my conclusion.\n\n\n"
