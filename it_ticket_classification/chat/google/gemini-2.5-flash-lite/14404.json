The phrases \"time card status\" and \"annual leave\" strongly suggest an HR-related issue.  I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most relevant category. It seems straightforward, but I want to be certain, so I'll review other options to make sure. I'm focusing on the context clues.\n\n\n**Revising Category: HR Support**\n\nI've solidified my categorization decision. The keywords related to timekeeping and leave are undeniably HR-centric. My analysis of \"time card status,\" \"annual leave,\" and approval processes firmly points to \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category. I'm now confident in this assignment.\n\n\n"
