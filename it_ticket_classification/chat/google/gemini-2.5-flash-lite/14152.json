I've noted keywords like \"access card,\" \"assigned employees,\" and \"activate card.\" It seems related to granting or managing access, leading me to lean towards \"Access.\" However, I'm carefully reviewing the context to ensure nothing points to another category like \"Hardware\" or \"HR Support.\"\n\n\n**Categorizing the Access Issue**\n\nI've refined the initial category selection. After considering keywords like \"deactivate,\" \"facility,\" and \"doors,\" it's solidified that managing access cards for employees is the core issue. My analysis points decisively to \"Access\" as the most suitable category.\n\n\n"
