My goal is to determine the most relevant IT ticket category. So far, the terms suggest potential access issues, but I'm not ready to classify it definitively. I'm considering all possibilities before making a final decision.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"Access\" category, with the ticket's keywords strongly supporting this. The phrase \"password reset request\" is a clear indicator. Confluence-related terms further point to access or application management. Although some aspects might touch upon administrative rights, the core issue appears to be access-related. I believe \"Access\" is the most appropriate initial classification.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and the available categories. The phrase \"password reset request\" is a central indicator, strongly pointing towards an access-related issue. Moreover, mentions of Confluence suggest application access, further solidifying this classification. Although the \"change pc\" part is unclear, the access indicators are significantly stronger. Therefore, I've determined that \"Access\" is the most appropriate and definitive category for this IT ticket.\n\n\n"
