Currently, I'm leaning toward \"Storage\" or \"Purchase\" as potential categories, given the mentions of \"snapshot\" and \"backup.\" However, I need to consider other categories such as 'Administrative rights' as an option. This is a complex challenge, but I will make the best judgement based on the current context.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm zeroing in on \"Storage\" as the definitive category. My analysis of the phrases \"create a snapshot,\" \"backup,\" and \"restoring snapshot\" strongly supports this conclusion. The text does not relate to the other categories. \"Internal Project\" is a possible alternative, but \"Storage\" is the most direct and specific match.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Match**\n\nI'm solidifying my classification of this ticket. Reviewing the ticket text once more, \"Storage\" remains the clear winner. The recurring terms like \"snapshot,\" \"backup,\" and \"restoring snapshot\" leave no room for ambiguity. \"Internal Project\" is a possibility, but \"Storage\" captures the core function and requested action perfectly. \n\n\n"
