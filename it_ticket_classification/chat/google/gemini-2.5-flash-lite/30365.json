The request seems related to user access, specifically \"removing engagers.\" This hints at an **Access** issue. While the ticket is poorly written, the core need is to restrict access. I'm focusing on keywords and context.\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Request**\n\nI've honed in on the ticket's core issue: user access. While \"Administrative rights\" is relevant, \"Access\" is a more encompassing term for removing user privileges. \"Removing engagers\" strongly suggests access revocation, making \"Access\" the most accurate categorization. I'm satisfied with this conclusion.\n\n\n**Determining the Priority**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's lack of detail, focusing on the core request to \"remove people.\" Given the limited information, urgency isn't clear, though the poorly-written nature suggests immediate action may not be critical. I'm focusing on classifying the type of access removal. While the phrase \"removing engagers\" is vague, \"Access\" still appears to be the most appropriate primary label. This has been confirmed.\n\n\n"
