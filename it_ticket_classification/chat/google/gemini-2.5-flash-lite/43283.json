The user can't see candidates in a tool, and isn't sure if it's a tool problem or user error. I'm focusing on \"Access\" as the initial point, but I'm also considering potential overlaps with \"Miscellaneous\" or even \"HR Support,\" depending on the specifics of the candidate-viewing tool.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've revised the initial thinking on this IT ticket. After a closer look at the user's description, I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support.\" The core issue revolves around a candidate-viewing problem within a selection process, indicating a clear HR-related function. While access might be implicated, the primary need is guidance on an HR tool and reporting. \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" are irrelevant here. \"Miscellaneous\" is too vague to be useful. Therefore, \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Ticket's Focus**\n\nI'm now focusing on the core issue: the user's inability to view candidates within the selection process. While 'access' and technical issues are possibilities, the primary function and need described are HR-related. The user is seeking guidance and assistance regarding a tool used for candidate management and generating reports, which reinforces the 'HR Support' category. I've ruled out 'Hardware,' 'Storage,' and 'Purchase' as irrelevant. Although \"blocked\" could relate to rights, the ticket's core issue remains supporting an HR function. Therefore, 'HR Support' best encapsulates the user's need for assistance with an HR tool and reporting.\n\n\n"
