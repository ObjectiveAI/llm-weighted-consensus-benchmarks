The mention of \"public holiday calendar\" errors and calculation issues suggests a system or software functionality problem, rather than a hardware defect.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm continuing to refine the categorization of this IT ticket. The specific error with the public holiday calendar, particularly the calculation of days during these events, leans towards a system functionality issue. While HR-related, the core problem appears to be a technical one rather than a direct HR policy query.\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Further**\n\nI'm drilling down into the ticket's specifics, leaning towards \"HR Support.\" The public holiday calendar errors and calculation discrepancies strongly suggest a system functionality issue tied to HR administration, rather than a broader software or hardware problem.\n\n"
