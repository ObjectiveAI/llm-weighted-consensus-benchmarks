The consistent theme across nearly all examples revolves around removing access rights. While some tickets touch on HR-related events, the primary directive is always about access management. This strengthens my determination to classify these tickets under the \"Access\" category. I am now confident that this is the best fit for all the tickets I've looked at.\n\n\n**Reaching a Conclusion**\n\nI've carefully examined the ticket text, meticulously dissecting each example and analyzing it against all potential categories. The recurring phrase is \"remove rights\" or \"remove access,\" appearing in almost every example. While some tickets touch on HR-related events, the underlying request is consistently about access management. I've ruled out other categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others, because \"Access\" provides the most accurate and specific fit. I've determined with confidence that the consistent theme is access-related.\n\n\n"
