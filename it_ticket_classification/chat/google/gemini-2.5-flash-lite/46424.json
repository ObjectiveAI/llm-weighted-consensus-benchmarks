I am leaning towards the \"HR Support\" category as the most accurate.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Focus**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the ticket's categorization. My initial instinct, HR Support, remains the most compelling fit, given the consistent HR-centric keywords like \"maternity leave\" and \"forms.\" While other categories were considered, HR Support precisely addresses the core issue.\n\n\n"
