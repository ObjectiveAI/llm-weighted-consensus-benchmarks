After analyzing the text (\"annual leave request accepted re annual leave accepted hi guys appro\"), I'm leaning towards \"HR Support.\" It seems like the user is inquiring about an annual leave request which falls under HR.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text, focusing on key phrases. \"Annual leave\" appears repeatedly, solidifying my conclusion. Although the user has included extra irrelevant information, the central theme points directly to \"HR Support.\" There is no hint of hardware, access, storage, or any other unrelated issue here.\n\n\n"
