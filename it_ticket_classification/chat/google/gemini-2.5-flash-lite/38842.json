It's tricky, feels like a simple access or user-related issue. Perhaps access to a system called 'snow' is modified. I'm focusing on keywords like \"groups\" and \"changed\". It could align with \"Access\" or potentially \"Administrative rights\" if user group modifications are involved. Let me check the exact wording or related tickets to be sure.\n\n\n**Narrowing Focus: Access**\n\nI've refined the ticket categorization. The phrase \"restricted access\" is a key identifier. Considering the operational impact and inability to check incidents, I'm leaning strongly toward \"Access.\" While \"Administrative rights\" remains a possibility, the core issue is restricted system access hindering work. I'm confident in \"Access\" based on the analysis.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket: Access**\n\nI'm solidifying the ticket's classification as \"Access.\" The key is the impacted operational duties and the strongly worded \"restricted access.\" While user group changes hint at administrative possibilities, the core problem is a lack of access, not specifically administrative permissions. I'm prioritizing \"Access\" due to its direct link to the operational impact and the inability to view incidents. The focus shifts to restoring access.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket: Access**\n\nI've finalized my categorization and determined \"Access\" to be the most appropriate. The core issue centers around restricted access impacting operational duties, aligning with \"restricted access snow affecting usual operational.\" Though administrative rights could play a role, the primary impact is the lack of access, directly impacting the ability to check incidents.\n\n\n"
