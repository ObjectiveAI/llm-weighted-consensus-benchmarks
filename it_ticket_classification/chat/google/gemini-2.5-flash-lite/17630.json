Keywords like \"bulk leaver form\" and \"interns\" are leading me towards potential fits within \"HR Support\" or \"Access\". I'm also considering implications of the \"school\" reference in tandem with \"access cards\". These details are shaping my analysis.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating Category Options**\n\nMy analysis has solidified on \"HR Support\" as the primary category for this ticket. While \"Access\" has some relevance due to the \"access cards\", the central issue revolves around the \"bulk leaver form\" and its implications for interns, which is fundamentally an HR-driven process. The keywords pointing towards HR are stronger.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Alignment**\n\nI've re-evaluated the category options, focusing on the core request: processing a \"bulk leaver form\" for \"interns\". While \"access cards\" are mentioned, they're likely a consequence of the HR process, not the primary driver. The connection to \"school\" further strengthens the case for \"HR Support\" as the leading category. My analysis now solidly favors \"HR Support\".\n\n\n"
