The words \"new starter\", \"re joiners\", and \"leavers\" point me towards HR-related support. However, \"technical mistake\" suggests a possible hardware or access issue. I'm carefully weighing these possibilities.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Context**\n\nI've been examining the text and the potential categories. While \"accounts\" and \"technical mistake\" initially suggested \"Access,\" the core theme centers around \"joiners\" and \"leavers.\" I am leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\" as the primary category, given the onboarding and offboarding context. I am still mulling over \"Access\" as a secondary classification, depending on the nature of the \"technical mistake.\"\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've carefully re-examined the ticket text, considering each available category. While \"Access\" could be a secondary concern due to \"accounts\" and \"technical mistake,\" I am firm in the belief that \"HR Support\" is the primary category. The consistent mention of \"new starter,\" \"re joiners,\" and \"leavers\" clearly places the issue within the onboarding/offboarding context. The \"technical mistake\" seems a symptom of the HR process, not the core problem. The \"accounts\" aspect likely relates to user account setup or removal during the joiner/leaver stages.\n\n\n"
