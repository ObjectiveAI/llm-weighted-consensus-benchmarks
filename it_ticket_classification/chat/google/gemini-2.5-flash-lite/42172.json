After careful consideration of the text, it appears the main issue revolves around access to the survey link. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" as the most suitable category, but I'm cross-referencing this against the other options to ensure accuracy.\n\n\n**Defining the Issue's Scope**\n\nI'm now fully confident that \"Access\" is the correct category for this ticket. The problem centers around users' inability to reach the feedback survey link. While other categories were considered, the explicit mention of \"access issues\" and the context of a survey strongly support this. My analysis confirms \"Access\" as the most precise fit, eliminating any remaining doubt.\n\n\n"
