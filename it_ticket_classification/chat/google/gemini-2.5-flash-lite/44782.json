The available options include various IT-related areas. So far, the phrase \"share\" stands out. I am leaning toward a Storage or Access-related ticket. I am continuing to break down and process the ticket description.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Control**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text. The words \"share\" and \"access\" are consistently popping up. While SharePoint is related to storage, the core concern clearly revolves around permission control \u2013 who can modify the shared file, and why access is now closed. Considering the given options, Access seems to best capture the crux of the issue.\n\n\n**Defining Access Issues**\n\nI've carefully reviewed the ticket text again. My analysis continues to pinpoint \"Access\" as the most suitable category. The ticket describes uncontrolled file modifications, and the restriction of access as key issues, making \"Access\" the central concern. I've ruled out alternatives by considering each option's relevance to the described problem.\n\n\n"
