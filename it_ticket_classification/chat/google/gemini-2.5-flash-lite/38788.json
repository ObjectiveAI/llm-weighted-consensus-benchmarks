Given the keywords like \"annual leave,\" \"timecards,\" and the inability to select tasks for submission, I've determined that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category for this IT ticket.\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI've confirmed the ticket's core issue revolves around the annual leave submission process within timecards. This aligns perfectly with HR functions, solidifying \"HR Support\" as the most accurate categorization.\n\n"
