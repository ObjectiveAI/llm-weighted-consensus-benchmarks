Then, I'll attempt to map that core issue to one of the defined categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. The next step is a deep dive into the provided text.\n\n\n**Analyzing Document-Related Concerns**\n\nI've determined the core problem is related to issues with documents. Phrases like \"issues with documents,\" \"problems with documents,\" and \"we experience issues with documents\" point directly to this. While \"Miscellaneous\" is a broad category, the specific nature of the issue\u2014potentially concerning storage or accessibility of files\u2014makes \"Storage\" the most suitable. So, the ticket is classified as \"Storage.\"\n\n\n"
