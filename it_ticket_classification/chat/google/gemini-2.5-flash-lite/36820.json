My initial assessment suggests a software-specific problem. The ticket details point towards filter malfunction and approval/rejection difficulties, solidifying this categorization.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Problem**\n\nI'm now focusing on the inability to find and manage submitted time cards within the Oracle system. While \"Access\" is still a contender, the specifics suggest a potential glitch impacting time card visibility and approval workflows. The filter malfunction is a key symptom, hinting at a software issue. Both \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights\" are still relevant, but I need more data to pinpoint the root cause (glitch, permission issue, or a combination).\n\n\n**Focusing on Access Issues**\n\nI've revised my understanding, now leaning strongly toward \"Access\" as the primary category. The inability to locate submitted time cards, coupled with approval/rejection difficulties and a malfunctioning filter, points to a fundamental access restriction. It's not just about a lack of administrative privilege; the core problem is that the user is not granted access to the correct functions.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Access\" as the primary category for this Oracle time card issue. The user's inability to see submitted cards and perform actions strongly indicates an access restriction. While administrative rights might be part of the solution, the core problem is the user's lack of functional access within the system. The filter malfunction further reinforces this as an access-related symptom. I've ruled out HR Support and Internal Project, as the issue is technical, not policy-driven, and not about a project itself.\n\n\n**Defining the Root Cause**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Access\" as the prime categorization.  The inability to see time cards and perform approval actions points directly to a lack of access to those functions.  The malfunctioning filter is just a symptom of this broader access problem.  HR Support and Internal Project are definitely out; this is a pure technical issue, not a policy or project matter. I have ruled out administrative rights, as the ticket focuses on the user's specific experience and a function within the user's view, not the lack of ability to configure something for an entire function.\n\n\n"
