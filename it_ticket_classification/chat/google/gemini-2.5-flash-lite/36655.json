I'm ready to make a definitive decision.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's language, identifying phrases like \"timecard issue\" and the specific error message as key indicators. After analyzing all options, \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate. The issue centers on a timecard, a clear HR-related function, and the problem requires their intervention. I'm ready to categorize it as such.\n\n\n"
