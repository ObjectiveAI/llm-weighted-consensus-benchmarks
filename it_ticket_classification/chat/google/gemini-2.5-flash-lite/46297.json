I've begun analyzing the provided text, looking for keywords and phrases that will help me accurately assign it to one of the following categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. Thus far, \"check oracle account\", \"starter form\", and \"start\" have been identified.\n\n\n**Identifying HR Connection**\n\nI've further analyzed the IT ticket content, including keywords like \"start date\", \"manager notified\", and \"training materials.\" These, along with \"starter form\" and \"check oracle account,\" strongly point towards an HR-related issue. The initial focus on \"check oracle account\" has expanded to encompass broader onboarding and employee setup activities, making \"HR Support\" the most appropriate category. The need for administrative rights might be implied but is secondary to the HR context.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've reviewed the keywords \"submit his weekly basis\" and \"log accordingly\" in the provided IT ticket text, but they don't seem directly related to the initial HR onboarding focus I identified. They are more likely part of the user's ongoing tasks or reporting. However, considering all the information, the ticket definitively centers on the \"starter form\" process tied to onboarding which clearly falls under \"HR Support\". The \"check oracle account\" and possible need for admin rights are ancillary issues, secondary to the overarching HR context established by the \"starter form\".\n\n\n"
