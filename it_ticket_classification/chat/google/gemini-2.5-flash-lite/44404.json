I'm dissecting the ticket content, hunting for the core issue, and mapping it to the predefined categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.  I'll ensure precise category mapping for efficient issue resolution.\n\n\n**Determining the Ticket Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's text, identifying \"access card issue\" repeatedly. \"Verifying access\", and \"lack access\" strongly suggest an access problem. Although the physical card could be hardware, the trouble is about using it, not its condition. HR support, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights don't seem applicable. \"Access\" is the closest and most appropriate.\n\n\n"
