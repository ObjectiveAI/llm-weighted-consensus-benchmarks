The initial text mentions \"network issue,\" which is guiding my initial assessment.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've reviewed the IT ticket details and have concluded that the primary issue revolves around gaining access to shared resources and software. Based on this, I've assigned it to the \"Access\" category as it most accurately reflects the user's request for necessary permissions.\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the provided IT ticket text, and based on the explicit mentions of needing access to shared resources and specific software, I've confidently assigned it to the \"Access\" category. This aligns perfectly with the user's core request for permissions.\n\n"
