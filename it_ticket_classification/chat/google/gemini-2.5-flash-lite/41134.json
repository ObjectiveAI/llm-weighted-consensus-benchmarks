It's clear there's an issue with an Oracle error status related to annual leave retroactively affecting submitted cards. I'm focusing on the error's source and the user's request for resolution.\n\n\n**Evaluating HR Implications**\n\nThe ticket's core issue appears to stem from an Oracle error impacting leave submission. This suggests a problem within an HR system or process, specifically concerning retroactive annual leave affecting submitted records. I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the essence of this ticket. After considering the \"Oracle error\" and the \"retroactive annual leave,\" it's apparent the problem concerns an HR-related system or process failure. The \"cards for week\" submission further solidifies this focus on HR procedures. I've ruled out the other categories, as they don't capture the HR workflow at play here.\n\n\n"
