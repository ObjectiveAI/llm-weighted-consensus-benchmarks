Right now, I'm leaning toward HR Support, but I'm keeping an open mind for other possible matches, too.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the ticket's keywords, focusing on terms like \"absence records,\" \"annual leaves,\" and \"timecard.\" These strongly indicate an HR-related issue. After comparing these terms to the categories provided, I've concluded that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting choice. This encompasses the ticket's core function of managing employee time and leave requests.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe keywords \"absence records,\" \"leave log,\" and \"timecard\" are critical. I'm prioritizing the HR Support category due to the emphasis on managing employee time off. I considered \"Internal Project\" but opted for \"HR Support\" because it directly aligns with the ticket's core function: handling employee absence data.\n\n\n"
