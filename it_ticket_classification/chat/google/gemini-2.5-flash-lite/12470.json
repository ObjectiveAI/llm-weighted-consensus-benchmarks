                    "reasoning": "**Determining the Ticket Type**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket description to pinpoint the appropriate category. Initial assessments leaned towards \"Access\" given the mention of adding people. However, the context is still unclear, and I'm cross-referencing keywords like \"add\" and \"people\" with other potential categories to ensure accuracy before making a final determination.\n\n\n**Categorizing Further Refined**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. While \"Access\" is still a frontrunner, \"HR Support\" has become more relevant due to the potential for new hire onboarding, even though the context is slight. I'm carefully analyzing the nuances in the \"add people\" request to see if it leans more toward access rights or personnel management. Contextual keywords are being cross-referenced, and a final decision will depend on whether \"add\" denotes user permissions or employee management.\n\n\n**Refining Access Classification**\n\nI'm now carefully differentiating between \"Access\" and other options. While \"HR Support\" still holds some relevance, I believe the core request is about granting permissions or access rights, making \"Access\" the more direct fit. I'm focusing on the implied action of granting users entry to a resource, rather than an HR-related process. Keywords are being evaluated to solidify the choice.\n\n\n**Refining Access Rationale**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket to settle on the correct classification. The phrase \"add people to address\" is the key. While the HR connection is still present in my mind, the focus is increasingly on the technical aspect of adding users to a resource, which points towards the \"Access\" category. I am now confident that granting user access to an address book or communication platform constitutes the core of this request. Further, it feels less like HR because the nature of the request feels more technical.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Action**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the crux of the ticket. After analyzing the request \"add people to address\", I firmly believe it points to managing user access, likely to a system or resource address book. I'm focusing on \"access\" as the best fit, as the request leans toward technical access control rather than HR-related onboarding. The ambiguity of \"address\" still weighs heavily in this context.\n\n\n"
