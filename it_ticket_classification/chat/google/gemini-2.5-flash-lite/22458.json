Given the phrase \"new project for school,\" I'm leaning heavily towards \"Internal Project\" as the most suitable classification. My goal is to select the category that best encapsulates the request's core purpose.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Project**\n\nI've carefully considered the keywords and phrases within the text. \"New project for school,\" \"presentations,\" and \"calendar widget\" are key indicators. I'm prioritizing the educational context. While software development is implied by \"front developer,\" the project's core is educational, so \"Internal Project\" seems most appropriate. I'm confident this choice aligns with the ticket's primary purpose.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Educational Context**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the ticket, focusing on the educational nature. The phrase \"new project for school\" keeps coming to mind. I'm carefully weighing \"Internal Project\" against \"Access,\" but the project's educational core leads me back to internal development or management for school-related features. I'm now leaning towards this category as it seems most aligned with the ticket's true intent, as opposed to access requests.\n\n\n**Selecting the Primary Theme**\n\nI've carefully considered the keywords, phrases, and the underlying intent of the ticket. The phrase \"new project for school\" consistently points towards an educational context. The addition of \"calendar widget\" and \"front developer\" indicates a software development element. While the user's initial analysis centered on the \"Internal Project\" category, I'm now leaning towards prioritizing the development aspect, keeping this in mind.\n\n\n"
