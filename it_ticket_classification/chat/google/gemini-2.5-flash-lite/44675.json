I've read through the text and identified \"certificate error\" as a key phrase, appearing multiple times. This, along with the implied need for access, suggests a potential issue within the \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" categories, but I'm still analyzing to decide which is most appropriate.\n\n\n**Refining Category Choice**\n\nI'm now leaning heavily towards \"Access\" as the appropriate category. The recurring \"certificate error\" directly impacts a user's ability to access the documents and system functionality. Although \"Administrative rights\" could play a part, the core problem is a direct access restriction, making \"Access\" a more accurate primary classification. Further, the user's specific access needs for documents further solidify this choice.\n\n\n**Evaluating Access Concerns**\n\nI've carefully re-examined the ticket's language, especially \"certificate error,\" and its impact on document access. Considering the limited category options, the phrase strongly points toward an access-related issue rather than an administrative rights problem. The need to open documents is at the heart of the user's difficulty.\n\n\n"
