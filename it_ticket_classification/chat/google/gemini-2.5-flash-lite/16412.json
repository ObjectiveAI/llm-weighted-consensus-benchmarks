However, I'm digging deeper to confirm it's not a deceptive lead. I'm exploring the context and wording to ensure this is the best fit before I finalize the classification.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Keywords**\n\nI've determined the initial \"Purchase\" classification is accurate. The terms related to hardware procurement\u2014\"safe,\" \"installation,\" \"invoice,\" and \"quote\"\u2014confirm this. Although \"Hardware\" is present, the ticket describes the entire purchase workflow, making \"Purchase\" the most suitable category.\n\n\n"
