I'm weighing keywords like \"card\" and \"engineer\" against the provided schema options.\n\n**Processing Ticket Data**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the IT ticket's text, specifically focusing on repeated keywords like \"card\" and terms such as \"engineer\" and \"administrator\" to best fit it within the `[\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", \"Administrative rights\"]` schema.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Details**\n\nI'm currently refining the classification of the IT ticket. My analysis highlights keywords such as \"card,\" \"engineer,\" and \"administrator,\" and I'm prioritizing the \"Access\" category based on common interpretations of these terms in IT contexts, especially considering phrases like \"allocate card\" and location references.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently focused on classifying the IT ticket.
