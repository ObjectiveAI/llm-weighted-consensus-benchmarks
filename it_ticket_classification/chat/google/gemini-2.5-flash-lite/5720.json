I'm considering \"HR Support\" or \"Administrative rights\" as possibilities, but further refinement is needed.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Support Category**\n\nAfter reviewing the ticket text and examining the keywords, I've concluded that \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category. The phrases \"change line manager\" and \"left\" strongly suggest an employee status update, typically managed through HR systems. I've ruled out other categories like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" as they don't capture the essence of this personnel-related request. The focus on a line manager change clearly aligns with HR responsibilities.\n\n\n"
