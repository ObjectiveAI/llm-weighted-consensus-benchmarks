The text mentions \"down project\" and a \"connecting cable\", which leads me towards either a \"Hardware\" or \"Internal Project\" issue. I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the mention of a cable suggests a physical component. I will refine this shortly, as this feels like a good fit, based on the provided choices.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, focusing on keywords to pinpoint the root cause. While \"project\" and \"deploy\" initially suggested an \"Internal Project\" issue, the recurring mention of a \"connecting cable\" and the \"down\" status strongly point to a physical hardware problem.  \"Host\" further reinforced this interpretation, solidifying my decision.\n\n\n"
