My initial leaning is towards \"Access\" due to the mentions of \"guests\" and \"connect,\" but I'm still weighing this against other possibilities to ensure the best fit.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Classification**\n\nI've refined my thinking on the ticket, focusing on the expanded content. The repeated theme of guests failing to connect, even with the manager's password, solidified my \"Access\" classification. It's a connectivity issue, not hardware, HR, or other unrelated concerns. I'm now certain this falls within the \"Access\" category, and will finalize it as such.\n\n\n**Clarifying Ticket Focus**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the details of this access issue. The user is struggling to get guests connected, with repeated mentions of \"guests cannot connect\" and password usage. Considering the added details, I've confirmed that \"Access\" remains the definitive category. I am prepared to finalize this as \"Access\".\n\n\n"
