The mention of \"nexus\" and \"deliver some releases today\" strongly suggests a development-related issue, leaning towards \"Internal Project,\" rather than general hardware problems.\n\n**Selecting Project Category**\n\nI've now considered the nuances of the ticket, specifically the urgent need to deliver releases and the mention of \"Nexus,\" a common artifact repository. This leads me to believe the core issue is tied to our development workflow, making \"Internal Project\" the most appropriate classification.\n\n**Investigating Connection Issues**\n\nI'm prioritizing the urgent nature of the ticket, focusing on the \"cannot get connection\" and \"deliver some releases today\" aspects. My current thought process leans towards classifying this as an \"Internal Project\" issue, given the context of development releases.\n\n"
