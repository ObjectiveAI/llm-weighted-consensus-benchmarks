I've reviewed the text and am leaning towards \"Access\" as the primary issue seems to revolve around the user's difficulty seeing active elements and making adjustments, potentially due to insufficient permissions. I'm double-checking, but this feels like the strongest fit.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choices**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the initial category suggestion. While \"Access\" seemed plausible due to the phrase \"difficulty seeing active,\" I'm now leaning towards a more specific option. The user's inability to make adjustments within the Oracle application, coupled with the \"difficulty seeing\" active components, points more strongly towards \"Administrative Rights\" than previously thought, or even perhaps \"Access\" with this new evidence, so I am weighing those choices.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. The \"cannot make adjustments\" issue within Oracle is really making me reconsider. While \"Access\" is still relevant given the difficulty *seeing* active elements, the inability to *make adjustments* feels more like an \"Administrative Rights\" restriction. It's a nuanced call, but I'm leaning toward \"Access\" unless more context is uncovered. I've re-examined the initial text and the core problem is clearly around user permissions to view and edit certain things.\n\n\n**Confirming Ticket Classification**\n\nOkay, after further review, I am convinced that \"Access\" is the most appropriate category. The inability to both *see* active items and *make adjustments* within Oracle strongly suggests a permissions issue. It's not about administrative duties, but standard user functions restricted by the system.  I've chosen \"Access\" over \"Administrative Rights\" for now.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Issues**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text. The phrase \"difficulty seeing active\" strongly suggests a permissions or access limitation.  While \"Administrative Rights\" crossed my mind initially, the inability to *see* and *adjust*  feels like standard user access restrictions, and \"Access\" appears the best fit for this scenario. I'm confident that Access is correct.\n\n\n"
