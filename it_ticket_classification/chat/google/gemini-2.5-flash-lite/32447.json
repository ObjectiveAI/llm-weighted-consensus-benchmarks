The \"attached\" implies something supplementary, but the core issue revolves around project-related code. This suggests a potential category, which I'm now leaning towards. I'll need to confirm that this is the best fit.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Selection**\n\nI've narrowed down the potential category to \"Internal Project.\" The user's input highlights project-related forms and setup procedures, aligning perfectly. The mention of \"new project code\" reinforces this connection. After considering all options, the \"Internal Project\" category seems the most precise fit for this IT ticket's content.\n\n\n"
