I'm reviewing the ticket details and comparing them against the available categories: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\".  My goal is to accurately assign the ticket to one of these predefined options.\n\n\n**Evaluating Ticket Details**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text, aiming to pinpoint the best category. Key phrases like \"check space on servers\" and \"host servers\" point toward storage concerns. Although \"install application\" could lean towards software, the context clearly indicates a need for server resources. I've ruled out HR Support as irrelevant. Now, I'm leaning toward selecting either \"Hardware\" or \"Storage,\" but \"Storage\" feels most precise.\n\n\n**Assessing Ticket Allocation**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the most relevant category given the ticket context. \"check space on servers\" and \"host servers\" are dominant themes. I ruled out \"Hardware,\" despite its connection to server capacity, as \"Storage\" feels more precise. The \"install application\" component further highlights the focus on available server resources.  The request seems more about assessing existing storage and its ability to meet requirements than a general hardware issue, making \"Storage\" the clear winner.\n\n\n"
