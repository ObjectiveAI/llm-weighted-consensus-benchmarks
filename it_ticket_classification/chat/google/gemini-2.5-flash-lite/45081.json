The key here seems to be the repeated mention of \"requisition issue\" and \"purchase requisition.\" I am leaning towards \"Purchase\" but need to consider potential nuances before finalizing the assignment. I'm reviewing the other categories to confirm this is the most apt.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI've determined that the keywords strongly point to the \"Purchase\" category. The repeated use of \"purchase requisition\" is the primary clue. While hardware or storage purchases are possible, the issue itself centers on the *requisition process* and approval, not the hardware or storage directly. After considering all options, I am certain the \"Purchase\" category is the most precise.\n\n\n"
