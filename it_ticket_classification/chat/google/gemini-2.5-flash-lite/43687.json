Right now, I am specifically dealing with tickets that concern email storage. My analysis so far indicates these types of issues seem to fall under \"Storage\" or \"Miscellaneous\" based on keywords like \"mailbox full\". I'm refining my model to further differentiate between the two with more precision. I will also incorporate additional keywords such as \"quota\" to improve accuracy.\n\n\n**Categorizing Email Issues**\n\nI've honed in on the \"Storage\" category as the best fit for this email-related ticket. The ticket text's references to \"mailbox full,\" \"almost full,\" and the user's failed attempts at freeing up space strongly indicate a storage problem. I'm satisfied that my initial assessment aligns perfectly with the textual cues, and I believe this category provides the most direct and accurate resolution.\n\n\n"
