I've analyzed the description, and the keywords \"password expire days\" are strong indicators. This points towards either \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" but is most likely \"Access\". I'll continue to evaluate other keywords to confirm.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Issues**\n\nI've determined the ticket concerns password management, as indicated by terms like \"password expire\" and \"complexity.\"  The user's description of failed password attempts strongly reinforces this. \"Access\" seems the best fit, despite considering \"HR Support\" due to the password-related issues.\n\n\n"
