I'm weighing whether it leans towards \"Storage\" or if there's an argument for \"Miscellaneous\" due to the general nature of assistance needed. I have to select a single category from the options.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Focus**\n\nI've examined the ticket content closely and determined the central concern. The request revolves around ensuring the proper backup of archives and understanding the associated access. While the need for server access is present, the main issue is the integrity and management of the backups themselves.  Therefore, I've confirmed that \"Storage\" is the most precise category. It encompasses the backup file concerns.\n\n\n"
