My approach involves a careful analysis of the textual descriptions provided within each ticket. I'm aiming to create a mapping system that can reliably identify key phrases and contextual clues to determine the most appropriate category for each ticket, considering options like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\"\n\n\n**Identifying Project Setup Needs**\n\nI'm zeroing in on this ticket's core function: the establishment of a \"new project\". Key indicators include repeated references to \"setup,\" \"templates,\" \"form,\" and a possible \"location\" addition. I am aiming to correctly categorize this as an \"Internal Project\" request. The goal is accurate identification of this request type.\n\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text, identifying key phrases such as \"new project,\" \"setup,\" and \"setup form.\" After a nuanced analysis, I've concluded that the primary focus is on the establishment of a \"new project\". I've assigned this to the \"Internal Project\" category, considering the \"setup\" aspect as a crucial part of project commencement.\n\n\n"
