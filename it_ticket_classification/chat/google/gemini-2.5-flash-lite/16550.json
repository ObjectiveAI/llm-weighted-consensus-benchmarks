The keywords \"leaver\", \"revoke\", and \"release\" strongly suggest an access management issue, particularly around departing employees. \"Token,\" \"inventory update,\" and \"infrastructure talk\" further pinpoint the need for access controls, potentially relating to system permissions and resource revocation. I'm leaning toward a category encompassing user lifecycle management and access governance.\n\n\n**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"Access\" category, solidifying its relevance. The terms \"token,\" \"AD token,\" and the repeated emphasis on \"releasing\" and \"revoking\" access are critical. I'm moving away from `Administrative rights` as it's subsumed by the broader access management context. \"Inventory update\" and \"tickets logged\" are consistent with the access revocation process triggered by a leaver.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Access Issue**\n\nI've analyzed the keywords, and the 'Access' category is fitting, as \"releasing,\" \"revoking,\" and \"ad token\" are central. The consistent mention of \"leaver\" and the need to \"release\" and \"revoke\" access solidified this. The phrases \"inventory update\" and \"tickets logged\" support this. I believe the core issue involves the user lifecycle management of the leaving employee.\n\n\n"
