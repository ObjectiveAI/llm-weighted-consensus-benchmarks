I'm cross-referencing this against the category options provided. Based on the initial analysis, I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" as the most relevant category. I'll need to carefully examine the text to confirm and rule out any other possibilities like access or purchase. I am double checking for related info like which computer.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've reviewed the provided information and have locked in \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category. The ticket's description, specifically the references to the monitor not functioning and cable checks, align perfectly with hardware troubleshooting. While other categories were considered, none of them resonated with the core issue. My assessment is complete.\n\n\n"
