My current thought process is analyzing the user's request for a \"password reset\" to determine the most appropriate category from the provided list.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm actively processing the IT ticket text. My analysis confirms that \"password reset\" and mentions of systems like \"confluence\" strongly indicate the \"Access\" category. I've discounted the boilerplate footer as irrelevant to the core issue.\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI've analyzed the IT ticket details, and the recurring theme of \"password reset\" alongside system mentions like \"confluence\" definitively points towards the \"Access\" category. I'm now prioritizing this classification.\n\n"
