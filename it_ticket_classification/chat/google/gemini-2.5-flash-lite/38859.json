So far, the input text seems brief and may be related to an HR matter or access issue. I am now evaluating the relevance of each category to the words in the text, and working towards making a final decision.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choices**\n\nI've re-evaluated the initial category assignments, taking into account the nuanced language within the IT ticket. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the primary categorization due to the prominence of \"leaver\" and form submission. There's also an indication of some tech issue with form access, so \"Access\" might be a secondary category. I will finalize my category selection and will determine if a more precise categorization is possible.\n\n\n**Defining Primary Focus**\n\nI've determined that the primary focus is HR Support, given the \"leaver\" context and form submission. Although there's a technical access issue preventing the form submission, the ticket's core revolves around the HR leaver process. I'm focusing on \"HR Support\" as the main classification, ensuring the proper category is identified.\n\n\n"
