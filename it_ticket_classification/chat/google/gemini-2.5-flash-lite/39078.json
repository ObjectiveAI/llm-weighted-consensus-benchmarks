After a careful read, the description highlights a recurring password prompt issue in Outlook that started after a password change. Based on this, I'm leaning toward Access as the most appropriate category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Problem**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the IT ticket. The core issue, confirmed by the user's description, appears to be an Outlook access problem triggered by a recent password alteration. I considered Hardware, HR Support, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights, but Access aligns best with the authentication issue. It's a clear fit and the most efficient resolution path.\n\n\n"
