The keywords \"project manager change\" seem relevant, but the overall context is a bit cryptic. \"Code\" is present, but without more context it's hard to determine the area of relevance. I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" due to the mention of a project manager and systems change, but I need to ensure it's the best fit.\n\n\n**Reconsidering Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm now revising my initial \"Internal Project\" categorization. The mention of \"annual leave\" is a clear indicator, shifting my focus toward \"HR Support\". The other details, while potentially relevant, don't strongly contradict this. I'm prioritizing the more definitive \"annual leave\" context, though I will hold this under review.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've re-examined the keywords, specifically focusing on the phrase \"annual leave November December.\" This strongly points toward an \"HR Support\" ticket. Other elements like \"project manager change\" remain unclear without context. I'm prioritizing the clear \"HR\" indicator and leaning heavily toward HR Support as the primary category.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Key Evidence**\n\nI've re-examined the text, focusing on the strong \"annual leave\" indicator. While other phrases, like \"project manager change,\" are present, they lack clear context. I'm choosing \"HR Support\" because the \"annual leave\" phrase is more definitive and central to the user's need.\n\n\n"
