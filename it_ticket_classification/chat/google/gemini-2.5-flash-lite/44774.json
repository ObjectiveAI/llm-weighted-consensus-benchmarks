I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" due to performance issues, but will also consider \"Miscellaneous\" if the problem proves less specific.\n\n**Refining IT Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm now reassessing the IT ticket's categorization. While initially leaning towards \"Hardware\" due to perceived performance bottlenecks, the mention of sync issues and the involvement of internal IT experts leads me to consider \"Storage\" more seriously, or even \"Miscellaneous\" if the scope remains ambiguous after further analysis.\n\n**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI'm now carefully analyzing the IT ticket, specifically the reported slowness in Outlook calendars. While \"Storage\" seemed plausible due to sync mentions, the lack of explicit storage constraints and the primary focus on performance make \"Miscellaneous\" a more fitting general category for now, pending further clarification.\n\n**Analyzing Calendar Performance**\n\nI'm currently reviewing the IT ticket data. The core issue revolves around Outlook calendar slowness and sync problems, with engineers having intervened. My current thinking is that \"Storage\" might be the most fitting category, as large sync volumes and data management often underpin such performance degradation.\n\n**Classifying Outlook Slowness**\n\nI'm currently determining the best category for the IT ticket regarding Outlook calendar slowness. Given the mention of sync issues and the potential for large data volumes affecting performance, I'm prioritizing \"Storage\" as the most relevant classification, as it aligns with potential underlying causes like large OST files or sync burdens.\n\n**Analyzing Calendar Slowness**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the IT ticket's core issue: Outlook calendar slowness. The mention of extensive download syncs suggests that the problem may stem from large data volumes impacting performance, making \"Storage\" the most fitting category for this investigation.\n\n**Assigning Calendar Slowness Ticket**\n\nI'm currently finalizing the categorization for the IT ticket concerning Outlook calendar slowness. Based on the user's description, particularly the emphasis on \"download sync every,\" I've determined that \"Storage\" is the most fitting category, as it best reflects the potential underlying issues related to data volume and synchronization.\n\n"
