The key phrases \"new starter,\" \"create his credentials,\" and \"candidate accepted job offer\" all point towards onboarding activities, which typically fall under HR-related processes. While \"Access\" could be a secondary consideration, I believe \"HR Support\" is the primary driver here.\n\n\n**Confirming Ticket Classification**\n\nHaving thoroughly reviewed the information, I've confirmed my initial assessment. Despite the access-related elements involved, the core of this ticket revolves around a new employee joining the company. The \"HR Support\" category perfectly encapsulates the onboarding process, including credential creation. I've ruled out all other categories based on their irrelevance to the described scenario.\n\n\n"
