Identifying the relevant category is the current priority. The goal is to accurately classify this request from the provided list. Determining the appropriate category is the objective.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text, searching for clues. The user's description points directly to password issues. While \"Access\" is a clear contender, \"Administrative Rights\" is less appropriate, as the issue is user-level, not administrative. It's a key process within security operations. Password management clearly falls under Access.\n\n\n"
