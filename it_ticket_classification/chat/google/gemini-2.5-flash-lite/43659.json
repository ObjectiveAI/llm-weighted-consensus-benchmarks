The goal is accurate mapping to the specified categories. I'm prioritizing keywords and phrases to improve categorization reliability.\n\n\n**Defining Core Problem**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket, focusing on the display driver errors and external monitor connectivity issues. Key phrases highlight the persistent problem across different monitors and the workstation.  It seems the root cause lies within this display functionality, not other IT aspects.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content, focusing on the described problems and user environment. The \"display driver error\" is the central issue, accompanied by ongoing external monitor connectivity problems and workstation impact. My analysis points firmly to a \"Hardware\" category, as the described issues relate to the physical display components and their drivers.\n\n\n"
