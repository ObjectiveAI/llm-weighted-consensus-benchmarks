It seems to revolve around absence management and delegation, prompting me to think this belongs under HR Support or Access category. The phrases \"back up approver\", \"vacation rule\", \"reassign\", and \"leave\" strongly suggest an HR-related workflow. However, I need to consider access rights too. I'm now leaning more towards \"HR Support\" category.\n\n\n**Narrowing down the options**\n\nI've carefully re-examined the ticket text, focusing on the keywords like \"vacation,\" \"reassign,\" and \"approver,\" and confirmed my initial assessment. While I considered \"Access\" briefly, the core function aligns definitively with HR Support processes. Now, I feel confident this is the definitive best fit.\n\n\n"
