Considering the provided text, the phrase \"distribution lists\" seems to point towards an access-related issue. This seems like it will be either access or administrative rights. I will check the existing tickets to confirm.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Focus**\n\nI've thoroughly re-examined the ticket's language about \"new list for location owners\" and consolidating existing distribution lists. The emphasis on managing these lists solidifies my initial hunch.  \"Access\" remains the most appropriate category, as these lists are inherently about granting and controlling access to information and resources. This fits squarely within the access category.\n\n\n"
