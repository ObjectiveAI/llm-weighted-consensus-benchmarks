Based on the provided text fragment mentioning someone \"not a leaver\", I'm leaning toward the \"HR Support\" category. However, I need to carefully consider other possible categories before definitively assigning the ticket. I'm taking into account how this might relate to employee status and access issues.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text fragment to precisely identify the main issue. It appears a person's employee status is inaccurate, which impacts their system access. Although \"accesses\" is mentioned, the core seems to be \"is not a leaver leaver\", so this indicates a possible discrepancy between their actual status and the system's record. This suggests the primary issue to be HR-related.\n\n\n**Determining the Priority**\n\nI've made a decision regarding the main category, focusing on the core problem: the employee's status. The inaccurate \"leaver\" status is a crucial point, suggesting \"HR Support\" as the primary category. While the mention of \"accesses\" does have a secondary importance, it seems to be a consequence of the status, not the primary cause. My thoughts now revolve around prioritizing which of the two categories to assign: HR support or access.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted to the nuances of the \"access\" mention. The \"accesses kept tickets closed\" phrase is prompting further investigation. While the \"leaver\" status certainly suggests \"HR Support\", the access aspect is pushing me to consider whether the access issue is the *direct* problem, or just a symptom of the HR status. I'm leaning more towards \"HR Support\" because the ticket text emphasizes an employee's incorrect status. Even if access is the immediate issue, this access problem stems from the incorrect status.\n\n\n"
