My approach is to extract key terms like \"purchase,\" \"order,\" and \"receipt\" from the ticket text. These keywords should help me confidently assign tickets to the \"New Purchase\" category, based on the provided list of allowed categories and matching keywords. I need to make sure I don't miss any relevant term variations that might indicate a purchase.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Match**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category match for IT tickets. My process involves analyzing the provided text for purchase-related keywords, such as \"new purchase,\" \"purchase,\" \"purchased,\" \"order,\" \"item ordered,\" and \"receipts.\" These are dead giveaways! Currently, the system is designed to pick \"Purchase\" from the list: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.\n\n\n"
