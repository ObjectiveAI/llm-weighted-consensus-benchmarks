The \"issue types and sub tasks\" language suggests this might relate to an Internal Project. The additional mention of \"issue type story\" seems to support this direction. I'm carefully weighing the other options to ensure a precise assignment, considering that \"story\" could be relevant to multiple categories.\n\n\n**Revisiting Admin Rights**\n\nAfter further reflection, I'm leaning toward \"Administrative rights.\" The language surrounding issue types, sub-tasks, and board visibility strongly suggests system configuration or permission changes. While \"Internal Project\" was initially considered, the focus is on *managing* the tracking system, which aligns better with administrative functions than the project's output. The \"add issue type\" request solidifies this connection.\n\n\n**Analyzing Permission Settings**\n\nThe initial focus on \"Internal Project\" felt almost right, but the more I dig into it, the more I believe it involves administrative controls. I've re-examined the key phrases: adding issue types, hiding sub-tasks, and board visibility. These actions point more clearly to the need for administrative privileges within an issue tracking system. I'm solidifying my conclusion, it falls under the \"Administrative rights\" category.\n\n\n"
