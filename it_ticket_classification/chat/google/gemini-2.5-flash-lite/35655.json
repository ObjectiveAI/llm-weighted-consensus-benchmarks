The request involves a user reporting a bug related to uploading a contract and a message pop-up. Based on the description, I'm evaluating it against available categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" and \"Miscellaneous\" to determine the most appropriate classification for this issue.\n\n**Classifying Software Glitch**\n\nI'm still working to accurately categorize this IT ticket. The user reported an upload bug with a contract, and after reviewing the available options, \"Miscellaneous\" seems to be the most fitting category for this type of functional software issue.\n\n**Classifying Contract Upload Bug**\n\nI've reviewed the provided IT ticket, which details a bug occurring during contract uploads accompanied by a pop-up message. Considering the available categories, \"Miscellaneous\" appears to be the most fitting classification for this functional software issue, as it doesn't align with hardware, access, HR, storage, purchases, internal projects, or administrative rights.\n\n**Refining Contract Upload Classification**\n\nI've analyzed the IT ticket again, focusing on the \"bug\" related to contract uploads and the accompanying message. After careful consideration of the available categories, I've concluded that \"Miscellaneous\" remains the most appropriate classification, as the issue doesn't clearly fall under hardware, HR, access, storage, purchase, internal projects, or administrative rights.\n\n"
