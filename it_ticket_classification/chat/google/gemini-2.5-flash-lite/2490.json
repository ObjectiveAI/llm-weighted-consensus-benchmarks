This ensures accurate and efficient ticket routing.\n\n**Determining HR Support Ticket**\n\nI've analyzed the provided text and identified key phrases like \"end of probation period,\" \"probation reminders,\" and \"date joining captured,\" which clearly point towards Human Resources functions. Based on this, I'm confident the ticket falls under the \"HR Support\" category.\n\n"
