Based on the keywords \"leaver\" and \"termination,\" I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support.\" However, I'm carefully considering other categories to ensure I don't overlook a potential fit. I need to make sure this is not a ticket to remove access.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've been evaluating the best category for this ticket. After considering the context, my analysis strongly suggests \"HR Support.\" The terms \"leaver,\" \"termination,\" and \"leaving date\" are all key indicators. While access removal is a possibility, the core issue seems to revolve around the overall offboarding procedure, making \"HR Support\" the best fit, in my current assessment.\n\n\n"
