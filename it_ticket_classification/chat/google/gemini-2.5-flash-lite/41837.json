The ticket content, \"unable to connect to from outside the via sent thursday unable connect outside via hi unable connect go\", strongly suggests an issue related to connectivity, which I'm evaluating against the available classifications.\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI'm now focusing on classifying the IT ticket based on its description. The ticket mentions an \"inability to connect from outside,\" highlighting a critical need to work remotely. I am weighing this against the categories provided, specifically considering if it falls under \"Access\" or potentially \"Hardware\" if the connection issue stems from equipment.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently processing the IT ticket. The core issue, \"unable to connect from outside,\" strongly points towards an \"Access\" category problem, as it directly impacts the ability to reach internal resources remotely. I am confirming this classification against the provided options.\n\n**Classifying Connectivity Issues**\n\nI'm finalizing the classification of the IT ticket. The recurring theme of \"unable to connect from outside\" strongly points towards an \"Access\" related problem, specifically concerning remote connectivity. I am confidently assigning this category based on the provided text.\n\n"
