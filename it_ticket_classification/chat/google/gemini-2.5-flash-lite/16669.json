My process involves a close examination of the ticket's text, specifically keywords like \"tunnel\" and \"clients,\" to match it against available enum values for the `category` field within the JSON schema.\n\n**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm actively refining the categorization of this IT ticket. My focus is on pinpointing the most accurate enum value from the `category` field in the schema, weighing terms like \"tunnel,\" \"gateway,\" and \"clients\" against the available options to best represent the user's request for setting up secure network connectivity.\n\n**Matching Ticket to Access**\n\nI'm refining my categorization. My current thought process is that the presence of \"tunnel,\" \"clients,\" \"gateway,\" and \"virtual addresses\" strongly points towards network access configuration. Given the available categories, \"Access\" appears to be the most fitting descriptor for setting up secure client connectivity.\n\n**Developing Tunnel Configuration Logic**\n\nI'm currently processing the provided text to determine the most fitting category for the IT ticket. My focus is on keywords like \"tunnel,\" \"clients,\" \"gateway,\" and \"automation engineer\" to ascertain whether the ticket pertains to setting up network access or an internal project, weighing these against the available schema enum values for the `category` field.\n\n**Investigating Project Scope**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the text to determine if the focus is on setting up access for clients or developing a broader tunneling solution. The mention of an \"automation engineer\" and the question of \"how to proceed\" suggests the possibility of an internal project aimed at standardizing tunnel creation.\n\n**Refining Project Scope**\n\nI'm currently assessing whether the ticket describes a client access setup or an internal development effort. The involvement of an \"automation engineer\" and the request for guidance on \"how to proceed\" and finding \"templates\" strongly suggest a project focused on building or standardizing tunnel creation capabilities, leaning towards an \"Internal Project.\"\n\n"
