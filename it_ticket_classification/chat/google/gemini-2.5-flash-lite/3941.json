I'm focusing on the keywords \"new starter\" and \"service now.\"  My current thinking leans toward \"HR Support\" because onboarding likely involves HR systems access. I'm considering \"Access\" as a secondary option, but the primary focus feels HR-driven. I'll need to weigh these options carefully against the given text.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Focus**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket text, and the phrases \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"annual leave\" have cemented my choice. I'm prioritizing \"HR Support\" because those phrases strongly point to HR processes, specifically onboarding. \"Access\" is still in the background as a secondary possibility, but the primary focus feels HR-centric. I believe I have the correct solution.\n\n\n"
