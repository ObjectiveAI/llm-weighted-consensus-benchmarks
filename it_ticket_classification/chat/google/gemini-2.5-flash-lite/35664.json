The description, \"oracle issue issue hello have problem with have filled days saved but,\" requires careful consideration to ensure the best fit.\n\n**Determining Category**\n\nI'm continuing to refine my categorization of the IT ticket. The description points to an Oracle software issue where saved data disappeared, which doesn't fit neatly into any of the specific provided categories like Hardware or Access. Therefore, I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the most appropriate general classification for this functional problem.\n\n**Refining Classification**\n\nI'm continuing to evaluate the Oracle issue. Given the data disappearance and functional anomalies within the application, and the lack of a specific software or bug category, \"Miscellaneous\" remains the most suitable classification as a general catch-all for this type of functional problem.\n\n**Selecting Category**\n\nI'm focusing on classifying the Oracle issue where saved data disappeared.
