The phrase \"purchase request\" strongly suggests the \"Purchase\" category, though the mention of needing \"additional access\" to complete it is also noted as a potential secondary tag for future consideration.\n\n**Determining Primary Category**\n\nI'm focusing on identifying the core intent of the ticket.
