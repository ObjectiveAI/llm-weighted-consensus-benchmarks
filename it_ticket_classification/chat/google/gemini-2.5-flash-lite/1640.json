I have a list of permitted options (\"Hardware| HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\").  The initial keyword from the ticket, \"leaver,\" suggests a need to classify it under one of these headings.  I'm now determining how best to map words and phrases to each category to increase accuracy.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nI've been analyzing the text for categorization. Keywords like \"leaver,\" \"leave date,\" and \"leaving date\" strongly suggest **HR Support** or offboarding.  \"AD rights\" and \"mailbox\" point to **Access** or **Administrative rights**.  While \"storage required\" emerged, the context leans HR. The focus is to determine the main process required from a ticket's information.\n\n\n**Finalizing Categorization**\n\nI've refined my thinking, prioritizing \"HR Support\" as the dominant category. While access-related keywords are present, they are a direct consequence of the \"leaver\" process, making HR the central concern. The keywords \"leaver form,\" \"mailbox,\" \"AD rights,\" and even the mention of hardware inventory are all secondary to the primary issue: an employee's departure. This confirms my initial assessment, so I can now move forward with confidence.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Primary Cause**\n\nMy analysis indicates this is clearly an HR-driven ticket. While keywords suggest potential \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" implications linked to the departing employee, the underlying cause is the leaver process.  The \"leaver\" theme and associated tasks, such as disabling accounts and managing mailboxes, all fall under HR support, validating the initial hypothesis. The hardware and storage mentions are peripheral to the HR core.\n\n\n"
