My initial assessment points towards a category related to onboarding or initial setup for a new employee.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm focused on determining the best category for this IT ticket. The phrase \"new starter\" strongly suggests an onboarding process, making \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" the most probable classifications due to the need for account creation and permissions.\n\n**Classifying New Starter Request**\n\nI'm currently refining the classification of the IT ticket. The mention of a \"new starter\" strongly suggests the onboarding process. My analysis indicates that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category, as it encompasses the initial IT setup and coordination required for new employees joining the company.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the provided text, \"new starter friday december hello please fill starting thank,\" to assign it to the most fitting category from the available options. The phrase \"new starter\" strongly suggests an onboarding process, leading me to prioritize categories like \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" due to the inherent IT requirements for new employees. My current analysis leans towards \"HR Support\" as the primary classification, as it encompasses the broader context of onboarding initiated by HR.\n\n**Categorizing Onboarding Ticket**\n\nI've refined my analysis of the ticket text, and the recurring theme of \"new starter\" strongly indicates an onboarding process. My current focus is on the most suitable category from the provided list. Given the context, \"HR Support\" appears to be the most encompassing classification, as it directly relates to the initial stages of integrating a new employee into the company's systems and workflows, which is fundamentally an HR-driven initiative.\n\n"
