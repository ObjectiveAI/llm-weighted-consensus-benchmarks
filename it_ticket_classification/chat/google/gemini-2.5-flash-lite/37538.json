After careful consideration of the text \"feed through patch panels ie pre data patch panel ca patch panel\", I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the most suitable classification. I'm confident I can make an informed decision based on this brief but relevant information.\n\n\n**Confirming Hardware Classification**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text with a fine-tooth comb. The repeated mentions of \"patch panels,\" \"cables,\" and \"racks\" solidify my original inclination. These are all physical components. \"Hardware\" is the correct classification. The detailed analysis leaves no doubt.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Type**\n\nI've meticulously reviewed the provided text. The repetition of \"patch panels,\" \"cables,\" and \"rack\" makes the correct category clear. I've considered all options. Considering these are core infrastructure components and it is clearly a hardware related issue, I am certain it fits the description of the \"Hardware\" ticket type. The focus is on the physical parts.\n\n\n"
