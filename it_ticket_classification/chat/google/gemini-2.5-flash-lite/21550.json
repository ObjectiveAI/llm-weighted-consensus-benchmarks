The text, \"new project code request\" and \"oracle\", points me toward a few possibilities. I'm carefully weighing the options to choose the most precise category. It seems like it might be an *Internal Project* or related to *Access*, but I'm leaning toward *Internal Project* since it's a \"new project code request\". I am still evaluating.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nNow, I'm second-guessing my initial assessment. While *Internal Project* seemed fitting at first, the focus on code creation, even if it's \"project code\", is broader than just initiating an internal project. I'm now considering if this is more about developing internal *systems* to do the task. Given the \"offers cost recovery sub type indirect\", this could be related to financial processes or cost tracking systems and so *Internal Project* does not seem to fit the bill. I'm revising my thoughts in that direction.\n\n\n"
