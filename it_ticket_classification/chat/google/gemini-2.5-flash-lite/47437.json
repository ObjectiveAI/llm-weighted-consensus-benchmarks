The \"manage rate schedules\" phrasing, coupled with the user \"creating\" them, strongly suggests an access or feature-related problem. Currently leaning towards \"Access\" as the most suitable category.\n\n\n**Evaluating Access Options**\n\nNow, I'm examining this situation more closely. The user's inability to \"find\" the feature following creation strongly points towards an access permissions issue, as opposed to a broader HR or administrative problem. However, I want to confirm that HR support could provide broader system-level support for such an issue.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nI've carefully reviewed the IT ticket details, focusing on the user's issue with \"manage rate schedules\" after creation. Analyzing the possible categories, \"Access\" seems most relevant. While \"HR Support\" and \"Administrative rights\" are related, the user's inability to \"find\" the feature strongly points to a direct access problem. I'm confident \"Access\" best describes the symptom, but I'll make sure to note that HR support is a relevant department.\n\n\n"
