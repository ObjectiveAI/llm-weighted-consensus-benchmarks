These suggest a user access management context, likely involving changes to user profiles or their associated resources. I'm leaning toward a category related to user account modifications. My analysis continues to refine the most precise category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Choices**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the most relevant categories. Based on the ticket details, \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" are the leading contenders, considering user \"unit\" assignments. The phrase about \"annual leave\" strengthens the HR connection. I'm focusing on whether \"unit\" is a group, a department, or implies a more general change in user profile or rights. The current analysis suggests HR Support is slightly more suitable.\n\n\n**Revising Category Selection**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, particularly \"change to unit\" and \"move also days per unit.\" Considering \"annual leave,\" HR Support continues to be a strong fit, as these adjustments align with employee data updates. While \"Access\" is a possibility, the context suggests changes within the organizational structure. I'm solidifying \"HR Support\" as the primary category.\n\n\n"
