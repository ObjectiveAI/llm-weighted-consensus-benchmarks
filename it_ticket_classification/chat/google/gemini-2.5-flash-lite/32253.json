The key seems to revolve around granting access, specifically related to a new employee. I'm carefully analyzing the provided description, searching for the most relevant keywords to select the appropriate category from the list. It feels like \"Access\" might be the best fit.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket description, honing in on key phrases like \"access card\" and \"new starter.\"  My conclusion is solidifying: \"Access\" is the most precise category. It directly addresses the core need described: granting access through a physical access card. While aspects touch on HR and hardware, the crux is access provisioning, making \"Access\" the indisputable choice.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI'm now fully confident in \"Access\" as the correct category. The ticket's core is the access card for the new employee. \"HR Support\" is somewhat relevant, but the request focuses on IT provisioning.  \"Hardware\" is a component, but the goal is access. Other categories are irrelevant. The enabling of physical access through the access card is the heart of this ticket. Therefore, \"Access\" is the most precise categorization, and I've selected it.\n\n\n"
