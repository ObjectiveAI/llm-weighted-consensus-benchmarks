I'm focusing on keywords and phrases that will help me accurately classify it. At this point, I see terms like \"new starter\" and \"intern,\" which suggests a possible HR-related issue. My goal is to carefully consider all of the possible categories before I make a final selection.\n\n\n**Identifying the Primary Driver**\n\nI've homed in on the core of the issue. The new information about the employee's status change from intern to \"test engineer grade\" is critical.  While access is definitely needed, the HR change dictates the IT response. I'm leaning toward HR Support as the primary category, with access setup as a secondary consideration.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Category**\n\nI'm now fully convinced that HR Support is the most accurate categorization for this ticket. The change in the employee's status from intern to \"test engineer grade\" is the key driver, indicating an HR-related onboarding process. The need for access setup will follow naturally after the HR team updates the relevant systems. I need to make sure that the system can handle updates from the HR system.\n\n\n"
