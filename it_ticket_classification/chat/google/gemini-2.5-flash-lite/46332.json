The user's mention of \"connections problems\" and specific attempts with \"wireless\" and \"cable\" strongly points towards a technical issue. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware,\" but I need to make a final decision.\n\n\n**Defining the Root Cause**\n\nThe user's ticket screams \"Access\" issue. Considering the constant password prompts, connection attempts, and mention of a server, it's pretty clear that's the core of the problem. Hardware might be involved, but as a secondary factor. The primary focus now is ensuring the user can access the intended resource and verifying the user's rights to establish the server connection.\n\n\n**Determining the Ticket Category**\n\nI've narrowed down the ticket's classification. Given the user's struggle to connect to a server and the persistent password prompts, the \"Access\" category seems most fitting. While hardware could be a factor, the core issue is the user's inability to establish a connection. \"Access\" encapsulates this issue, considering the connection and credential-based obstacles. I will update the ticket category accordingly.\n\n\n"
