After analyzing the text, my initial instinct is \"HR Support\". The phrase \"annual leave approver\" seems to strongly suggest a human resources-related issue, and the words \"hi kindly asking\" are consistent with the polite requests typical of such tickets. I'm focusing on whether this is the best fit before I move on to other potential categories.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Keywords**\n\nI've zeroed in on the keywords \"annual leave approver\" and \"change\" within the ticket's text. This reinforces my belief that \"HR Support\" is the most applicable category. My next step is to perform a sanity check to ensure that \"HR Support\" still makes the most sense. I will also make sure that there are no hidden clues which may point towards another category.\n\n\n"
