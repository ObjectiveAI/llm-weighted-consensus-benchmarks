                    "reasoning": "**Refining Categorization Strategy**\n\nI'm now focusing on developing a more robust strategy for ticket categorization. The goal is to accurately select the most relevant category from the available options. The current text snippet emphasizes \"access\" and \"points,\" suggesting a strong leaning towards the \"Access\" category. I am still analyzing the patterns.\n\n\n**Mapping Out Infrastructure Details**\n\nI'm now focusing on mapping out the ticket's core themes. The recurring terms, especially \"map,\" \"points,\" \"layout,\" and \"position,\" strongly suggest a spatial/organizational element. Terms like \"socket\" and \"install\" point toward infrastructure, and the initial mention of \"access points map\" is a strong indicator. I believe the ticket leans toward \"Access,\" but I'm still analyzing to be certain.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Primary Category**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. Analyzing the text, I see repeated references to \"map,\" \"position,\" \"socket,\" and \"install,\" strongly implying a physical infrastructure focus. The phrase \"access points map\" is a key indicator, and although \"Access\" could apply, the context leans more towards network/physical infrastructure, which fits \"Hardware\" well. I'm prioritizing the physical elements present in the text to make a final decision.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"Hardware\" category. Analyzing the text, \"access points\" strongly suggests a network infrastructure focus. The mapping and installation-related terms bolster this connection.  While \"Access\" is a possibility, \"Hardware\" seems more encompassing, particularly with the references to \"socket\" and \"install.\"\n\n\n**Confirming Hardware Category**\n\nI'm now certain the ticket belongs to the \"Hardware\" category. After analyzing the provided text, the core of the issue involves planning and installing network access points, represented as \"access points.\" Keywords like \"socket,\" \"install,\" and \"position\" all strengthen the focus on physical IT infrastructure.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Hardware Category**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. The phrase \"access points map\" and related terms like \"socket\" and \"install\" clearly point toward physical network infrastructure. My focus is on the hardware aspect of these access points. Despite the possibility of \"Access,\" I'm now leaning heavily toward \"Hardware.\"\n\n\n**Determining Primary Ticket Focus**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories. The repeated reference to \"access points,\" combined with \"map,\" \"position,\" and \"install,\" strongly indicates a focus on either network infrastructure or planning. Given the need for a precise category, I'm now leaning toward \"Internal Project\", as the text describes plan development and sharing, which fits a project context well.\n\n\n**Analyzing Project Context**\n\nI'm now determining whether \"Internal Project\" best describes the ticket. After analyzing the provided details, the ticket appears to describe elements of a broader project. Terms like \"share\", \"upload\", \"disciplines\", and \"lead\" suggest it's part of a larger, ongoing internal effort, so I will select \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Project Context**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories. The repeated reference to \"access points,\" combined with \"map,\" \"position,\" and \"install,\" strongly indicates a focus on either network infrastructure or planning. Given the need for a precise category, I'm now leaning toward \"Internal Project\", as the text describes plan development and sharing, which fits a project context well.\n\n\n**Determining Project Scope**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"Internal Project\" category. Based on the provided text, the ticket describes a plan to share and manage documentation, which falls under project management. Keywords like \"disciplines,\" \"lead,\" and \"share\" indicate a collaborative effort related to deploying network infrastructure.\n\n\n**Analyzing Project Context**\n\nI'm now determining whether \"Internal Project\" best describes the ticket. After analyzing the provided details, the ticket appears to describe elements of a broader project. Terms like \"share\", \"upload\", \"disciplines\", and \"lead\" suggest it's part of a larger, ongoing internal effort, so I will select \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Project Scope**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"Internal Project\" category. The text, specifically the phrases about sharing and planning, indicates this is part of a larger project, making \"Internal Project\" a better fit than \"Hardware\" at this point.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Project Goal**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. The provided text indicates this ticket's primary focus is not the physical hardware, but the overarching project. Specifically, this ticket pertains to the internal project to map and install these access points, which would include the initial \"access points map\" request.\n\n\n**Reviewing Project Categorization**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories. The repeated reference to \"access points,\" combined with \"map,\" \"position,\" and \"install,\" strongly indicates a focus on either network infrastructure or planning. Given the need for a precise category, I'm now leaning toward \"Internal Project\", as the text describes plan development and sharing, which fits a project context well.\n\n\n**Analyzing Project Communication Flow**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"Internal Project\" category. I'm focusing on \"disciplines\", \"lead\", and the project-related workflow. These suggest more than just hardware, pointing to project communications and shared planning.\n\n\n"
