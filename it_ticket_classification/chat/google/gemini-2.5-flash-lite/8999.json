While hardware returns are mentioned, the core driver for this ticket clearly points towards \"HR Support\" as the most fitting category for resolution.\n\n**Identifying Primary Category Focus**\n\nMy analysis continues, zeroing in on the \"leaver today\" and \"logged him leaver\" keywords. These strongly indicate that the core of this ticket lies within \"HR Support,\" despite the mention of hardware returns.\n\n**Categorizing Leaver Ticket**\n\nI've refined my categorization of the IT ticket. The keywords \"leaver today\" and \"logged him leaver\" remain the strongest indicators, firmly placing the primary focus on \"HR Support.\" The returned hardware is a secondary detail within this overarching HR-driven process.\n\n**Categorizing Employee Departure**\n\nMy focus is on identifying the primary driver for this IT ticket. The phrases \"leaver today\" and \"logged him leaver\" are strong indicators that the core of this request relates to an employee's departure, thus pointing towards \"HR Support\" as the most fitting category.\n\n"
