The phrase \"shared folder\" is the core concern, suggesting either \"Access\" or \"Storage.\" While \"Internal Project\" is also in the mix due to the \"joins project\" text, the access component seems more central. My current thinking leans towards \"Access\" as the primary category, with \"Storage\" as a possible secondary consideration if the need is related to data capacity or management. The informal language doesn't seem to offer strong clues for any category beyond the request for access.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nMy focus is firmly on \"Access,\" as the central request centers on gaining access to a shared folder. The \"Internal Project\" connection persists, but the direct action sought is access. \"Storage\" feels secondary, potentially relevant if the request involves storage capacity or management, but the language's emphasis is on joining and accessing. Considering the user's apparent need for entry into a resource, \"Access\" best captures their core intent.\n\n\n"
