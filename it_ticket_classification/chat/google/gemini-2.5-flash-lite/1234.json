After analyzing the text, I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" or \"Purchase,\" but the \"add assets\" phrasing is giving me pause. I'm carefully weighing the context to choose the most precise category.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket Type**\n\nI'm now prioritizing \"Hardware\" as the primary category, with \"Purchase\" as a secondary possibility. The user's request, involving a recent batch of assets and updating asset details (e.g., \"wired addresses\"), leans strongly towards hardware management.  \"Purchase\" could be inferred but isn't the central action.\n\n\n**Determining the Right Category**\n\nI've determined that the user's focus is adding to existing assets, and based on analysis, \"Hardware\" is the most fitting category. This ticket clearly centers on managing assets, which, in the context provided, primarily implies hardware. Keywords like \"add assets\" and \"wired addresses\" support this categorization. While \"Purchase\" was considered, the emphasis is on the addition rather than the acquisition of the assets, so \"Hardware\" remains the best fit.\n\n\n"
