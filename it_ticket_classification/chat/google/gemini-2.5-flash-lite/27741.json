I've taken a first pass, considering the keywords provided. \"Access\" seems like the most fitting category based on the request to grant user access. I'm now cross-referencing this initial assessment with the complete schema to ensure it's the most accurate classification.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket Type**\n\nI've examined the ticket description, identifying \"Access\" as the most suitable category. The request centers on granting access to \"sonar\" for new users, which aligns well. I've ruled out other categories like \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" because they don't apply. While \"Internal Project\" could be relevant, the core issue is the need for *access*. Therefore, I'm confident in \"Access\" as the primary classification.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's keywords and the defined schema, culminating in \"Access\" as the definitive classification. The request for \"access to sonar\" and adding users unequivocally aligns with this category. I've exhaustively compared it against all other options, like \"Internal Project\", but the *core need* is access, making \"Access\" the precise fit. I'm now certain this accurately reflects the nature of the request.\n\n\n"
