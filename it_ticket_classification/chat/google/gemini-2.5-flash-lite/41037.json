My initial thought is that \"files cannot be accessed\" on a single computer suggests a potential hardware or access issue. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" for this one. I'm weighing whether it could also fall under \"Hardware\" due to the specific issue with a single computer.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Issues**\n\nI've been analyzing the text further, focusing on the repeated phrases like \"manager access\" and \"visitor cards\". The emphasis on layouts, libraries, and shared resources strongly points towards an access-related problem. I'm now leaning heavily towards \"Access\" as the primary category for this ticket. The phrases about modified actions and default visitor cards reinforce my current assessment.\n\n\n**Clarifying Access Concerns**\n\nI'm now fully convinced that \"Access\" is the most appropriate category. The recurring themes of \"manager access,\" \"visitor cards,\" shared resources, and the inability to access files on a single computer all strongly point to permission and access control issues. The repeated mention of layouts, libraries, and facilities reinforces this conclusion. I feel quite confident in this categorization.\n\n\n"
