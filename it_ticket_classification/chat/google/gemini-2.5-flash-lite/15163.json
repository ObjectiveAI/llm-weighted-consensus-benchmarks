However, I'm carefully reviewing the wording to ensure it excludes any ambiguities and any potential overlap with the other available categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative Rights.\"\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Scope**\n\nI've refined my approach to ticket categorization. Initial strong indicators like \"new purchase,\" \"purchase PO,\" and \"purchased\" have cemented \"Purchase\" as the primary category. Now I'm carefully analyzing the text for phrases that might contradict or overlap with other categories. This includes scrutinizing \"order received\" and \"license\" to ensure they are strictly purchase-related.\n\n\n"
