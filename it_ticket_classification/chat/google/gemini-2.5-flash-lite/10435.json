The provided text is quite brief and lacks specific keywords, but it mentions a \"new starter\" and a \"joining\" form. My initial thought is to consider the \"HR Support\" category, as it seems relevant to onboarding. However, I am still weighing the other options to ensure a definitive classification. \n\n\n**Evaluating Initial Classification**\n\nI've considered the provided ticket text and the available categories. \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" are the leading contenders. The presence of \"starter form\" indicates an HR process, while access provisioning is a common IT task for new hires. The original classification leaned towards HR, but now I think I should review if  access provisioning is the primary need.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and the competing categories. While access provisioning is undoubtedly a component, the emphasis on the \"starter form\" and \"new starter\" strongly indicates an HR-driven request. I'm now certain that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate classification. This category best captures the initiation of the onboarding process, which then likely requires subsequent IT actions like access.\n\n\n"
