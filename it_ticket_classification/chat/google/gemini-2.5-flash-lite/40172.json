My initial assessment leans towards an issue related to database modifications or updates. I'm focusing on the keywords \"changes\" and \"oracle\" to arrive at the most precise categorization, considering the limited information given. I'll need to rule out irrelevant categories.\n\n\n**Assessing Access Requirements**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Access\" as the most suitable category. The ticket describes modifications to an approval flow (\"approval flow anymore\") and alterations to who can approve (\"adjust by select only card approver\"). The keyword \"oracle\" could possibly refer to a system, but the focus remains on controlling who can do what. I'm leaning toward selecting the 'Access' category.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Focus**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on the core request: altering an approval flow and specifying approvers. The keyword \"oracle\" initially gave me pause, but upon reevaluation, it appears to refer to the system within which the approval process is managed. I'm now leaning more firmly towards \"Access\" because it precisely describes the requested modification to who has the authority to approve something within the approval flow. I've eliminated less-relevant options, solidifying my conclusion.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nHaving analyzed the ticket text, I've confirmed my initial assessment. The ticket's core revolves around modifying the approval workflow, specifically dictating which individuals can approve \"cards\". I considered \"administrative rights\" but \"Access\" is more apt as it is about altering who has permission to take action within the system. The \"oracle\" reference is not important in categorization.\n\n\n"
