The text mentions \"audit secure spaces\" and \"secure spaces\", which leans towards a security-related category.  I'm weighing whether it fits best under \"Access\" or potentially \"Administrative rights\" if the update pertains to permissions.  I will now move to determine the best option based on the text.\n\n\n**Defining Scope Further**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the best category for this ticket. While \"Access\" seemed plausible initially, the emphasis on \"template updates,\" \"layouts,\" and \"forms\" points more strongly towards documentation of secure spaces rather than access control per se. I'm leaning towards \"Administrative Rights,\" as updating templates could involve modifying permissions or access definitions. However, \"Miscellaneous\" might also be a fit if the primary concern isn't strictly permission-related.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best fit. While \"Access\" was a contender, the central themes of documentation and auditing are emerging. Keywords like \"templates,\" \"layouts,\" and \"disciplines\" suggest an internal project rather than direct access control. I considered \"Administrative Rights\" because templates could touch on permissions, but the ticket's emphasis is broader. After careful review, I believe \"Internal Project\" best captures the nature of this task.\n\n\n"
