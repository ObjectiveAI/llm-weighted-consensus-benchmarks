I've narrowed it down to analyzing the ticket text, which pertains to a \"zone award nomination.\" The keywords point towards what category it may be. I'm carefully considering how to most effectively use these terms to make a final decision, given the categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Nomination**\n\nMy current assessment solidifies the \"HR Support\" designation. The ticket's content, focusing on an employee's performance and a nomination process, aligns directly with HR functions. The keywords and phrases point definitively towards HR-related activities, making \"HR Support\" the most accurate and logical categorization choice.\n\n\n"
