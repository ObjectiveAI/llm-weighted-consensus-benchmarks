The user keeps getting locked out and can't access their account. The other categories don't make much sense. I've ruled out Hardware, HR, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.  'Access' best encompasses the problem. I'm ready to mark the ticket as classified.\n\n\n"
