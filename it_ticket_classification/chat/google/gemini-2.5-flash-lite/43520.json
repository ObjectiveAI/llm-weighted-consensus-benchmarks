                    "reasoning": "**Identifying the Core Issue**\n\nI'm currently focused on the challenge of accurately categorizing this IT ticket. The text \"referral upload resume error safari os hello working\" presents a few keywords, and I'm carefully analyzing each one to determine the most relevant category from the options: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\". I'm leaning toward eliminating \"hello\" and \"working\" for now as potentially irrelevant, but keeping in mind the rest of the text.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket's Core**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket. After considering \"HR Support\" due to the resume aspect, I've eliminated it because the root problem is technical: an upload error. \"Access\" is not relevant, and \"Storage\" is off-target. While \"Miscellaneous\" is a possibility, I feel the focus on a browser-specific upload issue could fit under \"Internal Project\" if it's a known system. My current focus is to see if I can definitively connect the issue to an internal system for upload.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Primary Function**\n\nMy thinking has evolved. After more careful consideration, I've discarded the \"HR Support\" categorization. While the ticket involves a resume, the core problem is a *technical* malfunction: a file upload failing in Safari. The *function* being affected is an HR-related upload, but that is secondary to the technical error. My assessment now leans more toward a category addressing application or browser issues. The current options don't fully cover it, but \"Miscellaneous\" or potentially \"Internal Project\" if it's a known system bug are more appropriate now.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Focus**\n\nI've re-evaluated the categorization. The analysis now centers on the technical error preventing a user from completing an HR-related task. The \"HR Support\" category, while initially appealing due to the context of uploading a resume, is less fitting because the issue is a technical malfunction. After reviewing all potential classifications, I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" as the most appropriate.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Classification**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the core categorization. While initially leaning toward \"HR Support,\" I've since reconsidered. The focus has shifted; it's a *technical* hurdle, albeit one hindering an HR-related task. The \"upload resume error\" is the crucial element. \"HR Support\" still feels relevant, but perhaps only if it is the only category that applies to the use case.\n\n\n**Determining Primary Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted. While \"HR Support\" still applies due to the resume context, the root cause is a technical malfunction in Safari, which hinders the intended HR-related action. I'm now leaning more towards \"Miscellaneous\" due to the specific technical error, but remain open to other categories. My primary concern is providing the best possible classification, not an exact fit.\n\n\n"
