So far, \"Purchase\" seems like a strong contender based on the mention of \"equipment\" and the need for forms. However, the reference to a \"new starter\" and an \"administration officer\" also suggests a possible link to HR or Access. I need to weigh the evidence further before I commit to a final classification. I'm leaning toward purchase as primary with HR as secondary.\n\n\n**Analyzing Onboarding Needs**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"new starter\" aspect and the equipment request. While the ticket text mentions hardware, I'm now leaning more towards HR Support as the primary category, with Hardware being a secondary. The onboarding process feels like the core issue here. The need for the administration officer's involvement further solidifies this shift. The form fill is very likely connected to the onboarding of the new starter.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Onboarding**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket and now firmly believe \"HR Support\" is the best fit. While \"equipment\" is mentioned, the core context is the new employee's setup. The ticket's purpose is related to onboarding, and the \"equipment\" is a component of that process initiated by the administration officer. HR Support encompasses the whole issue better than Hardware.\n\n\n"
