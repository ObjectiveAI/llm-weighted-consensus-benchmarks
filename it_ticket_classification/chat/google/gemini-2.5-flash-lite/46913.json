Initial assessment points toward a potential \"Storage\" issue, but I'm being thorough, looking for subtle clues that might shift the categorization. Currently, I'm examining how \"Oracle\" might fit, could be storage, or a need for administrative rights.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nNow that I've analyzed the ticket text focusing on the approvals and requisition, I'm confident in categorizing it as \"Purchase\". The keywords align closely with procurement activities. Though other options exist, \"Purchase\" represents the best fit within the provided schema, as the issue describes the approval of requisitions.\n\n\n"
