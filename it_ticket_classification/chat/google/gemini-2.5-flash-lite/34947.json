Based on the explicit mention of \"access,\" \"retain access,\" and related terms, I'm confirming it falls under the \"Access\" category.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Subject**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text, and the recurring themes of \"access,\" \"retain access,\" and \"password\" strongly indicate that this falls squarely into the \"Access\" category.\n\n"
