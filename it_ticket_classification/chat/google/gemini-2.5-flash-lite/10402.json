                    "reasoning": "**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI'm currently focused on categorizing the IT ticket based on the given text. My recent progress involves carefully reviewing the ticket details and comparing them with the available category options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I'm aiming for the most precise match.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories. The focus is on a ServiceNow change request related to client button functionality and notification recipients. \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights\" are not relevant. This rules out all the options except \"Miscellaneous.\" However, considering the focus on ServiceNow processes, perhaps this is not the most appropriate category.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choices**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the initial category options, given the detailed ticket description. My thinking has shifted from simply matching keywords. I am now leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" being a default choice for this ticket, as it doesn't clearly fit any other category. But, thinking strategically, perhaps there's a more appropriate option. I am currently considering if there is more appropriate information for my choice.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Best Fit**\n\nI've been going through the provided text, and I'm narrowing down my choices. While \"Miscellaneous\" remains a possibility, the text \"update notification recipients on approvals for changes\" keeps drawing my attention. This suggests a change to the way notifications are handled within ServiceNow. Although an \"Internal Project\" is plausible, I'm now leaning more towards \"Miscellaneous.\" The language suggests this is a routine adjustment or a system configuration change.\n\n\n**Deciding on the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket, and it's getting clearer.  While \"Miscellaneous\" remains a potential fallback, the emphasis on updating notification recipients within ServiceNow, along with the \"change required summary\" and \"planned shared infrastructure\" aspects, leans me toward \"Internal Project.\" This suggests an organized effort within the IT system. The ticket's reference to 'client button' behaviour adds to this consideration as an internal systems functional change.\n\n\n**Selecting the Final Category**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the final selection. While \"Internal Project\" is still tempting given the described \"change\" within the system, the text leans towards a routine task: updating notification recipients and client button behavior. The \"change required summary\" and \"planned shared infrastructure\" aspects don't strongly suggest a full-blown project. I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous,\" but with a slight hesitation. This particular ticket seems to involve a configuration adjustment more than an overhaul.\n\n**Choosing the Final Option**\n\nI'm now choosing between \"Miscellaneous\" and \"Internal Project.\" Given the focus on altering ServiceNow's internal notification processes and associated infrastructure, \"Internal Project\" best reflects the planned, system-level change, rather than a one-off adjustment. \"Miscellaneous\" remains a fallback if I cannot find a good justification, and here the wording implies more of an overhaul.\n\n\n**Selecting the Best Category**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the final selection. After a thorough review of the text, and considering the available categories, I've decided this is best categorized as an \"Internal Project.\" The core activity is updating ServiceNow notification processes, which suggests a planned activity within the IT system. While \"Miscellaneous\" was considered, the more structured nature of the described change leans me towards \"Internal Project,\" focusing on the internal modifications to the software.\n\n"
