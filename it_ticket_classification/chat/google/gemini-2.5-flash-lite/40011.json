Now I'm actively considering whether this falls under \"Access\", or possibly even \"Internal Project\" depending on the context. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" but need more info.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket description, focusing on keywords like \"unable to submit oracle\" and \"unlock submit.\" The issue seems firmly rooted in access, specifically preventing a user from completing a critical task. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" being the best fit, but I'll consider alternative interpretations. The phrase \"unable submit for week\" reinforces that this is a persistent access issue.\n\n\n**Determining Best Fit**\n\nMy analysis is complete! After examining the ticket description (\"unable to submit oracle,\" \"unlock submit,\" etc.) and considering available categories (\"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" etc.), I've concluded \"Access\" is the most accurate. The user's inability to submit, indicating a block or permission issue within \"oracle,\" solidifies my decision.\n\n\n"
