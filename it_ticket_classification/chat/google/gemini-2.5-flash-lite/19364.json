I'm carefully analyzing the other keywords to ensure this is the best fit, while considering any less obvious options.\n\n\n**Evaluating Access & HR**\n\nI'm now carefully weighing the nuances between \"HR Support\" and \"Access.\" The \"leavers card\" clearly points toward access control changes, which is a key aspect. However, the root event, an employee departure, is inherently an HR process. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the primary category because it encompasses the broader context.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nNow I'm further refining my assessment, wrestling with whether \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" is the most precise categorization. The \"leavers card\" clearly demands an access change, which makes \"Access\" tempting. However, the ticket's root is the employee's departure\u2014an HR event\u2014which IT is supporting. My analysis centers around whether the request is better viewed as an HR-driven process the IT team assists with, or a direct access management task.\n\n\n**Solidifying the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted toward definitively justifying \"HR Support\" as the primary category for this ticket. The initial ambiguity has been resolved by focusing on the phrase \"leavers card to be processed,\" which emphasizes the HR-driven nature of this task. I'm now certain this is a process the IT department supports rather than owns.\n\n\n"
