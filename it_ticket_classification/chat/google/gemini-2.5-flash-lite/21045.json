The provided text is sparse, but the terms \"access cards\" and the mention of Belgrade strongly suggest an access-related issue. My leading thought is that this is likely an Access-related ticket. I am leaning toward \"Access\" being the best fit, I'll confirm this soon.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Details**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and the keywords are definitely pointing toward an access-related issue. The focus on access cards, locations, assigning teams, and controlling usage are all strong indicators. The \"order cards\" detail leans it toward access-related, not purchase. I'm focusing in and ready to confirm that \"Access\" is the best fit.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've been drilling down on the essential problem. Based on the keyword analysis, it's clear the ticket revolves around access cards. This includes understanding their usage, who has them, and defining controls. I believe \"Access\" is the most apt category, as it captures the core function.\n\n\n"
