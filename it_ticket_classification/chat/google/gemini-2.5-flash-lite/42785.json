Considering the options, \"Access\" seems most relevant, since the user needs to gain access to their account. I'll need to confirm this selection before finalizing the categorization.\n\n\n**Defining the Issue's Scope**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the category for the IT ticket. After considering each option (\"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" etc.), \"Access\" stands out. The user's inability to log in due to a locked account is the primary issue. It's impacting their daily work, making \"Access\" the most relevant. I feel confident this is the best fit.\n\n\n"
