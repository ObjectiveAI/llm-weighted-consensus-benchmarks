My goal is to accurately assign it to one of these classifications.\n\n**Identifying HR-Related Themes**\n\nI'm sifting through the ticket details, noticing a strong pattern around employee status updates, reporting on leave, and record modifications. This strongly suggests an HR Support classification is most appropriate, aligning with the keywords like \"maternity,\" \"absence,\" and \"person record.\"\n\n**Refining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm narrowing down the category for this IT ticket, leaning heavily towards \"HR Support.\" The recurring themes of employee status reporting, leave, and personnel record updates, alongside keywords like \"maternity\" and \"absence,\" strongly indicate this classification.\n\n"
