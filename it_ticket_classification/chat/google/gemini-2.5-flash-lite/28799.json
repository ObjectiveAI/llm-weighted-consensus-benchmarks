I'm building a system to map specific keywords and phrases to the pre-defined categories. My goal is to accurately classify the ticket based on this analysis, ensuring a correct \"category\" field in the JSON output. I'm working to fine-tune the keyword mapping to prevent ambiguity and improve overall classification accuracy.\n\n\n**Assessing Account Access Needs**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and determined the primary focus is account management. My current thought is to categorize the ticket as \"Access\". The phrases about quarantine, release, and account creation align best with this category, as they relate to controlling and granting access to resources.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've reviewed the original ticket text and the available categories again. The core themes of account creation, quarantine management, and alias handling all point decisively toward \"Access\". This choice seems most appropriate, given the context of user access and security. My confidence is high that \"Access\" is the most accurate classification.\n\n\n"
