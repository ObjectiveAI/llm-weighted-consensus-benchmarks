My initial assessment points towards a \"mailbox capacity increase\" request, given the repeated mentions of a full or nearly full mailbox. I'm also considering the urgency implied by the user's inability to delete emails and the emphasis on important messages.\n\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI've just finished categorizing the IT ticket. After analyzing the request for an increase in mailbox capacity due to being nearly full and unable to delete emails, I determined the most relevant category is \"Storage.\" This decision aligns with the ticket's focus on storage space, which is clearly a perfect fit. I explored other options, but none were as directly applicable.\n\n\n"
