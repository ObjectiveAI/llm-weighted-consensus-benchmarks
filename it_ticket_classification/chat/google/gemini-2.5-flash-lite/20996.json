My current assessment confirms that \"HR Support\" best reflects the overarching context, as the IT actions are initiated by an HR-driven employee lifecycle event.\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Details**\n\nI'm reviewing the IT ticket's content, specifically keywords like \"maternity leaver,\" \"access card,\" and \"return devices.\" My focus is on accurately classifying this request, ensuring the chosen category reflects the overarching context of employee lifecycle management.\n\n"
