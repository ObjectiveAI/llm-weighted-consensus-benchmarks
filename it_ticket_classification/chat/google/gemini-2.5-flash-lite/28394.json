Based on terms like \"port,\" \"connect,\" and a direct request for a \"cable,\" I'm leaning towards classifying this under \"Hardware\" as the most accurate fit from the available options.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI've reviewed the provided IT ticket description and the available categories. My current focus is on pinpointing the most precise classification. The mention of \"port,\" \"connect,\" and a direct request for a \"cable\" strongly suggests the ticket pertains to physical IT equipment.\n\n**Classifying IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket's mention of \"port,\" \"connect,\" and a request for a \"cable\" points me towards \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate classification from the given options. This seems to be the most direct and specific fit for the reported issue.\n\n"
