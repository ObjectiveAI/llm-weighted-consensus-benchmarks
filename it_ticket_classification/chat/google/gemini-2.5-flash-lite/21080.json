Currently, I'm focusing on identifying key terms to determine the most relevant category. So far, the terms \"new starter\" and \"administration officer\" stand out, potentially pointing towards \"HR Support\" or \"Access\". I'm still weighing these possibilities against the other options, like \"Miscellaneous\", because the available details remain sparse.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choices**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. The phrase \"new starter\" and the mention of an \"administration officer\" remain key. I now lean heavily towards \"HR Support\" or \"Access\" as the most likely categories. While \"Hardware\" is possible, the text doesn't explicitly confirm a hardware request. The date and location context strengthens the onboarding interpretation, supporting either HR or Access requirements. I'm focusing now on distinguishing between those two options.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Decision**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, now zeroing in on \"new starter.\"  \"HR Support\" still feels strongest, as it encompasses the full onboarding process. While \"Access\" is crucial, it's often a *part* of the broader HR-led onboarding for new hires. The ticket's text doesn't specifically indicate a *single* access request, but the general need for a new starter's setup. Thus, selecting \"HR Support\" reflects the overall context.\n\n\n"
