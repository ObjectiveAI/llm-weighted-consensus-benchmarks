Analyzing the phrase \"huron ontario phones not working\" led me to consider \"Hardware\" as a strong contender. However, I'm also exploring other possibilities like \"Access\" or even \"Miscellaneous\", since the root cause is still unclear. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware,\" but I need to make sure the issue isn't related to internal system access.\n\n\n**Defining the Problem**\n\nI've examined the phrase \"huron ontario phones not working\" in the IT ticket, and I think I've figured out the best category. The fact that the ticket consistently refers to \"phones\" and their malfunction pushes me toward \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate classification. While the ticket includes some extra details about Friday, my main focus is on the hardware aspect. I'm now certain \"Hardware\" is the correct classification.\n\n\n"
