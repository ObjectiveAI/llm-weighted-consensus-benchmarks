Considering the ticket involves moving physical equipment (a conference room system), I'm leaning toward \"Hardware.\" However, I'm also briefly considering \"Miscellaneous,\" though the primary focus seems to be the hardware move. I'll need to confirm that my interpretation is correct.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Category**\n\nI've determined that \"Hardware\" is the most accurate category for the IT ticket. After careful assessment of the other available options (HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights), it became clear that none of them directly address the physical relocation of equipment. Moving a conference room system inherently involves hardware, making \"Hardware\" the most precise and relevant classification. \n\n\n"
