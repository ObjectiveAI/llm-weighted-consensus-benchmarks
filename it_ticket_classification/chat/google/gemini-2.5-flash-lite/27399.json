My focus is on identifying recurring keywords like \"glasgow liverpool kick offs,\" \"folder access request,\" and \"folder storage\" to determine the most appropriate classification.\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm narrowing down the classification for the IT ticket. After reviewing the keywords, I'm prioritizing \"Access\" as the primary category due to the explicit \"folder access request\" and implied needs for sharing links, scripts, and notes. I'm also considering how \"Storage\" and elements of \"Internal Project\" support this core access request.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI've refined my analysis and determined the most fitting category. Given the explicit mention of \"folder access request\" and the implied need for shared resources, \"Access\" is the primary classification. While \"Storage\" and \"Internal Project\" are present, the core actionable request revolves around gaining entry.\n\n"
