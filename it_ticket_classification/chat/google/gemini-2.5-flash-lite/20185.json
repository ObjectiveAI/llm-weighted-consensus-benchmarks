While initially focusing on meeting space removal, I'm now prioritizing the clear mentions of \"equipment,\" \"cables,\" and \"phones.\" This suggests a stronger alignment with the \"Hardware\" category, though I'm also considering the \"Purchase\" aspect for ordering new equipment.\n\n**Identifying Core Request**\n\nI'm focusing on pinpointing the central IT need within this ticket. The mention of \"equipment,\" \"cables,\" and \"phones\" strongly suggests a hardware-related issue, potentially including a request to \"order equipment.\"\n\n**Updating Hardware Focus**\n\nI'm shifting my focus to the clear requests for \"equipment,\" \"cables,\" and \"phones.\" This indicates a strong leaning towards the \"Hardware\" category, though I'm also noting the mention of \"order equipment\" which could imply a \"Purchase\" element.\n\n**Identifying Core Request**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket to pinpoint the primary IT need. The repeated mentions of \"equipment,\" \"cables,\" and \"phones\" strongly indicate a focus on hardware, with a potential undertone of requesting new equipment.\n\n**Focusing on Hardware Needs**\n\nI'm currently prioritizing the identification of core IT requests within the ticket.
