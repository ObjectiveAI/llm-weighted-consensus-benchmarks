I need to select the most appropriate category from the options provided. It seems related to employee time tracking or payroll. I will consider the available choices to pick the best fit.\n\n\n**Determining the Ticket Type**\n\nI've determined the ticket's nature. After careful analysis of the provided text, including mentions of \"direct reports,\" \"weekly basis,\" and \"absences,\" it's evident that the core issue revolves around employee data and related processes. This led me to conclude that \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate categorization.\n\n\n"
