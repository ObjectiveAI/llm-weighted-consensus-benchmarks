The phrases \"leaver form,\" \"leaver,\" and \"leaving\" strongly suggest an HR-related issue rather than any of the other categories. This seems like a clear sign. I'm nearly certain of my choice.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've been meticulously sifting through the ticket details and the provided categories. While \"Access\" and \"Hardware\" have a potential link, the overwhelming evidence points towards \"HR Support.\" The presence of \"leaver form\" and the offboarding workflow indicate this is a key focus. I am now certain.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI have carefully re-evaluated the ticket text, focusing on the keywords that reveal its true nature. \"Leaver\" is undoubtedly the central theme. The various mentions related to form filling, account deactivation, and access rights all point toward a clear HR-driven workflow. \"HR Support\" has emerged as the most fitting category, encapsulating the entire process.\n\n\n"
