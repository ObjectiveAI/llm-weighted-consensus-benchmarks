So far, the input is limited to \"friday pm hi\", which isn't giving me much to work with. I need more information to make a decision, but I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" at this stage due to the lack of context.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Details**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the ticket categorization based on new text inputs. Initial ambiguity is fading as the data grows. \"friday pm hi rest monitor has arrived\" leans toward Hardware, but \"purchase made budget item listed under\" and \"perform purchase order\" solidify \"Purchase\" as the primary category. The task now involves mapping more varied input patterns to the defined categories.\n\n\n**Revising Ticket Classification**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text examples to refine the ticket categorization. The recent focus is on disambiguating similar-sounding requests. For instance, while \"monitor arrival\" suggests hardware, the broader context of \"purchase made\" firmly places it in the \"Purchase\" category. The presence of terms like \"purchase order\" and \"budget item\" further solidifies this classification. I'm prioritizing the most relevant category based on explicit keywords and actions.\n\n\n"
