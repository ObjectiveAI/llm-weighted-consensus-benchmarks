                    "reasoning": "**Analyzing Ticket Text**\n\nI'm currently focused on the ticket's text: \"install new cloud build status notifier install build status notifier hi dear ask installed build status notifier going.\" I'm identifying key terms like \"install,\" \"build,\" and \"notifier\" to determine the most relevant category. My initial assessment leans towards \"Internal Project\" due to the technical nature of the request. I am also considering \"Miscellaneous\" due to the vagueness.\n\n\n**Rethinking Ticket Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted to re-evaluating the initial \"Miscellaneous\" categorization. The repeated use of \"install\" and \"notifier\" suggests a more active process than a simple request. I'm now leaning towards \"Internal Project\" due to the specific tool mentioned and the implicit project-related configuration. The emphasis on \"cloud\" adds another layer of complexity that leans towards an Internal Project use case. I've eliminated \"Purchase\" and \"Access\" as the central focus is on setup, not acquisition or access per se.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Choices**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. Thinking about the 'build status notifier', my instinct is that it's a piece of internal software, but the ticket is vague.  I've considered all the options, but \"Internal Project\" is the frontrunner, assuming it's related to some development effort, while \"Miscellaneous\" remains a fallback. \"Purchase\" and \"Access\" are unlikely; the emphasis is installation, not acquisition or permissions. I'm hesitant to commit without more information, but I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" for now.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Install**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the nuances of \"build status notifier.\" The ticket's focus seems to be installation, not purchase or administrative access directly. I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project,\" given the tool's likely use in a development workflow, but a lack of specific project context leaves \"Miscellaneous\" as a viable alternative. My thoughts are still evolving, considering the installation's inherent technical nature.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Internal Project\" categorization. The ticket clearly describes installing a \"build status notifier,\" a tool commonly linked to internal development workflows. While \"Miscellaneous\" remains a valid option for generic requests, the software-specific focus suggests it's project-related. I believe, without further context, \"Internal Project\" best represents the setup of internal tooling. My thought process is now complete.\n\n\n**Confirming Final Classification**\n\nMy thinking has led me to the conclusion that \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. While \"Miscellaneous\" is a safe catch-all, the specific mention of \"build status notifier\" points towards a tool integral to development workflows, which are often classified as \"Internal Project\" support. The focus on installation, rather than general access or purchase, further supports this classification.\n\n\n**Deciding the Final Classification**\n\nI've finally settled on \"Internal Project.\" The \"build status notifier\" is crucial here, typically implying a tool within a development workflow. While the ticket is vague, the specificity leans towards supporting an internal project's development or build infrastructure. \"Miscellaneous\" remains a secondary option, but the context points strongly towards the internal project use case. My assessment is complete now.\n\n\n"
