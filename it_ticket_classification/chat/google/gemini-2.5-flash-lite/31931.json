My focus is on the keywords \"leavers,\" \"maternity leaves,\" and \"leave.\" These terms strongly suggest an HR-related issue. Based on this, I'm leaning toward the \"HR Support\" category, but I need to ensure there are no other clues that could lead to other categories before finalizing.\n\n\n**Narrowing the HR Focus**\n\nNow, I'm focusing on the employee leave types mentioned, particularly the \"annual leave\" detail. This further reinforces my initial assessment that this ticket is firmly within the domain of \"HR Support.\" I'm confident in excluding other categories such as \"Hardware\" or \"Access\" given the nature of the keywords and the context, so I'm finalizing my choice.\n\n\n"
