It's proving tricky due to the brevity and lack of context, but I'm considering words like \"supplier\" and \"contract\" to guide the classification.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI'm now diving deeper into the ticket description, identifying key phrases such as \"supplier contract approval,\" \"allocation of approvers,\" and \"creation of additional approver groups.\" It's becoming clearer that this ticket focuses on a new process implementation regarding supplier contracts, going beyond a simple change and touching on organizational workflow. The \"Internal Project\" category is looking like the best fit, though I'm still considering potential overlap with \"Administrative rights\" given the mention of user groups and access permissions.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's complex language and key phrases like \"algorithm allocation of approvers\" and \"creation of additional approver groups.\" It's clear this involves fundamental changes to how access rights are managed for supplier contract approvals. I've concluded that \"Administrative rights\" is the most accurate category, focusing on the system's rules and user permissions for approval processes, which are being redefined.\n\n\n"
