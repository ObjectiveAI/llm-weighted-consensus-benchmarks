I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" initially, yet the lack of context leaves room for uncertainty.\n\n\n**Categorizing the New Ticket**\n\nI've been honing in on the crucial keywords within the ticket text. \"New starter\" and \"joining\" are definitive indicators pointing towards HR-related onboarding. Though access setup could be involved, the overarching need appears to be HR support for a new employee.  I'm firmly convinced that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate category, as it encompasses the broad needs likely associated with bringing on a new team member. The other categories don't seem like they apply here.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket.  I've thoroughly analyzed the keywords and considered each permitted option: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\".  The ticket text focuses on a \"new starter\" and the process of \"joining\".  While access might be part of it, the most appropriate category is definitely \"HR Support\".  This is due to the new starter onboarding elements in the request, and how HR support includes any tasks for a new starter joining.\n\n\n"
