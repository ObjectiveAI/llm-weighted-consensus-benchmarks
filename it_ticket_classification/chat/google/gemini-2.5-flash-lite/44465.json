After careful consideration, I've narrowed it down to \"Access\" as the most appropriate category, given the user's difficulties with accessing bid documents. This seems to be the central issue and a good starting point for a deeper investigation of the problem.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Needs**\n\nI've been analyzing the access requirements highlighted in the ticket details. The core of the issue clearly concerns access to documents and bid libraries, with user requests, denials, and restrictions all playing a role. Based on the phrases related to access, the correct category is undoubtedly \"Access\", aligning perfectly with the primary problem.\n\n\n"
