The text points heavily towards a software issue, given the mention of \"Excel files\" and their associated \"difficulties.\" Now, I'm focusing on the available categories to determine the best match. This is a bit tricky, but I'm leaning toward selecting the most suitable category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm focused on the \"Miscellaneous\" category as the most suitable fit. The keywords \"excel files working difficulties\" and \"excel files affected\" strongly indicate a software-related problem, but not a specific one that directly fits the other categories. It's not a hardware issue or related to HR, access, storage, purchases, internal projects, or admin rights. \"Miscellaneous\" appears to be the most appropriate general designation for this.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Selection**\n\nMy thinking has shifted slightly. While \"Miscellaneous\" seemed like the default choice initially, I'm now exploring the possibility of other categories. The phrase \"excel files working difficulties\" is the key. While the other categories are unlikely, I'm reassessing if a more specific software-oriented category would be a better fit.  This is a nuanced determination.\n\n\n"
