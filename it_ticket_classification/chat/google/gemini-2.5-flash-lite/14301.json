The key phrase \"test center of excellence\" doesn't immediately suggest a clear category from the list.  I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the closest fit, but the presence of \"forward\" makes me consider \"Miscellaneous\" or potentially \"Access\" if it pertains to permissions within the project. I'll need more context to make a definitive choice.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating the Options**\n\nI'm reconsidering the initial categorization. While \"Internal Project\" seemed plausible, the mention of \"error\" and the need for a \"viewer instance\" are making me lean heavily towards \"Access.\" This now seems like the most likely category, as the user is likely reporting a problem with access rights within the \"test center of excellence\" project. \"Miscellaneous\" remains a possibility, but I believe \"Access\" provides a more direct fit.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've refined my initial analysis. While \"Access\" was a strong contender, the overall context still points towards \"Internal Project.\" The user seems to be encountering an issue within the scope of this project, involving sharing information and potentially encountering errors. I believe \"Internal Project\" best encompasses this scenario, rather than a specific access issue.\n\n\n"
