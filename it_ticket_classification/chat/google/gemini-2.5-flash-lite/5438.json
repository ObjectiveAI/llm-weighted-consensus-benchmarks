The request to \"change name\" and the mention of \"starter\" strongly point towards HR functions, though hardware allocation is also noted. I am leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most fitting primary classification.\n\n**Identifying Correct Category**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket's text. The phrases \"change name\" and \"starter\" strongly indicate a process usually handled by HR, though hardware allocation is also mentioned. I'm focusing on \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate classification for this request.\n\n**Updating Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm refining the classification for the IT ticket.
