I'm still weighing other options, but the access issue seems to be the primary focus.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Focus**\n\nI'm now fully convinced that \"Access\" is the correct categorization. The analysis of phrases like \"unable to access,\" \"access application,\" \"log in application,\" and various other iterations of \"access\" strongly supports this. I've ruled out other categories as they don't seem relevant given this analysis.\n\n\n"
