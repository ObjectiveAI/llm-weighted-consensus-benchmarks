After analyzing the keywords, \"display,\" \"receiver,\" and \"cables,\" I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" as the best fit. I'm carefully weighing whether other categories, like \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access,\" could also apply, but the hardware-related terms seem most prominent.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's core issue: a physical connection problem with a display receiver. Analyzing the keywords like \"display,\" \"receiver,\" and \"cables\" strongly points to \"Hardware\" as the primary category. While \"Purchase\" was initially considered due to the mention of buying a receiver, the central concern is the connection and setup, making \"Hardware\" the most accurate fit.\n```json\n{\n  \"category\": \"Hardware\"\n}\n```\n\n**Confirming the Hardware Issue**\n\nI've determined that \"Hardware\" is the most accurate category for this ticket. The initial analysis of \"display,\" \"receiver,\" and \"cables\" pointed strongly in this direction. Despite considering \"Purchase\" due to the mention of acquiring a receiver, the root problem is the connection and setup of hardware. My focus is on the physical connection issue and not the purchase itself. I'm satisfied \"Hardware\" encapsulates the core concern.\n\n\n"
