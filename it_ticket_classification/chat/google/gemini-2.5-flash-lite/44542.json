I've noted that Outlook access problems fall under that specific category and will flag this ticket as such. I'm building a system to recognize similar phrases efficiently.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Categories**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"Access\" category, which seems most relevant given the details. Specifically, the phrases \"cannot open outlook,\" \"add shared mailbox,\" and \"stopped working\" all suggest a problem with accessing email functionality. While admin rights might be involved, the core issue appears to be access to the application and mailbox. Therefore, \"Access\" best captures the primary concern.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Issues**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the phrases \"cannot open outlook,\" \"add shared mailbox,\" and \"stopped working\" in relation to the predefined categories. The \"Access\" category seems most relevant, encompassing application access and mailbox permissions. The other categories don't quite fit the given phrases, either by lack of direct relevance or by being too generic.\n\n\n"
