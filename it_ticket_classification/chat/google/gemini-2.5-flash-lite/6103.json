                    "reasoning": "**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've been working on refining the ticket categorization logic, focusing on the \"new starter\" and \"kind regards\" phrases. I'm currently leaning towards \"HR Support\" for tickets mentioning \"new starter\" and \"id image\" hints towards \"Access\" for the second. The presence of \"tuesday\" makes me think I'll also need to identify dates and times.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Context**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"new starter\" phrase as a strong indicator of an HR-related task. The \"id image\" wording further points towards access provisioning. Considering the context, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" as the most appropriate categories. I will verify if any date/time clues from \"tuesday\" should influence this.\n\n\n**Deciding On Category Focus**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories, and have decided to focus on identifying whether the ticket is a direct request related to HR processes, or a request for system access related to the onboarding of a \"new starter\". I am leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the primary category, given the strong indication of an HR-related task. The \"id image\" phrase might suggest an 'Access' sub-category, but the primary driver seems to be the new starter onboarding aspect.\n\n\n**Categorizing Onboarding Tickets**\n\nI've been going through the options, considering whether this ticket is directly about an IT function (like \"Access\") or a broader business process (\"HR Support\"). While setting up access is crucial for a new starter, the request itself stems from an HR-related need. The phrase \"new starter\" points strongly toward the HR department's involvement in the onboarding process, making \"HR Support\" a better fit, although both are relevant. I will finalize on HR Support.\n\n\n**Choosing Onboarding's Primary Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the text again, and the \"new starter\" phrase keeps drawing me back to \"HR Support\" as the main category. It's the central context, indicating this ticket is rooted in the onboarding process, even if access provisioning is part of that. While \"Access\" is relevant, \"HR Support\" best reflects the ticket's broader intent. This is the finalized categorization, for now.\n\n\n**Choosing Broadest Context**\n\nI'm gravitating towards \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category for this ticket. The \"new starter\" phrase points strongly to an HR-related onboarding request. Although access provisioning is part of this process, \"HR Support\" encompasses the broader context of onboarding a new employee, which aligns better with the limited information available.\n\n\n**Defining Initial Categorization**\n\nI'm gravitating towards \"HR Support\" for this ticket's primary categorization. Despite the technical aspect of access provisioning, the \"new starter\" phrase firmly places the context within the realm of employee onboarding, which is fundamentally an HR-driven process. The vagueness of the rest of the text emphasizes the core signal.\n\n\n**Determining Initial Context**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"HR Support\" category, as the phrase \"new starter\" repeatedly points towards employee onboarding. It's clear that, despite the technical aspects of access provisioning, the ticket's core context stems from an HR-related process, making \"HR Support\" the most accurate initial categorization.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the \"new starter\" phrase, deciding that it strongly points toward a request rooted in HR's onboarding process, even though access provisioning is part of it. The lack of detailed information tips the scales towards \"HR Support\" as the initial, overarching categorization.\n\n\n"
