My initial assessment leans towards a technical category since it involves a function that should be working. I must now determine if the precise category should be hardware, access, or another technical sub-category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now analyzing the ticket's \"blank screen sharing\" description, considering it's a technical issue likely related to communication software. The possible categories are being examined, with \"Hardware\" and \"Miscellaneous\" as the most likely candidates. Since the description isn't specific about hardware failure, I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" as the better broad fit.\n\n\n**Determining Best Category**\n\nI'm now assessing the \"blank screen sharing\" ticket, focusing on the \"Miscellaneous\" category as a strong contender. While hardware failure is a possibility, the description lacks specifics. I am weighing the fit against the other options: HR, Access, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights, all of which seem clearly inappropriate. The focus on software functionality makes \"Miscellaneous\" the best fit at this juncture.\n\n\n"
