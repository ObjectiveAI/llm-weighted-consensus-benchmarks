Initial assessment suggests it doesn't immediately fit into any of the broader categories. I'm exploring whether the phrase \"not expired\" hints at Access or Storage issues. However, the mention of \"sent\" requires further investigation to ensure I have not failed to recognize a key component of the ticket's nature. More analysis is needed to identify any hidden cues to guide me to the correct category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Type**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the crux of the ticket. It's becoming clearer that the issue isn't hardware or HR-related. The core problem revolves around access to expired forms. Analysis of the text indicates it's less about a general expiration notification and more about an ongoing ability to interact with expired data. This increasingly points towards an Access category, but Storage remains a contender. Further refinement is needed to definitively dismiss Storage. The \"managed submit\" portion may hold a hint, further contextual analysis is needed.\n\n\n**Confirming Ticket Access Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the access issue. The analysis highlights an unexpected continued availability of expired forms. The context clearly revolves around a permissions discrepancy. The mention of \"why were still available despite expired due date\" solidified this as a core access problem. Considering other categories, \"Access\" is the most relevant, with administrative rights possibly being a secondary concern.\n\n\n"
