Right now, I'm leaning towards \"Access\" because of the expired license issue preventing the user from working. Though \"Purchase\" could be relevant, the impact feels more immediate. I'm actively assessing if the \"Internal Project\" tag is better suited, but I'm leaning towards \"Access\" for now. I'm thinking about how an expired license leads to restricted access.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm now thinking the ticket leans strongly towards \"Access,\" given the license issue restricts the user's ability to work. Although \"Purchase\" initially seemed relevant, the \"activate\" language suggests an existing subscription. Focusing on the user's inability to access the tool solidified the \"Access\" choice. \"Administrative rights\" doesn't seem directly relevant, it seems about activating existing permission.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Focus**\n\nI'm solidifying my classification of the IT ticket as \"Access\". The license expiration directly hinders the user's ability to work. Although \"Purchase\" seemed like a possibility initially, the need to *activate* a subscription strongly points to a pre-existing license needing reactivation. The root cause is a lack of access, and I am confident that's the correct category.\n\n\n"
