The details about \"leaver form rule\" and \"access cards\" are leading me towards potential categories. I need to balance this information against the other available types, in the context of the user's intent. My primary focus at this stage is to differentiate between the likely categories.\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Issues**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on classifying the access issues. The \"leaver form rule,\" and \"access cards\" keywords are becoming focal points, but now I'm differentiating between \"Access\" and \"HR Support\". The ticket's content and keywords suggest the most direct fit is access-related.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Management**\n\nMy analysis indicates the ticket focuses on the access process for a departing employee. The keywords \"leaver form rule\" and \"access cards\" solidify this connection. I've considered how HR processes intertwine, but the central action is managing access control. The \"Access\" category stands out as the best fit, despite HR implications. The ticket's phrasing makes access the primary issue.\n\n\n"
