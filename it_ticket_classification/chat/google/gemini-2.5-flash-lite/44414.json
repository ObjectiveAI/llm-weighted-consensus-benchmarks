The phrase \"mailbox quota increase\" indicates a storage issue. While related to email, it doesn't seem directly HR-related, nor a hardware issue. I'll need to confirm that \"mailbox quota increase\" is the only thing the ticket mentions to be sure of the categorization.\n\n\n**Determining the Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text: \"outlook archiving option not present sent friday february re mailbox quota increase  hi thanks lot for your help below request would really appreciate if you can help with assign policy function passed more than hours received your assign policy did appeared tag section should use archive settings folder menu thank you sincerely manager.\" The phrases \"mailbox quota increase\" and \"archive settings\" strongly point to storage and quota concerns. While access to archiving might be involved, the primary issue is the email storage. Therefore, \"Storage\" seems the most appropriate category.\n\n\n**Defining the Issue**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's text and distilled the core issue. It's about an Outlook user experiencing a missing archiving option. Furthermore, the user's mailbox quota is mentioned, and they're also asking about applying a policy for it, all of which suggests they're running up against storage limits. The main problem is not a simple access issue, but how to archive their emails because of storage. This clearly points to a storage-related problem. The categorization of 'Storage' is confirmed.\n\n\n"
