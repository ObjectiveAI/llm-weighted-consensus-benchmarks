My current inclination leans towards \"Access\" or perhaps \"HR Support\" as the most fitting category, considering the implications for user accounts and data management post-employment.\n\n**Handling Leaver Data Procedures**\n\nI'm actively processing the implications of \"warning for data wipe\" and the automated hold post-leaver date. My current focus is on determining the most precise IT ticket category, weighing \"Access\" against \"HR Support\" to best capture the technical management of departing user accounts and their associated data.\n\n**Addressing Employee Departures**\n\nI'm currently prioritizing the IT ticket's core issue: managing data related to employee departures. My analysis suggests that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category, as the ticket directly concerns processes triggered by an employee's official leaver date, including automated data holds and wipes.\n\n**Categorizing Departure Procedures**\n\nI'm currently finalizing the categorization of the IT ticket. Considering the mention of \"warning for data wipe\" in conjunction with \"official leaver date\" and automated holds, I've determined that \"HR Support\" best encapsulates the IT actions supporting employee departure processes.\n\n"
