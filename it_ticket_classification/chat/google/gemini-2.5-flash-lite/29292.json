It seems the user is having trouble with a ServiceNow report's visualization.  My initial assessment leans towards \"Miscellaneous\" due to the broad nature of the issue. However, I need to look closely at the keywords to be completely sure. I will use the keywords provided to determine the correct category.\n\n\n**Assessing Report Issue**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content and the available categories. It appears the core problem relates to a report within ServiceNow. Based on the keywords, I've confirmed that the best fit is \"Miscellaneous,\" as the issue doesn't directly align with the more specific categories. This seems the most logical option due to the report visualization issue. \n\n\n"
