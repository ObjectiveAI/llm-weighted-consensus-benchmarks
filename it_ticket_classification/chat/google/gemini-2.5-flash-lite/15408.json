I'm prioritizing the keywords \"configure\" and \"access\" to best fit the options provided. The options appear to indicate \"Access\" may be most appropriate.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Requirements**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text within the IT tickets. The recurring themes solidify my initial assessment. \"Access\" remains the most fitting category given the emphasis on visitor cards, facility access, configuration, and expiration. While HR might be involved and hardware possibly involved, the core issue is clearly access control. Purchase and storage are irrelevant, and \"miscellaneous\" is too broad.\n\n\n**Determining the Core Issue**\n\nI've carefully examined the recurring themes in the ticket text. Visitor cards, facility access (specifically ground and other floors), configuration/setup, expiration dates, and access restriction are the key components. The issue clearly centers on *who* gets access to *what* areas. While HR might play a role and hardware is likely involved, the fundamental issue is access control. \"Access\" is the obvious fit. The task at hand involves visitor access management and control.\n\n\n"
