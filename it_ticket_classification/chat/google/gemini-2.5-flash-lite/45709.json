The term \"leaver\" is a key indicator, pointing towards an employee offboarding scenario. My current line of thinking leans towards categorizing this under \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access,\" depending on the specific tasks involved in the user offboarding. I will need more info to be sure.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket Category**\n\nI've refined my categorization to lean heavily toward \"Access,\" given the \"ad admin\" and \"leaver\" keywords. While \"HR Support\" remains a possibility if HR is the initiator, the technical nature of AD management suggests \"Access\" is more fitting. I'm focusing on user account deactivation and access revocation as the core task. The time reference is immaterial, and \"glide\" likely refers to a system, not a category driver.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Focus**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Access\" category. The keywords \"leaver\" and \"ad admin\" are the strongest indicators, clearly pointing to user account management. I've eliminated \"HR Support\" as the primary driver, as the technical nature of AD administration suggests a focus on access control. I'm solidifying \"Access\" as the correct categorization.\n\n\n"
