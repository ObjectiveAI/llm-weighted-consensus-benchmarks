It seems like a connectivity problem was temporarily resolved, but assistance is still requested. No clear category stands out from the available options. \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit for now, as it's the most general.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm now considering the \"connect via\" phrase within the ticket text. This crucial detail points toward either network or remote access, though the ambiguity remains. While \"Access\" seems fitting due to potential connectivity issues, the text's overall vagueness still makes \"Miscellaneous\" the safest choice for now. I'm hesitant to commit to a specific access type without further clarification, so I'm erring on the side of caution with the more general category.\n\n\n**Clarifying Ticket Ambiguity**\n\nGiven the ticket text's inherent ambiguity, I've revisited the \"Access\" and \"Miscellaneous\" categories. The phrase \"connect via\" initially suggested an access-related issue, but the lack of specific context still leans me toward \"Miscellaneous.\" Without further details, I cannot confidently categorize it as a direct \"Access\" problem, even though it's the closest fit.\n\n\n**Reaching Final Category**\n\nI've decided to categorize the ticket as \"Miscellaneous\". The vagueness of the text, particularly \"connect via,\" makes pinpointing a specific category challenging. While \"Access\" is a possibility, the lack of clarity about the nature of the connection problem necessitates a broader approach. \"Miscellaneous\" provides the necessary flexibility for handling this under-specified request.\n\n```json\n{\"category\": \"Miscellaneous\"}\n```\n\n"
