The terms \"allocation,\" \"purchase order,\" and the specific day \"wednesday\" seem particularly salient for classification.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm focusing on the explicit mentions of \"purchase order\" and \"allocation\" to steer the categorization. The additional details like \"swap required\" and \"accessories\" are being weighed against this core transactional language, aiming for the most accurate classification.\n\n**Identifying Purchase Orders**\n\nI'm currently processing the IT ticket and am focusing on keywords related to procurement. The repeated mention of \"purchase order\" and \"allocation\" strongly suggests this is the primary theme. I'm also noting hardware-related terms like \"galaxy,\" \"swap required,\" and \"accessories\" to ensure a comprehensive understanding for classification.\n\n**Purchasing New Equipment**\n\nMy latest analysis strongly points towards \"Purchase\" as the most fitting category. The repeated emphasis on \"purchase order\" and \"allocation\" clearly indicates a procurement process at the core of this request, even with the accompanying hardware-related terms.\n\n"
