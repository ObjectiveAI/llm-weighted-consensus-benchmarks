It looks like \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate, given the mention of a \"new starter\" and an attached \"starter form.\" I'll need to confirm this choice.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on fine-tuning the category selection, given the ticket's focus on a new employee's onboarding. \"HR Support\" appears the strongest based on the new starter's context and the mention of the \"starter form.\" The \"Access\" category doesn't quite capture the onboarding process's breadth, and I believe \"HR Support\" encapsulates the nature of this assistance request better.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Assessment**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's focus on a \"new starter\" and the attached \"starter form.\" The mention of needing help to complete the onboarding process solidifies my categorization, I think. This points to direct HR involvement, or processes often associated with HR. Thus, \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate fit. It clearly captures the essence of the user's request, which involves getting a new starter fully onboarded, and the starter form is also strong evidence for this category choice. I'm satisfied this represents the best-fit categorization.\n\n\n"
