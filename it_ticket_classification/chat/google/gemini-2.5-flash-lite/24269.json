The keywords \"access\" and \"people operations\" are pointing me towards \"Access\" or \"HR Support,\" possibly leaning towards the latter given the \"people operations\" context. I need to consider the overlap between these categories and ensure an accurate fit. I'll need to double-check if \"people operations\" falls under HR.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Choices**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Administrative rights\" as the primary category for this ticket. The phrases \"access to\" and \"rights\" are the key indicators. While \"Access\" is still relevant, \"Administrative rights\" is more precise. The \"people operations\" context further supports this, suggesting a need for access permissions related to an HR function. This aligns well with the request for rights.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Precision**\n\nI've decided \"Administrative rights\" is the best fit, thanks to the explicit mention of \"rights\" and the implied need for elevated permissions within the \"people operations\" context. While \"Access\" was a contender, \"Administrative rights\" is more specific and aligns perfectly with the core request.\n\n\n"
