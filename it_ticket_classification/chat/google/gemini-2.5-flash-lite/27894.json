Right now, I'm parsing the phrase \"new starter tower thursday october.\" It seems related to initial setup for new employees, but the \"tower\" part could be ambiguous. I need to clarify if it refers to a computer tower or something else.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nNow, I'm trying to identify the best category for this ticket, and the options of \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" seem the most fitting. Since the request pertains to setting up accounts and credentials for a new intern, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" because it's the most specific and accurately reflects the core action required.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Action**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and I think I've honed in on the key request. The initial \"new starter\" and intern information pointed to employee onboarding, which had me considering \"HR Support\" but after further analysis, the actionable instruction is \"adjust credentials.\" That solidified my choice of \"Access\" for the category.\n\n\n"
