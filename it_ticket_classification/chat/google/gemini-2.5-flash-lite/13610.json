The ticket specifically requests the deletion of Outlook bookings for a departing employee. I've narrowed it down based on the available categories provided. I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as it directly involves access to a user's account and data. However, I'm also considering the potential overlap with \"HR Support\" since it involves a leaver process.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've refined my thinking on the ticket category. While \"Access\" seemed relevant initially due to account-related actions, I now believe \"HR Support\" is the best fit. The request to delete Outlook bookings is firmly within the scope of offboarding procedures, which often fall under HR's purview. It aligns more holistically with managing a leaver's data and access.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Selection**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the best category for this ticket, and I think I've landed on \"HR Support\". The phrase \"delete outlook bookings\" made me consider access, but upon more careful review, it's about the offboarding process.  This means \"HR Support\" best captures the scope of managing a leaver's data.\n\n\n"
