The terms \"access to resources\" and \"policies\" are standing out. I'm carefully weighing them to determine the most fitting IT ticket category, considering the options available.\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Requests**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"Access\" category as the most suitable. The text heavily emphasizes \"access to resources\" and consistent policy application for new hires. Keywords like \"joiner\" and \"starter form\" further indicate the access request. The other categories, like \"HR Support,\" are less precise, as the ticket is about granting and checking user access.\n\n\n**Defining the Access Scenario**\n\nI'm now refining the justification for the \"Access\" category. The keywords \"access,\" \"resources,\" and \"policies\" are all working in concert. The \"joiner\" aspect is key; it's a new hire, and the ticket is explicitly about granting access according to existing company policies. It's not a general HR issue; it's a *technical* access request. I'm focusing on the technical side, like the \"assigned correctly\" phrase, to support the \"Access\" assignment.\n\n\n"
