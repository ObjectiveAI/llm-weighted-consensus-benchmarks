Currently, I'm leaning towards \"Access\" since it mentions a password expiring. I'm double-checking to make sure it's not something else, though.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories. The phrases \"password expire\" and the instructions for changing a password are pretty central. While \"Access\" is looking like the best fit, I'm just quickly ruling out other possibilities like \"Storage\" or \"Purchase\" since there's no evidence of those issues here. I'm focusing on \"Access\" given the context.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and the available categories. The repeated phrases like \"password expire\" and the password change instructions strongly point towards \"Access.\" While other categories were considered, they didn't align with the core issue of user authentication and password management. \"Access\" is the definitive match.\n\n\n"
