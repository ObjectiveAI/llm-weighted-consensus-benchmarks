                    "reasoning": "**Examining Ticket Content**\n\nI'm currently focused on the ticket content: \"recurrent issues following change\" and \"incident check if related changes were implemented.\" I'm leaning toward either \"Hardware\" or \"Access\" as possible categories, but I'm still trying to determine which is more likely to be the root cause of the problem. Further analysis is needed to make a final decision, possibly requiring more data. I will continue to investigate.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Focus**\n\nThe ticket's details regarding network performance, traffic routing, infrastructure modifications, and their downstream consequences have become clearer. I've ruled out several categories due to a mismatch with the specifics. \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project\" now seem the most likely fits, given the recurring performance issues post-change. The analysis is highlighting network-related performance problems as the central concern.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choices**\n\nAfter reviewing the ticket again, focusing on the recurrent network and performance issues, \"Miscellaneous\" remains the best fit. While \"Internal Project\" is still a possibility because of the infrastructure changes, the ticket's core is the system impact from the changes, not the project's details. The changes described are affecting network performance, traffic routing, and overall system load which isn't well captured by \"Internal Project\". The \"Miscellaneous\" category accurately reflects the broad, ongoing nature of the problem, and its lack of direct relation to Hardware, Access, HR, etc.\n\n\n**Deciding on Final Category**\n\nI've been going back and forth, considering \"Miscellaneous\" versus \"Internal Project\". The recent analysis highlighted the critical points: the focus is the change *and* its *impact*. It is a broad IT system performance incident, not a hardware fault, access problem, or the like. The changes described (infrastructure, traffic routing) do point toward an internal project as their source. However, the ticket is more about the performance degradation incident as a result of that project. Therefore, I believe \"Miscellaneous\" best captures the nature of the issue.\n\n\n**Choosing Final Category**\n\nI've been assessing the ticket details to arrive at the most suitable category. Originally, \"Miscellaneous\" appeared to be a broad fit, but a closer examination of the content has changed my mind. The descriptions of changes to traffic routing, infrastructure modifications, and their impact on user experience strongly suggest an \"Internal Project\" as the root cause. While the ticket is a post-incident report, it specifically details actions carried out as a part of a wider project, and the recurring performance issues are a result of these actions, so it makes sense to classify the ticket under \"Internal Project\".\n\n\n**Choosing Precise Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket details to arrive at the most suitable category. The ticket describes \"changing way traffic routed internally\" and \"maintenance works infrastructure,\" which are strong indicators of an internal infrastructure project. The recurring issues and performance problems are consequences of this project, therefore, the more specific and fitting category will be \"Internal Project.\"\n\n\n"
