It seems the core issue revolves around access control and employee identification within the system. My thinking is leaning towards \"Access\" as the most suitable category, but I'm still weighing it against \"HR Support,\" as there might be an HR element involved with employee card usage.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Access Issue**\n\nI've refined my focus to definitively categorize this ticket. The phrases \"audit access cards,\" \"pm cards usage,\" and \"employees...cards\" are key. After carefully reviewing the listed categories, I firmly believe \"Access\" is the most precise fit. It encompasses both physical access via cards and the auditing of their usage, perfectly aligning with the ticket's core problem. I've ruled out alternatives like \"HR Support\" because the central issue is access control, not general HR processes.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Access as Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's language, zeroing in on \"audit,\" \"cards,\" and \"employees.\" My analysis clearly indicates that the primary concern is access control and the monitoring of card usage. After careful consideration, I've confirmed that \"Access\" is the most fitting category, encompassing the audit and management aspects. I've excluded other options like \"HR Support\" because the crux of the matter is access, not broader HR issues.\n\n\n"
