                    "reasoning": "**Examining Ticket Text**\n\nI'm currently dissecting the ticket text to pinpoint the primary issue. The words \"change,\" \"oracle,\" and \"procedure\" suggest a possible database or software update scenario. I'll need to carefully consider the options and choose the most relevant category. My initial thoughts lean towards \"Administrative rights\" or potentially \"Internal Project,\" but I'm holding off on a definitive selection until I've fully analyzed the context.\n\n\n**Identifying the Root Cause**\n\nI'm now diving deeper into the ticket's core problem. The \"change oracle\" and \"procedure changing person\" phrases jump out, strongly indicating a potential issue tied to user access within an Oracle environment. While \"Internal Project\" is still a contender, the focus seems to be on a specific technical adjustment. I'm leaning toward \"Administrative rights,\" but want to be absolutely sure before selecting a final category. I'm carefully connecting all the clues.\n\n\n**Determining Access Type**\n\nI'm now carefully differentiating between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The \"change oracle\" context along with the focus on \"having rights\" points towards system-level permissions changes. While \"Access\" is broad, the emphasis is on **managing** and **controlling** access within the Oracle environment. I believe \"Administrative rights\" is the most fitting. The detailed list of task actions, approvals, and assignments suggests someone requires higher level privileges to perform those actions. I'm focusing on the implied need for elevated privileges.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Access Level**\n\nI'm now carefully differentiating between general access and administrator-level permissions within the Oracle system. While \"Access\" could apply, the request seems tied to specific procedures and potentially elevated privileges related to the \"change oracle\" context. I'm focusing on whether the user requires administrative control or simply the ability to perform actions within Oracle. The approval process suggests a request that needs elevated permissions or access to manage and maintain the system. Based on this, I'm leaning toward \"Administrative rights.\"\n\n\n**Defining the Access Type**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's core intent. Phrases like \"changing person,\" \"having rights,\" and \"approve/reject\" consistently point towards user access management. While \"Administrative rights\" remains a possibility, the lack of specific administrative keywords or focus on high-level system control makes \"Access\" a better fit. The ticket's convoluted nature, with approvals and user-related tasks, underscores the central theme of granting or modifying user access to systems or data. I'm now leaning toward confirming \"Access\" as the most appropriate category.\n\n\n"
