Reviewing the description, specifically \"clearing historical missing time cards\" and \"Oracle project management,\" suggests the best fit might be \"Internal Project.\" Though related to HR or Access, it feels like this request crosses boundaries into a process improvement project.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" now, given the specific mention of time cards and employee data. While Oracle Project Management is involved, the primary issue centers on resolving historical timekeeping discrepancies. The ticket's focus aligns more closely with HR-related systems and processes than an internal project, though it could impact a project.\n\n\n**Focusing on Timekeeping**\n\nI've decided \"HR Support\" is the best fit. While Oracle Project Management is mentioned, the core issue revolves around historical time card discrepancies and employee data, which directly falls under HR-related systems. The problem isn't about the project itself but timekeeping, which aligns better with HR processes.\n\n\n"
