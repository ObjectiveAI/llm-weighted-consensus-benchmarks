The ticket text clearly points to difficulties accessing shared folders, specifically Excel documents. The user's inability to open these files indicates an access problem that needs immediate attention. I'm confident that this is the correct classification for this particular IT issue.\n\n\n**Clarifying Access Issues**\n\nI've honed in on the access angle. The user can't access shared Excel docs, a direct indicator of permission problems. While storage isn't the primary concern, access is. I'm satisfied that \"Access\" is the most appropriate category for this issue. This narrows down the investigation scope considerably.\n\n\n"
