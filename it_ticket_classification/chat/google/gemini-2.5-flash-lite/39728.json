Based on the provided content, the \"Access\" category seems highly relevant, given the repeated mentions and apparent issues relating to permissions and access rights. Further analysis is underway to ensure no other category is equally suitable.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've carefully re-examined the ticket details, particularly the user's phrases regarding access and modifications. While other categories might seem superficially relevant, the consistent emphasis on permissions and inability to amend strongly supports \"Access\" as the primary concern. My next step will be to confirm this through a final, targeted keyword scan.\n\n\n"
