The repeated mention of \"leaver form\" strongly suggests this is related to HR Support. However, I am still running my evaluation, and would like to get it right.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the central issue: correctly assigning this IT ticket's category. After reviewing the ticket text again, the repeated mentions of \"leaver form\" solidify my initial impression. It's becoming increasingly clear that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category, as this process usually requires IT assistance. The 'Access' category seems relevant, too, but I'm leaning toward 'HR Support' as it encompasses the entire leaver process.\n\n\n"
