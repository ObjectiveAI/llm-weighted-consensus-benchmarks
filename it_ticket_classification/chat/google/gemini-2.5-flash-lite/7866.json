It seems \"Access\" might be the most relevant, but \"Miscellaneous\" could also apply. This specific ticket mentions \"soft closing\" multiple times, which doesn't fit any category perfectly. I'm exploring if this phrase points to a specific process or if it's unrelated.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Needs**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and the available categories. My primary focus is on the phrase \"access to soft closing.\"  The ticket clearly requests some form of permission or entry. I've ruled out Hardware, HR Support, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights as less relevant. While \"Miscellaneous\" is a potential fit, I believe \"Access\" is the most direct and accurate categorization, given the user's need to access a function or system.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and the available categories again. The core request revolves around gaining access to a feature or system related to \"soft closing,\" which also involves file uploads and a weekly process. While \"Miscellaneous\" is a possible fit, \"Access\" is the most precise and accurately reflects the user's primary need, given the \"access to soft closing\" phrase. The other categories are clearly less relevant to the ticket's core issue.\n\n\n"
