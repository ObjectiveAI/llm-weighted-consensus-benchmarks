Based on the phrases \"unable to upload docs\", \"cannot upload documents\", and \"tried\", I'm leaning toward an access issue. However, I need to be 100% sure before I finalize the selection. It could also involve storage, I will need to check other potential categories before deciding.\n\n\n**Selecting the Optimal Category**\n\nI've assessed the ticket details: \"unable to upload,\" \"cannot upload,\" and an \"error\" message. After considering the options - Hardware, HR, Access, etc. - \"Storage\" appears most suitable due to the file upload/storage context. I've ruled out others like \"Access\" (login issues), \"Purchase\", \"Internal Projects\", and others, as they don't seem applicable here. It's about data storage.\n\n\n"
