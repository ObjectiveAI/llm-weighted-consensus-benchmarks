Considering the specific nuances is important here, I'm carefully reviewing all the provided categories to ensure the best fit.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Access Type**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. Though \"Access\" seems fitting at first glance, the text's explicit mention of \"rights\" makes me rethink. Perhaps \"Administrative rights\" is a better fit after all, since they are related to access control. Still, I am going to weigh both categories to avoid a hasty decision.\n\n\n**Defining the Best Category**\n\nI've considered all the options, and I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access.\" The repeated keyword \"user rights\" is the central theme here, implying a need for managed permissions. Although \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility, it may be too narrow, so I'm favoring the broader, more inclusive \"Access\" categorization.\n\n\n"
