My aim is to accurately categorize each ticket based on its content, making sure I cover all possible requests. I'm considering using keyword analysis to facilitate the process.\n\n\n**Identifying The Primary Issue**\n\nI've determined that the primary issue relates to an employee departure. Keywords like \"leaver,\" \"mailbox,\" and \"ad rights\" are prominent. The focus seems to be on offboarding tasks. I'll need to define a relevant category to reflect this type of request.\n\n\n**Determining The Best Fit**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category, as this IT ticket relates to processing a leaver form, which involves offboarding and directly intersects with HR's responsibilities. I've considered that the ticket's primary focus is on an employee's departure and associated tasks like mailbox access, AD rights, and account management, all closely tied to HR workflows.\n\n\n**Choosing the Primary Category**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. While \"Access\" and \"HR Support\" both fit, I've decided \"HR Support\" is the key. The ticket itself is triggered by an employee leaving, and HR usually initiates and handles such processes.\n\n\n**Deciding the Final Category**\n\nI've considered all relevant factors. I've chosen \"HR Support\" as the best category. The ticket's core is an employee's departure, a process usually coordinated with HR. While \"Access\" is involved, it's a consequence of the leaver process.  \"HR Support\" encompasses the *situation*, and the associated IT actions.\n\n\n"
