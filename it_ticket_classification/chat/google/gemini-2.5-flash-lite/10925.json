After examining the text, which includes mentions of \"expense report\" and \"submit expense report,\" I believe the options are narrowing. I'm carefully weighing whether this falls under HR Support, Access, or perhaps a more general Miscellaneous category, since it doesn't seem directly related to hardware or specific technical access. I'm leaning toward a non-technical category for this one.\n\n\n**Analyzing Category Fit**\n\nMy analysis indicates this ticket's best fit is \"Purchase.\" Expense reports, per diem, and \"accounts payable\" clearly point to financial transactions related to company expenses, and the \"Purchase\" category encompasses these activities. I've ruled out \"HR Support\" as indirect, and \"Miscellaneous\" as insufficiently specific. The keywords strongly support the \"Purchase\" categorization.\n\n\n"
