I'm breaking down the text to identify key phrases that will point to the relevant category. My goal is to accurately assign the ticket to one of the following: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\".\n\n\n**Identifying Access Issues**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided ticket descriptions to pinpoint the underlying access issues. The phrase \"shared location\" appears consistently, suggesting a storage or access-related concern. Users are experiencing problems with this location and are seeking clarification on whether their actions are normal, or if they should take further steps. It seems likely this will fall under the \"Access\" category, with potential overlap into \"Storage\".\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided ticket descriptions to find the most accurate categorization. My focus narrowed on the repeated \"shared location\" phrase, which suggests either storage or access problems. User requests and the need for clarification around normal operations point towards \"Access\" as the primary category. While \"Storage\" is relevant because of the shared location, the core issue is the ability to interact with it, rather than the storage itself failing.\n\n\n"
