I'm noting specific keywords: \"special leave request,\" \"team leaders,\" and \"project managers\". Based on this, I'm leaning toward either \"HR Support\" or \"Internal Project\" as the relevant category. I'll need further analysis to make a final determination.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm now considering the context of the \"timed out\" issue, which could be a system glitch (Miscellaneous) or an issue with the HR system handling the leave request (HR Support). Since the core of the ticket remains the \"special leave request,\" HR Support remains the most fitting category, even if there's a technical glitch. I've ruled out Hardware, Storage, Access, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights as not directly related to the core issue.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nNow I'm digging into the \"timed out\" element. While it might hint at a system glitch, I'm focusing on the heart of the matter: the \"special leave request\". Even if there's a technical hiccup in the system, the root of the problem is still an HR process. Since I want to focus on the root of the issue, \"HR Support\" appears the clearest fit, as the timed-out issue is secondary to the need to approve the leave request, as the approval \"was per attached\". Miscellaneous, Access, and Internal Project were considered, but HR Support is more directly relevant.\n\n\n"
