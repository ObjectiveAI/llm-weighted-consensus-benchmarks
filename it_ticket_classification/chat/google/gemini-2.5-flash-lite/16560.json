After analyzing the provided text, which mentions \"video audio\" and \"meetings,\" I'm leaning toward a few potential categories. My initial thought is to consider \"Miscellaneous\" as a possibility, but I'm also considering other options. It requires careful review to ensure accurate classification.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nMy current focus is honing in on the most accurate category. After reviewing the provided text more thoroughly, I am leaning strongly towards \"Purchase.\" The key phrase \"order equip\" solidified my thinking, making it the most fitting choice. I'm now certain this isn't just a hardware issue but a request that triggers procurement.\n\n\n**Defining the Purchase Need**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Purchase\" category. Analyzing the text, especially \"order equip,\" reinforced my conviction. The detailed list of requested equipment - projector, microphone, speakers - further solidifies this classification. This is not just a hardware problem; it's a procurement request. I've ruled out all other categories.\n\n\n"
