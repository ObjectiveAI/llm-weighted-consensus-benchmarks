Considering the inability to access folders remotely, I've eliminated \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support.\" \"Miscellaneous\" seems too broad, and \"Purchase\" doesn't fit. I'm torn between \"Access\" and \"Administrative rights,\" as remote access issues can stem from both. I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the primary issue, with administrative rights possibly being a secondary factor, but I'll need to confirm that.\n\n\n**Confirming the Root Cause**\n\nI've narrowed the issue down to \"Access,\" as the ticket explicitly mentions inability to access folders remotely. I've ruled out all the other categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others due to lack of relevance. While administrative rights are a possibility, the primary concern is the *access* itself, regardless of the underlying permission issues. Therefore, I believe \"Access\" is the most precise categorization for this ticket.\n\n\n"
