I've noted \"purchased\" and \"installation,\" which hint at potential categories. I'm carefully sifting through the remaining words to pinpoint the most relevant category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on differentiating between \"Purchase\" and \"Hardware.\" The \"purchased\" and \"installation\" elements could fit either, but the focus seems primarily on the acquisition itself and subsequent installation. I'm leaning toward Purchase because that's the initiating action. I'm revisiting the provided schema to ensure this remains the most relevant fit. I've also noted that the user included a reference to video mirroring but this is of minor relevance to the core issue.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Focus**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket description to pinpoint its core intent. Keywords like \"purchased,\" \"installation,\" and \"receipts\" consistently surfaced as relevant. After considering all the categories in the schema, I've concluded that the primary action described, \"purchased,\" best aligns with the \"Purchase\" category. Although installation is mentioned, the buying aspect and subsequent documentation were more central, which made me decide on it.\n\n\n"
