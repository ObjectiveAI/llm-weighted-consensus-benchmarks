I'm carefully analyzing the provided text, paying close attention to keywords that align with the given categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The phrase \"integration with friday pm\" is the current focal point. I'm actively comparing this context with the category options to make an informed selection.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the categories. The phrases \"integration with friday pm,\" \"embed code,\" \"streaming,\" and \"broadcasting\" point toward project work. I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. I've re-evaluated each category: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The other categories don't seem applicable to the described activities.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Selection**\n\nMy thinking has moved toward a more refined view. Analyzing the phrases \"integration\", \"embed code,\" \"streaming\", \"broadcasting\", and \"meetings\" makes the \"Internal Project\" category the clear frontrunner. I've re-examined each category, discarding the others due to their lack of direct relevance to the described activities. The request describes the implementation of new functionalities or integrations, which strongly fits the scope of \"Internal Project\". The phrases  \"requirements\", \"configure\", and integration clearly support that.\n\n\n"
