It appears straightforward; the \"Hardware\" category seems like the most fitting classification for this incident. This aligns perfectly with the provided schema and the problem described. It's a key area that I now need to focus on.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Details**\n\nI've thoroughly dissected the IT ticket text. The language strongly points to a \"lost phone\" scenario, which immediately puts it squarely within the \"Hardware\" category. The user's actions, and their request for device wiping, solidify this classification. The request aligns with the initial schema, confirming this categorization as the most accurate and relevant.\n\n\n"
