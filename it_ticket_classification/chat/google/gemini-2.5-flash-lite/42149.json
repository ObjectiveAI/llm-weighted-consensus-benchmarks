Given the content \"unable to connect to from outside the via sent wednesday unable connect outside hi,\" I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the most suitable category. It seems to describe a connectivity problem.\n\n\n**Assessing Access Problems**\n\nI've got a new ticket and I'm still zeroing in on the best category. The phrase \"unable to connect from outside\" really jumps out. The added context about this being a long-term issue impacting remote work further pushes me towards \"Access.\"  The \"Access\" category feels like the best fit here given the persistent connectivity challenges, though I am open to revising if I've missed something.\n\n\n**Evaluating Ticket Access**\n\nI've examined a new ticket that describes a persistent inability to connect from outside the network. The phrase \"unable to connect to from outside\" is a recurring theme. The fact this has been going on for a couple of weeks, and the remote work requirements are also key drivers. The issue directly impacts the employee's ability to work, so I feel \"Access\" is still the appropriate category.\n\n\n"
