The ticket text strongly suggests a storage-related issue, specifically concerning email quota limits. I am actively eliminating less relevant options like HR Support or Administrative Rights, and leaning towards \"Storage\". I need to verify that this is the best fit, as \"Miscellaneous\" is always a fallback, but the ticket specifics seem more precise than that.\n\n\n**Verifying Category Fit**\n\nMy analysis continues, and I am solidifying \"Storage\" as the best category. The keywords strongly support this choice. While \"Miscellaneous\" could apply, the specific mentions of mailbox size and quota make \"Storage\" a far more accurate match. I am reviewing the other categories again to confirm there are no subtle, related issues that might be missed.\n\n\n"
