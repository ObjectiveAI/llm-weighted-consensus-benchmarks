Analyzing the keywords, I've narrowed it down to potential categories.  \"Backup\" strongly suggests \"Storage,\" though \"Miscellaneous\" is also a possibility due to the brevity and lack of concrete details. I'm leaning toward \"Storage\" as the more precise fit, given the context.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Scope**\n\nI've just finished the deep dive on the ticket details. The language clearly points to storage-related concerns. Though, I did pause on \"Internal Project\" since the snapshot discussion might imply this. Yet, \"Storage\" covers the core function of the ticket's request. Based on the terminology of backup, restore, and snapshots, I'm confident categorizing this under \"Storage\".\n\n\n**Identifying Storage Needs**\n\nI've just sifted through the ticket content, and the strong presence of \"backup,\" \"restore,\" and \"snapshot\" terminology seals the deal. Queries about hosting, cost, and retention further solidify \"Storage\" as the correct category. The initial context seemed to be broad but focusing on the operations, I am sure this is the correct classification.\n\n\n"
