The phrases \"new job title\" and \"engineer grade intern\" strongly suggest an HR-related action, likely setting up a new employee profile. While it involves an IT system (Oracle), the core issue seems to be the job title assignment which falls under HR.\n\n\n**Focusing on Onboarding**\n\nI've refined my initial categorization to place this firmly within \"HR Support\". The keywords are solid indicators of a new employee setup scenario. The phrases related to a new role and grade are a dead giveaway for HR-related action. Although it involves an IT system, the crux is title assignment, a clear HR function. I think this is a strong call.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've considered all the options, and HR Support remains the most appropriate category. \"New job title\" and \"engineer grade intern\" are the strongest indicators. While Oracle is mentioned, the core issue is the new title assignment, which is distinctly an HR task. Access is a possible secondary concern related to the title, but the ticket's core is the HR-related title.\n\n\n"
