I'm reviewing the available options to confirm the best fit.\n\n**Confirming Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's core issue, which revolves around a password reset for an external user and mentions of account expiry. Based on this, \"Access\" appears to be the most appropriate categorization, and I'm confirming this choice.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've finalized the categorization of the IT ticket. Given the core issue of \"password reset for external user\" and the related context of \"expire days,\" the \"Access\" category is the most suitable choice.\n\n"
