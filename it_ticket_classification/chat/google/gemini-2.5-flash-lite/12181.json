My current focus is on grouping these themes into distinct, actionable ticket types for efficient processing.\n\n**Assigning User Offboarding Tickets**\n\nI'm now focusing on mapping the identified \"leaver\" and related keywords\u2014such as \"AD rights,\" \"mailbox,\" and \"roaming profile\"\u2014to the most appropriate IT ticket category, prioritizing \"Access\" due to the strong alignment with user account management during offboarding.\n\n**Refining Access Category Assignment**\n\nI'm consolidating my analysis, confirming that the \"leaver\" context, with its emphasis on AD rights, mailboxes, and profiles, strongly points towards the \"Access\" category. I'm confident this is the most appropriate classification.\n\n**Finalizing Access Category Assignment**\n\nI've confirmed that the comprehensive set of keywords, especially those related to account management and digital permissions, firmly anchors this ticket within the \"Access\" category. My analysis is complete for this specific ticket.\n\n"
