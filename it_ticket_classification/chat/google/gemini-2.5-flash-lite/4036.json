My goal is to map these keywords to predefined categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and so on. I'm currently working to define a systematic approach for extracting these keywords from ticket text.\n\n\n**Defining Keyword Mapping**\n\nI've examined the ticket text and refined the keyword mapping strategy. Now, I'm leaning toward prioritizing \"Access\" based on the \"password expire\" and \"change pc\" phrases. The \"report production issues\" bit remains uncertain, perhaps \"Miscellaneous\" is the best fit, but it's less definitive. I'll need to develop a more robust system to handle ambiguous keywords, like those related to PC changes which are between Hardware and Access.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Details**\n\nI've determined that the \"Access\" category is the best fit, despite some ambiguity with \"change pc\". The strong emphasis on password-related terms, such as \"password expire\" and \"reset password,\" solidifies this classification. I've now set the primary category as \"Access\" and am ready for the next iteration.\n\n\n"
