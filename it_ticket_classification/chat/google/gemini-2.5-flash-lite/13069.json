The initial text fragment, \"missing time sheet pm sheet add card,\" is leading me to think this has something to do with HR. Though, the \"add card\" part is still throwing me off. I'm going to spend a bit more time with this to check the allowed options.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided text and it's getting clearer.  The \"missing time sheet\" and \"he leave\" elements definitely point to HR Support. While \"add card\" remains somewhat ambiguous, the context suggests this is access-related, possibly a leaving employee.  The repeated job titles are likely extraneous data that doesn't influence the categorization.\n\n\n**Clarifying Ticket's Purpose**\n\nNow, I'm focusing on the core issue. The \"missing time sheet,\" \"annual leave,\" and \"leave\" elements strongly suggest an HR context. Although \"add card\" could relate to access, it's more likely associated with HR in this context. \"PC\" might indicate a hardware connection, but it's secondary to the core HR need of leave processing and time tracking. I can definitively rule out purchase, storage, projects, and administrative rights. The repeated titles are irrelevant. HR Support is the most appropriate.\n\n\n"
