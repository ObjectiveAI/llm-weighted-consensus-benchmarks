My initial leaning is towards \"Access,\" given the repeated mention of access cards and the request to deactivate and replace them. However, I'm considering if \"HR Support\" could also be relevant due to the request being linked to a 'pass card', which could imply security or employee onboarding.\n\n\n**Categorizing Access Issues**\n\nI've solidified my thought process around categorizing this ticket. The phrases \"lost access card,\" \"lost pass card,\" and \"deactivate request\" clearly point towards an access-related problem. While HR Support might initially seem relevant, the core issue is the management of physical access, making \"Access\" the definitive fit. I'm excluding other categories based on the ticket's explicit focus on access card management.\n\n\n"
