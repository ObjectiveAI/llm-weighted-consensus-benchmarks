The phrase \"leaver disable ad\" is key, pointing strongly towards \"Access\" issues, likely involving account deactivation. I'm also considering the nuances of user access and administrative privileges within that context.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI'm now leaning heavily towards \"HR Support.\" The \"leaver form\" aspect is a key indicator. While \"Access\" is connected to disabling the AD account, that action is a direct *result* of the broader HR-related process of a departing employee. The overall context points clearly to an HR workflow.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Category**\n\nI've made a firm decision to categorize this under \"HR Support.\" The \"leaver form\" context solidified the core issue. While disabling the AD account is an access matter, it is a task within the larger leaver process, and this whole scenario revolves around a departing employee. The previous focus on the AD account was a narrowing step, but the overarching theme is clearly HR-related, even though I had initially been considering \"Access\" as well. I believe this categorization is the most appropriate.\n\n\n"
