Further examination will be needed to confirm this, but I'm leaning toward this category based on the initial keywords.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Type Focus**\n\nI've honed in on the HR Support category for this ticket. The wording, including issues with time cards, suggests it's the optimal fit. Further, the details about errors when submitting and incorrect working hours are strongly supportive of HR involvement.\n\n\n"
