It's impacting software performance, especially Visual Studio. While it mentions software, the root cause points to a hardware limitation. This is a tough one to classify; it could be filed under hardware, but maybe also needs a bit of 'Miscellaneous' in the mix?\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've decided \"Hardware\" is the most accurate category, reflecting the primary issue of an underpowered CPU impacting performance. The ticket's focus is on the hardware's deficiency, even though the user discusses software performance. While \"Purchase\" is relevant for the suggested upgrade, it's secondary to the core problem. The \"Hardware\" category best captures the crux of the user's report.\n\n\n"
