Given the available categories, and the clear infrastructure-related nature of the problem, I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the most appropriate classification, since none of the other options directly address building utility issues.\n\n**Categorizing Utility Outage**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the IT ticket's content, noting the explicit request for electricity restoration on the fourth floor due to an outage. Given the provided categories, and the infrastructure-focused nature of the problem, I'm confirming \"Miscellaneous\" as the most fitting classification.\n\n**Assigning IT Ticket**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the IT ticket detailing an electricity malfunction on the fourth floor, impacting the acceptance test team. Given the available classifications, and since the issue involves a utility outage rather than specific IT equipment, I've assigned it to the \"Miscellaneous\" category.\n\n"
