It seems to point towards a hardware issue, possibly related to a phone swap or replacement. I need to carefully consider all possible categories before committing. My instinct leans towards \"Hardware,\" but I'm checking if it could also include other options.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Issue**\n\nI've refined my initial analysis of the ticket's keywords. The focus is definitely leaning towards a hardware problem given the terms \"phone\" and \"swap.\" While \"blank card number\" *could* be access-related, it's connected with a phone swap, cementing the hardware classification. I'm now certain this is a hardware issue and have set my course accordingly.\n\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's language, factoring in the mention of \"blank card number,\" \"phone,\" and the required \"swap.\" While \"card number\" had me briefly consider access issues, the surrounding context strongly aligns with a hardware concern, requiring either a phone replacement or reconfiguration of a device. \"Installation\" also fits here, as part of the hardware swap. It's a clear fit for hardware category.\n\n\n"
