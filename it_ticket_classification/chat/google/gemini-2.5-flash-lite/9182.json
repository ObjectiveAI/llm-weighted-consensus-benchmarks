The repeated mention of \"leaver form\" strongly suggests an HR-related issue. This points towards \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate classification. My analysis is progressing well, and I'm ready to select the final category.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've solidified my determination of the best category. Considering the text, which includes multiple instances of \"leaver form,\" I've confirmed that \"HR Support\" perfectly captures the essence of this ticket's request. It's clearly about a HR-related procedure, not hardware, storage, or any of the other irrelevant categories. I am now confident that this will make for an efficient and accurate assignment.\n\n\n"
