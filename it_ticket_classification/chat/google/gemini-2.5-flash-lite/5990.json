The phrase \"new starter\" points towards onboarding which is usually an HR function. However, the ticket does not clarify access requirements, which also hints at \"Access\". I'm still weighing the options.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Ticket's Focus**\n\nI'm now focusing on the core request within the ticket to finalize the best category. The phrase \"new starter\" and the mention of a job title, alongside \"joining\", all strongly suggest HR Support as the primary category. While \"Access\" could be a secondary concern due to the developer role, HR Support seems to be the central issue needing resolution first, especially for initial setup. Administrative rights aren't the primary request.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've examined the ticket again, focusing on the core request for classification. The references to a \"new starter\" and the job details strongly favor HR Support. While the developer role hints at potential access concerns, the central issue is the employee's onboarding, which is primarily an HR matter. Administrative rights are implied but not the main point of concern; their grade level and role are the core issue. I'm going with HR Support.\n\n\n"
