However, I want to further refine my understanding. The phrase \"importance\" suggests there is more to this than just a minor error, perhaps impacting workflow. I need to consider all available information to make the best judgment call on this.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've been analyzing the text closely, and while \"Miscellaneous\" seemed plausible at first, the frequent mentions of \"starters\" and \"leavers\" point strongly towards an HR-related issue. The template error impacts the onboarding/offboarding process, which suggests this ticket aligns well with an \"HR Support\" category. However, I have more information to process before I am sure.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the central issue, which appears to be a flaw in the \"starter template\" impacting the weekly employee onboarding/offboarding process. This process has \"high importance,\" given it's affecting all starters and leavers. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the appropriate category.\n\n\n"
