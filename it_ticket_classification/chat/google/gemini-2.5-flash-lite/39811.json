I'm leaning toward an HR Support categorization, since timecard issues typically fall under that umbrella. I'll need to double-check that this is the best fit, ensuring it's not a different issue.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy analysis of the ticket text solidifies the \"HR Support\" category as the best fit. Keywords like \"missing timecard,\" \"submit,\" and \"weekly\" strongly suggest an HR-related issue. I've re-reviewed the options and am confident this is the most accurate classification, rather than any other category that may have overlapping keywords. The reference to \"training materials\" is a slight distraction, but not central.\n\n\n"
