I've taken the ticket text apart, looking for key terms and phrases. The combination of \"maternity leave,\" \"form,\" and \"access card\" is giving me a strong lead toward a specific category, but I want to be certain. I'm focusing on \"Access\" and \"HR Support\" because they seem relevant to the described scenario.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm now leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\" as the primary category for this ticket. While \"Access\" is relevant due to the access card, the context of an employee's departure via maternity leave forms suggests a stronger alignment with HR processes. The ticket text's keywords (\"maternity leaver form,\" \"access card\") point to an HR-driven scenario. This is my current focus to ensure the appropriate department gets the ticket.\n\n\n**Determining the Priority**\n\nI've decided to prioritize \"HR Support\" for this ticket, placing the \"Access\" aspect as a secondary detail. The \"maternity leaver form\" is the central concern, strongly indicating an HR-related offboarding process. While the access card is relevant, it falls under the larger umbrella of employee departure, placing \"HR Support\" as the more accurate label.\n\n\n"
