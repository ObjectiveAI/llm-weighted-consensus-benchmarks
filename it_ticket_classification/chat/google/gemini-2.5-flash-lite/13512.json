I'm hesitant to automatically flag this as an HR-related issue. My thought process is to keep thinking about whether any other aspects of the ticket need to be assessed as well.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text: \"missing expense report,\" \"no longer employee,\" and additional details about an expense report. These details solidify \"HR Support\" as the ideal category, especially considering the employee's separation. While \"Miscellaneous\" is a broad option, \"HR Support\" aligns more precisely with the content. Therefore, I'm confident \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate.\n\n\n"
