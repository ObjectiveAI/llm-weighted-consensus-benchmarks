                    "reasoning": "**Examining Ticket Content**\n\nI'm currently dissecting the ticket content, focusing on keywords and phrases. I've pinpointed \"requisitions approver\" as a key indicator. The repetition and context suggest an approval process issue. Further analysis will determine the specific nature of the problem, but initial findings suggest this is the core issue. I'm moving toward identifying the correct category and subcategory now.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Strategy**\n\n\\n\\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket. After considering \"Access,\" I'm also exploring \"Purchase\" because requisitions are fundamentally linked to procurement. \"Administrative rights\" remains a possibility, as changing an approver could be an administrative task. The next step is to weigh the evidence more carefully and make a definitive decision. I'll need to assess which category best captures the core issue.\n\n\n**Deciding on Best Fit**\n\n\\n\\nI'm now carefully weighing \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights\" against \"Purchase.\" The \"changing approver\" aspect continues to steer me toward access-related categories.  While requisitions link to purchases, the core issue is user role management.  Access, or Administrative Rights if it's system-level access, seem more precise. I'm leaning toward Access, however, I am still evaluating Administrative rights as the best fit. I'll make a final decision.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\n\\n\\nI'm now carefully navigating between \"Purchase,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The \"requisitions\" context strongly suggests \"Purchase.\" However, the core action involves changing *who* can approve, which leans toward role management. \"Access\" seems fitting because it governs permissions. \"Administrative rights\" is a good fit if this involves system-level changes. After careful consideration, I'm now leaning more towards  \"Access\" because the action is more about permission.\n\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Effectively**\n\n\\n\\nI'm now carefully navigating between \"Purchase,\" \"Access,\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" The core action centers on changing an approver, which strongly suggests a role or permission-based issue. The requisitions context leads to \"Purchase\" initially, but the focus is on *who* has approval authority.  \"Access\" seems the best fit, as it addresses permissions for approving within the system, better than \"Purchase\", which focuses on the act of requesting purchase. I'll stick with Access for now.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket's Scope**\n\nI'm now clarifying the ticket's true scope: it's not the purchase itself, but the user's *permission* to approve requisitions. This points clearly towards access management. After careful consideration, I'm now leaning more towards  \"Access\" because the action is more about permission, but I still remain open to the idea of \"Purchase\".\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\n\\n\\nI'm now determining the crucial element of this request. While \"Purchase\" is relevant, the heart of the matter is altering an individual's *approval permissions*.  The focus is on user access, rather than the act of purchasing itself. This steers me towards a category that reflects permission management within the system.  I will narrow down which \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" is the better fit.\n\n\n**Focusing on Core Action**\n\n\\n\\nI'm now identifying the ticket's core action.

While \"Access\" is closely related, changing an approver feels like granting/modifying an *administrative* permission within the requisitions system. The core action here is not just granting basic access, but providing authority to manage and approve requests. The emphasis on \"changing approver\" strongly aligns with administrative task, so 'Administrative rights' is the selected category.\n\n\n"
