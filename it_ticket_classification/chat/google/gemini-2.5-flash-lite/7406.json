My aim is to identify keywords that strongly suggest one of the predefined options: [\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", \"Administrative rights\"].\n\n**Determining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm currently processing the provided ticket details, focusing on keywords like \"leaver,\" \"AD rights,\" and \"mailbox.\" My analysis suggests this falls under categories related to employee departures and access revocation. I'm weighing between \"Access\" and \"HR Support\" due to the nature of the tasks mentioned.\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI'm further analyzing the ticket's phrasing, specifically terms like \"leaver service,\" \"leaver form,\" and the explicit mention of \"leaver ad rights.\" This reinforces my assessment that managing user access, particularly deactivating accounts and permissions upon departure, is the central theme. I am leaning heavily towards the \"Access\" category as the most precise fit.\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Categorization**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed all the extracted keywords and phrases. My conclusive decision is to assign this ticket to the \"Access\" category, as the core of the request revolves around managing and revoking an employee's digital permissions and accounts upon their departure.\n\n"
