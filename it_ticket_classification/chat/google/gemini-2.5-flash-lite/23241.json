My goal is to map these keywords to the defined categories: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights\".  I am exploring various NLP techniques to improve the accuracy of category assignment. I need to handle ambiguous or overlapping keywords as well.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Relevant Categories**\n\nI'm currently working to pinpoint the most applicable category for this ticket text. I have isolated key phrases like \"internships membership\" and \"user accounts\", and am considering if this issue aligns more with \"Access\" due to the Active Directory context or \"HR Support\" given the employee/intern distinction. The ambiguity between these categories is central to my analysis now.\n\n\n**Categorizing User Access**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the \"Access\" category, driven by the Active Directory context and the specific discussions around user accounts, distinguished names, and differentiating intern versus employee access. Although HR support might be involved in defining the policy, the ticket text primarily describes a technical issue related to user access management and configuration within the AD environment. I am also making sure I have a good grasp of the technical language here, as it could impact any further decision making.\n\n\n**Refining Category Determination**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"Access\" category, as the ticket text's focus on Active Directory, distinguished names, and differentiating intern accounts aligns perfectly with user access management. While HR might set policies, the technical implementation described points to an access-related issue. The presence of 'user accounts' and the context of intern versus employee roles solidifies my decision.\n\n\n"
