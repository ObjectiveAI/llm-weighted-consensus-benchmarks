After analyzing the ticket description (\"issue sent wednesday february issue hi having problems connecting connected\"), I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Hardware\" as the most relevant categories based on the key words. The lack of context makes it tricky, but \"connected\" is a strong indicator. I need to make a solid selection soon.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Options**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket. The phrases \"problems connecting\", \"attempting connect\", and \"certificate verify failed\" point towards \"Access\" or potentially \"Hardware\", but I am leaning towards \"Access\". The issue appears to be a problem with connecting and authenticating, rather than a physical hardware fault.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Category**\n\nI've examined the ticket description further, focusing on the certificate verification failures. \"Access\" still aligns best because these errors prevent the user from establishing a connection, directly impacting their ability to *access* a system or service. I'm confident in my categorization.\n\n\n"
