I'm also considering the implications of \"specifications document\" and \"automation,\" which may point towards \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"Hardware\". I am focusing on identifying the core intent of the ticket.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Intent**\n\nI'm solidifying the hardware classification, reinforced by \"new machine\" and \"specifications document.\"  While \"automation\" suggests an internal project tie-in, the central focus remains the machine's technical details.  This leads me to believe the user's primary concern is about this new piece of hardware, so I'm finalizing that the ticket belongs in the hardware category.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Assignment**\n\nI've determined that the \"Hardware\" classification is the most accurate, though the term \"automation\" is suggestive of other categories. My thought process is now focusing on ensuring that the selected category, \"Hardware\", aligns perfectly with the textual cues, with particular focus on the \"new machine\" and \"specifications document\" mentions. I'm confident that this classification accurately captures the intent of the IT ticket.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Hardware\" classification. The repeated \"machine\" references and the focus on \"specifications\" strongly support this. The phrase \"automation machine\" is a characteristic of this type of \"Hardware\", rather than an indicator of an independent project. To confirm, the specifications are about the \"new machine\" and not the \"automation\".\n\n\n"
