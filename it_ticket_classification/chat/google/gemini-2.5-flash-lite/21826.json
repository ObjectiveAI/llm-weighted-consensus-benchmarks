The keywords \"maternity leave\" and \"hardware retrieval\" suggest the need to choose between categories.  I'm leaning towards \"Hardware,\" as the term is explicit. However, \"HR Support\" has also come to mind. I'm focusing on refining this aspect.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket: HR Emphasis**\n\nI'm now focusing on categorizing the ticket as \"HR Support\". The presence of keywords like \"maternity leave,\" \"leaver form,\" and \"administration officer\" overwhelmingly points to this category. The initial instinct to lean towards \"Hardware\" due to the \"hardware retrieval\" element has evolved. It's becoming clearer that the hardware retrieval is a *consequence* of the HR-related process, rather than the primary focus.\n\n\n**Revising Category: Confirmed HR**\n\nI've thoroughly assessed the ticket, and the \"HR Support\" category continues to be the most appropriate. The recurring themes of \"maternity leave,\" \"leaver form,\" and \"administration officer\" solidify this choice. The \"hardware retrieval\" is now viewed as an action within an HR workflow, rather than an independent hardware issue. It's not a hardware problem itself, so \"HR Support\" will get it to the right person.\n\n\n"
