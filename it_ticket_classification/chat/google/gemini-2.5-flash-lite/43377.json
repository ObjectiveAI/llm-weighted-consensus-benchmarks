I'm carefully reviewing the description, paying close attention to keywords that align with the provided categories. It looks like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\" might be relevant, given the reference to \"starter filter\" and \"new starter\". I'll continue to analyze the context for a more precise fit.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Alignment**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket, focusing on \"new starter request\" and the \"filter\" issue. While access could be involved, the context suggests the problem lies in the onboarding process itself. Therefore, I believe \"HR Support\" is the most accurate category, reflecting the operational aspects of a new employee starting. This is now the primary direction.\n\n\n**Determining Primary Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket. The \"new starter request\" aspect, along with the \"filter\" issue, clearly points toward an onboarding process problem. Although access is a component, the primary concern is the incorrect processing or system functionality impacting the \"new starter\". Therefore, I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most precise fit, reflecting the operational nature of this issue.\n\n\n"
