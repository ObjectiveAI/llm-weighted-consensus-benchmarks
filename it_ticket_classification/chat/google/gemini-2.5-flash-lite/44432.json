After analyzing the text, my initial instinct is \"HR Support,\" as the description of a \"time card error\" strongly suggests a payroll or human resources issue. However, I'm also considering the possibility of \"Access\" if the inability to amend or submit is related to permissions, or \"Administrative Rights\" if the user has a related permissions problem, but HR seems the most likely based on the given information. I need to be sure before I make a final call!\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text and the available categories. My primary focus remains on determining the most appropriate classification. While the user's inability to \"amend or submit\" initially hinted at \"Access\" issues, the core problem is clearly a \"time card error.\" This points definitively toward \"HR Support.\" I've considered other options, but \"HR Support\" appears the most direct match.\n\n\n"
