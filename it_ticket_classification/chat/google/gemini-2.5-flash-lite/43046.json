The phrases \"access is not working\" and the mention of a date are primary clues. My aim is to select the most appropriate category from the options provided. The focus is to determine the best fit from the supplied options, using the provided phrases as guides. My goal is to assign the optimal category based on the available information.\n\n\n**Defining Access Issue Type**\n\nI've honed in on the ticket text and isolated phrases like \"access is not working\" and \"longer able connect.\" These point directly toward an access-related problem. Considering the category options, \"Access\" is the most fitting. I'm focusing on these keywords to establish a consistent categorization strategy. My objective is to create a process that reliably categorizes similar access issues in the future.\n\n\n"
