Based on the manager's inability to approve annual leave requests and the mention of a missing \"approval button,\" I've narrowed down the category. The details strongly suggest \"HR Support\" is the most fitting classification, as the core issue revolves around a function within Human Resources.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI've finalized the classification for the IT ticket. Given the specific mention of a manager's inability to approve \"annual leaves\" due to a missing \"approval button,\" the \"HR Support\" category most accurately reflects the core issue.\n\n"
