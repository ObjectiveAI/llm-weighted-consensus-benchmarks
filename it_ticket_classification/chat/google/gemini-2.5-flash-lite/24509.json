The provided text doesn't explicitly mention hardware, HR, access, storage, purchase, or admin rights. The terms \"new request\" and \"custom functionality\" suggest possibilities I'm still weighing. \"Informed\" and \"implemented\" are also key indicators.\n\n\n**Evaluating Navigation Needs**\n\nI've been drilling down on the text, particularly focusing on the navigation-related aspects and the requested custom functionality. The phrases \"hard navigate,\" \"easy navigate,\" and the specifics regarding site collections, sub-sites, and libraries are central. I'm now weighing the best fit considering \"Internal Project\" for the new functionality and \"Miscellaneous\" for the general navigation improvement request. \"Access\" also crossed my mind, but it appears less relevant than the others.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nI've carefully re-examined the ticket's core needs: custom functionality implementation, navigation enhancements (hard/easy navigation, back buttons, breadcrumbs, site linking, site collection/sub-site/library improvements), and enhancing the user experience.  The original categories, \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Administrative rights,\" were dismissed as irrelevant. The \"Internal Project\" classification seems most suitable, because this ticket involves changes, implementation, and future sprint planning, and therefore it resembles a project within an internal team.\n\n\n"
