I'm leaning towards \"HR Support,\" but I'm cross-referencing against the other categories to confirm.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've evaluated the ticket content extensively. It encompasses leave requests, accept/decline features, allowance details, and user-specific information. Considering these factors, I'm confident that \"HR Support\" is the optimal category. I've ruled out other categories as they don't encompass the core functionalities described in the ticket.\n\n\n"
