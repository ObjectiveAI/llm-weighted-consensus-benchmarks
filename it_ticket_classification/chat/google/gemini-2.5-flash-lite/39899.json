After analyzing the provided text, the most fitting category seems to be \"Access.\" I've considered other options, but the repeated attempts to establish a connection, coupled with the \"trying connect\" message, strongly suggest an access-related problem. I'm confident in this classification.\n\n\n**Revising Access Classification**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text and the available categories. My earlier classification of \"Access\" still appears correct, given the repeated mentions of \"connect\" and the phrase \"outside\". Although there is no explicit mention of VPN, the external connectivity problem points to access issues. I considered \"Miscellaneous\" as a fallback, but the specific wording points directly to connectivity difficulties. My final determination is to categorize this issue under \"Access.\"\n\n\n"
