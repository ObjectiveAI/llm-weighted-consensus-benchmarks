The recurring nature suggests a persistent issue. The fact that it reboots and functions again narrows the scope of the problem considerably. I'm focusing on the nature of the crash message to see if I can classify the failure.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Cause**\n\nI've honed in on the error message after restart. \"Windows on laptop crashed twice today\" and \"continues work\" gives me enough information that the issue is not critical, but persistent. My primary thought is towards a potential hardware malfunction, specifically, RAM, but the possibility of software incompatibility or driver issues is also on the table. This is an intermittent problem. I'm going to further research RAM and drivers.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nI've determined the issue clearly falls into the \"Hardware\" category. Repeated crashes, as described, strongly point to an underlying hardware malfunction. The presence of a screen with text post-restart further reinforces this. I've ruled out other categories like HR support, access, and miscellaneous, as they don't align with the technical nature of the problem. This is a solid classification.\n\n\n"
