After analyzing the text (\"missing time sheets sent friday sheets every submit never goes line manager get\"), my initial thought is that it might fall under \"HR Support\". However, I'm still evaluating this and considering other possibilities.\n\n\n**Confirming the Classification**\n\nI've taken a deep dive into the ticket text, and the initial hunch of \"HR Support\" appears to be the most accurate categorization. The key phrases related to time sheets, line manager approval, and delays align strongly with HR processes. While \"Administrative rights\" was briefly considered, the core issue centers on process, not system access. The definitive conclusion is \"HR Support,\" as the ticket's essence is an issue with HR documentation handling.\n\n\n"
