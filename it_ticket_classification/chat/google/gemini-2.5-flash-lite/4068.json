After analyzing the keywords, I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most suitable fit. The presence of terms like \"leaver\" and \"reminder\" strongly suggests an HR-related issue. This seems like it doesn't align with a strictly technical category like Hardware or Access. I will continue to explore other terms to see if this holds true.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the optimal classification. The ticket text's consistent focus on \"leaver form\" and related terms clearly points to an HR-related process. While there's a minor aspect of mailbox access, this is secondary to the central theme of employee departure documentation. The keywords, when examined in context, confirm that HR Support aligns best with the ticket's core issue.\n\n\n**Determining the Core Issue**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text and have honed in on the central problem. Focusing on the keyword \"leaver form\" highlights an HR-centric issue. Examining the context of phrases like \"reminder\" and \"submit leaver form\" solidifies my conclusion that this is not a technical access or hardware problem. The mailbox mention is ancillary, the priority being the leaver form.\n\n\n"
