My aim is to accurately map the described issue to one of the available categories, ensuring precise categorization for efficient resolution.\n\n**Categorizing Network Woes**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's details, focusing on the recurring themes of IP addressing limitations and network connectivity problems, including mentions of stack cables and slow terminal intervals. This leads me to classify it under \"Hardware\" due to the infrastructure and equipment components involved.\n\n**Resolving Network Bottlenecks**\n\nI'm presently refining my classification of this ticket. The repeated references to IP address shortages, stack cable issues, and slow terminal intervals strongly indicate a problem with the underlying network infrastructure and its connected equipment. Therefore, I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate category.\n\n**Confirming Hardware Classification**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the ticket's details, specifically noting the persistent issues with IP address availability, stack cables, and slow terminal performance. These elements strongly indicate a problem with the underlying network infrastructure and its associated equipment, leading me to confidently categorize this as a \"Hardware\" issue.\n\n"
