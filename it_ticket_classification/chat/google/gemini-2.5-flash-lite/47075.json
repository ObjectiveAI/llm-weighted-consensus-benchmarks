My primary goal is to identify keywords and phrases that align with the defined categories, specifically looking for indicators related to system access.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the text to classify the IT ticket. The repeated mentions of \"access,\" \"login,\" and the inability to reach project-related functionality strongly suggest the \"Access\" category is the most fitting. The need for an Excel add-in, while also present, seems secondary to the core problem of gaining entry and functionality.\n\n**Confirming Category Selection**\n\nMy analysis confirms \"Access\" is the most appropriate category. The repeated emphasis on login issues and inability to reach project functionalities, alongside mentions of installation for reporting, firmly places it here, overriding secondary concerns.\n\n"
