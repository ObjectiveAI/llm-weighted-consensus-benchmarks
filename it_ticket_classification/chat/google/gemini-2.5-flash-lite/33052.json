The terms \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and similar variations point towards a category related to onboarding or employee setup, but I haven't locked in on the precise category yet.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate category for the IT ticket. While \"Access\" could be relevant if it includes setting up accounts, the core issue revolves around \"new starter\" processes and the \"starter form.\" The consistent mentions of \"starter form\" and dates further solidify this categorization, indicating a broader focus on onboarding rather than specifically access-related issues.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text for a better understanding of the problem. It seems the key focus is not a direct access request, or some hardware issue, but the overarching process of a new employee starting, which involves managing the \"starter form.\" The consistent references to the \"starter form,\" \"new starter,\" and relevant dates solidify that this is a core HR function. I've narrowed it down even further to HR Support.\n\n\n"
