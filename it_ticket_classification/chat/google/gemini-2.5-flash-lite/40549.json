Given the description points to a \"wireless connection problem,\" I'm leaning towards a category directly related to network infrastructure or general support.\n\n**Deciding Ticket Category**\n\nI'm processing the IT ticket and focusing on its description of a \"wireless connection problem.\" After reviewing the available categories, I believe \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate classification, as this type of issue often stems from the user's device's wireless adapter or associated drivers.\n\n**Assigning the Ticket**\n\nI'm currently determining the best category for this IT ticket. The description mentions \"wireless connection problem\" and specifically points to an \"intel dual band wireless ac\" adapter being \"disconnected.\" This strongly suggests a hardware-related issue with the network interface card, leading me to classify it under \"Hardware.\"\n\n**Choosing the Category**\n\nI've decided to classify this IT ticket under \"Hardware.\" The recurring mention of \"wireless connection problem\" and specifically the \"wireless adapter disconnected\" with the \"intel dual band wireless ac\" detail strongly indicate an issue with the network interface card itself.\n\n"
