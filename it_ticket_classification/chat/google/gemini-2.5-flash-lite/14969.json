Access, storage, purchase, and internal project seem irrelevant. \"Miscellaneous\" feels like a cop-out, so I need to make a more informed choice. I'm leaning toward HR Support, pending further investigation into whether it's company property.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Options**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, specifically the phrase \"backpack rental.\"  \"HR Support\" still feels inaccurate. While \"Hardware\" is a possibility for specialized equipment, this sounds generic. Access, storage, purchase, and internal project remain off the mark. \"Miscellaneous\" still seems like the most general fit, but I'm checking to be absolutely certain before concluding.  I think I have a final answer on this.\n\n\n"
