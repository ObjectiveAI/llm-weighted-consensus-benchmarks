The repeated mentions of \"training,\" \"curricula,\" and \"assessment\" strongly suggest that **HR Support** is the leading candidate. I'm also considering whether this could fall under \"Internal Project\" as it seems to relate to improving internal processes.\n\n\n**Categorizing Training Requests**\n\nI've decided to prioritize \"HR Support\" for this ticket. The frequent mentions of training, assessment, and curriculum are key indicators. While an internal project is a possibility, the focus seems to be on HR-related functions like training needs and soft skills development.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR Alignment**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"HR Support\". The phrase \"HR Support\" has strong connections to  'training needs,' 'curriculum,' and 'assessment.' It resonates strongly with the ticket. While \"Internal Project\" is still a distant possibility, the primary focus remains HR. The described tasks focus specifically on HR functions related to soft skills development and internal training calendar creation.\n\n\n"
