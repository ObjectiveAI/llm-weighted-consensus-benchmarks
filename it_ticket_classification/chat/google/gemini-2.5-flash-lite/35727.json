Based on the \"lost badge\" mentions and the need to \"allocate\" a new one, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\". However, I'm still considering if it might overlap with \"HR Support\" given the physical security implications. I'm focusing on the access-related keywords to make the final determination.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Options**\n\nI've reviewed the categories and the ticket text, and I've zeroed in on \"Access\" as the most suitable option. The keywords \"lost badge\" and \"allocate badge\" are the defining factors. While \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" are tangentially relevant, the core issue is clearly access-related. My rationale excludes the other choices because they don't reflect the ticket's primary focus.\n\n\n"
