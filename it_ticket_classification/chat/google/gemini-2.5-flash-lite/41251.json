Phrases like \"wrong allocation hours\" and \"hours per\" suggest potential allocation or time tracking issues. The mention of \"oracle\" introduces a database element, and \"submitted before days off\" points to a process-related or possibly HR concern. I'm leaning toward either HR Support or Internal Project, given the limited information.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Scope**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"HR Support\" as the primary category for this IT ticket. The keywords \"wrong allocation hours,\" \"working hours,\" and the mention of \"days off\" strongly suggest an HR-related issue. While \"oracle\" indicates a system involved, its purpose within this context leans toward HR processes like time tracking and payroll management. I am ruling out options like \"Internal Project\" and \"Access\" as irrelevant.\n\n\n"
