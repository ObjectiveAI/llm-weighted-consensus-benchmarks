So far, \"error,\" \"delete,\" and \"enable\" suggest an access or software-related issue. \"Manage cards\" might indicate access, but I need further analysis to make an accurate determination. I'm considering \"Access\" and \"Miscellaneous\" as potential options.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket Category**\n\nI've refined my thinking, zeroing in on \"HR Support\" as the best categorization for the ticket. My analysis of keywords like \"timecards,\" \"resubmit,\" and \"manage cards\" solidified this direction. Comparing with other categories, I've discarded those not applicable to timekeeping issues. \"Access\" was considered but deemed less relevant, as the core problem lies within employee time management.\n\n\n"
