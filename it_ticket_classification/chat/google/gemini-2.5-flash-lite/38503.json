After analyzing the provided text (\"issues all agents are on make busy caller is on the line\"), I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the most relevant category. It seems to describe an issue with agent availability or status, which falls under access control. I'm double-checking to ensure this aligns perfectly.\n\n\n**Shifting Towards Classification**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket. Initially, \"Access\" seemed possible, but after a deeper dive into the text (\"issues all agents are on make busy caller is on the line...\"), I'm now leaning towards \"Miscellaneous.\" It's an operational issue linked to call handling and reporting. The problem description doesn't align with \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" or \"Administrative Rights.\" My aim is to select the best fit, and \"Miscellaneous\" appears the most suitable.\n\n\n"
