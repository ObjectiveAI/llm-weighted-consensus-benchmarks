The text analysis is complete, focusing on keywords relating to \"access cards,\" \"offices,\" and \"order.\"  My primary consideration is whether this is an access issue, which I am now thinking it most likely is. I am comparing the possible categories to my current understanding of the ticket.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Type**\n\nI've completed my analysis and categorized the IT ticket. After carefully evaluating keywords related to access card management, I've confirmed my initial assessment. \"Access\" is the most fitting category, considering the core theme revolves around the usage and control of physical access cards, and thus takes precedence over \"Purchase\" even though cards are ordered. I've ruled out other categories like Hardware and HR Support due to their less direct relevance. The chosen category aligns perfectly with the problem.\n\n\n"
