My focus is on identifying key terms within the ticket description to align it with one of the defined categories.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently processing the incoming ticket details, focusing on keywords like \"leaver,\" \"access,\" and \"storage.\" My aim is to precisely match these terms to the most relevant IT support category from the provided list to ensure efficient ticket routing.\n\n**Determining Leaver Ticket Category**\n\nI'm now focusing on assigning the most accurate category for IT tickets concerning employee departures. My analysis highlights keywords like \"leaver,\" \"access,\" and \"mailbox management\" as crucial indicators. I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the overarching category, as it best encompasses the coordinated actions IT performs when an employee leaves the company.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the detailed keywords within the provided text, such as \"leaver form,\" \"leaving date,\" and various access-related terms like \"ad forwarder\" and \"leaver mailbox.\" My current thought process is to definitively place this ticket under the \"HR Support\" category, as the entire set of described actions are intrinsically linked to the employee departure process, which is typically initiated and managed by HR.\n\n**Focusing on Offboarding Procedures**\n\nI'm currently refining my categorization, observing a strong emphasis on terms like \"leaver,\" \"leaving date,\" and \"ad forwarder.\" My analysis indicates that while \"Access\" is a significant component, the overarching context of employee departure strongly suggests \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate classification for this IT ticket.\n\n**Classifying Leaver Ticket**\n\nI'm currently refining my categorization for this IT ticket. My analysis of keywords like \"leaver form,\" \"leaving date,\" \"ad forwarder,\" and \"leaver mailbox\" confirms that the core of this request is tied to employee offboarding. While access and hardware are involved, the overarching context and likely initiation by HR strongly lead me to assign this to the \"HR Support\" category.\n\n**Processing Leaver Ticket Details**\n\nI'm currently refining my categorization. My analysis of keywords like \"leaver form,\" \"leaving date,\" and various access-related terms (\"ad forwarder,\" \"leaver mailbox\") confirms this ticket is intrinsically tied to the employee departure process. I am classifying this under \"HR Support\" as it represents IT's role in assisting HR with offboarding procedures.\n\n"
