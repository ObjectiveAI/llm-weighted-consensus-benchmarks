Based on the description \u2013 a missing \"approve button\" for a \"line manager\" on \"sheets\" \u2013 it's definitely a permissions issue, likely tied to a specific role or access level. The missing button suggests a configuration problem rather than a systemic software bug.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Root Cause**\n\nI'm now leaning heavily towards \"Access\" as the primary category, considering it encompasses permission issues more broadly. The \"approve button\" scenario for a \"line manager\" on \"sheets\" clearly signals a lack of the right to access and use the function. While \"Administrative rights\" is relevant, the core problem is simply that the user can't perform an action they should be able to.\n\n\n**Defining the Problem's Scope**\n\nI'm now weighing the nuance between \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" The missing \"approve button\" for a \"line manager\" to approve \"sheets\" definitely hinges on permissions. It's becoming clearer that the issue is the lack of *access* to a specific feature, the button, required to perform a task. While \"Administrative rights\" is relevant, the core problem is simply that the user can't do their job due to missing feature access. The line manager's role *should* entail this function.\n\n\n**Revising the Focus**\n\nI've revised the initial thinking and am now confident \"Access\" is the most fitting category. This comes from closely examining the missing \"approve button\" scenario for the \"line manager.\"  It's clear the problem is a lack of *access* to a specific feature required for a defined role function, rather than a broad administrative issue.  \"Administrative rights\" might involve broader system-level permissions, and that isn't the scope of this particular issue.\n\n\n**Defining the Solution's Scope**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Access\" as the right category. The evidence is mounting: the \"approve button\" is clearly a feature the line manager *needs access* to, regardless of how that access is granted. The fact that the user can't perform their intended action seals it \u2013 lack of access is the core problem. While \"Administrative rights\" might *enable* the access, the immediate issue is the lack of feature accessibility.\n\n\n\n**Confirming the Selection**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Access\" as the correct category. The issue of the missing \"approve button\" for the \"line manager\" boils down to a fundamental *lack of feature accessibility*. Despite the potential involvement of administrative rights in *granting* this access, the immediate problem remains the inability to use the button. This represents a direct access barrier, not a broader administrative issue.\n\n\n"
