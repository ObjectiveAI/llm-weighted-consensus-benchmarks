It's becoming clearer. \"Error submission of time entries\" points strongly away from hardware or access and toward something related to internal systems or HR processes.  I'm now contemplating between \"HR Support\" and \"Internal Project,\" focusing on the nature of the error and the potential support needed. The contact information in the ticket further clarifies the context of the ticket for me. I am leaning more toward the former.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI'm solidifying the issue as an error in time entry submission. The user needs guidance on their next steps. Access might play a small role, but the core problem revolves around submitting their time and receiving an error notification. The ticket details strongly indicate a functional issue with the system designed for time entry.\n\n\n**Clarifying the HR Context**\n\nI've narrowed it down to \"HR Support\". The time entry error is the crux. While \"access\" is mentioned, the core complaint stems from the submission process. I've re-examined the ticket details, now focusing on the \"error notification\" and the user's need for \"next steps.\" This reinforces the \"HR Support\" category, as it directly relates to a function managed within an HR-related system or process. The application of access is implied within the flow of an HR process.\n\n\n"
