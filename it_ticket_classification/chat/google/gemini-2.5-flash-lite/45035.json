This strongly suggests an \"Access\" problem, which I'm inclined to prioritize as the leading candidate. I'm carefully comparing the nuances of this issue to other potential categories, like \"Miscellaneous\" or a potential hardware glitch, but \"Access\" remains the most likely fit.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Culprit**\n\nI've narrowed the ticket's core problem down to \"Access\" \u2013 the user can't add to their dashboard and access a board.  It's not an HR, hardware, or purchase issue. I'm dismissing \"Administrative rights\" since the focus is on standard user access limitations, not administrator-level permissions. \"Access\" perfectly captures the root cause.\n\n\n"
