                    "reasoning": "**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently focused on the challenge of accurately categorizing this IT ticket. The text, \"new starter states friday july pm re completed please make procure license fast track,\" is being scrutinized to identify the most relevant category from the list: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\". My initial assessment points towards a \"Purchase\" related request, given the mention of procuring licenses.\n\n\n**Categorizing IT Request Deep Dive**\n\nI'm now focusing on a more nuanced categorization. Analyzing the \"new starter\" requests, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or a combined \"Access/Purchase\" category because they require software installation, credentials, and potential hardware or license procurement. The ticket text strongly emphasizes user setup and access-related needs, shifting from an initial pure \"Purchase\" focus. The recurring themes of software, credentials, and user enablement dominate the content.\n\n\n**Prioritizing User Setup**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the recurring emphasis is on new user setup. This involves software procurement and installation (Word, Excel, etc.), credentials provisioning, and some mention of necessary hardware. This points to either \"Access\" or a combined \"Access/Purchase\" category being the most appropriate. The requests center around enabling a new user to access systems and resources, more so than the simple act of procurement alone.\n\n\n**Integrating HR and Access**\n\nI'm now integrating insights from multiple tickets. Considering the recurring \"new starter\" theme and the onboarding forms, HR Support is clearly relevant. However, the need for software, licenses, credentials, and potential hardware also points to \"Access\" being vital. A combined category, \"HR Support/Access,\" best reflects the nature of this request. It's essentially about onboarding a new employee with the necessary access and tools, strongly involving HR processes.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Need**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the core concept. These tickets revolve around onboarding a new employee. Setting up a new starter encapsulates all the ticket's sub-tasks. \"HR Support,\" despite lacking explicit software install verbiage, encompasses all the actions. Procurement and provisioning are the end goals within the general support process. The request is not about simply purchasing licenses but enabling a new user to start, aligning with HR onboarding.\n\n\n"
