I'm leaning toward a category that encompasses onboarding or access, as it seems to be related to a new employee. I'm cross-referencing these keywords against my category options to find the best match.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Involvement**\n\nI've been further refining my thinking. Now, I'm focusing on \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category. The \"new starter\" and \"joining\" keywords, along with the onboarding context, point towards HR initiating the process. While access is a part of this, the ticket's emphasis is on the broader onboarding rather than a specific access problem. I'm confident in prioritizing HR involvement.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Origin**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the ticket's language, considering the terms \"new starter,\" \"joining,\" and \"compliance officer.\" I recognize the significance of these keywords in guiding me towards the appropriate IT support category. After comparing the options, \"HR Support\" appears the most pertinent. The description suggests a new employee onboarding, and the ticket's emphasis aligns with activities initiated by HR. I'm confident in classifying it as an HR support request.\n\n\n"
