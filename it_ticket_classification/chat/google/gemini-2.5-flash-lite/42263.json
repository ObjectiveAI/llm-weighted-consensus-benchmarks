After careful consideration of the text \"blocked by sever sent monday\" and \"blocked,\" I'm leaning towards \"Access,\" but I'm still weighing other options. I need to be sure that the chosen category truly reflects the core issue at hand.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text and the potential categories. The recurring theme of being \"blocked by server\" strongly points toward \"Access\". While there's a potential link to Storage, Access is the more immediate and fitting description of the problem. This categorization reflects the central issue: denied or restricted server interaction.\n\n\n**Clarifying Access Concerns**\n\nI'm now fully convinced that \"Access\" is the most precise category. The recurring phrase \"blocked by server\" throughout the ticket text firmly establishes this as the central problem. Keywords like \"test,\" \"release,\" and \"issues\" all point toward a need for server interaction, but the \"blocked\" element highlights the access restriction. It's a straightforward access denial.\n\n\n"
