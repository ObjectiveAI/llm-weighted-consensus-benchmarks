I'm finalizing this assessment before I proceed.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Root Cause**\n\nI've determined the access issue is the root cause after evaluating the ticket's keywords. Phrases like \"can't get access\" and connection issues point directly to access problems. Although other categories were considered, \"Access\" is the most precise and accurate classification for this ticket. My final assessment has been made before I proceed with the next step.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text and have decided the appropriate classification is \"Access.\" While other categories were assessed, the consistent mention of access difficulties and connection challenges strongly indicates this is the most fitting choice. The repetitive phrases, such as \"can get access\" and \"connection working but...\", solidify this decision.\n\n\n"
