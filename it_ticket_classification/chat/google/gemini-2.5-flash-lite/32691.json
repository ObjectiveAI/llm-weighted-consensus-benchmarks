The terms \"new starter,\" \"joining,\" and \"starter form complete\" strongly suggest an Access-related issue. Similarly, \"credentials\" reinforces this direction. I'm leaning toward selecting \"Access\" as the primary category for this ticket.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Ticket**\n\nI've carefully re-examined the ticket's language, considering the terms \"new starter,\" \"joining,\" and \"starter form complete\" alongside \"credentials.\" The context points towards onboarding. While \"Access\" is relevant, \"HR Support\" appears more comprehensive as the initial driver here is the HR-led process for a new employee. I'm focusing on the overall process.\n\n\n"
