My current focus is on the explicit mention of \"jabber removal,\" and I'm evaluating if \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" best represents this request, leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as it's not strictly an access revocation.\n\n**Classifying Application Removal**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket content, which centers on the removal of the \"Jabber\" application. Considering the available categories, I've determined that \"Miscellaneous\" best encompasses this request as it pertains to software functionality rather than hardware, access, HR, or procurement.\n\n"
