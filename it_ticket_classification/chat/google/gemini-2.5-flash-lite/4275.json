Based on the words like \"equipment\", \"screen\", and \"mouse\", I'm leaning heavily towards \"Purchase\" or possibly \"Hardware.\" The other categories don't seem like a strong fit, but I am still giving them some thought.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've been evaluating the keywords and possible categories. Phrases like \"additional equipment,\" \"screen,\" and \"mouse order\" point strongly toward \"Hardware.\" While \"Purchase\" is a possibility, \"Hardware\" seems more precise for these specific physical IT components. After a careful analysis of the ticket's text and the schema, I've eliminated \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative Rights\" as being less relevant. Based on the \"order\" context, \"Hardware\" appears to be the most fitting choice.\n\n\n"
