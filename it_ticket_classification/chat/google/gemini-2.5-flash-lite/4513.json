It seems to involve resource mirroring and an application, which leads me to lean towards a category that reflects application-related support. \"Internal Project\" is the likely best fit, but I am still giving \"Storage\" and \"Access\" consideration.\n\n\n**Revising Category Selection**\n\nHaving initially leaned towards \"Internal Project,\" I'm now re-evaluating, considering \"Storage\" as a potential primary category. The phrase \"mirroring resources\" points strongly towards data replication, which is storage-centric. However, \"Internal Project\" continues to be a possible secondary classification given the \"project tudor\" component. I'm focusing on finding the best balance in my categorizations.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've carefully re-examined the ticket, and \"Internal Project\" continues to be the most fitting primary category. While \"Storage\" is relevant, the core of this ticket appears centered around a project-related task: the mirroring of resources. \"Access\" is also possibly related, given the nature of a project, but it is not the most crucial aspect here. I am confident that \"Internal Project\" is the best primary fit.\n\n\n"
