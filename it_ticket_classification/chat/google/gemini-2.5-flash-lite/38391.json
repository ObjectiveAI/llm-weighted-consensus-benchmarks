This screams \"HR Support\" to me, as it deals with employee leave tracking. I am confident in this classification and will submit it shortly.\n\n\n**Revising Classification Approach**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's language, focusing on keywords like \"special leave\" and \"work hours.\" It's now crystal clear: this is a time-tracking problem closely tied to HR functions. I'm discarding the other categories, as they're irrelevant to the central issue of leave appearing incorrectly. I'm ready to formally categorize it as an HR support issue.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket, focusing on the core problem: \"special leave\" is incorrectly showing up as \"work hours\". The \"oracle time\" system mentioned further confirms this is a time-tracking error, an HR support issue. The manager's request to \"please help\" supports this. Given the central issue is the incorrect representation of leave as work, HR support is the correct path.\n\n\n"
