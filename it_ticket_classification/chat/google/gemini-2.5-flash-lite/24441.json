I'm hesitant to lock it in yet, and want to check on the context surrounding \"different\" and its use, just to be sure. However, it looks like this is the right category.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Issues**\n\nI've been drilling down on this ticket and the \"Access\" category feels the best fit. While \"Administrative Rights\" has come up in my head a few times, it seems that it is a less direct fit, since it is more focused on managing administrative privileges than specifically setting access permissions on content. The focus is specifically how users can *manage* the access. The document library context is a major key to the ticket, and I need to make sure I am covering all grounds.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Access Control**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Access\" category. The ticket focuses squarely on managing permissions for folders and document libraries. I've considered other categories, but access control is the direct concern. Even though \"administrative rights\" relates to access, it is less direct than the management of the setting itself for content. I've reviewed the request carefully to ensure \"Access\" is the best fit, and I feel confident.\n\n\n"
