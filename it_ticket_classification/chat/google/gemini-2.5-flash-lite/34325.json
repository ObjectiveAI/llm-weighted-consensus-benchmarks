The limited context suggests an urgency, with \"asap\" and \"since morning\" hinting at a time-sensitive issue, but the details are too sparse to make a concrete decision. I'll need more information before I can confidently place it within one of the defined categories.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe ticket text analysis is ongoing. The initial look pointed towards an \"Access\" issue due to \"rejected\" keywords. However, the second text block introduces \"requisition\" and \"data cabling,\" broadening the scope. The third block further confuses the picture, mixing requisition details with \"rejected\" mentions. I'm leaning toward \"Purchase\" or \"Access\", but the final categorization remains unclear. More context will be required.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nThe analysis is progressing. Given the repeated references to \"requisition,\" \"supplier,\" \"cost,\" and \"invoice,\" I'm now strongly leaning towards the \"Purchase\" category. The \"data cabling\" aspect further solidifies this. While \"Hardware\" might seem relevant, the core issue revolves around the procurement *process* and a rejected requisition. \"Purchase\" encompasses all these elements, making it the most appropriate classification, with \"Hardware\" being an important but subsidiary detail.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy analysis has culminated in a strong conviction. Though data cabling implies hardware, the repeated mentions of requisition, supplier, cost, invoice, and the rejection of the requisition itself, have driven me towards a \"Purchase\" category, which includes and emphasizes the procurement process more aptly than the technical hardware itself. The focus isn't a singular hardware failure; it's a breakdown in the purchasing flow.\n\n\n"
