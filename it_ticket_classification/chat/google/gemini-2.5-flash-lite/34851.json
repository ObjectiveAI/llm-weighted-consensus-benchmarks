I'm trying to interpret the user's issue to determine the correct category. The repeated mention of \"password changed\" seems to be a significant clue. I'm leaning toward either \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" but need more clarity before committing.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've refined my thinking on the ticket, focusing on the keywords and potential categories. The user's description, especially phrases about Outlook and password changes, strongly point towards an \"Access\" issue. I've ruled out other categories like \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" because they don't capture the core problem: the inability to access Outlook. The repeated mentions of passwords confirm the need to address access issues.\n\n\n"
