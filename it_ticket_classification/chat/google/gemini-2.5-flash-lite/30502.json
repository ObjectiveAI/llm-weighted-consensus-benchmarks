The keywords \"leaver,\" \"mobile phone,\" \"subscription plan,\" and \"mailbox\" are key. I'm leaning heavily towards a specific category based on the context of those mentions. I need to make sure the category chosen accurately reflects the need.\n\n\n**Revising Categorization Focus**\n\nI'm reconsidering the initial categorization. While \"HR Support\" seemed promising given the \"leaver\" context, the specifics push me toward \"Access\". Managing a departing employee's access to their phone (deactivation/reassignment) and mailbox are primary needs. HR often triggers these access-related actions. The hardware aspect is secondary.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Decision**\n\nI've decided on the \"HR Support\" category, as the primary context is an employee departure (\"leaver\").  The \"mobile phone\" and \"mailbox\" elements are tasks typically handled during offboarding, an HR-driven process. While \"Access\" is relevant, the overall scenario aligns better with the wider HR context. I think \"HR Support\" accurately captures the essence of the ticket.\n\n\n"
