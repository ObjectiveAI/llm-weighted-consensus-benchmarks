After analyzing the text, my initial instinct is leaning towards \"HR Support\". The presence of terms like \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" strongly suggests an HR-related matter. I will need to consider whether other categories apply, but this feels like the most likely fit.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Options**\n\nI'm now carefully sifting through the list of potential categories. \"Hardware\", \"Storage\", and \"Purchase\" can be immediately ruled out. While \"Access\" is a possibility due to \"Oracle\", the predominant themes of \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" still strongly suggest \"HR Support.\" I'm also considering \"Administrative rights\", but I believe \"HR Support\" captures the essence more accurately.\n\n\n**Confirming HR as the Focus**\n\nI'm now certain that \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category. My analysis of the text confirms the predominant themes of new employee onboarding and related forms. Although \"Oracle\" suggests a possible access issue, the core of the ticket revolves around the initiation of the onboarding process, firmly placing it within the realm of HR responsibilities.\n\n\n"
