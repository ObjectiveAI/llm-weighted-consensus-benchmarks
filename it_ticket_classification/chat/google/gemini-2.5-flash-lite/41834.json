While other categories might be relevant, the \"certificate error,\" \"non-secure connection\" and \"verified yet\" keywords are leading me to prioritize security considerations. I am leaning towards flagging this ticket with high urgency.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Root Issue**\n\nMy current focus is on the correct category. Initially, 'Access' seemed fitting, as certificate issues impact secure access. However, the phrases \"certificate error\" and \"non secure connection\" are steering me toward a broader interpretation. The problem is fundamentally a system-level security issue with SSL/TLS protocols. Evaluating the available options, the best fit is still a bit ambiguous, but a more accurate representation would be closer to 'Miscellaneous' because the problem touches on underlying system configuration rather than a specific hardware, HR or Access issue.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Problem**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the root cause. While \"Access\" seems initially relevant given the potential access blockage, the emphasis on the \"certificate error\" and \"non-secure connection\" leans me towards a more fundamental system issue with SSL/TLS protocols, not specifically about users' access privileges. I'm wavering between \"Access\" and \"Miscellaneous\", recognizing the issue's broader impact on secure communication. Despite the potential access disruption, I'm finding 'Miscellaneous' to be a better descriptor of the underlying problem as it's not a direct access issue.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket's Scope**\n\nI'm now focusing on the ticket's scope. Considering the presented text, and my current list of possible categories, I'm leaning toward 'Access'. Even though the issue is rooted in certificate verification, the user's report of a \"non secure connection\" strongly suggests their access to a resource, namely the logo, is being hindered. I am now more strongly considering this to be the most fitting label.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Selection**\n\nMy thinking has shifted again, now focusing on the precise nature of the issue. Initially leaning towards \"Access\", I'm reconsidering whether it's the most accurate representation of the core problem. The \"non secure connection\" and \"certificate error\" point towards a fundamental security misconfiguration. While access is impacted, the root cause isn't necessarily a simple access right issue. I'm wavering between \"Access\" and the broader \"Miscellaneous\", recognizing the issue's security implications, although there is a more clear relation to access.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nHaving reviewed all options, I've confirmed my choice. The \"Access\" category encapsulates the core problem. The root of the issue lies in a security misconfiguration. Although potentially impacting underlying system settings, it directly hinders secure access to the logo. Therefore, this ticket clearly warrants the 'Access' classification.\n\n\n"
