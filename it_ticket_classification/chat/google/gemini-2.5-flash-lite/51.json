The keywords \"leaver,\" \"form,\" and \"leave\" strongly suggest an HR-related issue.  I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most suitable classification for this ticket, and will use that classification.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Origin**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's language, and while IT tasks are involved, the core issue stems from an employee's departure, a process usually managed by HR. My analysis reinforces the initial assessment, and I'm confident \"HR Support\" accurately reflects the ticket's primary focus, despite the presence of many IT-related details.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Assignment**\n\nI've refined my initial thinking, and am now confident in assigning this ticket to \"HR Support.\" The recurring theme of \"leaver\" is paramount. Although many IT tasks are involved, these are **consequences** of the core HR-related trigger: the employee's departure. This distinction clarifies that \"HR Support\" captures the essence of the ticket, despite its technical aspects. I've considered all other categories, and none are a better fit.\n\n\n"
