The core of the issue seems to revolve around the functionality of specific buttons within the time card submission process. I'm weighing the options of \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Access\" to determine which best represents this particular problem.\n\n**Refining Time Card Categorization**\n\nI've reviewed the IT ticket's details. The inability to proceed with time card submission, specifically the missing \"next\" and \"submit\" buttons, strongly suggests an HR system function issue. Considering the provided categories, \"HR Support\" appears to be the most fitting classification for this type of user problem.\n\n**Classifying the Time Card Issue**\n\nI've examined the IT ticket's specifics again. The core of the problem, the absence of functional \"next\" and \"submit\" buttons within the time card submission flow, clearly aligns with an HR system functionality defect. Therefore, I've decided \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate classification.\n\n"
