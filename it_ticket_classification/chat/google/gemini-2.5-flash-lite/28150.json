Phrases like \"employment,\" \"cancel his accounts,\" and \"close initiated processes\" strongly suggest this ticket relates to HR support and managing user access during an exit.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the provided IT ticket text to pinpoint the most suitable category from the given options. My analysis hinges on identifying keywords that strongly correlate with employee lifecycle events, specifically focusing on terms related to employment status and account management.\n\n"
