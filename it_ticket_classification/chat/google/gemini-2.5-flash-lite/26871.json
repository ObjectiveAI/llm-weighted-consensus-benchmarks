The phrases \"request feedback form\" and \"feedback form hello colleagues went\" suggest an administrative or possibly miscellaneous function, rather than hardware, HR, or access issues.\n\n**Determining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm currently processing the text to ascertain the most suitable IT ticket category. The phrases \"feedback form\" and \"app noticed unable feedback peoples\" lean towards either an administrative function or a miscellaneous request, as it doesn't directly relate to hardware, HR, or access issues.\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI'm currently weighing the nuances of \"feedback form,\" \"app,\" and \"approvals\" to pinpoint the most accurate IT ticket category. While \"Miscellaneous\" remains a strong contender, I'm exploring if \"HR Support\" or a more specific category could better encompass a request involving feedback processes and necessary authorizations within an application.\n\n**Reviewing Feedback Category**\n\nI'm currently refining the categorization of the request. While \"Miscellaneous\" initially seemed fitting due to the mention of \"feedback form\" and an \"app,\" the inclusion of \"approvals required\" alongside \"peoples\" is prompting a closer look at \"HR Support.\" It's possible this relates to an employee feedback process requiring authorization.\n\n**Revisiting Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm re-evaluating the most fitting IT ticket category. While the initial analysis pointed towards \"Miscellaneous\" due to the \"feedback form\" and \"app\" mentions, the phrase \"approvals required\" is leading me to consider \"HR Support\" more closely, as it might pertain to a process involving employee feedback requiring authorization.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently processing the text to select the most appropriate IT ticket category. Given the mention of \"feedback form\" and \"approvals required,\" I'm leaning towards \"HR Support,\" as this often relates to employee feedback processes and workflows.\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the available categories against the ticket's details. The phrase \"request feedback form\" coupled with \"approvals required\" strongly suggests a process that falls under \"HR Support,\" likely related to employee feedback mechanisms or workflows.\n\n"
