After analyzing the issue description, \"server hello after returned holidays,\" the problem seems technical. My initial leaning is towards \"Hardware\" or \"Access,\" but I need to consider it further.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Root Cause**\n\nI've been drilling down on the root cause. While \"Hardware\" seems a possibility due to the server's role, \"Access\" feels more accurate given the consistent theme of failed connections and authentication problems. The certificate issue is a strong contender too. The user can't connect, can't authenticate, and the certificate might be the key to both, leaning towards an \"Access\" issue with a potential underlying certificate problem impacting secure connections.\n\n\n**Finalizing Access Determination**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the issue, considering hardware, HR, and other potential categories. The critical factor is the user's inability to connect and authenticate. The error messages strongly suggest an access problem stemming from a probable certificate issue. The server connectivity and authentication failures directly point to a lack of access, confirming my previous categorization choice. This reinforces \"Access\" as the precise classification for this IT ticket.\n\n\n"
