The system is designed to categorize the tickets into Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I'm exploring the text for keywords and context clues to determine the best fit.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Issues**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket text: \"problem with problem with hello experienced some issues trying use error being displayed try access picture attached can you please help with thanks have great manager.\" The key phrase \"try access\" strongly suggests an access-related issue. This is more specific than the generic problem descriptions and aligns well with the \"Access\" category. While \"error being displayed\" could be related to software or hardware, the focus on access makes \"Access\" the most appropriate. I'm confident in categorizing this ticket as \"Access\".\n\n\n"
