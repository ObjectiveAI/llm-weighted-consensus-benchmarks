The focus on authentication points definitively to access problems.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Category**\n\nI'm solidifying the \"Access\" category. The focus on password resets and expired credentials leaves no room for doubt. It's a clear fit for access-related problems. I will construct the appropriate JSON output based on this conclusion. My plan is to produce the output according to the given schema which just needs a category key.\n\n\n"
