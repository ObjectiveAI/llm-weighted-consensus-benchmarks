Based on the provided text mentioning \"changes oracle pm changes,\" I'm leaning towards \"Administrative rights\" or potentially a \"Miscellaneous\" category, as it seems to relate to system modifications. Further analysis is needed to determine the exact nature of these changes and if they require specific access rights.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Choices**\n\nI've refined my thinking on the ticket categorization. While system changes are present, the \"recent changes leavers\" phrase is a strong indicator of an HR-related issue.  \"HR Support\" seems the most fitting category, as it aligns with employee offboarding and associated data management or access modifications. The request for assistance with \"logging\" may be an aspect within this broader HR context.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket text carefully, considering all options. While system changes and logging were initially considered, \"recent changes leavers\" proved to be the pivotal phrase. This strongly suggests the issue stems from an HR-related context, likely concerning employee offboarding processes. Therefore, I'm confident that \"HR Support\" is the correct category, aligning precisely with the described scenario.\n\n\n"
