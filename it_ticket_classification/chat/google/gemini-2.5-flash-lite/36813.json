I will narrow it down to the most appropriate IT category, considering the provided list and the context of the error.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Access Issue**\n\nI've refined the ticket classification. The connection and login failures strongly suggest an access-related problem. While other categories were considered, \"Access\" best encapsulates the core issue. I've ruled out Hardware, HR Support, Storage, Purchase, and Internal Project. \"Miscellaneous\" remains, but I believe \"Access\" provides more precise categorization. I'll document my reasoning for auditability.\n\n\n**Determining the Root Cause**\n\nI've examined the ticket details more closely. The connection failures and login issues point directly to an access-related problem, confirmed by my in-depth analysis. Access problems are now strongly indicated, and I've ruled out all other candidates.\n\n\n"
