After careful consideration of the available options, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" since the director is attempting a function related to user permissions and access rights within the system. The missing \"save\" option suggests an issue with the user's ability to modify data, which falls under access control.\n\n\n**Revising the Classification**\n\nI've re-evaluated the categorization. While \"Access\" seemed plausible initially, the HR context became clearer. The issue is a block in an HR-related workflow (line manager changes). The \"save only\" symptom now feels secondary to the HR process breakdown. Therefore, \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate classification.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"HR Support\" as the definitive category for this ticket. After deeper analysis, the director's inability to \"submit\" a line manager change, despite having the \"save\" option, aligns perfectly with an HR-related system issue. It isn't just a matter of access rights; it's a break in an HR workflow. \"HR Support\" best reflects the core of the problem.\n\n\n"
