Booking meeting rooms leans towards \"Miscellaneous\" or potentially \"Access\" if it involves permissions. However, neither seems perfect. Perhaps there's an internal process that fits, so I'm considering \"Internal Project.\"\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've decided to categorize this as \"Miscellaneous.\"  While \"Access\" initially seemed relevant due to the potential for permission issues, the core problem centers around a booking system's functionality. It's not a hardware issue, HR-related, storage-related, a purchase request, or an internal project. Ultimately, \"Miscellaneous\" best encompasses the service-specific nature of this booking issue.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Miscellaneous\" as the most appropriate category. Thinking it over, the nature of the issue (a booking system error) doesn't warrant a more specific category from the available options. The initial hesitation about it being an \"Access\" issue proved unfounded upon closer examination of the ticket details. The core problem is with the booking service itself.\n\n\n"
