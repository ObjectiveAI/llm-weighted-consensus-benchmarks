It seems the focus is on a \"new starter,\" so I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most relevant category. There's a strong indication of onboarding or a similar process. However, I'm still weighing other options just to be sure. I'm taking a moment to cross-reference similar tickets.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR Onboarding**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. The \"starter form\" element is particularly persuasive. While access might be involved later, the current text focuses heavily on the initial onboarding procedures that HR usually handles. I'm now certain that the \"HR Support\" category is the best fit, as the ticket clearly relates to this process.\n\n\n**Refining Onboarding Focus**\n\nI've considered all the data, and my thought process led me to conclude that HR Support is the best category. The \"new starter\" focus and the explicit mention of a \"starter form\" strongly indicate that this ticket falls under the HR onboarding process. This often involves IT provisioning, but the primary task aligns with an HR support request. I'm confident now.\n\n\n"
