The provided text is brief, so initial analysis suggests it could be \"HR Support,\" particularly given the mention of \"annual leave.\" However, I'm carefully considering other possibilities, ensuring I don't overlook any potential keywords or context that could point to a different category, like \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" even though they seem less likely. I'm aiming for a definitive classification.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"HR Support\" category as the most appropriate classification for this ticket. The phrases \"annual leave submission issue\" solidify the connection to HR processes. While other categories were considered, the explicit mention of leave makes \"HR Support\" the clear frontrunner. I'm now confident in this assignment.\n\n\n"
