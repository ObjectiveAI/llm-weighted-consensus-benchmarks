The user's input, despite its brevity and unusual wording, seems to point towards a hardware-related issue, possibly allocation-related. The mention of \"non starter hardware\" is a key indicator. I am also considering a category for this if no match is found. I need to make sure that the assigned category accurately reflects the essence of the problem described.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Hardware Focus**\n\nI've honed in on the \"Hardware\" category. Although phrases like \"never hired\" initially suggested \"HR Support\", the central issue appears hardware-centric. \"Hardware allocation\" is the critical phrase. I've re-evaluated other conversational elements and concluded that they support, rather than contradict, this categorization. The core request revolves around hardware, making \"Hardware\" the most fitting choice, despite the unusual wording of the ticket description.\n\n\n"
