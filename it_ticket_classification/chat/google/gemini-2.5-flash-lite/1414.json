After analyzing the request for an \"external account password reset,\" I'm leaning toward the \"Access\" category. However, I want to ensure this is the most accurate fit before moving forward.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've further refined my initial assessment. The provided ticket text is definitely a password reset request. I've now firmly classified this as an \"Access\" issue, given that it deals explicitly with an external account's access. The other categories don't seem like good fits.\n\n\n**Determining Access Type**\n\nI've examined the ticket text. The emphasis on an \"external account password reset\" solidified my categorization. It is evidently an \"Access\" issue; no other category is truly applicable. I'm ready to mark the ticket as such.\n\n\n"
