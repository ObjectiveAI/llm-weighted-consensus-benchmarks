After a careful review of the description, \"new starter december pm starter form ext,\" I'm currently leaning towards either \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" I'm carefully weighing the implications of \"starter form\" and considering how this might relate to access provisioning or HR-related onboarding.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best fit. Having considered the ticket description \"new starter december pm starter form ext,\" and eliminated Hardware, Storage, Purchase, and Internal Project, the remaining choices are HR Support, Access, and Miscellaneous. Since the ticket involves a \"starter form,\" and new starter onboarding is primarily an HR process, I think \"HR Support\" is the most encompassing. However, the connection to Access is also clear, given the need for systems access. This means I'll need to consider this possible secondary categorization, to ensure all aspects are adequately addressed.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nI've narrowed the choices to HR Support and Access after carefully reviewing the ticket, \"new starter december pm starter form ext.\" I've ruled out all other categories as less relevant. While \"Access\" seems relevant due to the necessity for system access for new starters, \"HR Support\" appears broader and directly related to the \"starter form,\" suggesting the primary trigger lies with HR. Therefore, while Access may be needed, HR Support takes precedence.\n\n\n"
