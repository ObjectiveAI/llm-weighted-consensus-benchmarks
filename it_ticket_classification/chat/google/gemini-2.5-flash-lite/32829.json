The ticket text references \"cable\" and \"resources,\" leading me to believe it's an \"Access\" issue, though \"Storage\" is also a possibility due to the mention of resources. The text's brevity makes a definitive categorization challenging, and further refinement may be needed.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the initial \"Access\" categorization for the IT ticket. While the \"access to resources\" phrase remains a strong indicator, I'm now considering the context further. The \"cable\" reference is still a key factor, but more so related to its function in providing access. The inability to join calls and perform simple tasks seems related to a network, which strongly supports \"Access\".\n\n\n**Reiterating Access Concerns**\n\nI've honed in on the \"Access\" category for this IT ticket. The user's inability to access resources via the \"cable\" is the core issue. Blocking joining calls and simple task completion, it sounds very network-related. I eliminated other categories based on their lack of relevance to resource access and the described symptoms. My categorization is a direct match, given the described symptoms and keywords.\n\n\n"
