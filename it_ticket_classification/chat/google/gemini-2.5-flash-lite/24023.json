The text mentions \"increase memory\" and a \"mailbox almost full,\" which suggests issues related to storage or hardware. I'm leaning towards a few possibilities, and I'll need to carefully consider the best fit before committing to one.\n\n\n**Determining Primary Issue**\n\nI've decided to prioritize the hardware category, given that \"increase memory\" is the central request. The \"mailbox almost full\" part could be related to storage, but the primary focus seems to be on RAM. After reviewing the options, I think \"Hardware\" aligns most closely with the explicit need.\n\n\n**Confirming Hardware Priority**\n\nI'm solidifying my classification of the IT ticket. While the \"mailbox\" text pointed me toward storage initially, the specific request for an \"increase memory\" solidly places this in the hardware realm. RAM seems to be the central issue and my choice of \"Hardware\" is the correct categorization.\n\n\n"
