Phrases like \"scottish holidays\" are leading me towards HR Support, but the other half of the phrase is cut off. I need to be more careful, and expand my search to cover other likely categories based on the full text. I'm building a more robust keyword dictionary to improve accuracy.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR-Related Issues**\n\nMy focus is narrowing in on the HR Support category. The phrases \"scottish holidays,\" \"allowance,\" and \"public holidays\" are consistently recurring, pointing decisively toward HR-related concerns.  I'm building a keyword list to recognize those terms.  I am confident that this ticket is about managing holidays and allowances within an HR context. This seems like a better fit than an internal project, though it could be related.\n\n\n**Analyzing Holiday Requests**\n\nMy analysis now definitively points to \"HR Support\" as the appropriate category. Phrases like \"adding Scottish public holiday scheme\" and \"our allowance\" cement this classification. I've re-evaluated all possible categories and determined that \"HR Support\" best fits the ticket's core issue of managing and configuring holiday-related settings. This is a solid classification, based on the specific language used within the ticket text.\n\n\n"
