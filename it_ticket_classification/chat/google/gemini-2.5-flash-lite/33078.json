My current thinking points toward \"Access\" as the most relevant category. I'm double-checking to ensure no other category aligns better, but access permissions seem to be the primary issue.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nMy analysis now leans toward \"Internal Project\" as the appropriate category. While \"Access\" initially seemed relevant, the specific issue of \"cannot add change forecasts\" better aligns with project management functionalities and data handling within an internal project context. I'm satisfied that this choice is the most accurate given the current information. I might need to clarify with the user to confirm this is indeed the problem.\n\n\n**Confirming the Domain**\n\nI'm now quite certain that \"Internal Project\" is the correct category for this ticket. The phrases \"change forecasts,\" \"data and projects,\" and \"resources estimates\" all point directly towards project management activities. While access might be a contributing factor, the core issue is the *inability to perform* a project-related function. I've re-evaluated \"Administrative Rights,\" but the focus remains on the *process* of adding forecasts within a project context. This reinforces my confidence that \"Internal Project\" is the most accurate classification.\n\n\n**Selecting the Primary Domain**\n\nMy ongoing analysis continues to emphasize the \"Internal Project\" category as the most accurate fit. Focusing on the core phrase \"cannot add change forecasts,\" combined with the project-related keywords, solidifies this choice. The inability to execute a project-related function is the core of the issue. I am satisfied with this conclusion.\n\n\n"
