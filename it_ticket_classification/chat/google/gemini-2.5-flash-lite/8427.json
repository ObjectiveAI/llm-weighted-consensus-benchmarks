Currently, I'm focusing on \"leaver still active,\" \"decommissioned location,\" and \"disable SN,\" which point towards potential access-related issues and system changes. This data needs more context, but initial categorization suggests access management and location/system decommissioning could be involved. I'm aiming to refine this with further context.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Categories**\n\nI've narrowed down the categorization focus to \"Access\" based on the ticket's language. The terms \"leaver still active\" and \"disable his sn\" firmly place this ticket within an access management context. My analysis also confirms the importance of user account deactivation, strengthening the relevance of the \"Access\" category. While other categories were considered, \"Access\" best captures the primary concerns revealed in the ticket description.\n\n\n"
