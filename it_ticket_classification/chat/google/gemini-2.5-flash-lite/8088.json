Based on the provided text, I'm leaning toward the \"HR Support\" category, given the terms \"new starter\" and \"joiners.\" However, the lack of specific details makes me cautious. I'm carefully weighing the limited context against the available categories in the schema. I'm exploring the nuances to ensure the most accurate categorization.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Choice**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's text: \"new starter belgrade belgrade october hello please find attached two joiners thank regards administrator\". My prior focus on \"HR Support\" still holds, especially considering the \"new starter\" and \"joiners\" context. I've eliminated \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" because they aren't relevant. \"Access\" is connected, but \"HR Support\" captures the broader onboarding. Similarly, \"Administrative rights\" is a detail of the onboarding process. \"Miscellaneous\" and \"Internal Project\" are too broad and specific, respectively. Based on the analysis, I feel confident that \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"HR Support\" classification. Analyzing the provided text (\"new starter belgrade belgrade october hello please find attached two joiners thank regards administrator\") and considering each schema category, \"HR Support\" is the most encompassing. It addresses the onboarding context better than \"Access\" or the more general \"Miscellaneous\". I've ruled out all other options (\"Hardware\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", \"Administrative rights\") as they don't adequately capture the ticket's primary purpose. The focus on new starters and joiners strongly supports this final decision.\n\n\n"
