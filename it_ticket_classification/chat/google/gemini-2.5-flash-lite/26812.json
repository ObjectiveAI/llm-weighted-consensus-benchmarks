This will help me assign it to the correct bucket from the provided list.\n\n**Resolving Employee Data**\n\nI'm currently identifying keywords that strongly indicate an HR Support categorization. The mention of \"direct reports missing time\" and processes for \"submitting weekly basis\" alongside references to individuals who have \"left\" points towards managing personnel data and workflows.\n\n**Classifying the IT Ticket**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the provided text, focusing on keywords like \"direct reports missing time,\" \"left,\" and \"weekly basis.\" My current assessment strongly leans towards classifying this ticket under HR Support due to its clear connection to employee time management, personnel changes, and adherence to established reporting processes.\n\n"
