I've noted the mention of \"prepare for the new survey quarter.\" This hints at a potential alignment with \"Internal Project\" or possibly \"HR Support.\" I'm continuing to analyze the context for a more precise match, considering other potential categories.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the IT ticket text, and the central theme clearly revolves around contact management and survey preparation, with a strong emphasis on data accuracy and contact validity for the upcoming survey quarter. Keywords like \"nominate contacts,\" \"check contact info,\" and \"customer care sends surveys\" are recurring. The user seems to be facing issues with contact list updates and associated processes.\n\n\n**Categorizing Administrative Tasks**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Administrative rights\" as the primary category for this IT ticket. The focus is clearly on actions related to managing survey data, contact lists, and system configurations. The user's requests revolve around performing administrative tasks like adding/editing contacts, using spreadsheets, verifying data accuracy, and confirming eligibility for surveys. While \"Internal Project\" is a possible secondary category, the core need seems to be guidance on *how* to perform administrative duties.\n\n\n**Clarifying Category Alignment**\n\nI'm now refining my categorization based on further analysis. While \"Access\" is a possibility, the core issue is how to perform administrative actions related to survey data. The user seems to need guidance on *how* to use the system's administrative features. They mention adding contacts, editing, using spreadsheets, verifying data, checking visibility, and obtaining client approval. Therefore, \"Administrative rights\" is the strongest fit.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Administrative Rights\" and \"Access\" as the prime candidate categories. The recurring theme is the user needing guidance or configuration to manage survey-related data: adding contacts, editing, spreadsheet uploads, and verifying data accuracy. \"Internal Project\" is still a secondary possibility. They require support for system configuration or process knowledge to perform administrative actions. The recurring phrase \"editing contact doesn't work\" confirms this.\n\n\n**Focusing on Core Tasks**\n\nI am now focusing on the ticket's core intent. I've concluded that \"Administrative Rights\" is the closest match, even though \"Access\" and \"Internal Project\" were considered. The user is asking about actions related to data management, data editing, and access for surveys, all of which align best with administrative tasks. I'm still trying to confirm if this user requires help on the processes or is an issue with configuration itself.\n\n\n"
