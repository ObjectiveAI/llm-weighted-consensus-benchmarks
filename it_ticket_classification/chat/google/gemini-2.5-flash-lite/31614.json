My goal is to determine the most fitting IT ticket category. Considering the keywords \"new starter\" and \"joining\", I believe it leans towards **HR Support** or possibly **Access**, but \"administration officer\" suggests it may also be administrative, so I'm also considering **Administrative rights**. I'm weighing these against the other options now.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR and Access**\n\nI'm now focusing on how the \"new starter\" aspects are best addressed. While \"Administrative rights\" remains a possibility, the primary need seems HR-centric with potential access implications. Analyzing the terms \"joining\" and \"completed form\" strengthen this conclusion. My analysis now zeroes on prioritizing \"HR Support\" with \"Access\" as a potential secondary classification to best match the core of the request.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now focusing on the core issue: categorization. \"HR Support\" appears most accurate based on the text. Although \"Access\" could be relevant, the ticket's primary focus, with the \"new starter,\" \"joining,\" and \"completed form,\" clearly centers around HR onboarding and administration. Therefore, I believe \"HR Support\" best fits this.\n\n\n"
