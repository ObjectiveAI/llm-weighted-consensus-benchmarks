I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\" but need to consider the context more carefully. I'm eliminating categories like \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase\" at this point.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Scope**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on the core issue: controlling access to confidential client data on the platform. The \"Access\" category is looking like the best choice, especially considering the need to take down information immediately and add security layers. While \"Storage\" was considered, the emphasis is now definitively on *who* can access the data, not the storage medium. I've ruled out \"Miscellaneous\" as \"Access\" is more precise.\n\n\n"
