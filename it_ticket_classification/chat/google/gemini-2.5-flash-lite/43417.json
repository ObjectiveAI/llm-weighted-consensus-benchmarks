Based on the \"connection\" problem and inability to access client servers, my initial leaning is towards \"Access\" or potentially \"Hardware.\" However, the exact nature of the connection problem is still unclear. I'm exploring whether network configuration or physical hardware are the root cause.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Categorization**\n\nI've carefully considered the issue description, weighing each category meticulously. I've ruled out options like \"Hardware\" since the issue's core is connectivity. \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility but feels less direct than the overarching \"Access\" category. Based on the user's struggle to connect and access client servers, \"Access\" is the most accurate classification. I am now confident this is correct.\n\n\n"
