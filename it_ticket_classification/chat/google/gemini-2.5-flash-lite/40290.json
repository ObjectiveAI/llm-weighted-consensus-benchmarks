The phrase \"not able to access\" coupled with \"network\" and \"proxy\" strongly points towards an \"Access\" related issue. I've ruled out other categories such as \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and \"Purchase\" because they don't capture the essence of the problem. Further investigation will be needed to be completely sure, but \"Access\" is looking like the best fit.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Type**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the ticket description, focusing on key phrases and potential categories. The user's inability to access a \"stable environment\" due to network and proxy problems strongly indicates an \"Access\" issue. I've considered other categories, but \"Access\" best encapsulates the core problem of resource unavailability caused by network-related factors. The focus is on *access*, making this category the most precise match.\n\n\n"
