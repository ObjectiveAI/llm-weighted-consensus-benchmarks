The phrase \"new joiners\" is a clear indicator, and I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" or \"Access,\" but I need to consider more context to be sure. I'm carefully weighing the candidate categories.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter reviewing the ticket again, I've decided to refine the category. The \"approvals\" aspect pointed me toward \"Access\" initially, but upon further reflection, the emphasis on new employees and leave requests makes \"HR Support\" a much better fit.  I'm confident that the core request falls squarely within HR-related processes.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. While \"Access\" seemed plausible initially due to the approval requests, the emphasis on \"new joiners\" and \"leave approvals\" significantly shifts the focus towards HR-related processes. After a comprehensive review, I've eliminated \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights\" because they don't align with the ticket's core content. I'm choosing \"HR Support\" because the ticket's language and content are clearly more about HR functions than IT access alone.\n\n\n"
