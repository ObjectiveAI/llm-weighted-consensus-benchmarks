The provided text, relating to a new employee's onboarding, seems to point towards a need for Access or HR Support, but there could be more nuances. I'm carefully analyzing the provided text for relevant keywords to refine my category selection process.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Focus**\n\nMy current thinking is that this ticket leans heavily towards HR Support. While a new starter will eventually need IT access, the immediate request is clearly about completing the onboarding form. The keywords strongly reinforce this conclusion. I'm prioritizing the HR angle, recognizing that access requests often stem from HR processes. My immediate goal is to finalize the categorization, keeping in mind that the underlying need for access may become apparent later.\n\n\n**Narrowing HR Connection**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the strong HR connection. The \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" keywords confirm the HR nature of this task. Though access will likely be a follow-up, the immediate action requested seems to be related to the form itself. I've ruled out other categories since this doesn't explicitly mention hardware, storage, or projects. I'm focusing on the inherent HR aspects.\n\n\n"
