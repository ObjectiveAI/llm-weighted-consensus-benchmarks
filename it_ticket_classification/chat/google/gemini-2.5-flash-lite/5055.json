The mention of \"cable\" immediately points me towards a hardware-related issue, though I need to be certain. I'm carefully considering whether \"rejected\" hints at a purchase issue, but the short phrase is unclear.\n\n\n**Identifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've determined that the focus of the ticket is procurement. The wording points to a rejected requisition for a monitor cable. Words like \"price\", \"supplier code\" and \"requisition\" confirm that the issue revolves around purchasing a specific item. Categorization as \"Purchase\" is the most logical choice.\n\n\n"
