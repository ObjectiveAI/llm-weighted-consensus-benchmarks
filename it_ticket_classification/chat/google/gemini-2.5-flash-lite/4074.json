After analyzing the keywords \"leaver form\" and \"leaving\", I'm leaning toward selecting the most suitable category from the list provided. It seems to align best with one of the options, but I'm still weighing the nuances to ensure the most accurate classification.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nNow, I'm reconsidering the initial leaning toward the \"Access\" category. While access revocation is crucial, \"HR Support\" has come back into view. The initiation of the \"leaver form\" seems central. The \"Access\" actions are subsequent steps in a broader process that begins with HR notification and form processing. I am now leaning more toward \"HR Support\" as the primary category, with an argument to include subtasks about \"access\" if such a feature were available.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Focus**\n\nI've honed in on the central issue: managing a departing employee's access. While elements of hardware are present, the essence of this ticket revolves around revoking and reassigning various access permissions. My analysis strongly suggests \"Access\" as the primary categorization, with other factors secondary. I'll need to prepare the JSON.\n\n\n"
