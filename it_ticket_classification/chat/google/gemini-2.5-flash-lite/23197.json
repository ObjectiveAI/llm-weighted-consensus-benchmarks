I'm focusing on identifying key terms and phrases to help narrow down the options. I've noted \"adapter,\" \"ports,\" and \"license\" as significant, but I'm still weighing their relevance against the available categories. My goal is to find the closest fit.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Adapter Request**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and am leaning towards \"Purchase\" as the primary category. The repeated phrase \"purchase adapter\" is a strong indicator. While \"Hardware\" is also relevant, the request seems to be specifically about acquiring the device, not general hardware troubleshooting. The license component appears as a secondary concern related to the hardware request.\n\n\n**Defining the Purchase Context**\n\nI'm now fully confident that the ticket falls under \"Purchase.\" The constant reference to purchasing an adapter makes it the most precise category. Though \"Hardware\" is relevant, the core issue revolves around acquiring the device, solidifying my decision. My focus is now on ensuring this is the best, most logical categorization.\n\n\n"
