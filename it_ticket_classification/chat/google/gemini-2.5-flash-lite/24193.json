I've received the list of potential categories and am now analyzing the ticket text. At this stage, it seems the provided text doesn't clearly map to any of the categories, such as \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" or \"Access.\" The terms \"pictures\" and \"links\" could relate to \"Storage,\" but without more context, it's unclear.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Category**\n\nI've made significant progress in defining the ticket type. By scrutinizing the text, I've identified the root problem as users lacking the necessary access to view images within a library. Though \"Storage\" and \"Miscellaneous\" were initially considered, \"Access\" now seems to be the most fitting category, given the emphasis on permission issues and user rights. I will classify this ticket as \"Access.\"\n\n\n**Focusing on User Access**\n\nI've narrowed down the categorization to the \"Access\" issue.  Analyzing the phrases \"added rights library\" and the inability of users to view images pinpoint the core issue. Storage is relevant, but the problem isn't about storage per se but user permissions. It's clearly not hardware, HR, a purchase, or an internal project. I'm now certain \"Access\" is the appropriate classification for this IT ticket, given the emphasis on viewing rights.\n\n\n"
