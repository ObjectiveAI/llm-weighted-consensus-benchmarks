I'm focusing on keywords and phrases to pinpoint the relevant category. It seems to involve user management and possibly access control within an Active Directory environment. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but need more context.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've narrowed the ticket's core function down to revoking user access within Active Directory. The repeated phrases reinforce the user-account management focus. \"Access\" is still the leading contender, as it directly reflects the act of removing users. \"Administrative rights\" is a possible secondary concern because modifying AD often entails using those rights. The ticket content suggests I select \"Access.\"\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've determined that \"Access\" is the best fit for this ticket. The core action requested is the removal of user accounts within Active Directory. This aligns directly with the \"Access\" category, as it involves revoking user access and permissions. \"Administrative rights\" is a secondary consideration.\n\n\n"
