Based on the mentions of \"people to projects\" and \"role,\" I believe \"HR Support\" or perhaps \"Access\" are the most fitting categories. I'm weighing which best captures the essence of managing user roles within project structures.\n\n**Selecting the Best Fit**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket details and considered the available categories. My current analysis strongly points towards \"Access\" as the most accurate classification, given the explicit mentions of adding people to projects and assigning roles. This seems to encompass the core request more precisely than other options.\n\n"
