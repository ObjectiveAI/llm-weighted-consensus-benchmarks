My process involves analyzing the ticket description to pinpoint key phrases and understand the user's intent. The goal is to match each ticket with the most fitting category from the predefined list. Right now, I'm working to discern what \"remove user\" indicates.\n\n\n**Clarifying Access Issues**\n\nI'm zeroing in on this ticket's core problem: it's definitely access-related. The \"remove user from snow groups\" language is the crucial indicator here.  Keywords like \"sn license\" and \"assigned groups\" further strengthen this. Even \"getting\" suggests ongoing access struggles. The other terms are technical issues that the analyst may address later or are part of the audit trail. I can categorize this firmly under \"Access.\"\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Control**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's language, zeroing in on \"remove user from snow groups\" and \"sn license\".  These clearly indicate access management. While \"poll feed status down\" is technical, the user's focus is on access. The context around \"assigned groups\" further reinforces this. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" being the best fit, as the technical details seem secondary.\n\n\n**Confirming the Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's language, especially \"remove user from snow groups.\" While \"varnish poll feed status down\" complicates things, the user's core need appears access-focused. \"sn license\" and \"assigned groups\" confirm this. \"Access\" is the best fit, despite the technical noise.\n\n\n"
