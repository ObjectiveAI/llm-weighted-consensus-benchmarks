So far, the terms \"leaver,\" \"service,\" and \"leave\" keep coming up. This is a bit tricky, but I'm leaning toward HR Support, given the context seems related to employee status changes and associated administrative tasks. I need to make sure I don't overlook any other clues that might suggest a different category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Categories**\n\n\\n\\nI'm now focusing on \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" as the most likely candidates for this IT ticket. The text is packed with phrases centered around an employee leaving, like \"leaver mailbox\" and \"leave date.\" I'm also finding plenty of direct references to access management tasks like deactivating accounts and revoking permissions. I believe it's leaning toward HR, but I'll make sure to double-check for any hardware or storage hints before deciding.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating the Category**\n\n\\n\\nI'm now refining my categorization. While HR Support remains a strong contender, I'm also considering the implications of account access revocation and data storage concerns. The \"leaver\" theme is definitely central, but I need to accurately reflect the actions and potential resources impacted. Based on the \"ad forwarder\", \"leaver mailbox\", and storage mentions, it seems likely that Access and Storage will also need involvement along with HR. However, it looks like HR Support should be the primary category based on the content. I'm going to look for other terms, and make sure that this is the best decision.\n\n\n**Determining Primary Category**\n\n\\n\\nI've now concluded that \"HR Support\" is the primary category for this ticket. The \"leaver\" theme permeates the text, strongly indicating an employee offboarding scenario. While access management and storage are clearly involved, they are subordinate to the HR-driven process. The mention of access-related items like \"ad forwarder\" and \"mailbox\" are common tasks in this leaver process, but it looks like the underlying request is focused on the offboarding process. I'm satisfied that this is the best decision based on all considerations.\n\n\n"
