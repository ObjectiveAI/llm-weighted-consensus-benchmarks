The symptoms are Outlook sync problems with shared mailboxes, constant credential prompts, and daily issues after an upgrade, all affecting client communication. After eliminating \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative Rights\", and, while \"Miscellaneous\" is a valid default, I have determined that \"Access\" is the right category given the authentication and sync access issues described.\n\n\n"
