The description mentions a \"new starter,\" which immediately makes me think HR Support might be the best fit. I'm carefully considering the available options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.  My primary focus is on understanding what is being requested in order to find the correct classification.\n\n\n**Defining the Best Fit**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category for the ticket. The phrase \"new starter\" in the description is the key. The lack of specific technical details leads me to believe this is likely a standard onboarding request, which usually involves HR and encompasses things like initial account setup and access provisioning. While \"Access\" could be relevant, \"HR Support\" seems more comprehensive for onboarding.\n\n\n**Selecting the Best Category**\n\nI'm now completely set on \"HR Support\" for this ticket. The 'new starter' context is the primary driver, and this is the most likely category. The request is vague, but it seems to involve onboarding, which encompasses providing initial system access, email setup, and other account creation aspects that are standard when a new employee joins the company. It's safe to classify it as 'HR Support', as the IT team often helps with the onboarding process.\n\n\n"
