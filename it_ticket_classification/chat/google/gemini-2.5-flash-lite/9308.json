Based on terms like \"new delivery,\" \"received,\" \"apple keyboard,\" and \"po,\" I'm leaning towards categorizing this under \"Purchase.\" I'll cross-reference this with the other available categories to ensure the best fit.\n\n**Categorizing Incoming Tickets**\n\nI'm currently processing an IT ticket. Based on terms like \"new delivery,\" \"received,\" \"apple keyboard,\" and \"po,\" I'm leaning towards categorizing this under \"Purchase.\" I'll cross-reference this with the other available categories to ensure the best fit.\n\n**Refining Ticket Classification**\n\nFurther analysis suggests that while \"Purchase\" aligns with \"po\" and \"delivery,\" the primary item is an \"apple keyboard,\" which strongly indicates a \"Hardware\" category. I'm now prioritizing \"Hardware\" but will consider the procurement context if it becomes essential for more granular classification.\n\n**Refining Classification Focus**\n\nI'm now focusing on the explicit mention of \"apple keyboard\" as the core subject. While \"po\" and \"delivery\" suggest procurement, the primary classification should reflect the actual item. Therefore, \"Hardware\" appears to be the most appropriate category, though I'm still considering how to best represent the procurement context.\n\n**Identifying Core Subject**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the IT ticket. While \"po\" and \"delivery\" indicate a procurement aspect, the central focus appears to be the \"apple keyboard\" itself, leading me to prioritize the \"Hardware\" category for now.\n\n**Classifying New Deliveries**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the input. The presence of \"po\" and \"new delivery\" strongly suggests the \"Purchase\" category, as it relates to the procurement process of incoming items, even though the item itself is hardware.\n\n**Categorizing Incoming Assets**\n\nMy current focus is on classifying an IT ticket. The keywords \"new delivery,\" \"received,\" and particularly \"po\" strongly indicate that the primary theme revolves around a purchase transaction, so I am assigning it to the \"Purchase\" category.\n\n"
