The phrases \"new starter\" and \"candidate\" strongly suggest an HR-related issue.  While it mentions a tower, it's tied to onboarding, not hardware functionality.  I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" but will double-check to ensure no other options fit better given more ticket details.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've decided to finalize the category as \"HR Support\". The ticket's focus revolves around onboarding a new employee who just accepted a job offer. This includes actions directly resulting from an HR process. Although \"Access\" is relevant, it's a consequence of the HR-driven onboarding, making \"HR Support\" the superior choice as it encompasses the entire scope. The phrase \"new starter\" solidifies this direction.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've just finished the deep dive on this ticket's classification. The \"new starter\" and the job offer acceptance firmly place this within the realm of HR-driven processes. Although granting access is a critical step, it's a direct result of the onboarding, which is most logically categorized under \"HR Support\". The phrase \"create his credentials\" sealed the deal, emphasizing the HR origin of this request. Thus, \"HR Support\" emerges as the optimal choice.\n\n\n"
