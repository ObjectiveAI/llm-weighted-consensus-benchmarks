Based on the provided details, I'm leaning towards the \"Hardware\" category, though \"Miscellaneous\" is a possibility if further context suggests something outside typical hardware issues.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket's content for keywords. Phrases like \"trying access,\" \"files stored,\" and \"cannot open file\" point strongly towards the \"Access\" category. I'm evaluating \"Storage\" as a secondary possibility, but the primary issue appears to be access-related.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's details, focusing on user-reported problems. The recurring phrases about \"trying access,\" \"files stored,\" and specifically \"cannot open file\" lead me to firmly categorize this as an \"Access\" issue.\n\n"
