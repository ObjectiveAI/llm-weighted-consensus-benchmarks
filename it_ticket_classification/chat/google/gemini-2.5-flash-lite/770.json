I'm considering if \"help on images help images\" indicates a technical issue or if there's a broader context. I need to make a solid selection from the available categories: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\".\n\n\n**Assessing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been honing in on the key problem. It appears to be related to images and file sizes, particularly within a Word document context. Based on this, \"Storage\" seems the most appropriate category. I'm discarding the initial \"help on images help images\" and focusing on \"unable view size\" and file properties. I'm now leaning heavily towards a storage-related issue, or how the application is using the files on disk, despite the general nature of the request.\n\n\n**Determining Best Fit**\n\nMy analysis suggests \"Storage\" is the best fit, despite considering \"Miscellaneous.\" I've focused on file size and document issues, discarding extraneous information. I've ruled out other categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others, since the ticket details are not related to them. The phrasing and issues are specifically about image and document storage.\n\n\n"
