My current approach involves analyzing the ticket content and looking for keywords to help determine the best category. \"Modify grade\" appeared multiple times in the example, and this seems to suggest something, though I haven't quite figured out what yet. I'm focusing on \"Modify grade\" and the context it appears in, such as its surrounding words, and how that fits within my IT domain knowledge. I need to figure out which category that belongs to.\n\n\n**Determining the best fit**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's content and narrowing down the potential categories. Based on keywords like \"modify grade\" and \"extended contractual period\", I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\". The phrase \"modified grade\" and the context strongly suggests that this is not a hardware, storage, or miscellaneous request. While \"Access\" could be a consequence of the grade change, \"HR Support\" seems like the primary area affected by the action. Internal project seems less likely.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Details**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"HR Support\" as the best category. The language used, focusing on \"modify grade\" and \"extended contractual period\", has solidified my decision. I am fairly certain that this ticket is requesting an HR adjustment rather than a hardware, storage, or access change. My process has shown that the core of the ticket is a personnel change which dictates access, which is often an HR-led action.\n\n\n"
