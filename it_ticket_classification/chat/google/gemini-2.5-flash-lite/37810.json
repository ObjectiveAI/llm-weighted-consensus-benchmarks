Initial assessment suggests it leans towards \"Access\" due to the mention of link and file access issues. However, the ambiguous nature of \"any files\" introduces a minor complexity. I'm exploring if the context implies a broader storage issue warranting consideration of the \"Storage\" category as well. Need to clarify the access context.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket Issue**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"Access\" category as the primary focus, given the consistent theme of inability to view specific files despite link access. The user's inability to view the files is the crucial detail. Though the text doesn't explicitly mention permissions, the context heavily implies restricted access within the accessible link. The \"Storage\" category seems less relevant. The user wants to see files that they can't see, that is an access issue.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Issue**\n\nI've determined that the user's core problem revolves around access. The ticket content clearly indicates a problem viewing files even though a link is accessible. Therefore, I\u2019m prioritizing the \"Access\" category. While administrative rights or storage implications could be involved, they are not directly referenced. The inability to see files, despite link access, is the central issue.\n\n\n"
