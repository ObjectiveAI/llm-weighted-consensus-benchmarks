The initial words \"allocation,\" \"purchased,\" and \"installation\" are leading me to think about resource management or deployment, and the mention of \"users\" suggests it's not a singular hardware issue. I'm leaning toward \"Purchase\" or \"Internal Project\" as the closest fit, and am analyzing if there's sufficient signal to distinguish between the two.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text, focusing on keywords such as \"purchased,\" \"installation,\" and \"allocate.\" The term \"purchased\" is the most compelling indicator, and I'm confident in classifying it as a \"Purchase\" ticket. The other keywords are strongly associated with post-purchase actions related to the newly acquired hardware, which solidifies my decision.\n\n\n"
