The key phrase \"mouse broke\" is standing out as highly relevant. My thinking is leaning towards the \"Hardware\" category based on this information. The other categories don't seem like they'd fit.\n\n\n**Revising Category Assignment**\n\nI've refined my initial hardware assignment. While \"mouse broke\" still strongly suggests a hardware issue, I'm now cross-referencing this against the broader context. Considering the brevity of the text and lack of further detail, I'm cautiously leaning towards \"Miscellaneous.\" The minimal information doesn't explicitly rule out other categories, but it seems to point towards a very basic, undefined issue.\n\n\n"
