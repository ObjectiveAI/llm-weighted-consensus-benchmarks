It's proving tricky due to the vague language. Initial thoughts lean toward either \"Hardware\" or \"Miscellaneous\" as the computer restart suggests a potential hardware issue, but the overall lack of specific details makes it hard to be certain. I'm considering all options to ensure accuracy.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's ambiguous phrasing, focusing on the \"computer restarted\" and \"seems like connected\" segments. While \"Hardware\" remains a possibility, the lack of definitive technical details pushes me towards \"Miscellaneous.\" The restart could stem from software issues, so \"Hardware\" isn't certain. My current thinking solidifies on \"Miscellaneous\" as the most encompassing and fitting category, aligning with the output schema.\n\n\n"
