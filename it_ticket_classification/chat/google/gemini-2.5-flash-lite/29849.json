My current focus is on pinpointing key terms like \"access,\" \"site,\" \"folder,\" and \"spreadsheet\" to accurately assign it to the most relevant category from the predefined list.\n\n**Accessing Site Data**\n\nI'm continuing to refine my classification by focusing on keywords. The strong presence of \"access to site\" alongside terms like \"folder\" and \"spreadsheet\" is leading me to the \"Access\" category.\n\n**Identifying Ticket Category**\n\nI've finished my analysis of the IT ticket text. Based on the recurring keywords and overall context, I've confidently determined the most appropriate classification for this ticket.\n\n"
