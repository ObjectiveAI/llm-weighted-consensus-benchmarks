The presence of terms like \"access,\" \"team,\" and \"sonar\" suggests a direction. I'm leaning towards a specific category based on the implications of these words, but I need to make a solid selection.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Keywords**\n\nI've been drilling down on the keywords to select the right category. The focus remains on \"access,\" \"team,\" and \"sonar,\" with \"access\" being the most direct fit.  I've ruled out several options, and now I'm weighing \"Access\" against \"Administrative rights,\" considering the nuances of tool permissions versus broader administrative control. The presence of \"sonar\" suggests the former is a better fit.\n\n\n**Determining Final Category**\n\nI've considered all the evidence and honed in on the optimal category. I've analyzed the keywords \"access,\" \"team,\" and especially \"sonar\" which points directly toward tool permissions. The context of the ticket doesn't suggest administrative functions or an internal project. I'm now certain that \"Access\" is the most appropriate and precise category. The process is complete.\n\n\n"
