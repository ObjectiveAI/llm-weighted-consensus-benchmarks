It's a bit of a mixed bag \u2013 \"Oracle error\" suggests a technical glitch, while \"time cards\" and \"card statuses\" lean toward HR or administrative duties. I'm leaning towards the Oracle error being the primary issue, so perhaps it's related to some access or a system that handles these records. I need to be sure. I will carefully consider what the user means when he says \"Access\".\n\n\n**Determining Ticket's Core Issue**\n\nI've examined the possible categories in relation to the ticket description, and \"Miscellaneous\" feels like a fallback option, not the best. It's not a storage issue or a hardware problem. There isn't a direct human resources-specific question. The focus is on a technical malfunction: the \"Oracle error\". I'm exploring the implications of that error in the context of time card functionality and the displaying of card statuses. I'm moving toward a more precise categorization.\n\n\n"
