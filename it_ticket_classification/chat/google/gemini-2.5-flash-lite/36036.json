After reviewing the available categories, I've concluded that \"Miscellaneous\" is the most appropriate fit as the problem doesn't align with hardware, HR, access, storage, purchase, internal projects, or administrative rights.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI've identified the ticket's core issue as a functional defect within an Oracle application, specifically a missing submit button for time cards. Given the provided categories, I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the most suitable classification since the problem doesn't align with hardware, HR, access, or other more defined options.\n\n"
