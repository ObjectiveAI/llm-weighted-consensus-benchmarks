The user's need to preview calendar meetings feels like a functional access issue within the Outlook system. I'm still considering all other options, but \"Access\" aligns best with the problem described.\n\n\n**Considering Final Category Choice**\n\nI'm now revisiting the category selection. Initially, \"Access\" seemed viable, but after further scrutiny, I believe \"Miscellaneous\" is a more accurate fit. The issue with the Outlook calendar preview appears to be a functional glitch or a need for assistance with an Outlook feature. This doesn't neatly align with the other categories like \"Access\" or \"Hardware.\" The \"Miscellaneous\" category allows for this more general, application-specific issue. I am satisfied with this categorization.\n\n\n**Evaluating Final Categorization**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, focusing on keywords like \"outlook calendar preview\" and \"different display\". My analysis has solidified my categorization choice: \"Miscellaneous\" is the most appropriate. Although I initially considered \"Access,\" it doesn't align with the nature of the problem, which seems functional rather than a permission issue. The user's query about the calendar preview appears to be a help request or a functional glitch within Outlook. This problem is not a hardware, storage, or administrative rights problem and is therefore best suited to the \"Miscellaneous\" category.\n\n\n"
