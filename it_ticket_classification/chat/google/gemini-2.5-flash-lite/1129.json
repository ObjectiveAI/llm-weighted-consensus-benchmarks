Terms like \"new delivery,\" \"received shipment,\" and \"headsets\" strongly suggest a hardware-related issue, possibly involving procurement. The presence of a PO number also supports this hardware-purchase angle. I'll need to weigh this against the other categories before making a final decision.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket's Scope**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and it strongly points towards a \"Purchase\" issue. Key phrases like \"new delivery,\" \"received shipment,\" and the presence of a PO number solidified this conclusion. While \"Hardware\" was a possibility, the actions of receiving and logging the shipment align more closely with the purchasing process itself. This aligns the ticket to a purchasing context better. The other categories, after consideration, are clearly less relevant to the nature of this request.\n\n\n"
