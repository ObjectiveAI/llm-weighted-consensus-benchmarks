The \"Oracle blocker\" element adds a layer, possibly linking to a system hindering access, but the central problem centers on the employee's profile data, making HR Support the most relevant category.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket's Scope**\n\nI've been going through the ticket details, isolating crucial phrases. \"Profile incorrect,\" \"employment history,\" and \"inaccurate data\" consistently highlight HR implications. Although \"Oracle blocker\" suggests a system issue, the fundamental problem centers on employee profile data, making HR Support the most relevant. The urgency \"delaying resolution\" reinforces the need for prompt HR intervention, confirming HR Support as the appropriate categorization.\n\n\n"
