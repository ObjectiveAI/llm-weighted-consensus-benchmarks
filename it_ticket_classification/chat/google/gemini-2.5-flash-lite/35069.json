Right now, I'm focusing on identifying key phrases and keywords within the text. The term \"licenses\" seems very important. I will be sure to refine my search to include it. I'm building a more robust method to avoid misclassifying it. I am attempting to create an algorithm for ticket categorization.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nMy focus is narrowing in on the optimal category. The \"Purchase\" option feels the most accurate given the text. The consistent mention of \"licenses\" and the act of \"purchasing\" them solidify this. I considered \"Hardware\" due to the mention of wireless controllers and access points, but the primary task is acquiring the licenses, not troubleshooting hardware. The other categories clearly don't fit the context. Therefore, \"Purchase\" will be the designated category.\n\n\n"
