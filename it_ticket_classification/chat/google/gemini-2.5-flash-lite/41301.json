The specific wording keeps pointing me in that direction.\n\n\n**Analyzing Request: Deeper**\n\nI've been drilling down on the ticket text, meticulously cross-referencing keywords with the provided category options. The phrases \"re-enable local admin rights\" and \"removing rights\" are popping up, suggesting a strong lean towards \"Administrative rights.\" The \"pilot\" aspect is a red herring; the crux of the issue is user privilege management.\n\n\n**Confirming Classification: Refined**\n\nI'm solidifying my assessment, focusing on the recurrent \"re-enable local admin rights\" and \"removing rights\" phrases. The \"pilot\" reference, though present, seems secondary to the central issue of user privileges. After careful consideration, I've eliminated \"Access\" as the primary category, as \"Administrative rights\" encapsulates the core concern: modifying and restoring administrative privileges, which is far more precise.\n\n\n"
