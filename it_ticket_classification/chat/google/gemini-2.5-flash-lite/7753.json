The \"eel\" mentions are throwing me off, but I'm focusing on \"new employee,\" \"not active,\" \"assign,\" and \"colleague.\" My initial thought is to lean towards \"Access,\" but I'm still weighing other possibilities before making a final determination.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Issues**\n\nI've homed in on the \"Access\" and \"HR Support\" categories. The phrases \"new employee,\" \"not active,\" and \"cannot find\" point directly toward access hurdles. While \"HR Support\" covers onboarding, the lack of access seems more critical in this specific instance. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" now, but I still need to see if there are any other possible problems. The eels are likely irrelevant.\n\n\n**Evaluating Onboarding Context**\n\nI'm now considering the context of onboarding. \"HR Support\" seems more relevant, given the \"new employee\" status and the need to assign access. While \"Access\" is relevant to the problem, \"HR Support\" encompasses the entire onboarding process. Therefore, I believe \"HR Support\" is the right call given the ticket content, schema, and current evaluation.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've decided to move away from \"Access\" and confidently select \"HR Support.\" While access is definitely a component, the overarching issue centers on onboarding the \"new employee.\" The system seems to handle that, but the new employee is not able to access anything because she cannot find it. While both were initially good candidates, I believe \"HR Support\" provides the most holistic fit given the ticket context.\n\n\n"
