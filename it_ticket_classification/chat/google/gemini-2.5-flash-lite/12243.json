The user's goal is to accurately tag incoming tickets, and I've started by parsing the keywords in the text. I've identified \"leaver\" and \"mobile\" as starting points, which will likely affect the categorization choice.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and evaluating possible categories. The \"leaver\" keyword is key, pointing strongly towards HR Support, as it encompasses employee offboarding. Access management is relevant due to mailbox deactivation, but HR Support seems more central. \"Mobile phone\" isn't just about hardware; it's linked to the leaver, suggesting a broader HR-related issue.\n\n\n**Reaching a Conclusion**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and the available categories. \"Leaver\" is the most prominent keyword, indicating an employee offboarding scenario. While mobile phone and mailbox management touch on hardware and access, the core issue centers on HR Support for this employee departure. Therefore, \"HR Support\" is the most suitable category.\n\n\n"
