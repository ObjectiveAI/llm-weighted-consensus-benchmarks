I've begun to parse the ticket content and am currently matching keywords and phrases to the available categories. My goal is to produce a JSON object with the correct classification, following the specified format. It looks like it could be one of the 'Hardware' tickets.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Category**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"Storage\" category. Analyzing the ticket content, the keywords \"mailbox full\" and \"allocate more memory\" strongly point to storage issues. My JSON output will reflect this, containing only the \"category\" key with the value \"Storage\".\n\n\n"
