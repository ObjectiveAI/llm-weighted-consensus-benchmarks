I'm carefully sifting through the words to pinpoint the most relevant keywords. My goal is to match these keywords to the predefined categories: \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Right now, the text doesn't seem to lean strongly towards a specific category, so I need to be thorough.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Type**\n\nI've analyzed the text and identified \"new employee\", \"joining\", and \"contractor status\" as key terms. These strongly align with the \"HR Support\" category. The text's overall focus on onboarding and employee status confirms this classification.\n\n\n**Revising Category Assignment**\n\nI've re-examined the text and confirmed \"HR Support\" as the best fit. Keywords like \"new employee,\" \"joining,\" and \"contractor status\" point unequivocally to employee onboarding. The \"mobility officer\" reference also suggests an HR-related workflow. My analysis focused on the context of each term, leading to the confident classification as \"HR Support\" for the ticket.\n\n\n"
