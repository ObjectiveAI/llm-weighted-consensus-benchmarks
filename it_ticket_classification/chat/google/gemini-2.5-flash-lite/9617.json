The text \"internal audit access cards usage cards usage hi find attached\" is the key data point. I'm carefully sifting through the wording to pinpoint the most fitting category, considering options like \"Access,\" \"Internal Project,\" or perhaps something else entirely. The phrase \"find attached\" is unhelpful and makes the issue less obvious.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Access Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text \"internal audit access cards usage cards usage hi find attached employees other which cards more than days help respect comments attached spreadsheet thanks\" to determine the best category for this ticket. The core seems to be about tracking and auditing access card usage. While \"Internal Project\" is a possibility due to the \"internal audit\" aspect, the primary function revolves around access management, specifically access cards. It does not seem like any of the other categories. \"Access\" appears the most suitable. \"HR Support\" could be involved, but the focus is on *access* not HR policies.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've been honing in on the \"Access\" category for this ticket, considering that the text explicitly mentions \"access cards usage\" multiple times. While the \"internal audit\" aspect initially suggested \"Internal Project,\" the core issue is fundamentally about managing or auditing access control. It seems most appropriate, given the options provided. It does not look like the others listed apply as well.\n\n\n"
