This points to a likely access-related problem within the room booking system, warranting immediate attention. The fact that the user had access to the calendar previously, and now doesn't, is a strong lead that will be followed.\n\n\n**Assigning a Category**\n\nI'm now focusing on categorizing this IT ticket, leaning towards \"Access\" as the most relevant. The user's inability to book rooms, despite past access to the meeting calendar, strongly implies a permissions or access-related issue.  I think this aligns well with the provided schema categories.\n\n\n"
