The specific references to \"sonar tool\" and \"sessions\" point me toward a potential category among those options provided. Considering the context, I think I have a good idea of the best fit. I am considering that the word \"granted\" is a good clue.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI've solidified my selection to \"Access\". The recurring term \"access\" is undeniably central, and the descriptions of \"sonar tool\" along with \"sonar sessions\" confirmed my initial hunch. \"Granted access sonar\" further reinforces the category. I am very confident in my assessment.\n\n\n"
