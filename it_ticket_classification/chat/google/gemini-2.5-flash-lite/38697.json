My analysis of keywords such as \"buying,\" \"card,\" and the implied process suggests \"Purchase\" is the most fitting category. I'm focusing on the implied request, rather than any secondary requests in the ticket.\n\n\n**Confirming Purchase Category**\n\nI've honed in on the ticket text and the provided category options. The keyword analysis points decisively toward a \"Purchase\" request, as the user initiates the buying process of the card. Keywords like \"buying\" and \"procedure\" solidify my conclusion. My focus is on the action of purchasing, rather than the card's potential use, which aligns with the \"Purchase\" category, and I believe this conclusion is final.\n\n\n**Defining the Procurement Request**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the ticket's language. The repeated mention of \"buying card\" and the procedural language is crystal clear. I've considered all angles. The card's nature is secondary; my focus is on the purchase itself. This is not about access, hardware functionality, or HR; it's the *process* of acquiring the card that needs my attention. The keywords leave no room for doubt; \"Purchase\" is the only suitable category, and I feel confident with this assessment.\n\n\n"
