I'm carefully reviewing the schema to ensure my choice is the most accurate.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter reviewing the ticket again, my original \"Storage\" assignment seems even more appropriate. The added details about \"inventory failure\" and \"empty slot\" solidify the connection to tape backup management, not just general tape use. I'm now certain this is the best fit, as the other categories don't relate to these specific issues.\n\n\n"
