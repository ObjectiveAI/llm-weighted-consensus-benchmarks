Offices with multiple users reporting the same suggests a network-related problem, but I need more data before I can determine the exact problem. I'm exploring the options from the schema to see which one is the best fit.\n\n\n**Mapping to Categories**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's core issue: slow connection affecting multiple users in offices. While \"Hardware\" seems the closest fit, I'm thinking about broader interpretations of \"hardware\" to include network infrastructure.  The focus is on the connection itself, which could be indicative of faulty network devices. It feels like \"Hardware\" is the best fit from the provided schema, given the connection issues impacting a group.\n\n\n**Categorizing Network Issue**\n\nI've decided to categorize the ticket as \"Hardware\". While ideally a \"Network\" or \"Connectivity\" category would be better, the focus on a shared \"connection is slow\" problem across multiple users in offices points toward infrastructure. This implies faulty network hardware like switches, routers, or ISP links, making \"Hardware\" the most fitting choice among the provided options. This decision reflects a shift in thinking from purely workstation hardware to network infrastructure.\n\n\n"
