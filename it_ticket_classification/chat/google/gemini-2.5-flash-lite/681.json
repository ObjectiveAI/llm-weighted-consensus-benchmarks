I am considering the keywords and their implications within the context of the available options. The phrases suggest onboarding, leaning toward HR or Access support, but I am still working towards a final definitive classification.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket: Ongoing**\n\nI am now focusing on determining the most appropriate IT ticket category. After analyzing the keywords, \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" seem like good fits. I've ruled out \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Internal Project\" as less relevant based on the information provided in the given text. I am considering which is more likely to be the top option, if only one category is possible. The location details are useful to determine the user's location, but they do not relate to the ticket type. \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility as part of onboarding new employees, but needs to be evaluated.\n\n\n**Defining the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the optimal IT ticket category. After analyzing the keywords, I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support.\" The phrases \"new starter,\" \"joining,\" and \"completed form\" strongly indicate an onboarding process managed by HR, which likely requires their support initially. Access and hardware are relevant but secondary to the overarching HR-led onboarding phase suggested by the text. I am confident in this categorization.\n\n\n"
