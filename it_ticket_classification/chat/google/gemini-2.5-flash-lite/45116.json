The key element is the \"lack of space on drive\" issue, which strongly indicates a Storage problem.  I'm evaluating whether the \"run\" command context pushes it toward another category, but Storage seems most appropriate right now, even if other categories might be considered. I'm focusing on the primary issue at hand.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Storage Issue**\n\nMy current priority is the \"Storage\" category. The description of running out of space and a lack of disk space confirms this. The ticket is straightforward in this regard. I'm satisfied that Storage is the most relevant.\n\n\n"
