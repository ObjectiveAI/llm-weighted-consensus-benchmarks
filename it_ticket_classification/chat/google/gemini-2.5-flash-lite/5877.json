I am currently performing a deep dive into the specifics of the ticket to ensure accurate categorization.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nI've just finished the analysis, and based on the keywords found in the ticket text, I've concluded that \"HR Support\" is the most appropriate category. The ticket deals primarily with timecards, approval processes, employee data, and related functionalities, which fall under this category. I'm now structuring the output as a JSON object, ensuring it adheres to the requested schema.\n\n\n"
