My primary goal is to accurately select the appropriate category from the given options. I'm carefully analyzing the text to identify keywords and phrases that will guide my classification. Once I've finished analysing the provided text, I will output my findings as a JSON object, as required.\n\n\n**Identifying the Key Element**\n\nI've homed in on \"monitor allocation\" from the ticket text. This phrase, combined with the word \"monitor\" itself, makes a strong case for the \"Hardware\" category. After carefully considering the available categories, \"Hardware\" seems to be the most accurate fit based on the supplied context. I'm now certain this is the correct choice, and I will output my findings as JSON as requested.\n\n\n**Reaching a Conclusion**\n\nI've just concluded that \"Hardware\" is the correct category, considering \"monitor allocation\" and the presence of the word \"monitor\" within the IT ticket. Despite other potential interpretations, the phrase's inherent connection to physical hardware overrides them. I've ruled out all the other categories, as none are a better fit than \"Hardware\" based on the ticket's provided context. The data will be returned as JSON.\n\n\n"
