I've parsed the text, recognizing keywords like \"time sheet,\" \"Oracle,\" \"submit,\" and \"save.\" The issue clearly relates to a timesheet problem within Oracle, potentially an issue with saving or submission. I'm leaning towards \"Application Issue\" as the primary category, but might need more information to be fully definitive.\n\n\n**Re-Evaluating Categories**\n\nI'm now revisiting the categories, specifically focusing on \"HR Support\" versus \"Access.\" While an access issue *could* be involved, the core issue appears to be the inability to *save* or *submit* the timesheet within Oracle. This suggests a problem with the HR system's functionality itself, rather than simple access permissions. Therefore, I'm solidifying my assessment: \"HR Support\" seems the most appropriate classification.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Classification**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket text again and now I'm firmly settled on \"HR Support.\" The issue is the user cannot submit or save a timesheet within Oracle. While access may play a small role, the main problem centers around the HR system's functionality itself. This is what finally solidified my conclusion.\n\n\n"
