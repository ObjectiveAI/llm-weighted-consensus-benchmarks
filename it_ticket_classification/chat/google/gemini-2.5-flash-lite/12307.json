The specifics around international calls and phone arrangements further solidify this assessment.\n\n**Assigning IT Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the provided text, and the recurring themes of phones, roaming, voice traffic, and arrangements for international calls strongly indicate that this IT ticket should be classified under \"Hardware.\" The specifics suggest a need for managing physical devices and their associated service plans for a business trip.\n\n"
