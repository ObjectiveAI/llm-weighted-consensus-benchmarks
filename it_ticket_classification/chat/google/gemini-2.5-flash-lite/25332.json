I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate classification.\n\n**Categorizing Employee Offboarding**\n\nI've identified keywords like \"leavers,\" \"missing time,\" and \"accounts disabled.\" This strongly indicates an HR-related issue concerning employee departures, so I've classified it under HR Support.\n\n"
