The phrases \"approve requisition\" and \"investigate requisition needs approved\" are guiding me towards the \"Purchase\" category, but the inclusion of \"buzz\" is a bit ambiguous. I'm hesitant to finalize, so I'm considering if there could be an element from another category I may be missing, or if buzz could be a keyword referring to an internal IT system purchase.\n\n\n**Confirming Purchase Category**\n\nI've solidified my categorization. The phrases \"approve requisition\" and \"investigate requisition\" directly point to \"Purchase.\" While \"buzz points\" initially seemed unclear, the surrounding context of approvals and justifications solidly reinforces this category. The addition of \"accommodation task\" and \"client workshops\" further solidified this.\n\n\n"
