The keywords \"visitor cards\" suggest a potential link to \"Access\" or \"HR Support,\" but I'm weighing this against the broader implications of managing physical access credentials.\n\n**Focusing on Access Credentials**\n\nI'm consolidating my thoughts around the \"Access\" category. The persistent mention of visitor cards, activation, and deactivation strongly points to access control issues, making \"Access\" the most fitting classification for this ticket.\n\n**Determining Access Issues**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the ticket's content. The repeated emphasis on \"visitor cards,\" along with actions like \"activate,\" \"deactivated,\" \"removed,\" and \"returned,\" definitively places this request within the \"Access\" category.\n\n"
