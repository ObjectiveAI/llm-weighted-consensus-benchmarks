The \"safari on os\" part could open it up to a hardware issue. I'm focusing on trying to find the primary focus of the text.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nAfter revisiting the possible categories, I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous.\" The core issue seems to be a display problem within an application (Oracle Time Card), which doesn't cleanly fit into the other specific categories. \"Access\" is less appropriate, as the user can see *some* details, and it's not a storage, hardware, HR or purchasing issue.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nNow, I've eliminated \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative Rights.\" The application-specific nature of the display issue strongly points towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the most suitable category. The user is seeing some details, so it is not an access issue. It is a technical issue and therefore is Miscellaneous. The text does not relate to hardware, HR, storage, purchase or administrative rights.\n\n\n"
