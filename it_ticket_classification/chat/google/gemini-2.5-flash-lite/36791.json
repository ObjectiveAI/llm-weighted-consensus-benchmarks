While other categories might be tangentially relevant, the core issue revolves around this denial of access. I'm focusing on the keywords related to access control to make sure that this is the best fit.\n\n\n**Identifying the Primary Category**\n\nI've determined that \"Access\" is the most relevant category for this IT ticket. The user's description centers entirely on problems with accessing test environments, and uses the exact keywords. The sub-category is clearly within the \"Access\" framework. I've ruled out other categories as tangential or irrelevant to the core issue.\n\n\n"
