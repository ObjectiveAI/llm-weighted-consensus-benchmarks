After a close read, I'm leaning toward \"HR Support,\" as the ticket seems related to a disciplinary matter and personnel updates. The word \"HR\" appears explicitly, which is a strong hint. I'm double-checking to be sure nothing else is a better fit before finalizing the categorization.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and am now pretty certain that the core issue revolves around a disciplinary matter not being reflected correctly. The phrase \"change of discipline\" appears prominently, solidifying the idea that this is an HR-related matter, not an IT issue. I believe that it is not related to internal project.\n\n\n**Revising the Selection**\n\nI've been evaluating the ticket text again, and while \"HR Support\" seemed like the initial best fit, I'm now certain that it's the right choice. The phrase \"change of discipline\" repeatedly appears, and combined with \"HR,\" it strongly suggests an HR-driven request. I considered other categories, but none are as direct. The implication of a role-related change aligns perfectly with an HR function. This also makes the 'Internal Project' selection incorrect. The issue seems to be a failure to correctly implement an HR-related update.\n\n\n"
