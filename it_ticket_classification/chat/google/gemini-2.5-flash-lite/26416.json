The text provided is sparse and a bit disjointed, which makes pinpointing the right category tricky. At first glance, \"HR Support\" seems most likely, due to the mention of an employee's departure and expenses. However, the lack of clarity has me second-guessing myself and wondering if other options might also apply. I'm focusing on trying to discern the primary subject.\n\n\n**Finalizing Classification Details**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category. I considered other options, but the explicit mention of an employee's departure and outstanding expenses solidifies this classification. The text focuses on the administrative aspects tied to this departure, rather than broader access or project-related activities.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Focus**\n\nI've just spent a good chunk of time analyzing the ticket text and I've locked onto \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category. The mention of someone having \"left\" and the related \"expenses\" is key. I explored the other possibilities, and none of them quite clicked. My primary focus is the employee's departure and its financial ramifications.\n\n\n"
