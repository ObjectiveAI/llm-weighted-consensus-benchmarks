My initial assessment leans towards an issue related to employee offboarding, which might fall under HR Support, or possibly Access, depending on the system's nature. I'm carefully considering whether it represents a straightforward HR matter or if it indicates access-related problems that could necessitate a deeper dive.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nI've refined my thinking on the ticket, focusing on the core issue: the late termination of an employee's access. The key phrases, like \"access should have terminated\" strongly suggest an access-related issue. While HR Support is relevant to the broader offboarding process, this specific ticket is about the technical implementation of access termination. Therefore, Access is the more fitting category, making it the right selection from the provided list.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket content, and the focus is firmly on the delayed termination of the intern's access. The wording \"access should have terminated\" is definitive. While the leaver process involves HR, the primary IT task here is managing user access. I'm leaning toward selecting \"Access\" as the core category, as this precisely reflects the problem needing resolution.\n\n\n"
