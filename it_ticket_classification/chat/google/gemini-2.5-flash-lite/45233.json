So far, the phrases \"team members visibility issues\" and \"annual leave days visible\" suggest an *access* issue. I am leaning toward Access being the best match; however, I will do one final check before confirming the categorization.\n\n\n**Defining the Best Fit**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's language, and I've come to a firm conclusion. The phrases \"absences issue,\" \"annual leave,\" and \"special leave requests\" all clearly align with HR processes. After thorough review, I've confirmed that \"HR Support\" is indeed the optimal category for this IT ticket. I'm ready to move on.\n\n\n"
