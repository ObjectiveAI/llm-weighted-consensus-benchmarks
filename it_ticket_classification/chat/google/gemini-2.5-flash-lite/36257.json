The text indicates a recurring issue with a laptop crashing, suggesting a problem with hardware. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Hardware\" as the primary category for this ticket, and I need to consider it the most important.\n\n\n**Revising Ticket Classification**\n\nAfter a more thorough evaluation of the ticket's description, I've confirmed that \"Hardware\" is the optimal category. The consistent crashing and error message strongly suggest a physical hardware issue with the laptop. Although the text mentioned data loss, the core issue is the system failure, not a storage-specific problem. I've re-prioritized the \"Hardware\" classification as the most accurate based on all available information, and am ready to proceed.\n\n\n"
