My priority is to accurately map incoming tickets to the provided schema, particularly the mandatory `category` field with its specific enum values: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", and \"Administrative rights\".\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm analyzing the ticket description provided. The recurring keywords like \"contracts,\" \"sow,\" and \"executed\" strongly suggest that the core issue revolves around agreements and their related documentation. Therefore, I'm leaning towards \"Administrative rights\" as the most fitting category for this request.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI'm refining my understanding of the ticket's core request. Considering the strong emphasis on \"contracts\" and \"SOW\" execution, it doesn't align with typical IT support functions like hardware, HR, or access. Therefore, I'm concluding that \"Miscellaneous\" is the most appropriate classification given the provided schema.\n\n"
