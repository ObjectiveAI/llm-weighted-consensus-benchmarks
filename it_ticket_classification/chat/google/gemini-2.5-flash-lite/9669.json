I'm carefully analyzing the provided text, particularly phrases like \"amend customer feedback owners\" and \"membership snow\", to determine the best fit from the given options: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\". I am considering whether the text suggests any of these categories explicitly or implicitly.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating Category Options**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. While \"Access\" could apply depending on the system's nature, the core of the issue seems focused on managing feedback workflows and assignments. \"Administrative Rights\" is also a consideration, but it depends if the ticket revolves around permissions. My analysis now highlights \"Internal Project\" due to its alignment with the overall goal of managing feedback systems, assignments and processes. The other options are far less relevant to the presented scenario.\n\n\n**Determining Primary Focus**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"Administrative Rights\" category, as the phrases \"amend customer feedback owners\" and \"added feedback owners assignment\" strongly suggest a focus on access control. While an \"Internal Project\" could be relevant if the system itself is being built, the ticket's emphasis is on user permissions within an existing feedback system.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Best Fit**\n\nAfter further evaluation of the text and all previous considerations, I've confirmed that \"Administrative rights\" is the most accurate classification. I have carefully revisited the text, focusing on phrases such as \"amend customer feedback owners\", \"added feedback owners assignment\", and \"assign feedback tickets\". They strongly indicate a request related to user permissions or roles within the feedback system.  The recent analysis leans more towards assigning the correct administrative capabilities, not implementing an entirely new system.\n\n\n**Concluding the Classification**\n\nI've carefully revisited the text, including phrases like \"amend customer feedback owners\", \"assign feedback tickets\", and \"added feedback owners assignment.\" They all clearly point to modifying user permissions and assignment capabilities within the feedback system.  The ticket's emphasis is on user-level management, not system development. After deep analysis, I now confidently choose \"Administrative rights\" as the correct classification.\n\n\n"
