My initial thought is to categorize this under \"Access,\" but I'm considering if it also touches on \"Storage\" due to the shared location. I will also check to make sure those two categories are the only relevant ones. I'm carefully comparing the ticket's keywords to each category in the schema to ensure accuracy.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Primary Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's language, focusing on phrases like \"access denied\" and \"need write access\". While \"administrative officer\" hints at a potential \"Administrative rights\" aspect, the core issue is clearly centered around access to a shared location, definitively placing it under the \"Access\" category. I am confident in my assessment.\n\n\n"
