The key issue appears to be related to the security of confidential documents. I'm carefully considering the available categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. My initial leaning is towards an \"Access\" or potentially a \"Miscellaneous\" category, given the nature of the described problem.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Problem**\n\nI've refined my thinking on the IT ticket. Initially, I leaned toward \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" However, after a deeper dive, the issue of \"access rights\" for confidential HR documents (application letters) is the crux.  My primary focus is on resolving the access control problem for confidential documents. I'm now certain \"Access\" is the most precise category.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted. While initially, I considered the HR context, it's clear the core issue is fixing access rights, as specifically requested. I've reevaluated the options, and now I'm certain that \"Access\" is the most fitting category, even though the documents are HR-related. The primary concern is resolving the access control problem.\n\n\n"
