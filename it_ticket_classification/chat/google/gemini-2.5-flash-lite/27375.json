It mentions \"audit,\" \"access cards usage,\" and \"employees,\" suggesting a focus on physical access control. I'm carefully weighing the specifics to make the best call.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Focus**\n\nI've refined my thinking by digging deeper into the ticket's language. The terms \"internal audit,\" \"unpaid leave,\" \"intern,\" and \"employment type\" are solid indicators pointing toward an HR-centric issue. Though access cards are involved, the core issue seems to revolve around employee status and audit trails. I'm now leaning heavily towards \"HR Support,\" with \"Access\" as a secondary, but relevant, concern.\n\n\n**Confirming the Core Issue**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text and it's crystal clear that the heart of the matter lies in auditing and managing access card usage in relation to employee status. The key phrases like \"audit,\" \"unpaid leave,\" \"intern,\" and \"employment type\" all point towards an HR-driven concern. It's about ensuring access controls align with employee records, like leave and employment type, making \"HR Support\" the leading candidate, with \"Access\" playing a supporting role.\n\n\n"
