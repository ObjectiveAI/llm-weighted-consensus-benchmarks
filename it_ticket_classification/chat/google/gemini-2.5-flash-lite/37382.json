The current context indicates issues sending meeting invites from a shared mailbox. Initial analysis leans towards an Access or potentially an Exchange-related problem. I'm actively assessing if the problem aligns with existing access control protocols or points to a broader system configuration.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've determined that the appropriate category for this ticket is \"Access.\" The ticket's content, detailing issues sending meeting invites from shared mailboxes and problems with shared mailbox access and group membership, directly points towards access-related concerns. While administrative rights are involved, the core issue is the users' ability to utilize these shared resources, thus \"Access\" is the best fit.\n\n\n"
