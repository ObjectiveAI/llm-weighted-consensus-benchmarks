My focus is on identifying keywords and phrases within the text that will allow me to accurately assign it to the most fitting category from the available options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. I'm paying close attention to terms like \"pm oracle report\" to inform this classification.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket description and identified \"pm rights\" as a key indicator. This phrase strongly suggests that the ticket pertains to administrative privileges, making \"Administrative rights\" the most fitting category. While other terms like \"oracle report\" and \"forecast\" might touch upon projects or data, the explicit mention of rights solidifies my classification.\n\n**Identifying Key Terms**\n\nI'm processing the IT ticket's text, focusing on keywords like \"pm rights\" and \"modify forecast.\" These phrases are crucial for pinpointing the core request. My analysis is leaning heavily towards classifying this as an administrative rights issue, given the direct mention of 'rights' and the context of needing permissions to alter reports and forecasts.\n\n"
