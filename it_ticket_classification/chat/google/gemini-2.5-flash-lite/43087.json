Based on the phrases like \"unable to access\" and \"kept getting locked\", I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\", but I'm being thorough, and considering the other options as well. I need to make sure I don't overlook a nuance that points to a different category, even though access seems most likely.\n\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's language, focusing on phrases indicating authentication problems. \"Unable to access\", \"kept getting locked,\" and the need for credentials strongly support \"Access.\"  The troubleshooting steps and request for review solidify this. While I considered other options, the evidence firmly points to this category as the best fit.\n\n\n"
