My focus is now on confirming that storage is indeed the best fit from the offered categories.\n\n\n**Confirming Category: Storage**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"mailbox size increase\" request. The description paints a clear picture of storage constraints due to email volume. My next step is to solidify Storage as the optimal category, given the nature of the issue. I am now confirming storage is the right fit, and eliminating the remaining potential categories.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization: Storage**\n\nI'm now certain that \"Storage\" is the correct category for this ticket. The user explicitly requests an \"increased\" mailbox, which is a direct storage concern. The detailed description about email volume and difficulty managing deletions further confirms this. I've ruled out other categories like \"Access,\" \"Hardware,\" and \"HR Support\" as they don't align with the described issue.\n\n\n"
