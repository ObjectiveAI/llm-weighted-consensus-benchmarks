Based on the description, \"connection no longer working,\" it seems network-related, and likely an infrastructure issue. While \"Hardware\" might seem a fit, the vagueness of the description points to network connectivity or a user-specific access problem, excluding the other category. It appears to be an issue that needs escalation for resolution.\n\n\n**Revising Ticket Classification**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket, focusing on the \"connection\" issue and the mention of a new floor. The language points strongly to an access or network problem. While \"Hardware\" isn't ruled out, the lack of detail makes it less likely than \"Access.\" I'm now leaning heavily toward \"Access,\" since the location change is the likely reason for network access problems. The lack of connection due to a location change suggests an access issue.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's details, emphasizing the user's \"connection\" problem and the new location. Focusing on the loss of connection after moving floors strongly indicates an \"Access\" issue. The lack of connection directly relates to access to a network resource. Though the ticket doesn't rule out other possibilities, \"Access\" is the most likely cause based on the information provided.\n\n\n"
