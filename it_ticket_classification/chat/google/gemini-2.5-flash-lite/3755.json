My process involves identifying key terms and phrases that strongly suggest a particular category among the options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I'm prioritizing accuracy.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Type**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided ticket text to determine its appropriate category. The goal is to accurately classify it from the options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. After a thorough review, I've identified the recurring theme of \"access\" within the text. This led me to conclude that \"Access\" is the most fitting category, which should be the final determination.\n\n\n"
