Considering the phrase \"admin rights\", I'm leaning toward selecting \"Administrative rights\" as the most suitable category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the available categories. The repeated mention of \"admin rights\" is critical, indicating the need for elevated permissions. The additional context suggests this is more involved than a simple access issue. While \"Access\" is relevant, \"Administrative rights\" seems more precise given the request's technical nature.\n\n\n**Confirming the Category**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details and the provided categories. The consistent emphasis on \"admin rights\" and related tasks like script execution confirms \"Administrative rights\" as the primary focus. I'm now fully convinced this is the best fit, despite the secondary context of migration.\n\n\n"
