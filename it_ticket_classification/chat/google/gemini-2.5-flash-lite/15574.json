                    "reasoning": "**Determining Ticket Type**\n\nI'm currently trying to pinpoint the best category for this IT ticket. I've analyzed the text and am considering several possibilities. The mention of \"escalation teams\" and \"attached document\" is particularly relevant, and I'm weighing whether it's related to access, internal projects, or possibly hardware configuration. I'm focusing on the service component to make the best call.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe analysis of the ticket's text continues. I've considered that the issue could involve aspects of user access and potentially system administration. Given the keywords \"escalation teams,\" \"escalation groups,\" and \"screen mirroring,\" I'm now leaning toward \"Access\" as the primary category, with a possible secondary consideration of \"Internal Project\" if the implementation is a new feature rollout. I'm carefully reviewing the context to differentiate.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating Project Scope**\n\nI'm reconsidering the best classification for this ticket. The initial inclination towards \"Access\" is still present, but the context points towards a more defined scope. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Internal Project\" because of the implementation of screen mirroring and the setup of escalation teams, suggesting new workflow implementation. I'm weighing whether the \"access\" aspect is simply a component of the larger internal effort or the driving force. It seems like the core effort concerns workflow integration and improvements, rather than strict access control.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket's Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. The mention of \"screen mirroring implemented\" is shifting my perspective. It strongly suggests a feature roll-out, leading me to lean heavily toward \"Internal Project.\" While the access aspect is still present, the main focus seems to be the setup and configuration of a new workflow or feature. The focus is now on the *implementation* aspect.\n\n\n**Analyzing Feature Implementation**\n\nI'm now focusing on the project's internal workflow. The screen mirroring is a new element which has a direct relationship with escalation groups, supporting the \"Internal Project\" classification. The focus is to connect the service and matching escalation teams, suggesting that the feature aims at a better user interaction and support system. I am carefully weighing the project's scope, aiming to categorize the ticket appropriately.\n\n\n**Assigning the Ticket**\n\nThe analysis continues, with \"Internal Project\" taking the lead. The key here is feature *implementation*: connecting services to escalation teams. The description focuses on a new system or workflow, not simply user permissions. While \"Access\" is relevant, the implementation is the more relevant aspect. I've considered that the description is about the setup of a new feature for the escalation team, so \"Internal Project\" best captures the nature of the task.\n\n**Prioritizing Feature Implementation**\n\nI've considered that the ticket's core function is to implement a feature: routing services to escalation teams via a screen mirroring feature that triggers upon a user action. \"Internal Project\" best reflects this. I'm focusing on the implementation aspect of the feature, which suggests a new initiative, making this fit better than \"Access\".\n\n\n"
