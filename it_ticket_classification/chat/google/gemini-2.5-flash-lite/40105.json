I will need further information to make a final selection.\n\n\n**Determining the Ticket Type**\n\nI've determined the ticket's nature focuses on \"Administrative Rights.\" The text describes a user's ability to alter an incident's status, triggering questions about their permissions. Initially, I considered \"Access,\" but \"Administrative Rights\" is more precise, highlighting the core issue: authorized actions on the ticketing system. This makes \"Administrative Rights\" the most accurate categorization, given the context.\n\n\n"
