I'm weighing which category best encompasses the described actions.\n\n**Reviewing System Changes**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the request, trying to pinpoint whether the \"structure section\" modifications and the \"add button\" request fall under HR Support given the mention of \"job description\" and \"graduates,\" or if it's more of a general system configuration or administrative task. I'm weighing the evidence for each.\n\n**Classifying the Ticket**\n\nI'm currently reviewing the IT ticket text, specifically focusing on the recurring terms \"structure section,\" \"job description,\" and \"graduates.\" My current hypothesis is that these elements strongly suggest an \"HR Support\" categorization, as they point towards functionality related to recruitment or career pages rather than general system configuration. I am weighing this against the possibility of it being a broader system change request.\n\n"
