My next step is to examine the provided text and match its keywords and intent with the most suitable classification.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Details**\n\nI'm reviewing the ticket's wording, specifically noting the phrases \"leave project codes,\" \"leave received,\" and \"submission.\" These terms strongly indicate a query related to human resources or administrative procedures. My current thought is to categorize this under HR Support, as it directly aligns with the presence of \"leave\" related information.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's language, focusing on terms like \"leave project codes,\" \"leave received,\" and \"submission.\" My current assessment strongly points towards categorizing this under \"HR Support\" due to the direct relevance to leave-related administrative processes.\n\n"
