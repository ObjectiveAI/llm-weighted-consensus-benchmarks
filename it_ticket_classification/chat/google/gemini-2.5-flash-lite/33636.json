I've been examining phrases like \"purchase request\" and \"requested by items\" within the ticket's text. My goal is to determine the most relevant category from the options I was provided, which include: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. So far, the phrases I found lead me toward \"Purchase.\"\n\n\n**Identifying Ticket Type**\n\nI've refined my approach, zeroing in on keywords to classify this IT ticket. Examining phrases like \"purchased\" and \"log installation,\" alongside \"purchase request\" and \"requested by items,\" solidifies my initial assessment. The recurring theme of procurement-related language makes \"Purchase\" the most suitable category.\n\n\n"
