The repeated use of \"toil\" along with the phrase \"consume toil\" makes me think this is a storage issue. I'm leaning toward selecting the \"Storage\" category for this ticket.\n\n\n**Determining the Ticket Type**\n\nI've been going through the text again. The \"annual leave\" phrase, coupled with the \"error\" message about the date, makes it clear this is an HR-related issue.  I've ruled out storage and hardware options, and \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate classification considering the nature of the error and leave management.\n\n\n"
