I'm carefully weighing which category best fits the repeated mention of \"issues\" and the timeline.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the nuances of the ticket text and considering the available categories. \"Access\" seems increasingly suitable because the core complaint revolves around connecting to and using network resources. While \"Hardware\" is a possibility, the wording suggests it's the network functionality rather than a specific piece of equipment at fault, and \"Access\" describes a more precise problem.\n\n\n"
