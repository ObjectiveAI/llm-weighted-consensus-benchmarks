I'm double-checking the descriptions of the other categories to make sure before I make a final decision.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Choice**\n\nI've got it down to HR Support. The sick leave mentions and the \"amend\" phrase solidify that choice. \"Administrative Rights\" is the only other possibility that's even remotely related, but that has to do with access to systems, which isn't the primary focus here. I'll make the final decision in just a second.\n\n\n"
