I'm leaning heavily towards \"Storage\" as the primary category, since the crux of the ticket revolves around disk space. My next step will be to confirm this classification and ensure no other secondary categories are needed.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the ticket text, and the evidence is compelling: \"insufficient space\" and \"drive\" issues are central. While the upgrade process is involved, the root problem is storage capacity. \"Storage\" is the most appropriate primary category, with an upgrade-related secondary tag potentially considered if such granularity is needed. I'm satisfied with this categorization.\n\n\n"
