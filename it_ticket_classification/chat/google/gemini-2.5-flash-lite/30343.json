The keywords \"restore\" and \"service recovery test\" suggest a potential issue related to data recovery or system restoration. I'm leaning toward \"Storage\" or possibly \"Internal Project,\" given the context of a service recovery test. Still evaluating if any other category is a better fit.\n\n\n**Evaluating Category Fit**\n\nI've examined the ticket text and the available categories. \"Service recovery test\" and repeated mentions of \"restore\" and \"documentation\" highlight a testing and recovery process.  While \"Storage\" and \"Access\" are possibilities, \"Internal Project\" seems to capture the broader scope of this annual, architect-driven activity. I am leaning towards this category as the best fit.\n\n\n**Defining the Project Scope**\n\nI'm now solidifying my thinking around the \"Internal Project\" category for this ticket. The phrases \"annual service recovery test\" and mentions of architects, templates, and documentation highlight the structured and recurring nature of this service recovery procedure. The \"test\" and \"restore\" terms indicate a procedural focus which leads me to believe this is indeed an internal project of some kind.\n\n\n"
