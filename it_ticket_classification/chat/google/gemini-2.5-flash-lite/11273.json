The core seems to be about access, but there's almost nothing useful there. \"List of people with access to locations\" is the only substantive phrase. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" being the best fit, despite the lack of context. I'll need to flag this as potentially needing more info for a definitive classification.\n\n\n**Defining Access Focus**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket, focusing on the core request. It's still a sparse text, but the phrase \"list of people with access to locations\" is key. I'm now certain this is most strongly related to \"Access.\" While \"old personnel forms\" could imply an HR connection, the explicit access request is the primary need. This ticket will go in \"Access\" without hesitation, while remaining mindful of the sparse information.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IT Ticket**\n\nThe ticket's text is short, but I've drilled down on \"list of people with access to locations.\" Even with the presence of \"auditor\" and the mention of old personnel forms, my analysis points firmly to \"Access\" being the best fit. I'm choosing \"Access\" as the category, given the direct request for an access list is the central requirement.\n\n\n"
