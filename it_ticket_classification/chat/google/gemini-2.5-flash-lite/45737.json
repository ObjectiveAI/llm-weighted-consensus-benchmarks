I'm focusing on keywords and phrases that align with the provided schema of categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and so on. Initial analysis suggests the issue might relate to a career portal or access, which will narrow down the options. I'm considering all possibilities before settling on a final categorization.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket's Scope**\n\nI've carefully examined the ticket text, extracting key phrases like \"careers not working\" and \"candidates cannot apply.\" This points towards a problem with the company's job application portal. After considering the given categories, \"HR Support\" appears to be the most accurate fit. It aligns perfectly with the issue of candidates' inability to apply, which falls directly under HR's purview.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Relevance**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"HR Support\" category as the most appropriate. The recent analysis of the ticket text, including phrases like \"careers not working\" and \"candidates cannot apply,\" solidified this conclusion. Though I considered alternatives, this category aligns perfectly with the problem. It highlights issues directly affecting candidate applications and, therefore, the HR department's core responsibilities. This has led me to finalize the decision that this ticket belongs in the HR support category.\n\n\n"
