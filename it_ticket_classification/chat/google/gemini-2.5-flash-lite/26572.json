My primary focus is to identify the most accurate category.  Considering the options, \"Access\" seems to be the most fitting label, as the text describes a request to limit file access.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Category Focus**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket description and concluded that \"Access\" is the most precise category. It directly addresses the core request to limit access to specific backup folders. Although storage is implicitly involved, the user's primary concern is restricting access, which aligns perfectly with the \"Access\" label. I've also considered \"Administrative rights\", but \"Access\" captures the essence of the request more directly.\n\n\n"
