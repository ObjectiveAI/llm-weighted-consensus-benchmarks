I've been carefully analyzing the text and considering each option: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. The \"referral tool\" issue seems to fit best under \"Access,\" as it relates to uploading and accessing information.\n\n\n**Categorizing for Action**\n\nI've refined my thinking and I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support.\" The \"referral tool\" is the key. While \"Access\" seemed plausible initially, the core issue isn't *gaining* access, but the tool's malfunction in uploading. It's not a hardware or storage issue, and while an internal project could be involved, \"HR Support\" pinpoints the *function* impacted \u2013 the referral process itself. I'm solidifying my rationale.\n\n\n"
