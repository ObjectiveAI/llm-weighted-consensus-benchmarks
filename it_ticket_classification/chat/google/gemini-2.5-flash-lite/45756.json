I'm double-checking if \"HR Support\" might be a closer fit due to the expense report aspect, but \"Miscellaneous\" seems more encompassing of a general system or process issue.\n\n**Dedicating to Access**\n\nI'm focusing on the \"Access\" category for this ticket. The core of the issue appears to be an error encountered while trying to access details related to a rejected expense report, which strongly aligns with access-related problems within a system.\n\n**Resolving Expense Report Access**\n\nI've refined my categorization. The issue centers on accessing details for a rejected expense report within the Oracle system, strongly suggesting an \"Access\" related problem to specific system functionalities.\n\n**Categorizing the Oracle Issue**\n\nI'm currently prioritizing the \"Access\" category. The core of the ticket revolves around an error encountered while trying to access details concerning a rejected expense report within the Oracle system. This directly points to a problem preventing full system functionality.\n\n**Prioritizing System Access**\n\nI'm currently focusing on the \"Access\" category for this ticket. The core of the issue appears to be an error encountered when attempting to retrieve details concerning a rejected expense report within the Oracle system, which aligns directly with access-related system functionalities.\n\n**Prioritizing System Access**\n\nI'm currently focusing on the \"Access\" category for this ticket. The core of the issue appears to be an error encountered when attempting to retrieve details concerning a rejected expense report within the Oracle system, which aligns directly with access-related system functionalities.\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI'm currently refining my classification based on the core functionality being impacted. The emphasis on an \"error\" occurring during an attempt to \"access\" information related to a \"rejected expense report\" strongly points towards \"Access\" as the most appropriate category. This signifies a technical barrier preventing the user from performing a specific system action, rather than a policy or general support question.\n\n**Investigating System Access**\n\nI'm currently refining my classification of this ticket. The core issue, based on the user's description of an \"error\" when attempting to \"access\" information related to a \"rejected expense report\" within Oracle, strongly points to an \"Access\" category. This suggests a technical barrier is preventing proper system interaction.\n\n"
