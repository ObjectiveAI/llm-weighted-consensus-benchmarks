I need to figure out the right category for this IT ticket: \"for pm hi because annual leave weeks did unfortunately annual leave must public\". I'm considering Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.\n\n\n**Revising Category Selection**\n\nHR Support now seems the most fitting category. The ticket's focus on \"annual leave,\" \"public holiday,\" and the resubmission instruction strongly suggests employee leave management, a core HR function. This aligns well with the provided context and the given options. I'm focusing on \"annual leave\", \"holiday\", and \"resubmit\" as the key phrases.\n\n\n**Focusing on Leave Context**\n\nI've homed in on the \"annual leave\" and \"public holiday\" keywords. They decisively point to employee time-off requests, firmly grounding the ticket within the HR domain. The resubmission instruction further reinforces this, suggesting an HR-related workflow that requires rectification. This new focus solidifies my confidence in \"HR Support\" as the right category.\n\n\n"
