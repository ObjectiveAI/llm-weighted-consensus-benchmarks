The description mentions a non-functional room TV, a conference room, and a potential power issue. I'm prioritizing the urgency based on the \"high priority\" request from the senior tester. I'm leaning towards \"Hardware/Power\" with \"High\" priority for now.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Category**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. The ticket's core revolves around a non-functioning conference room TV. While initially considering a broader \"Hardware/Power\" approach, the direct link to the malfunctioning TV now makes \"Hardware\" the most fitting category. This aligns with the ticket's primary concern.\n\n\n"
