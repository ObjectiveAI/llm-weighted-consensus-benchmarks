I think the root cause of this ticket is a hardware issue, specifically related to storage capacity. \"Bigger hard drive\" sounds like a request for more storage space. I am now leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the best category.\n\n\n**Determining the best fit**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and available categories to categorize the IT ticket. While \"memory\" could refer to RAM, \"hard drive\" and \"run out\" strongly suggest a storage issue.  \"Storage\" seems the most precise category. However, \"Hardware\" is a viable, broader alternative if \"Storage\" weren't available. The urgency of \"investigate urgently\" supports the criticality of the issue.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Option**\n\nI'm now prioritizing \"Storage\" as the best category. I've re-evaluated the keywords: \"memory,\" \"run out,\" and \"bigger hard drive\" all strongly indicate a storage-related problem. While \"Hardware\" is a viable backup, \"Storage\" is more precise, addressing the core issue. I've eliminated \"Purchase\" since the ticket describes a storage issue, not necessarily the initiation of a purchase request. The urgency confirms the \"Storage\" category's significance.\n\n\n"
