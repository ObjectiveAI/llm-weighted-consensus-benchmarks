My primary goal is to determine the most fitting category from the options: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\". It seems likely this relates to onboarding, possibly pointing towards either HR Support or Access. I'm focusing on the keywords to refine this initial assessment.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR and Access**\n\nI'm leaning towards HR Support as the primary category, with Access being a strong secondary consideration. \"Starter form\" is key; it's the HR department that usually handles these. While access is a definite component of onboarding, the form itself is more HR-focused. I am still evaluating \"Internal Project\" as a long shot, but it seems less likely given the specific keywords. I'm carefully weighing whether \"ext\" influences the priority, as its meaning is unclear, so I'm focusing on \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" as defining the classification.\n\n\n**Finalizing HR Support Classification**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category for the ticket. The keywords \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" are highly indicative of an onboarding process, a core function of HR. While \"Access\" is relevant, the ticket's focus is on the form itself, suggesting the initial setup phase often managed by HR. My analysis led me to rule out other options like \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" due to the absence of supporting details. \"Internal Project\" is a possibility, but less likely.\n\n\n"
