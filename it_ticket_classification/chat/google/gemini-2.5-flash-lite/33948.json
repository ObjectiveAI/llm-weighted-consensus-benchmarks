I'm leaning toward an HR support category but still considering the implications of that \"pop ad\". The context isn't clear enough to definitively exclude other options.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR and Access**\n\nI'm now focusing on \"new starter\" and the attached documents. They point definitively towards HR support, likely involving access provisioning as an ancillary aspect. The \"pop ad\" remains a puzzle, but its relevance seems minimal compared to the clear HR onboarding indicators. I am leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\".\n\n\n**Narrowing Focus to HR**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text and it points strongly to HR Support being the most suitable category. The \"new starter\" phrase keeps recurring, and the instructions indicate necessary paperwork which is typical of HR onboarding. \"Access\" is a definite part of onboarding but feels less central. Given the information available, I'm confidently classifying the ticket as belonging to HR.\n\n\n"
