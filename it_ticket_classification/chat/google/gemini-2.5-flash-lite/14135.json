My immediate focus is to identify keywords that will help me accurately assign it to one of the predefined categories: [\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", \"Administrative rights\"]. The initial text snippet, \"oracle\", suggests a potential direction for categorization.\n\n**Determining HR Focus**\n\nI'm refining my understanding of the ticket's core request. The emphasis on \"oracle time cards\" and \"cards left\" in the context of an employee departure strongly indicates this falls under HR support, specifically regarding the management of employee data and approval processes post-departure.\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nI'm consolidating the analysis. The mention of \"oracle time cards\" and employee departure, coupled with the need for approval, firmly points towards an \"HR Support\" classification. This ticket clearly concerns the management of employee-related data post-departure.\n\n"
