The ticket's focus on router decommissioning, availability checks, new purchases, and traffic routing strongly points towards network hardware lifecycle management. This feels like the most accurate fit.\n\n\n**Confirming the Scope**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Hardware\" as the primary category. The router lifecycle, from decommissioning to procurement, clearly falls under this umbrella. While \"Purchase\" is relevant, it is a sub-aspect of the broader hardware management process. I'm satisfied that \"Hardware\" best encapsulates the core intent of the ticket. The focus is on the physical device itself.\n\n\n"
