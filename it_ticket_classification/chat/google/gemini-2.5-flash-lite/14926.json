After analyzing the short text \"employee due to be leaving announcement due,\" I've narrowed down the potential categories. The phrasing doesn't clearly point to a hardware issue, access request, storage, or purchase. \"HR Support\" seems most relevant given the employee's departure. However, I need to be absolutely certain before finalizing the classification.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Optimal Category**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the extended ticket text, focusing on key phrases like \"employee leaving\" and \"resignation.\" The context strongly suggests an HR-driven event with corresponding IT implications, specifically regarding mailbox management. While access adjustments are relevant, \"HR Support\" appears the most precise classification, encompassing the root cause \u2013 the employee's departure. This category aligns with the primary action needed \u2013 supporting the HR-related process.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Need**\n\nI'm now fully confident in the \"HR Support\" category.  The ticket details, particularly the employee's pending departure and the mention of mailbox management, clearly point towards this classification. While access adjustments are involved, they're a direct consequence of the HR-driven event. \"HR Support\" encompasses the *reason* for the IT action and aligns with the core need: supporting the HR process surrounding an employee's resignation and associated tasks.\n\n\n"
