Based on these keywords, I'll identify the best-fit category from the list. I've started by defining the allowed categories and now I'm working to map possible keywords and their corresponding category.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've just refined my approach to determine the single best category. The provided keywords point towards \"Access\" as the most suitable category because it directly addresses the core issue of managing user permissions and physical access (cards) for departing employees. While \"HR Support\" is relevant in the context, the primary technical action is access management.\n\n\n**Defining the Best Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the given text and various categories. Analyzing the keywords (\"disable cards,\" \"leaver form,\" \"permissions\") and focusing on the underlying technical action led me to \"Access\". This choice accurately reflects the primary IT task of managing user accounts, permissions, and physical access (cards) for departing employees, even though \"HR Support\" may also be related.\n\n\n"
