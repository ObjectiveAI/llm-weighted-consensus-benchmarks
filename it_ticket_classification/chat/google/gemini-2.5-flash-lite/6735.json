My analysis has led me to pinpoint the keywords, \"ram from leavers\" and \"leavers\", which are pivotal. I am considering the context and the potential IT-related implications.  My goal is to effectively place this ticket into the correct bucket, and I'm narrowing down which of the existing categories might best apply.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's text, identifying key phrases such as \"leavers,\" \"members leaving,\" and \"take back.\" The focus is undoubtedly on managing resources and access when employees depart. While \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights\" might be involved, the core issue stems from an HR-driven process. Therefore, I believe \"HR Support\" is the most fitting primary category for this ticket.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the initial category assessment, considering \"HR Support\" as the most suitable choice. The phrases \"several members leaving\" and \"take back\" are key indicators of this.  While \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights\" are possible secondary aspects, the underlying trigger is the HR-initiated employee departure. My current focus is refining this selection to ensure full alignment with the ticket's primary objective.\n\n\n"
