Given the context, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access\" or potentially \"Internal Project,\" though I'm still analyzing whether the \"post upgrade\" aspect shifts it towards a different category. I'm focusing on the implied system access and any potential project tie-ins.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Choices**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket. The phrases \"notification\" and \"fusion\" are key. I am considering \"HR Support\" due to the timecard and work schedule issues, alongside the access difficulties. \"Access\" also seems plausible since the logging and access problems are central. I'm carefully weighing whether the upgrade's core impact makes \"Internal Project\" relevant, but the user-facing impact favors \"HR Support\".\n\n\n**Analyzing System Access Issues**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category for this ticket. The phrases \"notification\" and \"fusion\" are key. I am considering \"HR Support\" due to the timecard and work schedule issues, alongside the access difficulties. \"Access\" also seems plausible since the logging and access problems are central. I'm carefully weighing whether the upgrade's core impact makes \"Internal Project\" relevant, but the user-facing impact favors \"HR Support\". The common thread is the users' inability to correctly use Fusion after the upgrade. However, the timecard, work schedule elements clearly lean towards \"HR Support,\" alongside access issues which is a crucial system functionality to ensure employees can perform their work duties. I'm focusing on \"HR Support\" with \"Access\" as a close second.\n\n\n**Refining Category Rationale**\n\nI've re-evaluated \"HR Support\" as the primary category, given the timecard and work schedule issues directly tied to the core functionality being broken by the post-upgrade access and login problems. While access is a symptom, the underlying *problem* is in HR-related operations. The problems are fundamentally impacting access to HR processes, not just access to a generic application. Given this, my categorization strongly leans toward \"HR Support,\" with \"Access\" as a secondary consideration if the issue persists after these specific HR functionality problems are resolved.\n\n\n"
