Based on the sparse text, it seems to relate to onboarding a new employee. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" but considering \"Access\" as a potential fit since new employees often need setup. This is a tricky one! I'm now comparing the options, considering how vague the provided context is.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Request**\n\nI've refined my thinking on the ticket category. Given the ticket text mentions a \"new starter\" and an \"intern,\" \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate classification. While \"Access\" could be relevant, the broader context of onboarding a new person points more strongly to HR-related processes. I'm focusing on the keywords to reach the most logical solution.\n\n\n**Refining Category Choice**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"HR Support\" category.  The ticket's core revolves around a \"new starter\" and \"intern,\" hinting at initial onboarding procedures. While access setup is possible, the overall process feels more aligned with HR-related tasks, like data entry or form completion. The language used in the ticket is vague, so I'm making the best deduction based on minimal info.\n\n\n"
