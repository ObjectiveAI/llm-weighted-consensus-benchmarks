My primary focus is to accurately assign it to one of the predefined categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights. I'm analyzing the ticket's content to determine the most fitting classification.\n\n**Refining Access Classification**\n\nI'm continuing to analyze the IT ticket, and the recurring theme of restricted visibility and \"never had access\" strongly points towards an \"Access\" classification. I'm confirming this by looking for other indicators, but access seems to be the core issue.\n\n**Determining Access Level**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's content, and the repeated mentions of lacking visibility to salary, benefits, and project lists, along with the phrase \"never had access,\" strongly indicate that \"Access\" is the most appropriate categorization.\n\n"
