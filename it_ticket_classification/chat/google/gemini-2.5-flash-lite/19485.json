I'm focusing on \"maternity leaver form\" as a significant clue. Based on this, I'm leaning toward the \"HR Support\" category, as it seems most fitting. Further testing with more diverse texts will be needed to improve accuracy and make sure I don't overlook any subtleties.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Scope**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. While \"Hardware\" is present in the text, the key driver is the \"maternity leaver form.\" This points decisively to \"HR Support\" as the primary category. I've re-evaluated and confirmed this. The hardware aspects appear secondary, triggered by the HR process.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Choice**\n\nAfter reviewing all the elements, I've confirmed my initial impression. The key trigger is \"maternity leaver form,\" clearly indicating an HR process that also has IT implications for hardware return. The best category is **HR Support**, as it encompasses the central theme, while \"hardware\" is a secondary component of that HR process. The focus is on the *process*, not just the hardware.\n\n\n"
