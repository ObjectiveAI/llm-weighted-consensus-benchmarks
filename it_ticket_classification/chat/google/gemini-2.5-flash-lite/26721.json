The term \"electric extension cable\" keeps reappearing, making me lean towards a hardware-related issue. This suggests the ticket might fall under the \"Hardware\" category.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've carefully considered the categories, assessing their relevance to the \"electric extension cable\" request. While \"Purchase\" is a potential fit, the ticket's language (\"please provide\") leans strongly towards a hardware need. My analysis highlights \"Hardware\" as the most suitable category.\n\n\n**Defining the Final Verdict**\n\nI've carefully considered the nuance between \"Hardware\" and \"Purchase\" within the available categories. While \"Purchase\" could technically apply, the core of the request lies in needing the physical \"electric extension cable.\" Therefore, based on the ticket content and the system's likely categorizations, \"Hardware\" emerges as the most accurate and appropriate category. The ticket will thus be classified under \"Hardware\".\n\n\n**Concluding the Classification**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket content and available categories, confirming \"Hardware\" as the best fit. While \"Purchase\" could apply if interpreted as procuring a needed item, the core request is for the physical item, an \"electric extension cable.\" Therefore, the IT ticket will be categorized as \"Hardware,\" reflecting the need for physical equipment. The final JSON output will reflect this categorization.\n\n\n"
