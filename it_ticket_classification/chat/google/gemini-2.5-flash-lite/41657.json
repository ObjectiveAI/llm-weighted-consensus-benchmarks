After a review, it seems \"Internal Project\" is most appropriate. The phrase \"project codes\" strongly suggests a project-related issue, and the \"inactive\" status reinforces that. No hardware, HR, access, storage, or purchase elements are indicated.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket's text, focusing on keywords and context. The issue clearly revolves around project management. \"Project codes,\" \"inactive status,\" and descriptions of task types all strongly indicate the need to manage internal projects, their settings, and statuses. The focus is on functionality and configuration within a project context, not HR, hardware, access, storage, or procurement.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Problem**\n\nI've carefully read the ticket and identified keywords. The terms \"project codes,\" \"inactive,\" and descriptions of task types all strongly suggest the need to manage internal projects, their settings, and statuses. The ticket is about functionality and configuration within a project context, not HR, hardware, access, storage, or procurement.\n\n\n"
