Based on the description, \"Hardware\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", and \"Internal Project\" seem clearly off the mark. It doesn't appear to be related to hardware issues, storage concerns, new purchases, or an internal project. I'm leaning toward either \"HR Support\" or \"Access\", since leave requests are typically handled by HR systems. However, I'm still trying to weigh if this is a system access issue. I will delve deeper.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's content, focusing on keywords and phrases. The description strongly suggests an issue with the leave request form. It's clear that the problem centers around submitting a leave request. Therefore, I've concluded that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category among the given options, and the schema confirms this.\n\n\n"
