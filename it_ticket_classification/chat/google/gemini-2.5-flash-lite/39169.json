After analyzing the text, I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The repeated mention of \"pc performance issue\" is the key indicator here. I'll need to finalize the categorization soon.\n\n\n**Defining the Root Cause**\n\nThe ticket's core issue is identified as a \"pc performance issue\" tied to memory limitations while opening multiple Excel files. The request for \"more memory\" solidifies a hardware-related root cause. My analysis now points firmly toward \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate category, given the concrete connection between the problem description and the proposed solution.\n\n\n**Confirming Hardware Diagnosis**\n\nThe analysis confirms the issue is hardware-related. The \"pc performance issue\" and specific reference to memory limitations while opening Excel files strongly indicate a hardware constraint. The request for more memory solidifies this diagnosis. My thought process now centers on confirming this is the correct classification, and the next steps to resolve.\n\n\n"
