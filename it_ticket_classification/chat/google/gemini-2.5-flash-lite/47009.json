Initial analysis suggests the issue lies within a specific functionality related to \"zone awards\". I'm carefully reviewing all potential categories to determine if this best fits as a software problem, a hardware issue, or falls under a more general type of support. I'll need to consider \"Internal Project\" as a possibility because of the functionality described.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and focused on \"zone awards functionality.\" I've ruled out hardware and storage as irrelevent, also purchase or miscellaneous. HR Support seems promising because this concerns award nominations. \"Internal Project\" is still a possibility if this feature is part of a bigger project. Access doesn't seem to fit the malfunction details, and administrative rights don't appear in the current description. My current thought is to assess the level of HR process vs. system issue, to nail down the most specific description.\n\n\n**Re-Evaluating Categorization Criteria**\n\nI'm now revisiting the \"HR Support\" category.  The \"zone awards functionality malfunction\" really points to a system issue impacting HR processes. While the problem originates in HR nominations, the core problem is a system error. It's more of a functional malfunction than general HR assistance. \"Internal Project\" is still a contender if this is part of a larger project, but I think the focus is more directly on the broken functionality. I'm leaning toward selecting the best category, given the limitations, because the described malfunction is preventing the HR process from progressing.\n\n\n"
