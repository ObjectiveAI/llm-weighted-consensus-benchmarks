This points towards an HR-related issue. My goal is to determine if \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category from the provided list. The ticket's content doesn't seem to relate to the other categories, like Hardware or Access. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" but will perform a final check.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Details**\n\nI've reviewed the provided ticket text again, focusing on phrases like \"maternity leave,\" \"direct reports,\" and \"weekly basis.\" The problem appears rooted in employee process compliance and time submission. This analysis confirms my initial thought: \"HR Support\" is the most accurate category, as it aligns with employee-related processes, HR policies, and team management issues.\n\n\n"
