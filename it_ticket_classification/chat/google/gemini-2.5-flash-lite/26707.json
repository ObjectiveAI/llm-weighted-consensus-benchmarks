My initial hunch leans towards \"HR Support\" due to the mention of a job title, but I'm also considering \"Internal Project\" as it could signify a project related to restructuring. I'm focusing on the keywords and context.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Selection**\n\nI've been honing in on \"HR Support\" as the leading category for the ticket. The phrase \"new job title\" is the main indicator of this. Although \"Internal Project\" seemed plausible, the focus appears to be on role adjustment rather than project creation. I'm satisfied \"HR Support\" best fits the primary intent of the ticket, based on my analysis.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Scope**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"HR Support\" as the optimal category. The wording strongly points to a personnel matter. While \"Internal Project\" could be a possibility in some contexts, the emphasis on \"new job title\" firmly steers me towards HR-related processes. I'm confident in this classification.\n\n\n"
