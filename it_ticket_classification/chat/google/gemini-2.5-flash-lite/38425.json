After reviewing the available options, \"Access\" appears to be the most suitable category, as the problem directly relates to establishing a connection to a server, even though a proxy is involved in the attempt.\n\n**Connecting to Server**\n\nI'm focusing on how to best classify this \"connection issue\" related to server access via a proxy.
