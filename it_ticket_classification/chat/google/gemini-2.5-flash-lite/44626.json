The text indicates issues with \"submitting hours\" and \"work shifts\" within the Oracle system. It seems related to timekeeping and payroll more than any of the other options. I am leaning toward a category for this sort of issue, but need to consider alternatives. I have considered a few possibilities but I need to narrow it down.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nThe focus is now on the HR Support category. Analyzing the text, the issue with \"submitting hours\" and \"work shifts\" within Oracle points decisively to an HR-related system function. While access might be a factor, the primary concern is the inability to perform these time-related tasks. Therefore, I'm confident that the HR Support category best addresses the core problem.\n\n\n"
