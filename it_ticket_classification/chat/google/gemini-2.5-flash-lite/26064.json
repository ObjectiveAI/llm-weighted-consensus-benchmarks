Now, I'll need to consider \"direct reports\" and \"action reports\". I think I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"HR Support\" being the most appropriate. I will move forward with more analysis.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Type**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket content, and the recurring themes point strongly towards HR support. It involves missing time, incorrect chasers, reporting process failures, and employee data updates, including leave and maternity. These data points clearly place the issue in the HR Support category.\n\n\n**Identifying the Root Cause**\n\nThe ticket analysis centers around reporting errors and personnel record updates. Recurring issues include incorrect chasers and a failure to follow the established process, specifically regarding time submission and reporting. \"Maternity leave\" is another crucial piece of information. The consistent thread suggests an HR Support need, not hardware, access, storage, purchase or internal project issues.\n\n\n"
