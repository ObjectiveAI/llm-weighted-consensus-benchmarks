My initial assessment leans towards an \"Access\" issue, but I'm considering other categories. The need for deactivation appears straightforward, though I'm thinking if it could also tie into HR Support.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Access Issue**\n\n\\n\\nI've delved deeper into the IT ticket. After a thorough review, \"Access\" remains the most suitable category. The user's concern about a lingering domain account tied directly to access management following an employee's departure. This confirms my initial assessment. I'm satisfied with this classification. The requested action, deactivation, falls squarely within access control protocols.\n\n\n"
