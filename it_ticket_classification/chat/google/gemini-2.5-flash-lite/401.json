I'm focusing on aligning the user's need with the most relevant and precise label.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI'm now carefully sifting through the ticket's language, zeroing in on the request's core. While \"HR Support\" seemed promising initially, I'm finding that the specifics - \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and \"induction\" - suggest a more direct IT provisioning need that helps facilitate the HR process. My analysis highlights that even though HR is the driving force behind the *process*, IT support is required to aid with the completion and submission of the forms, which involves IT components.\n\n\n**Refining Category Choice**\n\nI'm now carefully re-evaluating the \"HR Support\" category, considering the user's focus on the IT ticket's true nature. Despite the IT aspect of form completion, the core request revolves around facilitating a new employee's induction, an HR-driven process. The keywords \"new starter\" and \"induction\" are strongly indicative of supporting HR's onboarding workflow. It's becoming clear that even though IT steps in to facilitate, the root of the request lies within the HR domain. Consequently, I lean towards \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate categorization.\n\n\n"
