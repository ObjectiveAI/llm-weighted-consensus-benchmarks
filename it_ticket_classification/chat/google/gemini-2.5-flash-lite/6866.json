Based on the words \"card leaver re card leaver pride signature files\" I am leaning towards \"Access\" being the most appropriate. I will keep looking at the other categories to confirm my answer.\n\n\n**Evaluating Category Relevance**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the ticket category. While \"Access\" seemed plausible initially because of potential access revocation, after considering the full context, \"HR Support\" appears significantly more fitting. The keywords \"card leaver,\" \"confidentiality notice,\" and \"confidential proprietary information\" strongly point towards an employee offboarding or HR policy issue. The repeated mentions of \"signature files\" suggest a need to manage or retain employee documents. I am confident that \"HR Support\" is the best category at this time.\n\n\n**Reassessing Keyword Influence**\n\nI'm now refining the category assignment based on a deeper keyword analysis. I've re-examined the ticket text, and now the phrase \"card leaver\" is the most prominent indicator, strongly suggesting an HR-related matter, not solely access revocation. The repeated mentions of \"signature files\" also align with employee offboarding, necessitating the management of company documents. While access may be part of it, the core issue seems firmly rooted in HR policy and data management, and I am confident in selecting \"HR Support\" at this point.\n\n\n"
