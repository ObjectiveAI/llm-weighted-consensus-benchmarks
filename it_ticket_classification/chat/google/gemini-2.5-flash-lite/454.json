It seems most likely that this ticket falls under \"HR Support,\" given the context of time card submission and rejection. I'm also considering whether \"Access\" might apply, but the central issue is not clear access denial or permissions. I'm still weighing this, though I lean toward \"HR Support\" being the best fit.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Classification**\n\nMy assessment strongly favors \"HR Support\". The time card terminology dominates the ticket's description. Access issues seem less central. Based on submitted, rejected, and error messages related to time cards, \"HR Support\" clearly aligns with the core problem. My thought process is nearing a final determination on this matter.\n\n\n"
