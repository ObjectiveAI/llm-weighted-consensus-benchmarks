I'm focusing on keywords to enhance accuracy. The goal is to make the categorizer robust enough to handle slightly different phrasings. The term \"exceeding personal\" is throwing me a bit, but I still think it's storage related.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nRight now, I'm focusing on \"storage\" as the key term to categorize the ticket content. The initial phrases, \"approaching web site storage limit,\" \"available storage,\" and similar ones are pretty clear indicators. I'm building a system to account for variations, like \"push limit,\" within this central theme.\n\n\n"
