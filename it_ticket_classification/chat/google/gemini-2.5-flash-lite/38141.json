Therefore, I've classified it under the \"Storage\" category.\n\n**Identifying Storage Bottlenecks**\n\nI've processed the ticket details, noting the repeated emphasis on \"insufficient space on drive\" and the requirement for \"free space.\" These indicators strongly point to a storage-related issue, so I've categorized it as such.\n\n"
