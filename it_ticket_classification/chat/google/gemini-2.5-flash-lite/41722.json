I've read the description regarding the inability to submit \"past absence leaves,\" and I'm weighing whether it aligns best with \"Access,\" \"HR Support,\" or perhaps \"Miscellaneous.\" My initial inclination is towards \"Access,\" as it seems a system permission issue might be at play. However, I want to confirm that this is not an HR systems issue first. I'm focusing on the nature of \"past absence leaves\" - is it an application, a process, or a setting?\n\n\n**Defining the Core Issue**\n\nI've refined my thinking on the ticket category. Initially, I considered \"Access,\" but upon deeper analysis, I'm now leaning heavily towards \"HR Support.\" The inability to submit \"past absence leaves\" is fundamentally an HR-related process issue, not a permission or access problem. \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate fit as it directly pertains to employee management systems and processes. The other categories, like \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Access\", are less specific and do not accurately reflect the core issue.\n\n\n"
