So far, the provided description is somewhat sparse. \"Issue\" could point in many directions, so I'm trying to find keywords that give me more clues. I'll need more info to hone in on the exact category.\n\n\n**Determining HR Relevance**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"referral tool\" aspect. This strongly suggests an HR-related issue. The core concern is data visibility within the tool, which aligns with HR's recruitment activities. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate category, given the context.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nAfter reviewing the ticket again, my assessment strongly points to \"HR Support\" being the best fit. While there are elements suggestive of \"Access\" issues, the core problem lies in the referral tool's functionality, which is a key HR responsibility. I've concluded that the issue primarily impacts HR processes.\n\n\n"
