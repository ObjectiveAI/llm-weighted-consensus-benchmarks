The first involves requisition approval, which points towards the \"Purchase\" category, and \"incorrect mapping\" leans toward \"Access\". My primary task involves assigning these tickets into the predetermined categories: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\".\n\n\n**Categorizing Further Tickets**\n\nI'm now diving into the next batch of tickets, leveraging my previous understanding. The keyword \"approve requisition\" stands out strongly, with variations appearing frequently. Also, phrases like \"incorrect mapping\" and \"incorrect flows\" provide some key hints. It's becoming clearer that the primary concern of some tickets is the approval process for requisitions, which may involve purchases like \"flight tickets\" and \"accommodation\". I'll consider that for appropriate categorization.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket descriptions and analyzed the recurring themes. The emphasis on \"approve requisition\", combined with mentions of \"flight tickets\" and \"accommodation,\" solidifies my decision. Based on my analysis, \"Purchase\" aligns perfectly with the primary nature of these requests. While \"incorrect mapping\" might hint at a system issue, the core action is centered on approving or rejecting a purchase. I am finalizing the \"Purchase\" category assignment now.\n\n\n"
