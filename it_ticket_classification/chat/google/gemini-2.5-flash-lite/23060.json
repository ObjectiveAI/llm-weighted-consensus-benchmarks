My focus is on analyzing the text provided to accurately categorize it, ensuring it's mapped to the correct department or team for efficient resolution. This involves identifying key terms and intent within the ticket description.\n\n**Identifying Network Infrastructure Task**\n\nMy current focus is on dissecting the IT ticket's content. I've identified keywords like \"wireless networks scan\" and \"rogue wireless networks,\" leading me to believe this request directly pertains to network infrastructure, likely falling under the \"Hardware\" category.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm actively analyzing the provided IT ticket text. My current thought process focuses on keywords like \"wireless networks scan\" and \"rogue wireless networks\" to definitively assign it to the \"Hardware\" category, as these directly relate to network infrastructure.\n\n**Categorizing IT Ticket**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the provided IT ticket text, focusing on keywords like \"wireless networks scan\" and \"rogue wireless networks\" to categorize it. My assessment leans towards \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate classification, given the direct relevance to network infrastructure.\n\n**Refining Category Assignment**\n\nMy current thoughts are focused on definitively assigning the IT ticket. While \"Hardware\" is a strong contender due to the mention of wireless networks, I'm also considering \"Internal Project\" as scanning for rogue networks could be part of a specific initiative or audit. I'm weighing the direct subject matter against the nature of the task.\n\n**Reviewing Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently refining my assessment of the IT ticket's category. While \"Hardware\" remains a strong candidate due to the focus on wireless networks, I'm giving further consideration to \"Internal Project\" as the mention of a \"procedure\" suggests a planned, structured task rather than a reactive hardware issue. I'm weighing the technical subject matter against the project-based nature of the request.\n\n**Assessing Network Infrastructure Task**\n\nI'm currently evaluating the IT ticket's core function. The mention of \"wireless networks scan\" and \"rogue wireless networks\" strongly suggests a focus on network infrastructure, leading me to believe \"Hardware\" is the most appropriate category for this task.\n\n**Assigning Network Scan Ticket**\n\nI've concluded my assessment and determined that the ticket pertains to network infrastructure, specifically scanning for rogue wireless networks. Therefore, I'm categorizing it as \"Hardware\" to align with the management of physical network components.\n\n**Categorizing Wireless Scan**\n\nI'm currently refining the category for this IT ticket. While \"Hardware\" seems a strong fit due to the focus on wireless network infrastructure, I'm now considering \"Internal Project\" more closely given the mention of a \"procedure\" and the proactive nature of scanning for rogue networks, suggesting a planned security or audit task.\n\n"
