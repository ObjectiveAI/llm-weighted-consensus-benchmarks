I'm carefully analyzing each keyword to ensure I select the most appropriate category, balancing accuracy and speed.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've honed in on \"HR Support\" as the definitive category for this ticket. The textual clues regarding \"annual leave days\" solidify this choice. Although the language is somewhat unclear, the HR-related keywords are too prominent to ignore, overshadowing any competing interpretations. The final decision reflects a focused assessment.\n\n\n"
