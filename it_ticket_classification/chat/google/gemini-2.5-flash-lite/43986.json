The key phrases \"annual leave\" and \"holidays\" suggest a clear focus on employee time off. I am evaluating whether this falls under HR Support, or something else. I'm focusing on the category list provided to make sure the best possible category match.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Focus**\n\nThe ticket's leave-related language points definitively to HR Support. \"Annual leave,\" \"holidays,\" and \"absence allowance\" are frequent. I am cross-referencing these keywords with the provided category list to confirm the best fit. I am certain that \"HR Support\" is correct, and I am double checking to make sure it is the ideal categorization.\n\n\n"
