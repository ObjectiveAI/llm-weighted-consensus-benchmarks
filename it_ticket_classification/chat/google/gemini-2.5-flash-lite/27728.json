Considering the keywords like \"new starter\" and \"starter form,\" I am leaning toward a category related to new employee onboarding. The remaining categories appear to be less pertinent given the provided keywords. Further processing is underway to decide between \"HR Support\" and the broader \"Miscellaneous\" categories.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Optimal Category**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category: \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate. The ticket's emphasis on a \"starter form\" for a \"new starter\" strongly suggests this is a new employee onboarding process, which aligns directly with HR support. The form is the focus, more so than access or hardware setup. I'm excluding more general categories, and leaning toward concluding this as the best match.\n\n\n**Selecting \"HR Support\"**\n\nI've determined that \"HR Support\" is the best fit for this ticket. The phrases \"new starter\" and \"starter form,\" combined with the urgency, point clearly towards the onboarding process. Even though IT might interact with new hires to setup the starter form, the ticket's core function is HR-related onboarding. While other categories were considered, \"HR Support\" most directly aligns with the stated need for help with the \"starter form\". Therefore, I'm confidently categorizing the ticket as \"HR Support\".\n\n\n"
