The keywords \"oracle timecards,\" \"colleague has joined,\" and \"his time\" seem to point towards either an HR Support or potentially an Access issue. I need to figure out which category is the most appropriate. I'll need to consider what the system admin sees.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Category**\n\nI've been honing in on the ticket's ideal classification. Based on the clues of \"oracle timecards,\" \"colleague has joined,\" and related timecard concerns, I've discarded categories like \"Hardware\" and \"Storage\" as irrelevant. \"Access\" also seems less appropriate than initially thought. My current assessment clearly favors \"HR Support,\" as the issue directly concerns employee time management. It's a precise fit!\n\n\n"
