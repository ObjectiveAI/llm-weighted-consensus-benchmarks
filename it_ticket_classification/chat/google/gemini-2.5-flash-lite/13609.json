I'm prioritizing \"Storage\" for now. However, I'm analyzing the full text for more clues before committing.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"decommission,\" \"shutdown,\" and \"deletion\" as the core indicators. The presence of \"prod\" and \"test environment\" solidifies the focus on IT infrastructure or applications. \"Black Duck\" reinforces this, likely being a specific tool or system slated for removal. Considering the categories, \"Storage\" feels like the closest fit currently, given the nature of retiring systems and resources, but \"Internal Project\" could also be relevant due to the scope of this work.\n\n\n**Identifying the Scope**\n\nI've re-evaluated the category, focusing on the core activity: decommissioning and deletion. While \"Storage\" remains a possibility due to the removal of system resources, the encompassing nature of \"Internal Project\" now seems more accurate. It encompasses the methodical process of retiring an IT system, including both the technical tasks and project-management aspects.\n\n\n**Confirming the Scope**\n\nI'm now certain that the project-like nature of the decommissioning is key. It's not just a single deletion; it's the structured process of retiring the \"Black Duck\" environments. \"Internal Project\" captures the scope best. I've re-examined and this remains the strongest fit.\n\n\n"
