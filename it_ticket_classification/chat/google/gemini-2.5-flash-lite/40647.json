I'm reviewing the JSON schema, noting that only the 'category' field is mandatory and have identified the eight permissible categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm actively processing the provided IT ticket to assign it the most appropriate category from the defined list. The ticket describes a user experiencing login issues with specific credentials for \"sonar,\" while other applications work fine. This strongly suggests an access-related problem, leading me to tentatively categorize it under \"Access.\"\n\n**Processing Ticket Content**\n\nI'm refining the category assignment for the IT ticket. The user's login issue with Sonar, despite successful access to other applications, strongly indicates an \"Access\" related problem, which I'm confirming as the most appropriate classification.\n\n**Resolving Sonar Access Issues**\n\nI'm confirming the categorization of the IT ticket. The user's inability to log into Sonar with AD credentials, while successfully accessing other applications, clearly indicates an \"Access\" related problem, which is the most fitting category.\n\n"
