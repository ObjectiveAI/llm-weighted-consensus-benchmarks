Currently, the most relevant categories seem to be \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous\". The user's notes and their issues joining and staying in calls are giving me a strong signal. I need to make a final decision, but \"Access\" is looking more likely right now.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Problems**\n\nI'm continuing to analyze the IT ticket. I've ruled out several categories, like Hardware and HR Support. Access remains the most likely candidate, as the user is experiencing issues joining and remaining in meetings. I'm focusing on the idea that the user's core problem lies in the inability to properly access and utilize the meeting functionality.\n\n\n**Revisiting Ticket Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted to refining the \"Access\" categorization. After another review, the phrase \"cannot join\" strongly suggests access or connectivity issues to the core meeting functionality. Given the symptoms, such as the user repeatedly getting kicked out and being unable to join via phone, I'm leaning toward access or network availability as the source of the problem. It's becoming increasingly clear that the root cause likely lies in some form of access restriction, whether software-related or network-based.\n\n\n"
