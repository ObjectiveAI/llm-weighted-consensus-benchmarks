It seems related to a technical issue, but further context is needed for accurate categorization. The simplicity of the description is the challenge.\n\n\n**Categorizing the IE/Chrome issue**\n\nI've refined the analysis of the \"ie chrome issue\" ticket. The critical points are browser-specific access problems with contract upload/viewing. While initially considering administrative rights, it seems less likely if the core issue is browser compatibility. Access problems are most relevant now, because the user can\u2019t perform core tasks. The other possibilities are less applicable.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Access**\n\nI've concluded that the ticket concerns an access problem. The user's inability to upload and view contracts due to browser compatibility issues is central. Whether the root is permissions or a browser bug, the core issue is the user's lack of access to perform those core actions. \"Access\" encompasses this, unlike \"Administrative rights\" which might be a symptom but not the problem itself. It's not a hardware, HR, storage, purchase, or project-related issue. \"Miscellaneous\" is a last resort.\n\n\n"
