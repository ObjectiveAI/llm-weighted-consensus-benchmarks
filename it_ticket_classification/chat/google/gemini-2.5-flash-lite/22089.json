It looks like the key information points towards a new employee joining the team in Colombia. I'm focusing on keywords and phrases to pinpoint the appropriate category. My initial assessment leans towards \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access\" since it mentions a \"new starter.\" I'm carefully weighing the context to eliminate other less likely options.\n\n\n**Defining the Scope**\n\nI've refined my category selection to \"HR Support.\" The phrase \"new starter\" strongly suggests onboarding, and while access might be a component, \"HR Support\" encapsulates the overall task. The ticket mentions a form being \"completed,\" which further supports the HR connection, especially considering the need for IT assistance. I'm confident in my categorization, considering the broader context provided in the IT ticket's text.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on confirming \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category. The ticket text's details, particularly the new employee context and associated actions, strengthen this classification. Specifics like \"completed form\" and the job title \"developer senior technician\" align with HR processes. Although access could play a role, HR encompasses a broader range of tasks.\n\n\n"
