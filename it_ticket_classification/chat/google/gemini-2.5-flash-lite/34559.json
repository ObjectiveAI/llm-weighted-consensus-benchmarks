Based on the repeated mentions of \"per diem expense report,\" \"expense report,\" and \"approval,\" it seems to fit best within the \"Miscellaneous\" category for now.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Content**\n\nI've reviewed the IT ticket description and identified key phrases like \"per diem expense report,\" \"absence,\" and \"annual leave.\" Based on this, I'm now confident that \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category for this ticket, rather than the previously considered \"Miscellaneous.\"\n\n"
