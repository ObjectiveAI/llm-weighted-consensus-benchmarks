The terms \"filter\" and \"addresses\" lean towards email handling, while \"deleted automatically after days\" strongly suggests a **Storage** issue concerning retention policies or archiving. I'm leaning towards Storage.\n\n**Refining Storage Classification**\n\nI'm focusing on the \"deleted automatically after days\" clause. This strongly points to email retention policies or archiving, which falls under **Storage** management. While email filtering is mentioned, the core problem seems to be data lifecycle management.\n\n"
