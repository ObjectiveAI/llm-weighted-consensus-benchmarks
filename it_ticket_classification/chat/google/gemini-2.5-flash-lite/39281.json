Considering the symptoms, I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the most suitable initial category. I'll need to confirm that other categories, like \"Internal Project,\" do not fit.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Culprit**\n\nI've refined my initial hardware assessment. Considering the slow boot, Excel failures, and data loss, \"Hardware\" remains the most accurate starting point. The other categories don't capture the essence of the problem. While it could be software, without additional information, hardware issues are the most likely initial focus for diagnosing the problems described.\n\n\n**Evaluating Hardware vs Software**\n\nI'm now focusing on whether the issue is definitively hardware-related or possibly a software performance problem that manifests as hardware-like failures. While I initially leaned towards \"Hardware\" due to the slow performance and application failures, I'm now considering the possibility of corrupted system files or a driver conflict. The symptoms are still strongly suggestive of a hardware issue, but I want to be open to software as a contributor. I will still categorize this as \"Hardware\" as the most likely starting point, but I will keep software as a possible contributor in my troubleshooting.\n\n\n"
