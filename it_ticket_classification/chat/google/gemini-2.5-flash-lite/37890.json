It looks like the issue is related to outdated or lingering \"requisitions\" and \"positions\" within the \"select minds\" system. Specifically, there's a problem with expired analyst positions still appearing as open and a need to remove them without closing them. Other positions, such as \"graduate programme\" roles, are also mentioned.\n\n\n**Categorizing HR Issue**\n\nI've analyzed the IT ticket, focusing on the core problem: outdated job listings in \"select minds.\" The categories I'm considering are HR Support and Miscellaneous. While it's a system issue, the root cause revolves around managing job openings, suggesting HR Support. \"Miscellaneous\" remains a secondary option if HR Support doesn't fully capture it.\n\n\n**Determining the Root Cause**\n\nI've determined the key problem is outdated job listings within \"select minds.\" After careful evaluation, I've concluded the most likely root cause points to HR support. This issue focuses on HR's system for managing job requisitions and the need to streamline their removal or status change, to keep the system up to date.\n\n\n"
