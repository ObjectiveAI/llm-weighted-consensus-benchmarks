Right now, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous,\" given the limited information. I'll need to keep parsing and updating as I gather new data.\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the \"token\" data, and the focus is clearly hardware-centric. Phrases like \"spare tokens needed,\" \"replacement tokens,\" and \"ordering tokens\" are emerging as the common thread. Based on this, I'm now leaning more firmly toward \"Purchase\" as the dominant category. The context of ordering and acquiring tokens seems to supersede any potential hardware management concerns. It is clearly a need for purchasing and assigning tokens.\n\n\n"
