The mention of \"leaver\" suggests a potential HR-related issue or access revocation.  I'm now considering how best to categorize this information based on the provided schema. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" but need to confirm if there are other relevant keywords that I may have missed, to refine the final classification.\n\n\n**Revising Categorization Focus**\n\nI'm now focusing on solidifying the \"HR Support\" categorization for the ticket. The repetition of \"leavers\" reinforces this. While access deactivation is implied, \"HR Support\" encompasses the entire scope of the leaver process. I'm satisfied that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate classification.\n\n\n**Refining Classification Decision**\n\nI've reviewed the ticket text again and, while access deactivation is a component, the overarching theme of \"leavers\" reinforces the selection of \"HR Support.\" The context suggests broader processes. No other categories seem as fitting, and I'm confident in categorizing it as \"HR Support\". The various \"leaver\" references all point to this specific categorization within the provided schema.\n\n\n"
