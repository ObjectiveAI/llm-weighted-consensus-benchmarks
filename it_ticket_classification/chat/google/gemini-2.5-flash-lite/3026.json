It feels like this leans toward a \"Purchase\" or \"Administrative Rights\" issue, but I need to consider all available options to make the best possible determination. I am still evaluating the details.\n\n\n**Determining the Ticket Type**\n\nI've determined the ticket is related to HR. The text, specifically the phrases about contract endings and offboarding, clearly points to this. After a thorough review, \"HR Support\" appears to be the most fitting category. I've now constructed a JSON object to reflect this conclusion, as requested.\n\n\n"
