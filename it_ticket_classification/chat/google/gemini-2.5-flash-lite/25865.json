I'm also considering \"transferring folders\" in relation to data management and storage needs.\n\n**Identifying Core Issue**\n\nI'm refining my understanding of the ticket's primary concern. While data transfer (\"storage\") is mentioned, the repeated emphasis on hardware components like the monitor and ports suggests \"Hardware\" is the most fitting primary category.\n\n**Assigning Primary Category**\n\nI'm concluding that \"Hardware\" is the most fitting primary category for this ticket. While file transfers are mentioned, the explicit requests for monitor replacement, port issue resolution, and guidance on connecting a second screen strongly align with hardware-related concerns.\n\n**Focusing on Hardware Aspects**\n\nI'm prioritizing the hardware-related components of the ticket.
