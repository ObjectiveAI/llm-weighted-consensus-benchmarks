I'm looking for keywords and thematic elements within the text to guide this decision.\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nMy ongoing analysis is focused on identifying the most fitting category for the IT ticket. I'm cross-referencing keywords related to surveys, improvements, and dashboards against the available options to make the most accurate assignment.\n\n**Determining Project Classification**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the provided text, identifying recurring themes of survey management, client engagement, feature development for dashboards, and strategic improvements. Based on these elements, I've concluded that \"Internal Project\" is the most accurate classification for this ticket.\n\n"
