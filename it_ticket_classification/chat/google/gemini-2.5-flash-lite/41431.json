The final \"smo\" is confusing, adding an unnecessary layer.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"HR Support\" as the most likely category. The phrases about line manager assignment and constant errors point directly to an HR-related system or process. While \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility, it's a secondary concern to the core issue of setting the line manager. The \"module works\" detail remains a bit of a mystery, but likely implies that the underlying system itself is functioning, and the error stems from user action within that system.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Relevance**\n\nI've solidified my belief that this ticket belongs in \"HR Support.\" The \"line manager\" context is key, pointing directly to HR processes and systems. The recurring errors while attempting this specific task further supports this conclusion. While \"Administrative rights\" might be tangentially involved, it's a secondary consideration to the core HR-related problem. The \"module works\" phrase still needs context, but likely indicates the system, not the underlying process, is functional.\n\n\n"
