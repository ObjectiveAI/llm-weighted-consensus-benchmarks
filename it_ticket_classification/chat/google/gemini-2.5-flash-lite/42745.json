My goal is to select the correct category from \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\".  I'm leaning towards \"Hardware,\" as the issue seems device-specific, but I need to be certain. I'm now considering the possibility of an Access issue.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've been analyzing the IT ticket. The core issue is a device's inability to share video in the \"belgrade room,\" focusing on its specific functionality. After examining the provided categories, I'm confident \"Hardware\" is the most fitting. It aligns perfectly with the device-centric problem. \"Access\" was a brief consideration, but it's not the primary issue. I've ruled out all the other options as they don't describe the situation in the ticket.\n\n\n"
