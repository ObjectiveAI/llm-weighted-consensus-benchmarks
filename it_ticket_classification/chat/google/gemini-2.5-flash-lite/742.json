The recurring phrases \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" strongly indicate an HR-related onboarding process. Although \"mobile hardware\" is mentioned, it appears to be a secondary element within the broader context of bringing on a new employee. Therefore, \"HR Support\" seems to be the primary classification.\n\n**Identifying Core Ticket Purpose**\n\nI'm refining my understanding of the primary intent behind the ticket. The strong indicators of \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" consistently point towards HR support, even with mentions of hardware, which appear to be ancillary to the onboarding process.\n\n"
