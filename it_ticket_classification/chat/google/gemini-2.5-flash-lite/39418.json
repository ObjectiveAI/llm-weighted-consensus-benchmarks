I've narrowed it down, and am now leaning towards \"Access,\" as it seems a permissions issue might be at play. I'm carefully comparing it to other options like \"Miscellaneous\" to ensure I capture the root cause accurately. The core issue of tagging limitations requires the right classification.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Category**\n\nI've solidified my thoughts on the category. After re-evaluating the ticket content \u2013 specifically the inability to tag and the investigation into permission groups \u2013 I'm definitively settling on \"Access.\"  The \"Access\" category directly addresses the core issue of a user's permissions limiting their functionality, making it the most accurate fit.\n\n\n"
