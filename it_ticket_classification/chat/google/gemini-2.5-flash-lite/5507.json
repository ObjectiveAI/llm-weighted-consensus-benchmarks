My analysis strongly points towards the \"HR Support\" category, as the terms align with employee onboarding processes and required forms.\n\n**Assigning IT Tickets**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket description, identifying keywords like \"new starter\" and \"joiners.\" My current thought process confirms these strongly indicate an \"HR Support\" category, aligning with employee onboarding procedures and documentation requirements.\n\n"
