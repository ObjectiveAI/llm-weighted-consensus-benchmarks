The wording is quite cryptic, so I'm focusing on keywords like \"contractor\" and \"complete\" to see if they offer any clues. I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" as the initial classification, but I'm still trying to extract more specific details to refine that choice. There might be some contextual understanding that's being missed.\n\n\n**Identifying HR Processes**\n\nI've been examining the ticket text and I'm now leaning heavily toward \"HR Support.\" The repeated mentions of \"contractor complete\" along with \"starter form\" and someone being \"off sick\" strongly suggest issues related to onboarding, offboarding, or perhaps contractor absence management. These are typically HR functions, and I'm further analyzing the context for specific keywords to pinpoint the exact nature of the request.\n\n\n**Defining the Issue's Scope**\n\nI'm now focusing on the core problem: a contractor's onboarding or status is entangled with an employee's sickness. The ticket's content, despite its disjointedness, consistently points to HR-related processes. I'm prioritizing \"HR Support\" because of the recurring themes of forms, contractors, and employee absence. I'm certain now that it doesn't fall into the other categories.\n\n\n"
