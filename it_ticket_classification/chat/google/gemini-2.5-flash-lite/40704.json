I want to make sure I don't overlook any hidden clues in the phrasing. I'm building a mental model to determine a precise classification.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nAfter examining the phrases and words in the ticket, such as \"approvals,\" \"appro ving,\" and \"leave request,\" the \"HR Support\" category seems most applicable. Despite the \"oracle\" reference, the core issue centers on approval workflows and their impact on a leave request, which strongly points towards an HR-related problem. I'm finalizing my determination based on this refined understanding.\n\n\n"
