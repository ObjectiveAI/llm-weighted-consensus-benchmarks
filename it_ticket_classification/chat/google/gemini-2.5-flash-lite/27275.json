I'm actively searching the ticket text for specific keywords that align with the provided categories. I'm breaking down the text to find the most relevant clues, and this step is crucial for accurate classification.\n\n\n**Identifying Key Indicators**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and identifying key indicators for categorization. The phrase \"user roles changes\" clearly points towards \"Access\" or \"Administrative Rights\". The long section mentions adding/removing members, further reinforcing those categories. Confluence references suggest potential setup or administrative tasks. I'm focusing on these clues to refine the classification process.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text, primarily focusing on user roles and membership management. Phrases like \"user roles changes,\" \"add ones,\" and \"removed\" are strong indicators. The Confluence references suggest administrative or project-related access modifications, but the core issue revolves around user access permissions. I've ruled out Hardware, HR Support, Purchase, and Storage due to a lack of relevant keywords. While \"Internal Project\" is involved, the critical aspect is the user-level access manipulation, making \"Access\" the most accurate fit.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've been drilling down on the text, with particular attention to how user access is manipulated. I've noted the consistent references to adding, removing, and modifying member roles, alongside mentions of ownership and user permissions. I've effectively eliminated hardware, HR, storage, and purchase as viable categories. Although \"Internal Project\" is involved, the primary focus remains user-level access adjustments, solidifying \"Access\" as the precise classification.\n\n\n"
