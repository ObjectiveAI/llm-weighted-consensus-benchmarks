                    "reasoning": "**Determining the Category**\n\nI'm currently focused on the challenge of accurately categorizing this IT ticket. The text, \"modify notifications for now cr approval,\" is being analyzed to find the best fit from the options.  My analysis leans towards identifying the core issue; I am exploring the context of \"modify notifications\" to map it to the most relevant category.\n\n\n**Categorizing the CR Ticket**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the IT ticket text. The core focus is on notifications and reminders related to Change Requests (CRs) awaiting Change Advisory Board (CAB) approval. Key phrases like \"modify notifications,\" \"reminders,\" and \"pending approval\" guide my categorization effort. I'm prioritizing the context of these terms to pinpoint the best category, which leans toward either \"Access\" or a new category concerning change management. I will continue to narrow down options.\n\n\n**Analyzing Notification Changes**\n\nThis request feels like it's about the internal change management process, specifically the configuration of automated notifications related to CRs. I'm focusing on \"modify notifications,\" and \"enable out reminders\" to refine my categorization. The terms, \"outstanding change tasks,\" and \"working days\" narrow my current options. I am strongly leaning towards either an \"Internal Project\" or a new category concerning change management. I need to be sure this is not strictly a system access issue. I am continuing the analysis.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text, focusing on the core request. It is about a configuration change within a system managing Change Requests (CRs) and Change Advisory Board (CAB) approvals. \"Modify notifications\" and \"enable out reminders\" for \"outstanding change tasks\" are key phrases. While \"Internal Project\" is a contender, it's more of a system process update, not a full-scale project. I lean toward a more specific category reflecting this nuance.\n\n\n**Determining Project Scope**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the IT ticket's complexities. The core focus remains firmly on change management processes and the associated notification system. I'm prioritizing the context surrounding the modification of notifications for change requests, especially those pending CAB approval. I'm still weighing \"Internal Project\" as the best fit. I will continue to narrow down options.\n\n\\n\\n\nI'm zeroing in on an internal project focused on refining the Change Request (CR) workflow, particularly the notification system. The key lies in \"modify notifications\" and \"enable out reminders,\" aligning perfectly with a project aimed at optimizing internal IT processes. This is much more than a simple configuration tweak; it signifies a conscious effort to enhance communication and streamline approval tasks. I'm now leaning heavily towards \"Internal Project\".\n\n\n**Focusing on Internal Processes**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the essence of the ticket: a configuration change within the Change Request (CR) notification system, tied to the Change Advisory Board (CAB) approval workflow. Key phrases like \"modify notifications\" and \"enable out reminders\" underscore a need to optimize internal processes.  I am confident that this is an internal project focused on refining our change management workflow, with a specific emphasis on the timing and content of automated communications.\n\n\n"
