The description, \"not responding responding hello have created ticket responding gives timeout we need push merge commits we have release tomorrow can,\" indicates a critical, time-sensitive issue that needs immediate attention given the impending release. I'm prioritizing it as high-urgency.\n\n**Categorizing IT Issues**\n\nI'm refining the classification of the provided IT ticket. Based on the context of \"push merge commits\" and an impending \"release tomorrow,\" alongside \"timeout\" errors, I'm leaning towards categorizing this as an \"Internal Project\" issue, as it directly impacts development workflows and release schedules.\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Urgency**\n\nI've processed the ticket details, and the phrase \"push merge commits\" coupled with \"release tomorrow\" strongly suggests an internal development roadblock. I'm classifying this under \"Internal Project\" due to its direct impact on the project's release timeline and its technical nature.\n\n**Addressing Project Blockers**\n\nI'm currently refining the categorization of the IT ticket. My analysis confirms the core issue revolves around an inability to \"push merge commits\" due to system timeouts, directly impacting an imminent \"release tomorrow.\" This strongly points towards a problem within the development workflow, making \"Internal Project\" the most fitting category given the provided options.\n\n**Identifying Project Roadblocks**\n\nI'm currently processing the IT ticket to determine the most fitting category. The details provided, specifically the mention of \"push merge commits\" and an impending \"release tomorrow,\" alongside system timeouts, strongly indicate a critical blockage within the development workflow for an internal project. Thus, I'm classifying it as such.\n\n"
