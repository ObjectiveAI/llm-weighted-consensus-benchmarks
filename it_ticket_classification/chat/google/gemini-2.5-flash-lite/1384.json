I'll need to confirm that this is not an HR request or some other form of request. I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access.\"\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've been further analyzing the ticket text, specifically focusing on the phrase \"left owner.\" This points towards an HR-driven event. The need to reassign mailboxes often stems from employee departures. While \"Access\" is relevant, the context leans more towards HR-related workflows. Therefore, I'm now leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most accurate categorization for this ticket.\n\n\n**Identifying the Primary Cause**\n\nMy analysis continues. I've re-examined the phrase \"left owner,\" which strengthens the connection to HR. While managing mailboxes is an access-related task, the catalyst (employee departure) firmly places this ticket within the realm of HR-triggered workflows, not IT's direct responsibility. The focus is now on the *why* - an employee leaving - not just the *what* - changing ownership.\n\n\n"
