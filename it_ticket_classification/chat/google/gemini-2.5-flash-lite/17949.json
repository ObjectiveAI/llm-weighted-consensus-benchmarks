                    "reasoning": "**Determining Ticket Type**\n\nI'm currently trying to pinpoint the most fitting category for that ticket. Based on the phrasing, \"create record\" and \"change destination\" I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or potentially \"Storage.\" The other categories don't seem like the best fit here. I'm focusing on the technical aspect of record creation and modification.\n\n\n**Revising Ticket Classification**\n\nAfter a deeper dive, I'm now leaning heavily towards \"Access\" as the primary category, with a secondary consideration for \"Storage.\" The initial analysis of keywords like \"create record\" and \"change destination\" pointed toward record management, most likely DNS related. I'm focusing on \"Access\" now, as creating and changing records inherently affects access to network resources. I've ruled out HR, Hardware, Purchase, and Administrative Rights. \"Internal Project\" is still a possibility, but less likely.\n\n\n**Categorizing the DNS Request**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text and available categories.  The request to \"create\" and \"change\" records, especially within the \"net tuesday\" context, feels most relevant to either \"Access\" or \"Internal Project\". The \"create\" and \"change\" verbs are key. DNS falls somewhere between Access and Infrastructure. I'm focusing on record creation and modification which affect access, with an emphasis on the \"net tuesday\" identifier. I've eliminated \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" The \"Miscellaneous\" category remains a fallback, but my instinct leans towards the more specific \"Access\" or potentially \"Internal Project\". The request seems to be about record management, possibly DNS entries.\n\n\n**Focusing Ticket Purpose**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the purpose of this ticket. \"Create\" and \"change\" signal record manipulation.  \"Net tuesday\" is still key; an internal project is likely. The records modify access to a destination. Ultimately, access management feels like the most accurate. I'm prioritizing the impact on network access.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nI'm now focusing on the implied infrastructure aspect. The actions, \"create\" and \"change\" records that \"point to\" destinations, feel directly related to infrastructure. If \"net tuesday\" is an internal project, \"Internal Project\" is the best fit. I've ruled out \"Access\" as the primary, but it's not a bad second choice.\n\n\n**Choosing the Primary Category**\n\nI'm now determining the most appropriate category for this ticket. After considering the \"create record\" and \"change destination\" actions, I'm strongly leaning towards \"Internal Project,\" given the presence of \"net tuesday\" as a potential project identifier. This indicates a focus on an internal initiative requiring network record adjustments, likely DNS. I've narrowed the choices to primarily \"Internal Project\" and possibly \"Access\" as secondary, discarding other less fitting options like \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Hardware,\" etc.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Context**\n\nThe current focus is interpreting the request for record modification. The key phrases are \"create record\" and \"change destination\" and the unknown \"net tuesday.\" I'm strongly leaning toward \"Internal Project\" due to the possibility of \"net tuesday\" being a project identifier.  If \"net tuesday\" is not relevant, \"Miscellaneous\" might be better.\n\n\n"
