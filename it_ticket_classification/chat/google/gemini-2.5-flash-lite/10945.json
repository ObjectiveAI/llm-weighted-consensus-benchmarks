The repeated use of \"change\" is a key indicator, but I need to understand *what* is being changed to make a confident decision. I'm focusing on keywords and phrases that might hint at the specific nature of this \"change\" request.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Change**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Access\" as the most likely category. The phrase \"change existing members\" strongly suggests alterations to user permissions or group memberships. While \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility, it seems too specific unless further context reveals it's about elevated privileges. The failed attempt to change further reinforces the access-related nature of the request.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've considered all the clues and settled on \"Access\" as the most suitable category. The repeated use of \"change,\" coupled with \"existing members,\" seals it. Though \"Administrative rights\" is a possibility, \"Access\" is more generalized, covering a wider range of user permission alterations, which aligns better with the somewhat ambiguous nature of the ticket. The failed direct change attempt further supports the need for access modification.\n\n\n"
