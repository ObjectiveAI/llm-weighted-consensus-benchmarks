I've begun analyzing the sample text to identify the most relevant category. So far, the phrase \"broken laptop screen urgent need for replacement laptop\" points strongly towards a \"Hardware\" issue.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Text Further**\n\nI'm now diving deeper into the ticket text. While \"Hardware\" remains the primary category, the phrase \"need regular access documents contracts budgets etc\" does highlight an access component, though secondary to the hardware issue. I'm weighing whether to include a secondary category or stick with \"Hardware\" as the dominant classification. The urgency of the situation emphasizes the need for a quick hardware resolution to restore access.\n\n\n**Determining the Primary Issue**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text, zeroing in on the core problem. Although access to documents is mentioned, it's clear the primary obstacle is the malfunctioning laptop screen. The immediate need for a replacement device underscores the hardware's central role, making \"Hardware\" the most fitting primary category, even though access is indirectly impacted. The emphasis is the broken hardware preventing work, so hardware trumps the secondary access issue.\n\n\n"
