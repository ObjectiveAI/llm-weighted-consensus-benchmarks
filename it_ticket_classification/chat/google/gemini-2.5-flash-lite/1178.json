After careful consideration of the text, I believe the words suggest an employee's departure, potentially requiring some final tasks or actions. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category.\n\n\n**Confirming HR as Key**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's text, and my initial inclination toward \"HR Support\" still holds. While access revocation and device deactivation are potential follow-up tasks, the fundamental reason for the ticket is the employee's departure. This departure is the primary catalyst for all other necessary actions. Categorizing it under HR reflects the root cause and ensures the appropriate department is involved from the start.\n\n\n**Selecting the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"HR Support\" classification. Analyzing the text, the departing employee is clearly the central element, which in turn necessitates access changes and possible device handover. Though IT tasks are present, HR's involvement is fundamentally more crucial to initiate and manage the departure process itself. Therefore, HR is the best primary focus.\n\n\n"
