I'll need to confirm that this doesn't fall under a more specific storage allocation process.\n\n\n**Confirming Hardware Category**\n\nI've zeroed in on the \"Hardware\" category. After analyzing the ticket details (\"notification prod server request for memory ram\", \"increase total amount memory\"), the repeated emphasis on \"memory RAM\" confirms my initial instinct. The user's request is purely for a hardware resource, solidifying \"Hardware\" as the correct classification.\n\n\n"
