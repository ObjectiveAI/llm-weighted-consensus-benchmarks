After analyzing the phrase \"people operations access rights,\" I've concluded this is likely related to user permissions and access, therefore leaning towards \"Access\". This selection aligns perfectly with the content of the ticket. I have discarded the other categories.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Categorization**\n\nI've rigorously analyzed the ticket's text, identifying \"access rights\" as the core issue. All the phrases point towards granting, confirming, or restricting access to resources for operations teams. After considering the \"Administrative rights\" option, I decided \"Access\" is more suitable. \"Access\" directly reflects the ticket's focus on user permissions and library access.\n\n\n"
