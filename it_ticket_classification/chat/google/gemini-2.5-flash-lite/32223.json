The keywords 'leaver', 'form' and 'leave' suggest this might fall under HR Support, but I need to be certain. I am going to try to identify any other clues.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI've honed in on the key indicators within the ticket text. The terms \"leaver,\" \"mailbox,\" \"AD rights,\" and \"mobile phone\" definitely point towards an offboarding process. I'm focusing on the \"HR Support\" category, as employee offboarding encompasses both IT access removal and HR procedures, confirming the original hypothesis.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Ticket Data**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the ticket details, correlating keywords with specific categories. \"Leaver\" is a recurring theme. The elements are pointing toward the best category; given the presence of \"HR Support\" in the options, this seems to be the most relevant and encompassing.\n\n\n**Identifying the Primary Driver**\n\nI'm now certain \"HR Support\" is the optimal classification. The key is understanding that IT access management for a departing employee is a direct function supporting HR's offboarding process.  The presence of the \"leaver form,\" \"leaving date,\" and overall context solidified the correlation. The ticket focuses on the tasks surrounding a leaving employee, which HR manages.\n\n"
