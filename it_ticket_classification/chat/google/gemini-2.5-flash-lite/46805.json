My focus is on selecting the most appropriate category from the provided list to ensure efficient resolution. The ticket explicitly mentions access issues related to timecards, pointing towards \"Access\" as the primary classification.\n\n**Determining Ticket Classification**\n\nI've reviewed the details of the IT ticket concerning the new employee's timecard viewing issue. Based on the explicit mention of \"cannot view timecards\" and the request to \"be able view approve,\" the most fitting category is \"Access.\" This directly addresses the core problem of permission and visibility for the specified system.\n\n**Selecting Ticket Category**\n\nI've finalized my assessment of the IT ticket. The core issue revolves around a new employee's inability to access and view timecards, along with the request to enable approval capabilities. Consequently, I've definitively categorized this as an \"Access\" related issue, given its direct relevance to permissions and system visibility.\n\n"
