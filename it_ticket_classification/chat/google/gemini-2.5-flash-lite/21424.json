Therefore, I'm categorizing this ticket under \"Access.\"\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Request**\n\nI've analyzed the provided text, focusing on keywords like \"ad groups,\" \"members,\" and \"owners\" across various \"locations.\" My current thinking leans heavily towards classifying this request under \"Access,\" as the core actions involve managing user permissions and group memberships, rather than hardware, HR, purchases, or general administration.\n\n"
