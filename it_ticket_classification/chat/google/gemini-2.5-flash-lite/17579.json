The key phrases \"missing affected clients\" and \"ms shared infra\" seem most relevant. While several options are viable, the \"missing\" element might suggest an access or hardware issue, possibly related to shared infrastructure. I'm leaning towards \"Access\" but I am also considering \"Hardware\".\n\n\n**Analyzing Infrastructure Issues**\n\nI've been analyzing the \"shared infra\" references, specifically \"customers added by default\" and \"amendments implemented\". This suggests a system configuration or access problem. While \"log high priority feature\" sounds like a potential feature request, the core issue is the infrastructure's behavior. I am now evaluating the best category, focusing on whether this is more a configuration/access issue within the shared infrastructure than a specific hardware problem.\n\n\n**Evaluating Infrastructure Impact**\n\nI'm now focusing on how the \"shared infra\" issues affect access, configuration, and feature requests. The repeated mentions of \"shared infra\" and \"affected clients\" strongly suggest an infrastructure-related problem, but access may be the issue at the heart of it all. I am now considering if this should be categorized as an \"Access\" issue, given the impact on users, or whether the overall system context means a wider category is needed.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI'm now evaluating whether the issue is primarily one of access, configuration, or a broader system-level problem. The constant mentions of shared infrastructure and clients being added by default reinforce the importance of understanding the infrastructure's configuration and access control. While the \"log high priority feature\" sounds like a potential feature request, the core issue seems to be a system configuration or a provisioning problem, possibly related to access. I will prioritize \"Access\" for this ticket.\n\n\n**Refining Access Categorization**\n\nI've been honing my focus on the \"Access\" category, driven by the phrases \"missing affected clients\" and \"customers added by default.\" My current thought is centered on how users interact with the shared infra. The \"log high priority feature\" sounds like a potential feature request, however, the problem seems to be directly about the provisioning of access or how users are being affected by the shared infrastructure.\n\n\n**Defining Access Issues**\n\nI've determined \"Access\" is the most appropriate category for this ticket, and the reasoning is solid. The phrases \"missing affected clients\" and \"customers added by default\" are key. Even though it's related to a shared infrastructure, the core issue seems to be how users interact with that infrastructure, pointing squarely towards access control or user provisioning. The \"log high priority feature\" might suggest an addition, but the central concern is customer management.\n\n\n"
