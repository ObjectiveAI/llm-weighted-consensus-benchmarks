I'm leaning toward this category now, I am getting closer to the appropriate categorization.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Text**\n\nI've taken a deep dive into the provided text and pinpointed keywords that clearly link to HR processes. \"Time sheets,\" \"entering hours,\" and \"submitted\" are key indicators. I've ruled out all other categories, concluding that the ticket is definitively an HR Support issue.\n\n\n"
