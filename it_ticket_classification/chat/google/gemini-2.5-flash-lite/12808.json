Based on the mention of \"access to banks\" and \"banks folder,\" I'm leaning heavily towards \"Access,\" but I'm still weighing other options. My immediate focus is on whether the ticket specifically requests folder permissions.\n\n\n**Revising the Selection**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, particularly phrases like \"give whole banks folder\" and \"approving access.\" While \"Storage\" initially seemed relevant due to folder references, the primary request is undoubtedly for *access*. Therefore, I'm confident that \"Access\" is the most accurate classification.\n\n\n"
