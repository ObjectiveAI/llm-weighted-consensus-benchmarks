Considering the mention of \"new starter\" and \"employees\", I'm leaning toward either \"HR Support\" or potentially \"Access,\" depending on the specifics of the request. The text is still a bit ambiguous, but I'm focusing on keywords.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket's Purpose**\n\nI've honed in on the HR Support category. The phrase \"new starter\" along with the description of interns becoming employees and needing account changes solidified this. The focus on account status adjustments and closing accounts at the internship's end further supports this classification. This ticket clearly centers on employee lifecycle management, making HR the best fit.\n\n\n"
