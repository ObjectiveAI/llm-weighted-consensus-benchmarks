My aim is to discern the primary intent by distinguishing relevant keywords from boilerplate text, looking for clues related to task progression, change management, or user onboarding.\n\n**Reviewing Ticket Details**\n\nI'm currently reviewing the ticket's content, trying to isolate the primary request amidst repetitive phrasing and disclaimers. My current focus is on identifying the most relevant keywords to align with one of the provided categories.\n\n**Filtering Ticket Content**\n\nI'm refining my analysis, focusing on filtering out the extensive disclaimers and repetitive phrases. My current priority is to isolate keywords related to core IT functions, especially those concerning new personnel onboarding and system change processes.\n\n**Prioritizing User Onboarding**\n\nI'm focusing on the request for \"joiners asap,\" which clearly indicates a need for new user onboarding.
