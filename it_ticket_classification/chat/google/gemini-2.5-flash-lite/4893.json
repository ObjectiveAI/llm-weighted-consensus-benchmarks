My initial analysis indicates it likely falls under a category related to physical assets or perhaps disposal. I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" or potentially a more specific subcategory if available. I'll need to re-evaluate the choices, comparing context, when the ticket description becomes more elaborate. I think the key here is to find the most appropriate category.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Options**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" categories. The \"damaged cards belonging leavers\" phrasing firmly connects the ticket to employee departure processes. While the cards *could* relate to access, HR's involvement in managing these items, including their destruction, makes \"HR Support\" the leading contender. I will be sure to compare and contrast before I finalize my recommendation. The other choices seem less relevant.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Connection**\n\nI've decided to firmly assign the ticket to \"HR Support\". The mention of \"cards belonging to leavers\" is irrefutable evidence of an HR process. Destroying these cards is likely a standard procedure in managing employee departures, and the wording clearly connects to HR's responsibilities. It is the best choice given the context.\n\n\n"
