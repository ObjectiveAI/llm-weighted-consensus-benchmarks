The final classification will hinge on further analysis, specifically if I find other qualifying key phrases in the text.\n\n\n**Confirming the Purchase**\n\nI've determined that the IT ticket clearly falls under \"Purchase.\" The key phrases, like \"buy additional licenses\" and variations thereof, leave no room for ambiguity. This seems quite straightforward now.\n\n\n"
