I'll need to confirm that this is not an access issue, but the current signals point to HR needing to process a new hire in the system.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating Ticket Type**\n\nI'm now revisiting the classification and leaning even further towards \"HR Support.\" While \"hardware allocation\" is present, the core issue is likely the *process* for the new employee, encompassing IT setup, which is often an HR-driven process. The \"starting July\" timeline reinforces this perspective. My reasoning is solidifying around the idea that \"HR Support\" best captures the context and scope of this ticket's purpose. It's becoming clearer this is about enabling a new employee.\n\n\n**Refining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm now completely solidifying on \"HR Support\" as the best categorization. The focus on \"new starter\" remains the most compelling factor. While \"hardware allocation\" is mentioned, the core of the ticket is about setting up a new employee, which encompasses the process that includes hardware. My rationale strengthens; setting up a new hire is a process driven by HR requiring IT assistance. The context underscores a holistic onboarding request.\n\n\n"
