While \"return\" hints at a hardware component, the infrastructure context pushes towards Access or a related category. I'm leaning toward Access, but I'll continue to refine my analysis to be more precise.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR and Access**\n\nI'm now focusing on the intersection of HR Support and Access. The departure context strongly links to HR, while \"token\" undeniably points to access management. Considering all the keywords, I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\" as the primary categorization, even though \"Access\" is also valid. The employee's leave is the central driver for this action.\n\n\n**Choosing HR as priority**\n\nI'm now prioritizing HR Support due to the explicit \"upcoming leave\" and \"re leaver\" phrasing. The token's return is intrinsically linked to the employee's departure. While Access remains relevant, the ticket's trigger is employee offboarding, making HR the more fitting primary category.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Support as primary**\n\nI'm now completely decided on HR Support. The ticket text's focus is the token's return triggered by the employee's departure. While Access and Hardware are involved in the mechanics, the driver is the employee's leave. The fact that the user is a \"re leaver\" further reinforces the offboarding context, making HR Support the most relevant.\n\n\n"
