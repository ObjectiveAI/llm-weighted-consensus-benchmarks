While other categories might be tangentially relevant, the core issue seems to be about an employee's status and related paperwork, solidifying my inclination towards \"HR Support\".\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Context**\n\nI've been drilling down on the IT ticket's content and the available categories. Seeing \"leaver form\" and \"contract due\" solidified my focus on the human resources aspect. It appears the core issue revolves around an employee's status and pertinent paperwork, solidifying my perception of it falling under \"HR Support\". I'm ready to assign this ticket a home.\n\n\n"
