I've narrowed down the options, considering the new access card issue and related details. The ticket's content leans strongly towards an \"Access\" category due to the mention of a new card, activation, and door testing. A potential \"Hardware\" overlap is possible, but the primary concern is access-related. I will decide soon.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Fit**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket text, considering all the options. Given the emphasis on the new access card, its activation, and the testing of the door, \"Access\" appears to be the most fitting category. While a slight overlap with \"Hardware\" is possible because of the card, the core issue revolves around access, making that the primary concern.\n\n\n"
