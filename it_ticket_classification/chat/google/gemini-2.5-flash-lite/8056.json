I'm cross-referencing this with the available options to ensure it's the most fitting classification.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm re-evaluating the ticket's categorization. While \"Hardware\" was an initial thought due to \"windows upgrade,\" the persistent mentions of \"data backup,\" \"backup restore,\" and \"increase drive\" strongly suggest \"Storage\" is a more precise fit. The upgrade seems related to managing and potentially expanding storage capacity.\n\n"
