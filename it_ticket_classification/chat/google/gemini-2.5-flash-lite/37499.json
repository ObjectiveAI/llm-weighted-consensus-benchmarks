It seems to involve a problem with a \"change manager procedure,\" which is leading me to think this belongs under \"Miscellaneous,\" but I'm keeping an open mind for other possible matches. I'm carefully analyzing the provided categories to ensure accurate placement.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Categories**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided text and matching it to the allowed IT ticket categories. The text clearly indicates an issue with changing a line manager for a former member. I am leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate category since the core issue is about a core HR function. I'm focusing on the context of 'line manager change' and the 'former members'. The \"change manager procedure\" might be a process in use within the HR system. I am moving towards a conclusive decision.\n\n\n**Determining the Ticket Focus**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text and the available categories. The core issue revolves around modifying a line manager for a former member, strongly pointing towards \"HR Support.\" The \"change manager procedure,\" though mentioning \"Oracle,\" is likely an HR-related system, suggesting a focus on HR processes. My decision leans towards \"HR Support\" due to the specific HR context.\n\n\n"
