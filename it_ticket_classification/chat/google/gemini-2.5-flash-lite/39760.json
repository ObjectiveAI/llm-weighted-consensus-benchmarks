I've re-read the ticket text multiple times, focusing on keywords and phrases. The mentions of \"Sonar\" and the need for an older version seem to point towards a specific technical issue, but I'm hesitant to lock in a category without more information. \"Hardware\" doesn't seem to fit, as it's software-related. I will focus on the provided category definitions.\n\n\n**Narrowing Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm now leaning heavily towards \"Purchase\" due to the \"order\" phrase, even though \"installation\" is also prominent. The context of \"Sonar\" and needing an *older* version points towards a specific license acquisition issue or a special installation setup, which could involve purchasing older licenses or requesting access to them. The \"unable\" part suggests the user can't perform the task due to purchase constraints. I am revisiting the definitions.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Assignment**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the text again, narrowing down the potential categories. The phrases \"Sonar\" and \"older version\" keep drawing me back to \"Internal Project.\" Now, I'm focusing on \"install\" and \"order,\" trying to assess the priority. I'm certain the tool is development-related, and my prior analysis solidly supports the \"Internal Project\" classification. However, I'm trying to decide the extent to which \"Purchase\" and \"Access\" might influence the final decision.\n\n\n**Solidifying Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Internal Project.\" The developer context and the focus on \"Sonar,\" a code quality tool, strongly support this. The phrase \"order install older version\" is now seen as the developer needing a specific version for their internal project's workflow, so it's not a direct \"Purchase\" request. My prior analysis of \"Internal Project\" continues to be validated. All data points to this category being the perfect fit.\n\n\n"
