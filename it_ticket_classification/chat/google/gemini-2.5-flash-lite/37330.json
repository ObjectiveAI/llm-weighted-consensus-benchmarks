I'm leaning toward \"Hardware\" as the most relevant category because of mentions of physical connections and a specific port. I'll need to confirm that this is not a software configuration issue. I will keep you posted on my progress!\n\n\n**Determining the Category**\n\nI've dived deeper into the IT ticket text. My focus is on determining the right category. \"Hardware\" is still the frontrunner, given the emphasis on \"port,\" \"cable,\" and \"connection.\" While \"Access\" could be relevant if it involves network access, the direct mention of physical components solidifies \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate. I've ruled out other categories like HR, Storage, Purchase, and Administrative Rights, which are clearly unrelated.\n\n\n"
