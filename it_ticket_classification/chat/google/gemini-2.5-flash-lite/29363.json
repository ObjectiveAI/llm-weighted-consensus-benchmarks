I've begun to parse the description, looking for clear indicators like \"HR Support\" or \"Access.\" The goal is to build a reliable model that, with time, will allow me to automatically categorize tickets like this. Right now, I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" given \"testing discipline\" and \"confluence\". I'm also considering the frequency of the terms.\n\n\n**Examining Category Relevance**\n\nI'm now evaluating the category fit more thoroughly. While \"Internal Project\" still seems likely, I'm specifically assessing \"Access\" more closely, considering that creating something in Confluence might involve access permissions. I'm noting the repeated keywords like \"create\" and \"confluence\" to gauge their impact in the model. Additionally, I'm looking for direct language that strongly suggests a specific category besides the more probable, yet less directly supported, \"Internal Project\".\n\n\n**Pinpointing Project Focus**\n\nI've honed in on the ticket's core intent: establishing a new Confluence structure. The repeated emphasis on \"create\" and the \"testing discipline\" terminology solidified my initial inclination towards \"Internal Project\". I am now focusing on justifying the elimination of other possible categories, such as \"Access,\" though I still recognize it's a possibility, as I've ruled out Hardware, HR Support, Storage, Purchase and Administrative rights.\n\n\n"
