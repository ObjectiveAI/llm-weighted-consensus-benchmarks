The text seems related to a new employee setup, specifically in Belgrade, based on the provided keywords. Considering the available options, I am leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category. However, I want to make certain that \"Access\" is not more relevant.\n\n\n**Categorizing New Starter Request**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided ticket text and available categories. While \"HR Support\" seemed initially plausible, the phrase \"new starter\" strongly indicates an access-related issue. My current assessment leans heavily toward \"Access\" as the most appropriate category, given the lack of specific hardware or HR-related details in the text. I'm focusing on the implied need for system and email access for this new employee.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and available categories, revisiting my initial analysis. While HR involvement is possible in new starter scenarios, the core issue appears to be access-related. Given that the text centers on a \"new starter\" and doesn't explicitly mention HR processes or hardware, I'm confident in selecting \"Access\" as the most appropriate category for this request. The primary focus of this ticket, as I interpret it, is the provision of necessary system and email access for the new employee in Belgrade.\n\n\n"
