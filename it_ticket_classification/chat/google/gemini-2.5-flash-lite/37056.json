I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or \"Internal Project,\" but further refinement is underway.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nMy focus is narrowing in on the optimal category. While \"Access\" or \"Internal Project\" initially seemed relevant, the specific error messages and keywords like \"request entity too large\" and \"size restriction repository\" strongly suggest a storage-related issue. \"Storage\" is now the top contender, directly addressing the core problem. The analysis is nearly complete; a final review confirms \"Storage\" as the most precise fit for this IT ticket.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've meticulously reviewed the ticket text against the potential categories. The size and capacity constraints within the Git repository are unequivocally the central issue. I've considered alternatives, but the \"Storage\" category provides the most precise and direct classification. The other options were either too broad or not directly applicable to the core problem; the user's issue revolves around the repository's size restrictions. This is now fully categorized.\n\n\n"
