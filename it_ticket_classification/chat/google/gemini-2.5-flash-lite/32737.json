I'm carefully considering other categories to ensure this is the best fit, but the HR context feels the strongest right now.\n\n\n**Confirming Category Choice**\n\nI've solidified my initial assessment and strongly believe \"HR Support\" is the best fit for this ticket. The time submission issue, rejected entries, and task delays all point directly to HR-related processes. I've ruled out other categories as they don't seem applicable to the described problem.\n\n\n"
