While \"win install issues\" points towards installation, the lack of a direct software category means I'm re-evaluating \"Hardware\" and \"Administrative rights\" as potential, albeit less direct, fits, or settling on \"Miscellaneous.\"\n\n**Determining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the provided IT ticket text. The keywords \"win install issues\" and \"installing\" strongly suggest the core problem revolves around Windows installation. Given the available categories, I'm weighing \"Miscellaneous\" as a potential fallback, while also considering if \"Hardware\" or \"Administrative rights\" could be indirectly applicable depending on the underlying cause of the installation failure, which isn't explicitly stated.\n\n**Categorizing Installation Failures**\n\nI'm analyzing the IT ticket to determine the most suitable category.
