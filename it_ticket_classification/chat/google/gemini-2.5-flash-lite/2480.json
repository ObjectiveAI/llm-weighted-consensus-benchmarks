The terms \"time cards\" and \"submitted\" point strongly towards an HR-related issue. My current thinking leans heavily towards \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate category, given the context provided. I'm double-checking, but this seems to be the best fit.\n\n\n**Reaffirming the Classification**\n\nI'm solidifying my initial assessment. The provided text, with its consistent reference to \"time cards,\" \"submission,\" and related HR terminology, reinforces my decision. I've ruled out all other categories and remain confident that \"HR Support\" is the most accurate fit based on the user's explicit needs described in the ticket.\n\n\n"
