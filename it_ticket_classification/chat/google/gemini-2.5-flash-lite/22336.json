After analyzing the text (\"non starter bogota pm\"), I'm leaning toward \"Miscellaneous\" due to the ambiguity. Further information might be needed for a more precise classification.\n\n\n**Classifying Ticket Details**\n\nI've delved deeper into the IT ticket text. The phrases \"starter,\" \"joiner,\" \"leaver,\" and \"closing his accounts\" indicate this relates to employee onboarding or offboarding. Considering all the options, I'm currently leaning towards \"HR Support\" because it encompasses these employee lifecycle events more precisely than other categories. I'm hesitant to lock this in and could consider \"Access\" if account setup or deletion becomes the main focus.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Focus**\n\nAfter examining the provided text, I've confirmed my initial assessment. The \"joiner,\" \"leaver,\" \"closing accounts,\" and similar phrases strongly point towards an HR-centric issue. Therefore, I'm confident \"HR Support\" is the most fitting category, encompassing the employee lifecycle events described. While \"Access\" could be relevant, the broader HR context makes it a secondary consideration.\n\n\n"
