The text mentions \"designer,\" \"sketch app,\" \"licenses,\" and \"files.\" My initial thought is to consider \"Hardware\" or \"Access,\" but I'm leaning toward \"Purchase\" or even \"Miscellaneous\" depending on the exact nature of the license expiration and file access issues. I'll need to carefully weigh the evidence to get it right.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Options**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the keywords like \"sketch app\" and \"licenses expired.\"  \"Access\" is a definite consequence, but the core of the issue points toward a software licensing problem. While \"Purchase\" is a potential outcome, the immediate problem is lapsed licenses. I'm leaning heavily towards a specific category that directly addresses this software licensing issue. I want to choose the most accurate category from the list.\n\n\n**Choosing the Right Route**\n\nI've decided to refine the category based on the ticket's primary focus. While access is a consequence, the expired license points to \"Purchase.\" The workflow for expired software typically involves license renewal or acquisition, which falls under the \"Purchase\" category.  The priority now is to get the user the correct access, but the first step is to purchase the new license.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted again to the \"Purchase\" category, as the issue of expired software licenses inherently triggers procurement-related actions. The initial lack of access is a result, but the core need is to acquire or renew the license, positioning \"Purchase\" as the most accurate category. While \"Access\" is relevant, the expired license points to a software procurement process. I'm now certain this is the best fit from the given options.\n\n\n**Solidifying the Choice**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Purchase\" as the correct category. The ticket's central theme revolves around expired software licenses, which necessitates the procurement of new or renewed ones. While access is impacted, the root cause points squarely to the need for a purchase action. This aligns with standard IT ticketing practices where such issues are often directed to procurement or license management teams. The expired license directly triggers a \"Purchase\" process to restore access and functionality.\n\n\n"
