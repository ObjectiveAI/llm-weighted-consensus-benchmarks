Based on the provided text mentioning \"certificates\" and \"sonar,\" I'm leaning towards \"Access\" or potentially \"Internal Project.\" Need to determine which is a better fit.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access: Deep Dive**\n\nI've been honing in on the \"Access\" category. The mention of \"certificates\" repeatedly, specifically for \"sonar,\" strongly points to an access-related issue.  I'm drilling down further to clarify any potential overlap with \"Internal Project,\" but the core function appears to be granting or managing access via certificates.  The context of \"slave\" certificates also solidifies this access focus. I'm aiming for the most precise categorization.\n\n\n**Defining Access: Refining Logic**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the context surrounding \"sonar\" and the \"certificates.\" Initially, the direct application of certificates to enable secure or trusted connections suggests \"Access\" is the most precise categorization. While \"Internal Project\" presented an alternate, it's clear the core functionality revolves around access provisioning and management. Focusing on the technical implications of \"installing certificates sonar slave,\" the need for trust management for a system like sonar cements my conclusion. The \"engineer\" reference could potentially shift the context, but the emphasis is fundamentally about making the system accessible. Therefore, it's about Access.\n\n\n"
