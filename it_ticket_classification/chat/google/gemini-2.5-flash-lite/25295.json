The initial text \"service request small mod to risks export columns wednesday november pm mod\" points towards a technical adjustment, but it's not immediately clear. I am currently considering \"Miscellaneous\" or \"Internal Project,\" given the lack of specific hardware, HR, access, storage, or purchasing keywords. I'm focusing on the \"small mod\" aspect.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating Category Options**\n\nMy analysis indicates this isn't a simple miscellaneous request. The core is report modification. \"Internal Project\" is a strong contender, since this is an internal enhancement. Alternatively, there is an argument that this is a system modification, so \"Access\" and \"Administrative Rights\" are possible, since access controls will indirectly apply if report output is modified. I am now leaning towards \"Internal Project\" with possible cross-listing to other relevant categories, to cover different possible implications.\n\n\n**Confirming Project Scope**\n\nThe \"Internal Project\" classification seems strongest given the described modification of an internal tool's export function. However, the exact nature of the data involved requires further consideration. Updating columns implies a data-related modification. The ticket involves data processing and presentation within an existing internal tool, which points toward an \"Internal Project\". I am now weighing the potential for a secondary category assignment, perhaps related to \"Access\" since the changes affect data displayed.\n\n\n"
