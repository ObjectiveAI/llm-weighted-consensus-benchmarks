My approach is to identify clusters of phrases indicative of each defined category. I'm prioritizing the use of contextual clues to improve accuracy and avoid misclassifying it. I'll need to account for noise words and their potential impact on a proper category selection.\n\n\n**Defining HR Ticket Signals**\n\nI'm zeroing in on distinct HR-related indicators within the ticket text. \"Annual leave\" and \"timesheet missing\" are key signals. I'm building a profile of recurring phrases tied to HR Support, aiming to reduce classification errors. I'll need to expand my phrase library to enhance the accuracy for future tickets.\n\n\n"
