After analyzing the text (\"mailbox for is full sent thursday mailbox for\"), I'm leaning towards \"Storage\".  I need to make sure this selection makes sense given the user's focus on email inboxes. I'll double-check this before offering a final categorization.\n\n\n**Confirming Storage Category**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, particularly the repeated mention of \"mailbox full\". My initial assumption of \"Storage\" seems to align best with the central issue. While there is another issue presented, the \"mailbox full\" complaint is dominant, and the other part is ancillary. I will verify that with a final check, but I'm leaning heavily towards \"Storage\".\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Components**\n\nI've been analyzing the text to discern the primary issue. The \"mailbox full\" description is clearly the core problem. The secondary issue regarding calls might need its own ticket. I will make a decision based on the repeated \"mailbox full\" reference.\n\n\n"
