The \"cards\" mention is still slightly opaque, but the \"deleting something\" part points toward access or storage issues related to Oracle. I'm leaning toward Access, but I'm still weighing the other options.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Choices**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's description with a focus on \"cards.\" Now, I'm considering Administrative Rights as a strong contender. The deletion issue within Oracle, especially if those \"cards\" are data, suggests a need for administrative-level permissions. I'm moving away from \"Access\" as the primary category and leaning more toward data management capabilities and associated privileges.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket Issue**\n\nI'm now fully focused on the deleting issue and its connection to Oracle. The \"cards\" aspect continues to be relevant, but now I'm leaning heavily towards \"Administrative rights.\" Deleting data, especially within a database environment like Oracle, strongly implies the need for elevated permissions. The challenge isn't simply getting *to* the data, but being able to modify it.\n\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category: Administrative Rights**\n\nFocusing on the ticket's core issue, the \"deleting\" action within Oracle strongly indicates an *Administrative Rights* concern. Even though \"cards\" remain a bit unclear, the act of deletion transcends simple access, demanding elevated permissions or an analysis of existing rights. This decision solidifies \"Administrative Rights\" as the best-fit category, moving forward.\n\n\n"
