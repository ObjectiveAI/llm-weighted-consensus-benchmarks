After analyzing the ticket content (\"new starter salvo new please provide package\"), I've determined the key phrase is \"new starter.\" I'm leaning toward the \"HR Support\" category, as the request suggests a need for onboarding assistance or related resources for a new employee. However, I'm also considering \"Access\" depending on the context of the \"package.\" Further refining is in progress to finalize the appropriate category.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR Onboarding**\n\nI've honed in on \"HR Support\" as the primary category for this ticket. The \"new starter\" phrase is a strong indicator of an HR-related onboarding request. While \"Access\" and \"Hardware\" are possibilities, they seem subsidiary to the core onboarding need. The \"package\" likely refers to standard IT provisioning for the new employee. Categorizing it under HR reflects the originating request.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Onboarding**\n\nI'm solidifying my categorization decision. The key phrase \"new starter\" points strongly toward HR involvement, specifically onboarding. The \"package\" aspect further reinforces this, suggesting standard IT setup as part of the onboarding process, not a standalone hardware or access request. Although \"Access\" could be relevant, it's subsidiary to the broader HR onboarding context. My confidence in \"HR Support\" as the primary category is now very high.\n\n\n"
