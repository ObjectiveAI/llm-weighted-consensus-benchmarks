I'm focusing on \"Access,\" \"Hardware,\" and \"HR Support\" at the moment, to get a handle on the nuances. I plan to handle the other categories similarly in a later step.\n\n\n**Identifying Access Issues**\n\nI'm zeroing in on access issues. The recurring phrase \"site documents policies\" and mentions of write access, error messages when adding documents, and changes in permissions are definitive. I'll need to confirm that this is not hardware or HR support related.\n\n\n**Focusing on Permission Errors**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and I think the issues are rooted in permission errors. I've noted a lot of phrases like, \"write access,\" \"error message when attempting add document,\" and \"replace documents,\" which are key indicators. I'm focusing on \"Access\" as the central theme and trying to see if there are any other areas of impact.\n\n\n**Refining Access Issues**\n\nI'm now focusing on the nuances of this access problem. The user's inability to upload, replace, or add documents is clear. The frequent mention of \"write access,\" coupled with error messages, solidly confirms access as the core issue. I've ruled out hardware and HR support, so I'll further delineate what is meant by \"access\".\n\n\n"
