My primary task is to determine the most appropriate category from a predefined enum list: \"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", or \"Administrative rights\". I'm analyzing the ticket's content to make this determination.\n\n**Determining IT Ticket Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket to pinpoint its core request. The text points strongly towards the physical handling and setup of new equipment, alongside a recent purchase and replacement. Based on this, I'm leaning towards classifying it under \"Hardware\" due to the explicit mention of devices, swapping, and installation needs.\n\n**Refining Ticket Classification**\n\nMy latest analysis strongly suggests the \"Hardware\" category. The ticket details indicate a focus on physical devices, their receipt, replacement, and installation, which aligns perfectly with this classification over just the purchasing aspect.\n\n"
