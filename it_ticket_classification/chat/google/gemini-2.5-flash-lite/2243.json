My focus is on categorizing this request, and I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate classification, as it directly addresses the provision of necessary equipment for an incoming employee.\n\n**Providing New Starter Equipment**\n\nI'm currently focusing on the direct mention of \"equipment\" within the fragmented ticket details, especially in the context of a \"new starter.\" My analysis suggests the primary intent of this ticket revolves around the provisioning of physical hardware for an incoming employee, leading me to categorize it as \"Hardware.\"\n\n"
