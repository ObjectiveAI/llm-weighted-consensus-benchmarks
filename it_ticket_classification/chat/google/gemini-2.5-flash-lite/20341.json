The text \"new starter\" points strongly toward \"HR Support,\" but I'm cross-referencing this with all other available categories to ensure complete accuracy. Considering the context, I think I've landed on the right classification.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Context**\n\nI've been drilling down into the keyword analysis to refine the ticket classification. The date/time and \"ext\" code are confirmed to be irrelevant. My assessment of each category continues: \"Hardware\" and \"Access\" are definitely relevant, but are components of a bigger HR process. \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate primary category, as onboarding is initiated and coordinated primarily by HR. It's becoming clearer that \"HR Support\" best reflects the initial need, but requires confirmation of associated components.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Category Selection**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the initial \"HR Support\" categorization, and I'm solidifying it as the primary choice. \"Access\" is closely related, but the mention of a \"starter form\" solidifies HR's central role in the initial onboarding process. While hardware may be needed and access will be granted, HR is the initial initiator. Therefore, all supporting elements align under an HR umbrella for initial setup.\n\n\n"
