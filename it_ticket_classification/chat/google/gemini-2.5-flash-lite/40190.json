Keywords like \"locked\" and \"unlocking\" are key indicators to look for. Based on the available options, I'm thinking the best fit is likely Access or HR support. I'm leaning toward Access because it's a direct request related to user access. I'll need to examine this further.\n\n\n**Confirming Access Request**\n\nI've reviewed the provided IT ticket text, focusing on key phrases like \"user locked\" and \"unlocking.\" The context reveals a clear need for build server access. Considering the available categories (Hardware, HR Support, Access, etc.), \"Access\" stands out as the most appropriate. Although urgency is noted, the core issue is user access, and \"Access\" directly addresses this need.\n\n\n"
