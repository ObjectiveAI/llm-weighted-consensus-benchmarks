I'm focusing on keywords.\n\n\n**Focusing on Onboarding**\n\nI've homed in on the \"HR Support\" category. The ticket text's central theme revolves around a \"new starter,\" their onboarding process, and necessary forms. Keywords like \"starter form,\" \"joining,\" and \"allocation\" reinforce this. \"HR Support\" accurately reflects the nature of this inquiry, unlike options like \"Hardware\" or \"Storage.\" While access might be relevant, the primary issue is the initial HR-related steps.\n\n\n**Identifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've determined that the provided text is best categorized under \"HR Support.\" The recurring keywords (\"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" \"joining,\" \"allocation\") point directly to the onboarding process and associated HR functions. While access might be a secondary element, the primary focus is on the initial setup, firmly placing it within the HR Support domain.\n\n\n"
