I've reviewed the text and am leaning towards \"HR Support\" due to the mention of \"maternity leave\" and related forms. However, I'm carefully considering if other categories like \"Access\" are also relevant given the \"access card\" reference. I'm aiming for the most accurate and specific categorization.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've refined my category selection for the IT ticket. While \"Access\" was initially considered due to the \"access card,\" the primary focus is unequivocally on HR processes related to maternity leave and onboarding/offboarding. \"HR Support\" comprehensively encompasses this, making it the most appropriate choice. I'm now certain this is the correct categorization.\n\n\n**Refining Categorization Details**\n\nI've carefully re-examined the ticket context, focusing on the maternity leave forms and \"access card\" mention. My analysis confirms \"HR Support\" is the most accurate categorization, even with the \"access card\" reference. The card is a piece of hardware, but the user is requesting forms, which makes it an HR process, not a hardware process. This context dictates an HR-centric categorization over an access-related one. The priority is providing support and processes.\n\n\n"
