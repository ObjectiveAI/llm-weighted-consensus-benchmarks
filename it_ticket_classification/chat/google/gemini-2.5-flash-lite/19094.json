                    "reasoning": "**Analyzing Ticket Categories**\n\nI've been working on classifying the IT ticket based on the description, and currently, I am implementing the rules for the categories, starting with some simple keywords, and will be implementing more complex natural language processing to improve the accuracy. My goal is to determine the correct category for an IT ticket given the ticket's text, and output a JSON object with only \"category\" key and one of the allowed values.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently focused on the challenge of accurately categorizing these IT tickets. The text \"add to project that leave requests...\" hints at \"Internal Project\" or \"HR Support\", while \"starter form\" usually implies \"HR Support\" or \"Access\". I'm also considering the implications of \"license taken care\" which might be \"Purchase\" or \"Access\". I'm analyzing the combined context, particularly the central request for a new process for leave requests.\n\n\n**Defining Project Scope**\n\nThe categorization now points towards \"Internal Project,\" given the focus on a new leave request system integrated with project management. While \"HR Support\" and \"Access\" are tangentially relevant due to onboarding elements and system setup, the core request is to build a project-specific workflow. I've considered that the \"license\" and \"confluence\" references support the project's infrastructure, further reinforcing the \"Internal Project\" classification as the most accurate match. I am ready to output the correct response to the user.\n\n\n**Defining Project Focus**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and the potential categories. The ticket's core request is to modify project workflow for leave requests. Although HR aspects are present, the emphasis on building or setting up this process within a project context leans towards \"Internal Project\". The \"Confluence\" and \"license\" references further support this conclusion, indicating a project-specific setup.\n\n\n**Determining Project Emphasis**\n\nI'm now focusing on the central request: modifying the project's workflow to include leave approvals. The phrasing \"add to project\" strongly implies an internal project implementation. While \"HR Support\" has relevance, the core action is about integrating a leave request system within an existing or new project. The license and Confluence references further cement this project-based focus. The task involves process setup and user access adjustments within this newly defined project scope.\n\n\n**Defining Project Scope**\n\nThe focus has shifted to the process setup: modifying the existing project workflow to handle leave requests for PM approval, along with initial user access. The ticket's text makes me think \"HR Support,\" but I'm leaning more towards \"Internal Project\" due to the emphasis on integrating leave requests into the project workflow using the \"add to project\" phrasing. The references to licenses are also an additional element, which would be part of a project set up. I believe this request represents the best fit of the two.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Determination**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Internal Project.\" While HR and Access elements are present, the core request is a workflow modification within a project. I've re-evaluated considering the nuances of the ticket text and existing category definitions. I am ready to output the correct response to the user.\n\n\n**Finalizing Project Classification**\n\nI'm now fully committed to \"Internal Project\". Despite initial considerations of \"HR Support\" due to the leave request focus and \"Access\" for environment and license management, the core request is a workflow modification within a project. The \"starter form\" and infrastructure setup (Confluence, licenses) solidify this as an internal project, rather than a direct support request. The primary intent is to create a new approval process.\n\n\n"
