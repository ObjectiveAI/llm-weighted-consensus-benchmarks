The phrase \"wrongly approved period marked bench changed please undo\" points strongly towards an issue related to employee data. I'm leaning toward the \"HR Support\" category, as this seems to involve changes to an employee's record. This seems more appropriate than other options like hardware or purchase.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Issue**\n\nI'm now certain the ticket belongs in \"HR Support\". The phrase \"wrongly approved period marked bench changed please undo\" confirms this categorization because it focuses on employee timekeeping, which falls under HR responsibilities. This is a clear indicator that the ticket deals with employee data and status updates. Therefore, I've concluded the issue to be rooted in HR and employee period changes.\n\n\n"
