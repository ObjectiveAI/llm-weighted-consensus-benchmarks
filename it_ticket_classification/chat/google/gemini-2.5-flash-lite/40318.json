I'm trying to decide if this falls under \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" or perhaps \"Miscellaneous.\" The mention of a mobile phone suggests it's not HR, and \"Miscellaneous\" feels too broad. Leaning towards \"Hardware\" for now, but need to be certain.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Categorization**\n\nI've determined the ticket falls under \"Purchase.\" The user lost their mobile phone and needs a replacement. While \"Hardware\" was initially considered due to the device's nature, \"Purchase\" is more accurate because a new phone needs to be procured. I've confirmed that \"Purchase\" is a valid category within the schema. The solution is now finalized.\n\n\n"
