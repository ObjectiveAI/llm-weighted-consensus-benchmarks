The phrase \"new starter\" immediately points towards a potential area within the \"HR Support\" category, however I need to verify this assumption. Further analysis is required to solidify that initial read.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Support Category**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided text and pinpointed several key phrases. The \"new starter\" and \"interns become employees\" language strongly indicates an HR-related onboarding process. Requests to adjust accounts and mailboxes flow naturally from this. Thus, after carefully considering all the extracted information, my assessment leans heavily towards classifying this ticket under the \"HR Support\" umbrella. I am confident in my determination.\n\n\n**Confirming the Strongest Category**\n\nI've examined the ticket text thoroughly and identified the crucial phrases that indicate the most appropriate category. The core issue revolves around onboarding a new employee, specifically an intern transitioning to a permanent position. This clearly points towards an HR process, further supported by the need to adjust accounts and mailboxes. While \"Access\" is relevant, it's a consequence of the HR event. Thus, \"HR Support\" appears as the most encompassing and fitting category.\n\n\n"
