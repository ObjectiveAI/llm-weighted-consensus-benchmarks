The initial approach looked at keywords but now I am taking into consideration the context of phrases. I am specifically considering how phrases like \"leaver form\" and \"opening issues\" may indicate different tickets.\n\n\n**Evaluating HR Focus**\n\nI've determined the ticket clearly requires HR support based on the \"leaver form\" mention. While access might be involved, the context of employee offboarding processes leads me to believe \"HR Support\" is the most relevant category. The issue is more about HR operations than technical access restrictions.\n\n\n**Reiterating HR Relevance**\n\nI've re-evaluated the context, and \"HR Support\" still feels right. While initial analysis focused on technical access, the \"leaver form\" is crucial. This points directly to employee offboarding, a core HR function. The user's problems accessing the form are inherently linked to this HR process. Despite potential underlying access issues, the core problem falls under HR-related support.\n\n\n"
