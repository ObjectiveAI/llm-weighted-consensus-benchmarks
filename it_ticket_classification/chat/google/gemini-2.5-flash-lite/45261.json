The initial phrase \"cannot access\" points strongly toward an access issue. I need to be sure that this issue is clearly related to the \"Access\" category, as opposed to the other possibilities in the allowed list of categories. I am beginning to rule out other options.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI've honed in on the central issue: the user consistently reports an access problem. Details about connectivity and troubleshooting, while relevant, support this primary diagnosis.  The phrase \"cannot access\" is the key indicator, leaving no doubt that \"Access\" is the most fitting category for this ticket, and I have dismissed other options.\n\n\n"
