I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" due to \"new starter,\" but the lack of context makes me hesitant. I need to consider all available categories carefully before making a definitive classification.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the best fit for this ticket. The keywords \"new starter,\" \"joining,\" and \"compliance officer\" strongly suggest an HR-related onboarding process. While \"Access\" could be a secondary consideration, \"HR Support\" covers the broader scope of setting up a new employee, including potential access requests.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Support**\n\nI've solidified my classification of this ticket as \"HR Support.\" The context, including \"new starter,\" \"joining,\" \"compliance officer,\" and the need to process a \"form,\" clearly points to HR-related onboarding. Though access rights may be involved, it's a secondary implication compared to the primary focus on new employee setup.\n\n\n"
