The phrases \"active users issue\" and \"friday pm create\" are my focal points. I'm carefully weighing potential fits within the predefined options, leaning towards a category that encompasses user-related issues or system access, but I'm still considering all other possibilities.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Access Control**\n\nI've honed in on the access control aspects. The phrases \"restrict floor,\" \"physical control,\" and \"permitted groups\" are leading me towards the \"Access\" category. The focus on personnel and user management further solidifies this direction. I'm excluding other categories, considering the clear emphasis on physical and user access restrictions.\n\n\n**Defining User Permissions**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on defining user permissions. Phrases like \"personnel changes,\" \"leavers,\" and \"roles\" are key. The aim is to translate these roles into defined access rights to specific areas, like floors and doors. The primary emphasis is on physical access control, so I'm excluding categories that don't directly relate to it.\n\n\n**Categorizing Physical Entry**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the \"Access\" category, guided by the phrases \"restrict floor,\" \"physical control,\" \"permitted groups,\" and the need for accurate user access. I'm focusing on physical access to specific areas, like floors and doors. The emphasis is on managing who has physical entry, and I'm further solidifying the choice based on the descriptions provided. I'm excluding categories that aren't about direct entry management. The mention of access \"cards\" further points to this category.\n\n\n"
