Initial analysis suggests an access-related issue, specifically concerning granting permissions or access rights for someone. I am digging deeper. My focus is on the specific security implications of the request.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket text, focusing on key phrases like \"granting secured areas\" and \"access for Friday pm.\" My analysis clearly identifies the core issue as an access-related request. Specifically, I'm leaning toward granting physical access, likely through a card, for a cleaning staff member to restricted areas. I've ruled out other categories like Hardware, HR Support, and Administrative Rights, considering \"Access\" to be the most accurate classification.\n\n\n"
