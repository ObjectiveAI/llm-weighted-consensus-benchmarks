My focus is on \"owner change\" and mapping it to options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, or Administrative rights.\n\n**Refining Access Categories**\n\nI'm refining my understanding of \"owner change\" within IT tickets. Based on the recent analysis of ticket details, the focus on \"updated groups,\" \"add owner,\" and \"user removed owners\" strongly points towards managing user permissions and access controls, aligning well with the \"Access\" category rather than others like Hardware or HR Support.\n\n**Confirming Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the IT ticket description, focusing on keywords like \"owner change,\" \"updated groups,\" and \"add/remove owners.\" This analysis confirms that the ticket's core concern is managing user permissions and access controls, making \"Access\" the most fitting category.\n\n"
