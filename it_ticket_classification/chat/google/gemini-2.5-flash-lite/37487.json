After reviewing the text, I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" due to the mention of \"annual leave.\" However, \"Access\" is still in the mix because there might be some kind of access issue related to the new Oracle version preventing the entry of annual leave. I'm going to weigh those two options carefully.\n\n\n**Defining the Primary Category**\n\nI've continued to refine the categorization. The text about Oracle and annual leave strongly suggests an HR system issue. The mandatory task details further reinforces this. It looks like \"HR Support\" is the definite primary category. Although the Oracle mention sparked a temporary consideration of \"Access,\" I'm no longer seeing an access issue.\n\n\n**Determining the Root Cause**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and the provided categories to nail down the precise root cause. My analysis focuses on the inability to input annual leave in the new Oracle version and the mandatory task detail. The root cause appears to be an issue within the HR system itself, possibly a bug in the new Oracle release.\n\n\n"
