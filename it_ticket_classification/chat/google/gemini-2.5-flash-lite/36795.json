                    "reasoning": "**Assessing Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm currently narrowing down the best category for this IT ticket. The issue with document attachments to candidate profiles definitely points towards a system functionality problem. It's not a hardware issue, so that's out. \"HR Support\" is a strong contender because it impacts recruitment processes. I'm also considering if \"System Functionality\" is a more precise fit, given the technical nature of the problem.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Scope**\n\nI've been refining my approach to this ticket. While \"HR Support\" seemed initially relevant due to the impact on recruitment, I'm leaning towards \"System Functionality\" as the primary category. The issue, as I understand it, is a problem with the system's ability to handle document attachments, which points directly to a software bug or a functional limitation. This issue directly impacts candidate document upload functionality.\n\n\n**Categorizing the System Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best fit for this IT ticket. After careful deliberation, \"System Functionality\" seems most accurate, though \"HR Support\" has its merits given the context. The crucial aspect is the system's inability to handle attachments correctly, a clear functionality problem. While it touches HR processes, the root cause is technical, leading me to prioritize \"System Functionality\". However, I may consider \"HR Support\" if the organization prefers a broader categorization.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket Type**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the best category for this ticket. While \"HR Support\" has its merits, the core of the issue \u2013 inability to attach documents to candidate profiles \u2013 indicates a system malfunction. This leans heavily toward a technical problem, so I'm focusing on categories that reflect a software or functionality issue, such as \"Application Support\" or, if unavailable, the less specific \"Miscellaneous\". The storage argument isn't the problem itself, but potentially a side effect.\n\n\n**Analyzing System Limitations**\n\nI've been carefully reviewing the ticket details and considering different angles. The core issue is the system's inability to handle document attachments, implying a limit or a bug. While HR processes are affected, the root cause is technical. \"HR Support\" could be relevant if it refers to support for the system itself. I'm leaning toward emphasizing the system's functional issue, whether a bug or a limitation preventing the user to add documents, as the primary categorization focus, but \"Miscellaneous\" is a valid consideration.\n\n\n**Categorizing System Malfunction**\n\nAfter further thought, I'm leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\" as the most relevant category. The system issue directly impacts the recruitment process, a core function of HR. While the root cause may be technical, the business impact is on HR's ability to manage candidate profiles.\n\n\n**Classifying Recruitment System Issue**\n\nI've carefully considered the IT ticket and believe \"HR Support\" best fits. Despite the technical nature, it impedes HR's core function, document management within the recruitment system. This categorization reflects the impact on HR processes, aligning with IT's typical support model.\n\n"
