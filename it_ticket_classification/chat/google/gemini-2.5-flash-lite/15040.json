I need to make sure this is the primary focus and that no other categories are more pertinent. The challenge is in accurately weighing these clues to find the correct fit from the provided list.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Access Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and the term \"access\" remains central. The repetition of \"secure area\" solidifies this direction. While \"storage\" and \"starter card\" are present, they are secondary to the primary need for \"access\". Considering the recurring theme, I'm confident that \"Access\" is the most appropriate category for this ticket's core request.\n\n\n"
