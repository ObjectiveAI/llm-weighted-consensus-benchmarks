The text, \"new starter hardware pm starter form hello please help by filling out starter form thank\", seems to revolve around new employee onboarding, and hardware. I am leaning towards \"Hardware,\" as the primary issue. I'll evaluate the other categories for fit and consider secondary categorizations.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Hardware Focus**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket text: \"new starter hardware pm starter form hello please help by filling out starter form thank.\" The phrase \"new starter\" suggests onboarding, but \"hardware\" is the most direct clue. I'm focusing my analysis on hardware provisioning needs for the new employee, ruling out categories that don't directly relate to hardware or its setup. The form mention seems related to hardware setup.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Assessment**\n\nI've completed my assessment of the ticket text: \"new starter hardware pm starter form hello please help by filling out starter form thank.\" While \"new starter\" hints at onboarding, \"hardware\" is the key term. I've considered all categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. Given the explicit mention of \"hardware\" and the context of a \"new starter,\" Hardware is the most accurate primary category, and it seems to encompass hardware provisioning.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"category\": \"Hardware\"\n}\n```\n\n"
