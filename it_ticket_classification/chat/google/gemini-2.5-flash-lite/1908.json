The request mentions \"graph and table\" and \"grades obi dashboard withdrawn,\" which points towards a data visualization or reporting requirement, likely falling under \"Miscellaneous\" or potentially \"Internal Project\" if it's a new feature development.\n\n**Refining Ticket Categorization**\n\nI'm continuing to refine the categorization of the IT ticket. The mention of \"graph and table\" alongside \"grades obi dashboard withdrawn\" strongly suggests a data visualization request. I'm leaning towards \"Miscellaneous\" as the primary category, but considering \"Internal Project\" if it implies development within an existing internal system.\n\n**Classifying IT Requests**\n\nI'm currently focused on classifying the IT ticket based on its content. The request for a \"new graph and table\" for the \"grades obi dashboard\" points towards data visualization needs. I'm considering \"Internal Project\" as the most appropriate category, given the mention of a specific dashboard system.\n\n**Categorizing Data Visualization Needs**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the ticket to determine the most fitting category. The mention of creating a \"new graph and table\" for the \"grades obi dashboard\" strongly suggests a data visualization enhancement. I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the primary classification, assuming \"obi\" refers to an internal reporting or business intelligence system.\n\n**Developing Reporting Features**\n\nI'm currently classifying the IT ticket. The request for a \"new graph and table\" for the \"grades obi dashboard\" strongly indicates a need for enhanced data visualization. I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the most fitting category, assuming \"obi\" refers to an internal business intelligence system undergoing development or enhancement.\n\n**Categorizing Data Visualization Needs**\n\nI'm continuing to refine the classification of this IT ticket. The explicit request for a \"new graph and table\" within the \"grades obi dashboard\" strongly indicates a need for enhanced data visualization capabilities. My current assessment leans towards \"Internal Project\" as the most suitable category, assuming \"obi\" signifies an internal business intelligence or reporting system undergoing development or enhancement.\n\n"
