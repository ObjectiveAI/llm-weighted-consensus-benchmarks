My focus is on identifying keywords and context clues to narrow down the options from the provided list: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights.\" The goal is to make an accurate categorization based on the information available.\n\n\n**Categorizing User Access**\n\nI've been meticulously examining the ticket's language, zeroing in on phrases like \"codes due expire,\" \"find leavers,\" and \"user access.\" The emphasis on expired codes and managing user access rights, alongside the mention of \"leavers,\" indicates this is about Access management. While HR might be indirectly involved due to \"leavers,\" the primary function relates to managing access codes and their lifecycle, not HR Support. The task is to accurately pigeonhole the ticket using the provided options.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Categorization**\n\nThe focus shifted to selecting the most accurate category. After revisiting the ticket description and available choices, the core lies in managing expiring codes and identifying inactive user access, even considering the mention of leavers. I have concluded that 'Access' is the most suitable, as it encompasses the key elements of the request.\n\n\n"
