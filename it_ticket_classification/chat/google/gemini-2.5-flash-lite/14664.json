After a careful review, the phrase \"new starter\" points towards a likely \"HR Support\" issue, potentially needing access setup or other onboarding tasks. My evaluation currently leans towards this direction. I am keeping other options in mind but \"HR Support\" seems most relevant.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nNow I'm circling back to the \"Access\" and \"HR Support\" options. Initially, I leaned heavily towards HR. However, the request for a \"change\" of credentials is a strong indicator of access modification. While \"new starter\" and \"intern status\" may require HR collaboration, the core action is access control. I'm prioritizing \"Access,\" but I'll keep the context in mind.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Details**\n\nI have dived deeper into the ticket's nuances. Initially, I was torn between \"HR Support\" and \"Access\". While the \"change credentials\" request points strongly toward \"Access,\" the overall context of a \"new starter\" and \"intern status\" still heavily leans towards \"HR Support\". The phrase \"tower\" is not a key indicator. My evaluation still prefers \"HR Support,\" but it includes and acknowledges the sub-component of access provisioning.\n\n\n**Reassessing Category Priority**\n\nAfter more thought, I'm reconsidering the primary category choice. \"HR Support\" still feels relevant given the onboarding context, but the specific action of credential modification points strongly towards \"Access.\" The \"new starter\" status is a trigger, while the actual need is an access change. I'm now leaning towards \"Access\" as the more immediate and critical aspect.\n\n\n"
