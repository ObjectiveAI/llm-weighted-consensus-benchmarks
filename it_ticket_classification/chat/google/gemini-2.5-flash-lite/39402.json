Currently, I'm focusing on parsing the ticket's text (\"edit rights sent Wednesday\").  The words suggest access-related issues, or possibly administrative rights.  I'm weighing these two heavily against the other choices.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Possibilities**\n\nThe focus has shifted from initial keyword matching to a deeper semantic analysis of the ticket content. I am now working on identifying the core issue -- access and authentication difficulties are definitely at the heart of this problem.  My current thought process involves assessing the ticket's urgency and business impact while validating my category choice. The repeated request for credentials and the inability to open files strongly support 'Access' as the correct category.\n\n\n**Determining the Root Cause**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket content, and the focus is squarely on access problems. The provided text indicates a consistent theme of permission errors and credential issues. I'm prioritizing keywords and phrases like \"edit rights,\" \"access,\" and \"credentials.\" The user's inability to open the Excel file due to authorization failures strongly points towards 'Access' as the correct category. Additionally, the description's urgency emphasizes the business impact, which influences my reasoning.\n\n\n"
