After analyzing the provided text, which seems related to maternity leave, I've tentatively assigned it to the \"HR/Leave\" category. The presence of phrases like \"maternity leaver form,\" \"needed off,\" and \"maternity leave\" strongly suggest this classification. I'm double-checking, but it aligns with the initial assessment.\n\n\n**Re-Evaluating the Classification**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's classification. Initially, I leaned towards \"HR/Leave,\" but now I'm considering \"Access.\" While the original text focuses on a maternity leaver form, the inclusion of \"access card\" and the likely need to revoke/modify access as part of the leaver process makes \"Access\" more central. It's now looking more like an access provisioning issue triggered by an HR event. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" for the primary classification, although it intersects HR.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted again to the initial HR support designation. While \"access card\" raised questions of \"Access\", the core request's focus on the \"maternity leaver form\" and leave duration makes HR the primary driver. The access card piece is an outcome, not the central request. Ultimately, this ticket describes a leaver process, not a broken door lock. My decision is \"HR Support\".\n\n\n"
