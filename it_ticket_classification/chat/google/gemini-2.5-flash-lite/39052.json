I'm focusing on keywords and phrases that strongly suggest each category. I am still developing the logic to extract these clues from the ticket text. The main concern now is handling ambiguous descriptions, that could fall into several categories. I'm considering weighting keywords to prioritize the most relevant.\n\n\n**Categorizing Hardware Issues**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket content and pinpointed \"faulty equipment\" as the central concern. Initial analysis indicates this squarely falls under \"Hardware.\" Considering the impact on client interactions, hardware seems more fitting than \"Purchase,\" even though replacement might be needed. The keywords and phrases extracted, such as \"disrupt calls,\" solidify the conclusion. I am now finalizing the rules to handle similar hardware-related scenarios with precision.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Issue**\n\nI've examined the ticket content closely and have identified faulty equipment as the central problem, specifically a device or system disrupting client calls within a meeting room. Based on my assessment, \"Hardware\" emerges as the most suitable category. The ticket text strongly implies the malfunction of some sort of hardware. I have ruled out alternative categories, such as \"Purchase\" and \"Miscellaneous\", given that replacing the equipment is a secondary issue to the disruption caused by the hardware failure. My analysis leans heavily towards a hardware-related resolution.\n\n\n"
