Initial analysis is leading me towards \"Storage\" or \"Access\" as the most probable categories, given the keywords \"upload\" and \"documents\". However, further refinement is necessary to definitively choose between these options and exclude the other possibilities. I'm exploring the context for a more precise match.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Access Issue**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Access\" as the primary category for this ticket. The user's inability to upload documents, coupled with the explicit request for access, solidifies this choice. Although storage might be indirectly involved, the core problem is clearly rooted in access permissions, or lack thereof. The phrase \"can be granted access\" is the key indicator here.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've thoroughly analyzed the ticket text, and the \"Access\" category stands out as the best fit. While upload issues *can* touch on storage, the phrase \"can be granted access\" is a direct indicator. Uploading problems often stem from permission issues, not storage capacity. \"Access\" encapsulates the core problem: the user's need for upload functionality, which hinges on their access rights.\n\n\n"
