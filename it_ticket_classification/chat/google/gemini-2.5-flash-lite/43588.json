Analyzing the keywords, \"unauthorized uploads,\" \"remove documents asap,\" and \"uploaded,\" strongly points toward the Access category. I'm leaning heavily in that direction, but I'll double-check to ensure no other categories are applicable.\n\n\n**Evaluating Storage Concerns**\n\nI've reconsidered the \"Access\" category and now I believe \"Storage\" is more fitting. The language used in the ticket, particularly \"unauthorized uploads,\" \"migrated files,\" and \"must be immediately removed,\" points to a core issue of data storage and management. The focus is not primarily on access *control*, but rather the unauthorized *placement* of files within the storage system.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"Storage\" category. The consistent language regarding unauthorized uploads, immediate removal, and migrated files, along with the emphasis on document compliance, reinforces the core concern: where these documents are stored and how they got there. While access might be a contributing factor, the central problem revolves around the unauthorized placement of data within the storage system, therefore \"Storage\" captures the essence of this ticket.\n\n\n"
