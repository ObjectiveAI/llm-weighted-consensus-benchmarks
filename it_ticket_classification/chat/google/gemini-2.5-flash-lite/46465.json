Phrases like \"submit time oracle error\" and \"worked hours\" suggest an HR-related issue. \"Raise ticket issue\" seems generic, but I'm leaning toward HR Support based on the other clues. I'm focusing on the keywords and context.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Core Problem**\n\nI've been drilling down on the \"submit time oracle error\" and \"worked hours\" phrases, and now I see it's about a time-tracking system glitch. The \"raise ticket issue\" is just a general statement.  I'm now thinking it might be a HR support issue if HR manages the system, but I'm open to considering it could be a system issue first.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Relevance**\n\nI'm now fully convinced the ticket falls under HR Support. The time-tracking system error (\"submit time oracle error\" and \"worked hours\") points directly to a process managed by HR for payroll and attendance. While the \"oracle error\" itself is technical, the context of work hours submission makes HR Support the most relevant. I've ruled out other categories like \"Miscellaneous\" since the ticket is clearly about an HR-related function and a system tied to it. The focus is now on the HR aspect.\n\n\n"
