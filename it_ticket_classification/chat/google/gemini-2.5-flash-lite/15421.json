So far, the phrases \"new client to be added\" and \"client has added\" suggest a potential access or administrative rights issue. I'm focusing on those possibilities for now, but keeping an open mind for other options based on the available categories.\n\n\n**Categorizing Ticket Access**\n\nI've honed in on the ticket text and it keeps pointing me toward access-related scenarios. Phrases like \"new client to be added\" and mentions of client addition strongly signal access management. After careful consideration, I've eliminated \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Internal Project\" as they seem less relevant given the context. Ultimately, I'm leaning toward \"Access\" or potentially \"Administrative rights\" - the former seems broader and more fitting as it covers initial account setup.\n\n\n"
