It seems the user can't log into \"Oracle Fusion,\" and an error suggests contacting an administrator and clearing saved browser passwords. They also confirmed they're getting an error when using their password. I'm leaning toward \"Access\" as the primary category, but I'll need to review other factors for accuracy.\n\n\n**Refining the Access Type**\n\nI've determined \"Access\" is the right category. The focus is on a login problem with Oracle Fusion. The error message and user's failed password attempt solidify this. I considered other categories, but the core issue is the inability to get into the system, directly linking it to access restrictions or authentication problems.\n\n\n"
