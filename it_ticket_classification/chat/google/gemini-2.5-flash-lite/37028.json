Based on this text, I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate classification. However, I am considering other categories to be sure.\n\n\n**Narrowing Category Choices**\n\nI've refined my category selection based on the detailed ticket content.  The key phrases regarding timecards and approvals push me further towards \"HR Support.\" While there's a slight possibility of an access issue, the core problem seems rooted in the HR system's functionality. This makes \"HR Support\" the leading contender, given the context provided. I'm double-checking, but this seems to be the most accurate category.\n\n\n"
