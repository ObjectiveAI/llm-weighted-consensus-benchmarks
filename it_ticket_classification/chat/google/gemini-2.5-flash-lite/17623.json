The repeated mention of \"term absence\" and \"filled form\" strongly suggests an HR support requirement.  I'm confident this aligns with the available categories, and I'll confirm and select this as the primary classification.\n\n\n**Defining Scope: HR Support**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the ticket text, and the phrases like \"term absence\" and \"filled form\" clearly point towards an HR-related issue. My assessment is that the user is likely requesting support regarding an employee's absence or departure process, which fits perfectly within the scope of \"HR Support.\" The repeated focus on employee status changes and form processing further reinforces this conclusion, so I have categorized accordingly.\n\n\n"
