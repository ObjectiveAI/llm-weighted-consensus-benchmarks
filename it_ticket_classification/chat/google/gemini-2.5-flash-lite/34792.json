The text suggests issues related to time cards, approval processes, and rejections, which seem to fall under HR-related processes rather than a technical issue. I am excluding \"Access\" because it's about timecards.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI am now focusing on refining the rationale for selecting \"HR Support\". The ticket's emphasis on timecard issues, approval workflows, and rejection processes firmly places it within the HR domain. While \"Access\" could be a factor, the core issue centers on HR-related procedures and data.\n\n\n**Revisiting Ticket Analysis**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, specifically the keywords, to confirm \"HR Support\" as the most suitable category. The focus on timecards, approvals, rejections, and error resolution strongly indicates an HR-related issue. While access could be a factor in some aspects, the central problem revolves around HR processes and data management.\n\n\n"
