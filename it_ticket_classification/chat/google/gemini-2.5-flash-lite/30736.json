The primary goal is to map the user's input to the correct predefined categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and so on. Right now, I'm working through parsing and classifying the different possible phrasings and their intended meaning. I want to build a reliable system for categorization.\n\n\n**Identifying Key Actions**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided text to determine the necessary actions. The keywords \"accounts,\" \"employees,\" \"disable,\" \"delete,\" and \"client\" point directly to user account management. From this data, I'm leaning toward a category focused on disabling or deleting user accounts tied to departing employees, but I still need to ensure this is the best category.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Topic**\n\nI've dived deep into the provided text, and I'm honing in on the most relevant category. Examining the extracted keywords, it's clear the primary focus revolves around the management of user accounts: specifically, disabling or deleting these accounts when employees depart from clients. This process appears central to the user's issue and aligns perfectly with the category of \"Access\". Considering this, it's likely the best categorization for the ticket.\n\n\n"
