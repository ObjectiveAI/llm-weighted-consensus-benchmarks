After examining the text, \"new purchase po friday march pm purchase po dear purchased tv mb tv please log installation please take consideration mandatory,\" I'm leaning toward \"Purchase\" due to the repeated use of \"purchase\" and the mention of specific items like \"tv.\" I'm also considering whether \"Installation\" implies some sort of access request, or some type of service - but the focus seems to be on the *purchase* of the TV, and its *installation*, which is likely handled by a different team.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Request**\n\nI've further refined my assessment of the IT ticket. While \"installation\" initially raised questions, the prominent keywords related to purchase orders and the acquisition of a TV solidify \"Purchase\" as the most suitable category. The additional mentions of \"receipts,\" \"order,\" and \"item ordered\" reinforce this conclusion, pointing to a request related to the purchasing process and not a request for some form of technical service.\n\n\n"
