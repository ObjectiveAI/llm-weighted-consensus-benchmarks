So far, \"remove from any networks\" and \"confluence owner\" have been flagged as potentially key indicators. My goal is to map these clues to the defined categories and narrow down the possible options.\n\n\n**Identifying Access Needs**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on access-related keywords. \"Disable,\" \"add,\" and \"connect\" are surfacing consistently, pointing towards either granting or revoking permissions. The phrases \"requested location\" and \"secure dashboard\" further solidify this access focus. I'm cross-referencing these findings with the available categories to determine the best fit.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Requirements**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text more closely, looking for nuanced indicators. Phrases like \"platform removal/assignment\" and \"resource removal/assignment\" are really standing out now. I've noted \"secure dashboard\" and \"requested location\" as strong access cues. My current analysis heavily leans toward the \"Access\" category because it encompasses the described activities far better than other options. I'm focusing on \"disable\" and \"add\" action verbs, too.\n\n\n"
