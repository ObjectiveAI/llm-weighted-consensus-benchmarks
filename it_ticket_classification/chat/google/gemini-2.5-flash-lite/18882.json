Keywords like \"submit rights\" point towards \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights,\" but \"please\" is too vague. I'll need more context to refine this. I'm exploring the nuances of the ticket to pin down the precise category.\n\n\n**Determining the Ticket Category**\n\nI've homed in on \"Administrative rights\" as the definitive category. The key phrases, \"submit rights\" and \"administrative rights,\" are direct indicators. While the rest of the text describes a process, it reinforces the need for someone with administrative privileges. I feel confident that this categorization reflects the user's intent within the defined schema.\n\n\n"
