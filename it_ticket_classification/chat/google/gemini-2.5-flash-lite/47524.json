I am confident in this categorization.\n\n\n**Solidifying the Conclusion**\n\nI've examined the ticket details further. The recurring theme is unmistakably related to annual leave processes. The phrases, like \"absence correctly set\" and \"approval flow\", leave no doubt. Therefore, \"HR Support\" remains the most accurate category, reflecting the user's need perfectly.\n\n\n"
