I've analyzed the text, which includes keywords related to \"leaver form,\" \"leaving colleague,\" and \"leaver process.\" This suggests a strong connection to HR-related procedures.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Relevance**\n\nI've further assessed the \"leaver form\" text, and the core focus on \"leaving colleague\" and \"leaver process\" solidifies \"HR Support\" as the best category. While access removal is implied, HR owns the overall leaver process. Other categories like \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Purchase\" are irrelevant. This is clearly an HR-driven request.\n\n\n"
