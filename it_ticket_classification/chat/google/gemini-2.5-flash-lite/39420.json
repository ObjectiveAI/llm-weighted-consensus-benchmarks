While initial thoughts leaned towards \"Storage\" due to the document deletion aspect, I'm now honing in on the core problem. The user's inability to delete an obsolete contract is central, suggesting a deeper issue with the file system or data management. I'm leaning toward \"Storage\" as the primary category, with \"Access\" a secondary consideration depending on the underlying cause.\n\n\n"
