                    "reasoning": "**Identifying Key Terms**\n\nI'm currently focused on extracting the most relevant keywords from the ticket text. \"Approver change\" seems central, hinting at access modifications. Now, I need to determine if it relates to a specific area like \"Hardware\", or if it's broader, possibly \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights\". The \"oracle project\" and \"pm\" indicators are important, too. I'm leaning towards \"Administrative rights\" or \"Access\", but need to analyze if more context is needed.\n\n\n**Defining Ticket Scope**\n\nI've examined the ticket content closely and identified \"approver\" as the recurring theme, coupled with workflow-related concepts. Key phrases like \"oracle project\" and \"chargeable costs\" link this to potential financial or project systems.  Travel-related phrases, like \"book flight\", also appear. Considering the categories, \"Administrative rights\" seems less likely, while \"Access\" is partially relevant, though the core issue appears workflow-driven. I'm leaning toward \"Internal Project\" to capture the project management and workflow aspects, but need to consider alternatives.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Ticket Focus**\n\nMy analysis indicates the ticket revolves around \"approver\" modifications within a project-related context. While \"chargeable costs\" and \"quotation\" suggest potential purchase elements, the \"oracle project\" focus is clear. I've narrowed it down to \"Internal Project\" as the primary category, with a possible secondary consideration for \"Purchase\" if the approver change directly impacts purchasing within the project. The recent review emphasizes \"oracle project\" and the associated workflow as central, prompting a closer evaluation of how purchase-related activities integrate.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Core Issue**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's primary focus. The repeated mention of \"approver\" and its relation to the \"oracle project\" strongly point toward a workflow modification.  While \"Purchase\" has merit due to the \"quotation\" and \"chargeable costs\" indicators, the overarching theme is the project-related \"approver\" role. Therefore, I believe \"Internal Project\" best encapsulates the ticket's nature, assuming \"oracle project\" indicates an internal project or system.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nThe ticket's core issue is consistently the \"approver change\", suggesting a reconfiguration of an internal process. The \"oracle project\" context heavily indicates the underlying system is an internal project platform or a financial system related to internal project management. \"Internal Project\" captures both the workflow modification and project context, given \"oracle project\" is likely an internal system.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Focus**\n\nMy analysis consistently indicates the ticket's core relates to workflow modifications tied to an \"oracle project.\" While purchasing activities are suggested by phrases like \"chargeable costs\", the central issue is the reconfiguration of project-related approval workflows. Although \"Purchase\" could apply if directly impacting purchases within the project, the workflow aspect of \"approver change\" is the dominant theme, making \"Internal Project\" the most fitting category. I'm focusing on \"Internal Project\" due to the specific system reference and recurring workflow adjustment needs.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nHaving reviewed the ticket content, my primary focus remains on categorizing the \"oracle project approver change\". The key focus is on the workflow modification tied to an internal project system, even with associated purchasing activities. \"Internal Project\" best encompasses this workflow aspect as well as its relevance to an established internal platform.\n\n\n"
