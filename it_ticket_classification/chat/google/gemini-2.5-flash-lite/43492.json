My process involves a detailed examination of the ticket's content to map it accurately to the predefined options: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights.\n\n**Confirming Access Category**\n\nI've analyzed the keywords, specifically noting \"access issues,\" \"permissions,\" and \"privileges.\" These strongly indicate the ticket pertains to the user's ability to interact with system resources. Therefore, I'm confirming the \"Access\" category as the most appropriate classification.\n\n**Determining Access Needs**\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the provided text, identifying recurring themes of \"access issues,\" \"permissions,\" and \"privileges.\" These terms consistently point towards a need for enhanced user rights to upload and manage documents within a specific library. Consequently, I am concluding that the \"Access\" category is the most accurate classification for this ticket.\n\n"
