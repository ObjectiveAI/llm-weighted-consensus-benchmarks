While \"Access\" is a consideration due to account deactivation, the broader context of \"leaver forms\" and termination procedures strongly points towards \"HR Support\" as the primary classification.\n\n**Categorizing Offboarding Tickets**\n\nI'm analyzing an IT ticket involving account deactivation due to an employee departure. Considering terms like \"leaver form,\" \"resignation,\" and \"terminated,\" I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate category, as it encompasses the overarching HR process driving these IT actions.\n\n"
