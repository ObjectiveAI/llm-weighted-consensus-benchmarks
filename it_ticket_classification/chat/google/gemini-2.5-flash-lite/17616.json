After analyzing the text, I'm leaning towards \"Access,\" given the mention of removing a member and adjusting permissions.  The phrasing suggests a need for adjustments within a system or platform where access is managed. I'm double-checking, but this seems to be the most fitting category.\n\n\n**Assessing Access Requirements**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the request's core action. The phrase \"remove pm member\" strongly points to a need to revoke or adjust access permissions. While the specific context of the \"oracle team\" and \"technical leader\" is noted, the primary action is the removal. This reaffirms \"Access\" as the most appropriate category, rather than \"Internal Project.\" I'm confident in this categorization.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Classification**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and the available categories. The phrase \"remove pm member\" is the most decisive factor; it strongly suggests a change in permissions or team access. While other categories are possible, \"Access\" is the most direct and accurate reflection of the core request. It covers removing a team member from a group, which is about managing access to a system or project.\n\n\n"
