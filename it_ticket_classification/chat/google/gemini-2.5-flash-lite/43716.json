I'm leaning heavily towards \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate category, but I'm just making sure there aren't any obscure nuances.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm confident in \"Hardware\" now, seeing how well it fits the given criteria. There's a clear link to audio equipment and a meeting room, confirming my initial assessment. The process of elimination really highlighted the inapplicability of the other options. I think this is a done deal.\n\n\n"
