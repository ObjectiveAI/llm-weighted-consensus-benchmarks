The text mentions \"network question\" and \"weird behavior,\" which seem relevant. I'm cross-referencing these clues against the available categories to determine the most fitting choice. It's a bit tricky, since \"weird behavior\" is a bit vague, but the \"network question\" mention is clear.\n\n\n**Evaluating Possible Categories**\n\nI've been re-evaluating the category options, and the \"Internal Project\" label is looking increasingly promising. The phrases \"web portal we building\" and \"network question\" strongly suggest this is a project-related issue. The \"weird behavior\" and \"changing address\" descriptions further support this, indicating potential bugs or network configuration issues within the internal testing environment. \"Access\" is still a possibility, but the description points more to network functionality.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Internal Project\" as the best category. The \"network question\" is likely related to the project's infrastructure, and the \"weird behavior\" and \"changing address\" descriptions point to potential development or testing issues. \"Access\" is a possibility, but less direct. I'm discarding \"Miscellaneous\" as too broad.\n\n\n**Concluding Project Categorization**\n\nI've determined that \"Internal Project\" is the most accurate category. The ticket describes network questions and weird behavior within a \"web portal we building,\" which indicates an issue specific to internal project development or testing. \"Network question\" suggests an underlying network issue related to the project. Though \"access\" could be a possibility, the behavior described is more related to an issue during the development than access. \"Miscellaneous\" is too broad, and the other categories are irrelevant. The combination of phrases like \"web portal we building\" and the problems noted solidify the need to categorize this as an internal project problem.\n\n\n"
