I'm leaning toward combining these, or further refining the \"HR Support\" category.\n\n\n**Revising Categorization Focus**\n\nI'm now focusing on \"Access\" as the primary category for this ticket, given the consistent emphasis on enabling a \"new starter\" with necessary \"access.\" The \"access card\" mention is a strong indicator. I'm considering refining this further, perhaps adding a subcategory like \"New Starter Access\" or merging it with \"HR Support\" for onboarding requests.  I have abandoned considering other categories.\n\n\n**Focusing Access Categorization**\n\nMy latest thinking centers exclusively on \"Access,\" given the clear link to a \"new starter\" needing an \"access card\" and \"induction\" setup. While \"HR Support\" elements are present, the core of the request is IT-related access, not HR-specific assistance. I am solidifying \"Access\" as the primary and sole category for this ticket's classification.\n\n\n"
