So far, the lack of clear keywords is proving challenging. I'm considering possibilities outside the initial list, as none seem to perfectly fit. I'm focusing on \"oracle\" as the key term at the moment.\n\n\n**Identifying the Root Cause**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the crux of the problem. While initially leaning towards \"Access\" due to the Oracle system involved, the \"submitting\" and \"error attached\" details are shifting my focus. It seems the issue is with a specific Oracle *application* or *module* used for submissions, potentially related to leave requests. \"Internal Project\" is a possible option, given the internal workflow implications. I'm reassessing the provided categories with this specific function in mind.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Scope**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket, focusing on the Oracle application's specific function. My latest thoughts are centered on \"HR Support\". The \"annual leave\" component is the most compelling piece of the puzzle, and that seems to imply a functional issue, not an \"access\" or general IT problem. The submission process failure, coupled with the mention of annual leave, makes \"HR Support\" the most appropriate choice. I am confident that the issue is within Oracle's application of HR functions.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR System Issue**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's core problem, which seems centered on annual leave submission within Oracle. Despite the initial \"Oracle issue\" phrasing, the functional nature of the problem, coupled with the \"annual leave\" context, strongly suggests an HR support issue. The error is tied to an *application* process related to leave requests, making it an *application* functional problem.  Therefore, I'm confident in categorizing it as \"HR Support\".\n\n\n**Focusing on Leave Submissions**\n\nI'm now focusing on the 'submitting' issue within Oracle, specifically as it relates to annual leave. The error is tied to the leave submission process, not general Oracle access. My final thought is that, despite the 'Oracle issue' framing, this is fundamentally an HR support matter. I am very confident with HR Support now.\n\n\n"
