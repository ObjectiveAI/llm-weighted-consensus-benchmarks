I will analyze the wording again to finalize the assignment.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket details, keeping the available categories in mind. While initially settled on \"Hardware\", I've considered if other factors like a storage failure played a part, but I keep returning to hardware being the most likely culprit. The keywords are pointing me to a hardware issue of some kind. This ticket seems to be most directly related to the server itself. So, I will confirm it as a \"Hardware\" ticket for now.\n\n\n"
