After analyzing the description \u2013 highlighting \"error submission of time entries\", \"fixing error status timecards\", and \"error submission\" \u2013 I'm leaning toward HR Support, as it's the most relevant to timekeeping issues. However, I'm still considering potential overlaps.\n\n\n**Confirming HR Relevance**\n\nI've determined that HR Support is the best fit, given the focus on \"time entries\" and \"timecards.\" Analyzing the ticket's text, it's evident that the issues described fall directly under HR's purview. Therefore, I'm confident in categorizing it within that domain. This decision hinges on the core functions related to HR administrative processes.\n\n\n"
