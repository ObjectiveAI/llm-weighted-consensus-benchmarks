I'm focusing on the context and keywords to guide my categorization.\n\n\n**Identifying Primary Issue**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket and am leaning heavily towards \"HR Support\". The keywords like \"logged hours,\" \"absence hours,\" and the specific policy requirement all point strongly in that direction, making it the most suitable classification given the context.\n\n\n"
