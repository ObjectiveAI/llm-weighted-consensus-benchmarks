My process involves analyzing the ticket text to identify the most relevant category from the options: \"Hardware|HR Support|Access|Miscellaneous|Storage|Purchase|Internal Project|Administrative rights\". It's a careful evaluation, and I'm ensuring the classification aligns with the provided description.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Details**\n\nI've just finished analyzing the ticket details and have decided on a preliminary category. The text clearly indicates a request for a \"second monitor,\" which relates directly to hardware. Given the options, \"Hardware\" is the most precise categorization, and I've ruled out \"Purchase\" as it signifies the act of buying rather than the item itself. I've also eliminated all other options.\n\n\n**Confirming Hardware Choice**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket text and the available categories. The request for a \"second monitor\" coupled with setup and performance benefits solidifies my decision. While \"Purchase\" is related, \"Hardware\" is a more precise category, as it directly describes the requested item. The other categories are irrelevant, leaving \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate.\n\n\n"
