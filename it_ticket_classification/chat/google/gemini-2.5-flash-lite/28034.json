The phrases \"change owner\" and \"updated file members\" are central. My focus now is understanding if these relate to access controls or another category, and how \"understanding\" fits in.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on matching key phrases like \"change owner,\" \"updated file members,\" and \"permissions\" to the available categories. \"Access\" emerges as the most suitable, encapsulating the essence of ownership and permissions management for resources like Confluence and Git. I've ruled out others like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Internal Project\" as being irrelevant, and I decided that \"Miscellaneous\" is too vague. While \"Storage\" is indirectly related, the primary concern is access control.\n\n\n"
