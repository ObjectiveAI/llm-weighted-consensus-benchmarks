These keywords point towards access issues or server-related problems, potentially requiring troubleshooting for the web application interface.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Issue**\n\nMy analysis indicates that the ticket describes an access and security vulnerability within Outlook Web Access. The key issue is persistent access after session timeouts, a problem directly related to how users initially gain, and subsequently maintain, access to the system. This leads me to believe the \"Access\" category is the most appropriate. I have now analyzed the ticket and mapped the keywords.\n\n\n**Identifying Security Concerns**\n\nI've further investigated the ticket, specifically focusing on the \"exploit\" mention. It solidifies my conviction that the core problem is a security vulnerability tied to session management in Outlook Web Access. Users retaining access after timeouts and circumventing credential checks are primary concerns. Now, \"Access\" is still the most accurate categorization.\n\n\n"
