Determining if this is a general issue or specific user permissions is key.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Access Issue**\n\nI've homed in on \"Access\" as the central category. My analysis considered several angles, but the user's struggle with a password change, and the implication they are not directly on the domain, firmly places this under Access. I've also eliminated other options, like \"Administrative rights,\" as irrelevant to this specific scenario.\n\n\n"
