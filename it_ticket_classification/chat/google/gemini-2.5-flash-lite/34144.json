Based on the text, \"meeting room calendar issue meeting room hi calendar meeting room shared properly was originally can you\", I'm leaning toward either \"Access\" or \"Miscellaneous.\" The language suggests a problem with calendar access or configuration, but the specific nature is unclear. I'm exploring the nuances to make the best call.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Issues**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket text and the available categories. The phrases \"meeting room calendar issue\" and \"meeting room shared properly\" are leading me towards the \"Access\" category. The mention of \"free busy data\" further reinforces this, as access issues frequently impact calendar visibility. I'm focusing on whether it's an access or configuration problem to make the final determination.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Issue**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text, zeroing in on the \"Access\" category as the most fitting. Phrases like \"shared properly\" and \"free busy data\" confirm this focus. The mention of \"rest meeting rooms\" implies a potential systemic access issue. This strengthens my belief that it's an access-related concern.\n\n\n"
