The initial text mentions \"holiday requests\" and a \"PM\" adjustment. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" at the moment, but it could potentially be related to \"Administrative rights\" if the PM adjustment involves access. I'm carefully reviewing the context to make a final decision, keeping the available categories in mind.\n\n\n**Focusing on Categorization**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text, zeroing in on phrases like \"holiday requests,\" \"annual leave,\" and \"days remaining.\" The core function described centers on managing employee time off, aligning directly with an HR support workflow. I'm confident that the \"HR Support\" category is the most fitting. The \"accept/decline\" process and requestor mentions strengthen this conclusion.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR Alignment**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the \"HR Support\" classification. The analysis of phrases like \"annual leave\" and \"accept/decline\" solidified its relevance. This aligns seamlessly with managing employee time off, aligning well with the typical HR support workflow. The \"requestor\" and \"authorization\" confirmations seal the case.\n\n\n"
