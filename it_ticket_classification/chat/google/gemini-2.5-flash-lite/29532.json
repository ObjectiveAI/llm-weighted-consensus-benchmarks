I'm weighing the implications of both to pick a single primary classification. My inclination leans toward \"HR Support\" given the context of \"admin\" and \"human\" resources.\n\n\n**Determining the Primary Focus**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text and the provided keywords to determine the most fitting category. While \"HR Support\" seemed initially relevant, the recurring theme of \"server location access,\" \"write excel files,\" and \"location forms\" strongly points toward \"Access.\" I'm now leaning heavily towards classifying this as an \"Access\" issue, given the emphasis on obtaining permissions to specific data and locations.\n\n\n**Finalizing Category Selection**\n\nI've finished the analysis and determined that \"Access\" is the most appropriate category. While \"HR Support\" was initially considered due to the mention of \"HR admin\" and \"human resources,\" the core request revolves around gaining access to specific server locations, writing excel files, and location forms. These tasks all require permission, authorization, or Access, which strongly supports that being the final classification.\n\n\n"
