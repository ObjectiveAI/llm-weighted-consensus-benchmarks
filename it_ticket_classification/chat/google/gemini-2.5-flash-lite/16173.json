I've begun extracting key terms like \"server room\" to understand the core issue. My goal is to map these extracted keywords to the provided categorization options, aiming for a precise classification. The current focus is on building the framework for analysis.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Problem**\n\nI'm now identifying the key issues within the ticket text. It's clear that access control, secure storage, and procurement are central themes. I've begun to filter out irrelevant phrases and focusing on the core issues. My analysis leans towards categorizing this as a combination of \"Access\" and \"Purchase,\" with potential overlaps into \"Storage.\" The challenge now lies in prioritizing the most impactful categories.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Incident**\n\nI'm now identifying the most relevant categories for this ticket. The initial analysis has highlighted \"Access,\" \"Purchase,\" and \"Storage\" as key areas. Examining the text further, I see the core focus is on enhancing and formalizing access control for the server room racks, including implementing a secure key management process and procurement of secure storage solutions.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Key Issue**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and access control is a crucial aspect here. Securing the server room,  implementing key management, and visitor logs all point to access control. Procurement is happening, but the main issue is managing that access safely. Purchase is also involved, and storage of the new hardware must also be considered.\n\n\n**Focusing on Access Control**\n\nI've been analyzing the text and access control is a crucial aspect here. Securing the server room,  implementing key management, and visitor logs all point to access control. The hardware procurement is an aspect but access is the central theme in the ticket.\n\n\n"
