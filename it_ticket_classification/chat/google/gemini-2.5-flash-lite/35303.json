The initial text points towards a forced upgrade issue. The limited options at my disposal are challenging me, as the text seems to concern operating system issues, which does not easily fit any of the categories. I'm considering \"Hardware,\" \"Access,\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" but further analysis is needed before deciding.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down Options**\n\nI've refined my thinking by focusing on the keywords. It appears the user is facing difficulties related to a mandatory workstation upgrade. Considering \"Hardware,\" \"Storage,\" and \"Miscellaneous,\" I lean toward \"Hardware\" because the core issue is the workstation's upgrade process, with storage concerns being secondary. However, the user's issue might be more general, and \"Miscellaneous\" might be the best fit.\n\n\n**Confirming Hardware Choice**\n\nI've determined that the \"Hardware\" category is the best fit. I've considered that while \"Storage\" is also relevant, it's a secondary detail related to the primary issue, which is the workstation upgrade itself. The user's issue seems to be more directly related to the hardware upgrade process.\n\n\n"
