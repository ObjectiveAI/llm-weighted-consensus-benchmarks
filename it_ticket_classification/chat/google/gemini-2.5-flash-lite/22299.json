The phrase \"please find attached\" raises possibilities. I'm leaning toward HR Support, but \"storage\" gives pause. I'll need to weigh the prominence of each keyword to arrive at the best choice.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category. While \"storage\" appears, the emphasis on \"new starter,\" \"joining,\" and \"staffing\" is leading me towards HR Support. Access is a possible secondary factor, but the lack of explicit access-related language pushes HR Support forward. I'm prioritizing the central theme of onboarding.\n\n\n**Confirming HR as Primary**\n\nI've determined that the overarching theme points firmly to HR Support. Despite the presence of \"storage,\" it's ancillary to the central issue: the onboarding of a new employee. Considering the options, the focus on \"new starter,\" \"joining,\" and \"staffing\" solidified my choice. Access, though a consideration, is implicit.\n\n\n"
