Terms like \"purchase\", \"final owner id\", and \"purchased backpacks\" strongly point towards a procurement action. Even seemingly unrelated phrases, such as \"log replenishment\" and \"user guide found purchase note\", are linked to this purchase thread. My selection of \"Purchase\" as the primary category is firm and I am certain of the direction.\n\n\n"
