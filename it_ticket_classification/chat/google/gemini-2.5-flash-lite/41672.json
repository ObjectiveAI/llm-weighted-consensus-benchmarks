After analyzing the text, my initial thought is \"HR Support,\" as the keywords strongly suggest leave requests and notifications. However, I want to be certain, and will delve into the details to avoid a misclassification. I have started by noting the keywords, and will compare the keywords to the list of categories. The keywords are \"leave notification,\" \"annual leave\" and \"requests\".\n\n\n**Defining the Category**\n\nI've carefully assessed the ticket content, and the \"HR Support\" category seems most applicable. The core issue revolves around leave notifications and requests failing to reach their intended recipients, clearly pointing towards an HR-related process or system malfunction. I've eliminated the other categories, as they don't align with the content.\n\n\n"
