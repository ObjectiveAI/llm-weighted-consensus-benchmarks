After analyzing the ticket text about failed screen sharing and connections, I'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the most relevant category. It seems the issue is related to connectivity or permissions rather than hardware or a specific administrative task. I'll need to confirm if this is the most precise fit.\n\n\n**Revising Ticket Classification**\n\nHaving initially considered \"Access\" due to the connectivity aspects, I'm now strongly considering \"Hardware\" as the primary category. The ticket's description of a failed screen share and cable connection issues suggests a potential problem with the physical components or devices involved in the sharing process. While software could be the root cause, the explicit mention of a cable error leads me to lean toward \"Hardware\" as the most precise fit for this IT support request.\n\n\n"
