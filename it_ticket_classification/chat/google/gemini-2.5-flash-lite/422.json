My focus is on assigning it to the most fitting category from the available options: [\"Hardware\", \"HR Support\", \"Access\", \"Miscellaneous\", \"Storage\", \"Purchase\", \"Internal Project\", \"Administrative rights\"]. The phrase \"oracle security audit revoke\" is the key information guiding this classification.\n\n**Classifying Ticket Data**\n\nMy current effort involves classifying the IT ticket using the provided categories. The mention of \"oracle security audit revoke roles permissions\" strongly suggests an \"Access\" classification, given the focus on roles, permissions, and revocation.\n\n**Revisiting Category Selection**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket's content. While \"Administrative rights\" is relevant due to the mention of application administrators, the recurring themes of revoking roles, permissions, and security audits point more strongly towards \"Access\" as the primary classification.\n\n"
