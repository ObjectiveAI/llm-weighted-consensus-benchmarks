After a careful assessment of the request \"ownership request new pm ownership hi guys please add owner two visitor,\" I'm leaning toward \"Access\". The core request seems to be about granting or modifying permissions.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Options**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the ticket text, refining my categorization approach. The keywords \"ownership,\" \"add owner,\" and \"visitor groups\" are key. After excluding irrelevant categories like Hardware and HR Support, I'm now leaning heavily toward \"Access,\" given its broader scope in managing permissions and roles. The request's central theme is about changing who has control or visibility, which aligns with access management.\n\n\n**Confirming the Access Category**\n\nI've been going through the analysis again. The request clearly centers around granting or changing permissions, specifically involving \"ownership\" and \"visitor groups.\" I've considered and eliminated other categories. \"Access\" is still the most appropriate, as it encompasses all aspects of this request: ownership grants, new PM roles, and group assignments. The request isn't primarily hardware, HR, storage, purchase, or an internal project. While administrative rights are involved, \"Access\" is a more overarching and direct fit, as the core task is about who has control and who can view certain resources.\n\n\n"
