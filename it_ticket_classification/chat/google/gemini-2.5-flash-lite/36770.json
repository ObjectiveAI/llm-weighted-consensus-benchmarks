Identifying relevant keywords is crucial. \"Timecard,\" \"direct reports,\" and \"public\" are key, but the exact category remains unclear. I'm leaning toward \"HR Support\" due to the mention of \"direct reports,\" but further analysis may be needed.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\nI've honed in on the HR Support category. The timecard issue, direct report actions, and absence leave directly align. Access is a possible secondary issue, but the heart of the matter is the timecard workflow, making HR Support the clear frontrunner. I'm satisfied with this categorization.\n\n\n"
