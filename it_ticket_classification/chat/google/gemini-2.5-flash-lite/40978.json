The text seems to point towards a storage issue, possibly related to a full mailbox.  While other options exist, 'Storage' feels like the most accurate fit based on the limited information. I'm hesitant to make a definitive call without more context, but 'Storage' is the leading contender at the moment.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've been analyzing the provided ticket text and the available categories. It seems the core issue revolves around a \"full mailbox\" and undeliverable messages. Despite glancing at other options like access or HR support due to keyword \"password expire\", it's clear the root cause is storage capacity. \"Storage\" is the best fit, as \"mailbox full\" repeatedly indicates insufficient storage space.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Assignment**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket text and available categories, concluding that \"Storage\" remains the optimal choice. The phrase \"mailbox full\" appears repeatedly, signifying that storage limitations prevent email delivery, and rendering other options less relevant. I've ruled out other categories like HR support and Access.\n\n\n"
