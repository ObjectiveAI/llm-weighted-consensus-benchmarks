My process involves analyzing the ticket's content to assign it to the most suitable category from the provided list, which includes options like Hardware, HR Support, Access, and others.\n\n**Onboarding New Starters**\n\nI've been evaluating the ticket content, and the repeated mentions of \"starter form,\" \"new starter,\" and the need to prepare both \"hardware\" and \"accesses\" strongly point towards a new employee onboarding process. This seems to be the most accurate classification.\n\n**Preparing New Starters**\n\nI'm currently analyzing the provided text to determine the best classification for the IT ticket. The recurring phrases like \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and the specific needs for \"hardware,\" \"equipment,\" and \"accesses\" strongly indicate a new employee onboarding process. Therefore, I'm leaning towards categorizing it as HR Support, as this often encompasses the technical setup for new hires.\n\n**Provisioning New Hires**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket details, and the core request revolves around provisioning IT resources for a new starter. This includes preparing hardware, setting up accounts, and ensuring necessary accesses are granted for their immediate start tomorrow.\n\n**Classifying New Employee Setup**\n\nI'm continuing to refine my categorization of this IT ticket. My current focus is on how best to represent the core request for setting up a new employee. While hardware and access are key components, the overarching theme points to the initial onboarding process, which I'm considering as \"HR Support\" due to its strong connection to HR-driven initiatives.\n\n**Onboarding New Employees**\n\nI'm processing the ticket, and the recurring emphasis on \"new starter,\" \"starter form,\" and the need for \"hardware\" and \"accesses\" solidifies my classification. This request clearly pertains to the IT provisioning required for onboarding a new employee, a process often initiated by HR.\n\n"
