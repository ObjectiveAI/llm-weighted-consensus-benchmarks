My process involves analyzing the provided text against a predefined list of categories: Hardware, HR Support, Access, Miscellaneous, Storage, Purchase, Internal Project, and Administrative rights. I'm actively examining the text to determine the best fit for each ticket based on its content.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Context**\n\nI've been meticulously examining the ticket content in the context of our categories. The \"leaver\" theme is consistently emerging, making \"HR Support\" the predominant focus. Although many elements touch on access and storage, these appear subordinate to the primary HR process. Further refinements will explore the nuances of splitting the ticket into subcategories within the 'HR Support' category to better capture this additional information.\n\n\n**Revisiting Category Hierarchy**\n\nI'm now certain that \"HR Support\" remains the most appropriate overarching category. The ticket text's strong focus on employee departures necessitates this choice. Although access, administrative rights, and storage considerations are present, they are all integral steps within the HR-driven leaver process. I will be sure to account for those within the sub-categories, though.\n\n\n"
