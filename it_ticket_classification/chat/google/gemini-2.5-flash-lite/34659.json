The keywords point strongly towards a \"submission issue\", which I interpret as a problem preventing the user from submitting something. The persistent nature (\"last week\") suggests this is a critical impediment. Based on the options, I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\", but \"Access\" might also be a possibility if the submission is related to accessing a system or resource. I still need to reconcile the submission issue more clearly with the categories I have.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus has shifted towards the specific aspects of the issue described in the ticket. While \"HR Support\" remains the leading candidate, I'm now certain this isn't solely an access problem. The user's inability to submit, especially time-related data, points towards a core function within an HR-related system, solidifying \"HR Support\" as the most appropriate classification.\n\n\n**Defining the Issue's Scope**\n\nI'm now focusing on the core problem: the user's difficulty submitting time-related data. The details provided, \"clearing hours non billable was vacation annual leave,\" highlight the critical HR aspect. This is an issue with an HR system, solidifying \"HR Support\". The phrase \"fix submit worked scheme\" suggests a recurring submission issue, confirming that \"HR Support\" is the precise category.\n\n\n"
