I'm evaluating whether \"Internal Project\" is the best fit, or if a more specific category is needed. I'm taking the ticket text's length and redundancy into account while seeking the best category.\n\n\n**Analyzing Category Options**\n\nI've been analyzing the categorization options further. While \"Internal Project\" felt initially appropriate, the focus on administrative features and configurations like \"delete own content\" and \"restrict pages\" has led me to lean towards \"Administrative rights.\" The ticket's emphasis on admin-level actions and the \"administrator allow delete own content\" request solidify this choice.\n\n\n**Choosing the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now completely settled on \"Administrative rights.\" The repeated emphasis on \"administrator allow delete own content\" and the system upgrade's inherent administrative nature clearly point to this as the best category. Even the less obvious aspects, like copying hierarchies, are controlled or affected by administrator access to application functions. The focus is on *how* the administrator configures and allows or disallows.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nMy focus remains firmly on \"Administrative rights.\" The more I analyze the ticket text, the clearer it becomes. The frequent mentions of \"administrator allow delete own content,\" and \"restrict pages,\" coupled with the system upgrade, definitively point to the need for administrative control and configuration. Even the less direct aspects like hierarchy copying are ultimately governed by administrator access, making \"Administrative rights\" the most accurate categorization for this request.\n\n\n"
