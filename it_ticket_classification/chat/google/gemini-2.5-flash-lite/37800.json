This involves a careful examination of the ticket's content to identify key themes and requirements.\n\n**Resolving Ticket Category**\n\nI'm narrowing down the classification for this IT ticket. After reviewing the content, particularly mentions of \"timecard,\" \"hours,\" \"leave entry,\" and submission \"exceptions,\" it appears to most closely align with HR-related issues, specifically those impacting employee record-keeping and payroll processing.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the ticket's language, focusing on terms like \"timecard,\" \"leave entry,\" and \"submit.\" This strongly indicates the issue pertains to HR functions, specifically concerning employee data and payroll processing. Therefore, I've categorized it as HR Support.\n\n"
