I'm looking for the essential keywords and phrases to guide my categorization, specifically focusing on the most relevant meaning. The words are vague. I think I will need to consider the list of potential categories to determine if I can infer the context of the support request.\n\n\n**Identifying HR Focus**\n\nThe ticket's phrasing is quite clear. My reasoning now leans strongly toward \"HR Support.\" The \"new starter\" and \"starter form\" indicators are the primary drivers. Though IT may be indirectly involved, the core request seems administrative. Categorizing as \"HR Support\" appears the most accurate classification given the available options and the ticket content.\n\n\n**Prioritizing HR Classification**\n\nI've been analyzing the ticket's language, zeroing in on \"new starter\" and \"starter form.\" My thought process solidifies: The primary function needed seems to be an HR task, even if there's an IT role. It's more about the initiation of an HR process. Although some categories could be involved, the focus is HR-driven.\n\n\n"
