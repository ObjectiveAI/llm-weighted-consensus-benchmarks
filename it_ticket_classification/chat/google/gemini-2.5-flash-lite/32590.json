Based on the mentions of \"wireless networks,\" \"scan,\" and \"locations,\" I'm leaning towards \"Hardware\" as the most appropriate category, as it encompasses the physical components related to network infrastructure.\n\n**Classifying Network Scan**\n\nMy current focus is on refining the classification of the IT ticket. While \"Hardware\" initially seemed plausible due to the mention of wireless infrastructure, the emphasis on scanning for \"rogue wireless networks\" and involving engineers and analysts in a procedure points more strongly towards an \"Internal Project\" given the available categories.\n\n**Investigating Wireless Scan**\n\nMy current thinking is refining the categorization of the IT ticket. Given the strong emphasis on scanning for \"rogue wireless networks\" and involving engineers and analysts in a specific \"procedure,\" I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" as the most fitting category, as it reflects a coordinated effort rather than a simple hardware issue.\n\n**Reviewing Wireless Scan**\n\nMy current analysis suggests that the ticket\u2019s focus on scanning for rogue wireless networks and involving engineers/analysts aligns best with an \"Internal Project,\" reflecting a coordinated effort rather than a simple hardware issue.\n\n**Investigating Wireless Scan**\n\nMy current focus is on refining the categorization of the IT ticket.
