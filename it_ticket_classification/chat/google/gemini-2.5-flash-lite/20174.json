After analyzing the text (\"new starter bucharest february pm date hello please fill form joiner thanks\"), I'm leaning towards \"HR Support.\" There seems to be a strong implication of a new employee starting, which would typically involve HR. However, I'm keeping an open mind for other possibilities such as \"Access,\" depending on further context.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Onboarding Request**\n\nI've been honing in on the \"HR Support\" category, as the ticket's core revolves around a \"new starter\" needing to \"fill a form.\" Though \"Access\" remains a possibility, the emphasis leans heavily towards initial onboarding documentation and processes. It seems like the primary need is getting this new employee set up with necessary forms, not necessarily configuring immediate system access. This strengthens my resolve that HR Support is the most applicable initial categorization.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Best Fit**\n\nI'm solidifying my conclusion regarding the ticket's category.  The analysis of keywords like \"new starter,\" \"joiner,\" and \"fill form\" convincingly steers me toward \"HR Support.\" While access could be a byproduct of the onboarding process, the central focus on completing a form strongly implies initial HR involvement, not a purely technical access issue. The user needs help filling in the new starter information.\n\n\n"
