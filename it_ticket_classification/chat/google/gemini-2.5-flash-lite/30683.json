Identifying the primary concern is key to a precise category selection. I'm focusing on keywords and phrases that strongly suggest the relevant category.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Focus**\n\n\\n\\nI'm now zeroing in on \"Access\" as the most suitable category. The ticket text's core revolves around managing user accounts: disabling, deleting, and modifying access based on employment status. While \"HR Support\" has a loose connection to the issue, the primary concern lies within the IT realm of user account management.  \"Storage\" or \"Purchase\" are obviously incorrect.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Account Management**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's nuances. Managing user accounts, specifically disabling and deleting those of departing employees and clients, emerges as the central issue. While HR's involvement is tangential, the core task falls within the IT realm of access management. The phrases \"ad employees,\" \"active accounts,\" and \"disable/delete\" strongly support the \"Access\" category.\n\n\n"
