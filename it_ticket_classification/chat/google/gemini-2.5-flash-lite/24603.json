After a second look, \"Access\" seems most relevant given the mention of needing access to tools. While other categories were considered, the specifics lean strongly towards access-related issues. I'll need to finalize the determination soon.\n\n\n**Narrowing the Classification**\n\nI've refined my thinking on the IT ticket categorization. Considering the provided text, the initial instinct to select \"Access\" has been validated by examining related terms. I've eliminated \"Miscellaneous\" as being too vague and other categories like \"Hardware\" and \"HR Support\" were clearly irrelevant to the core issue of requiring access to specific tools. I'm now certain \"Access\" is the most precise selection.\n\n\n"
