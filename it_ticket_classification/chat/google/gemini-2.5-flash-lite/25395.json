The provided text, \"approvals november pm approvals hi guys please change flows holidays,\" is a bit cryptic. I'm leaning toward an issue concerning approvals or perhaps flow management. I'm trying to decipher if the user is asking for holiday approvals or a change related to the approval workflow.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've narrowed the ticket's category down to a choice between HR Support or Miscellaneous. The repeated term \"holidays\" provides a clear link to HR workflows or scheduling. The \"change flows\" part of the request suggests a workflow change, which further supports the HR Support category. While \"Miscellaneous\" remains a possibility, the specific mention of \"holidays\" tips the scale toward HR. I'm focusing on the implied workflow alteration concerning holiday-related processes to finalize the classification.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Content**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the request, particularly the phrases \"change flows\" and \"holidays.\" The \"approvals\" aspect reinforces the idea of a system or process modification. While the ambiguity of \"ext mob\" remains, it's not central to the categorization decision. I'm prioritizing the clear connection between the request and HR-related functions for the final category selection.\n\n\n"
