The description mentions \"critical alert\" repeatedly, along with details about data sources and recovery points. I need to determine the most relevant category given this information. I am considering potential categories such as \"Data Recovery,\" \"System Alert,\" or \"Data Synchronization Issue,\" as these seem to be the most relevant given the contents of the provided description.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've narrowed the ticket's category down to \"Storage,\" focusing on the \"recovery points\" mention, which is directly related to backup and storage systems. I eliminated other categories like Hardware because, though related to the broader IT infrastructure, the issue is specifically within the storage/backup context. This seems like a good fit for now.\n\n\n"
