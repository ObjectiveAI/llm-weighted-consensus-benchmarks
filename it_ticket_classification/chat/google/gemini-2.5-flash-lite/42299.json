It seems the user is experiencing issues with Outlook, and the problem surfaced last Friday. My primary focus is to determine the most fitting category, considering the user's specific concern. I'm carefully analyzing the provided information.\n\n\n**Defining the Ticket Type**\n\nI'm leaning towards \"Access\" as the most suitable category. The ticket describes file access errors and the need to restart, suggesting permission or network-related restrictions are at play.  While \"Storage\" or \"Miscellaneous\" are possibilities, the file access issue feels more central. I'll need to confirm if this aligns with the user's specific context.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Problem**\n\nI'm now focusing on categorizing this IT ticket. After analyzing the information, I'm leaning towards \"Access\" or \"Administrative rights.\" The \"Access\" category feels the most direct, given the file access errors. However, \"Administrative rights\" also fits if the user lacks necessary permissions. Restarting suggests a reset of system-level permissions. I'll evaluate the context to determine the best fit.\n\n\n**Identifying the Best Fit**\n\nI'm now considering the context of the issue. After revisiting the ticket description, the core problem revolves around file access. The recurring nature and the reliance on restarting point towards a deeper problem. I'm focusing on \"Access\" as the initial category, since the issues directly relate to file accessibility. I'll need to consider what specific access point it is.\n\n\n**Narrowing Down the Root Cause**\n\nI'm now focusing on the specific nature of the access problem. After reviewing the provided details, it seems the issue is with accessing files, and a system restart consistently resolves the problem. This pattern suggests a potential network or file permission issue. I'm focusing on \"Access\" as the most relevant initial category to reflect the user's experience.\n\n\n"
