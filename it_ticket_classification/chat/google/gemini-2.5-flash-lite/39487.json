I'm focusing on identifying relevant keywords and phrases to assign it to the proper category. I'm aiming to be precise and efficient in my mapping process. Currently, I'm trying to make a list of words that could trigger each category. I am still working on the best ways to filter out ambiguity.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Keywords**\n\nI've been analyzing the keywords and phrases to ensure accuracy. Identifying the key issue as storage-related has solidified \"Storage\" as the main category. While \"Purchase\" is involved, the primary need is for more storage capacity. I'm focusing on the core problem to ensure the categorization is correct. I am refining my understanding of the nuances between the different categories.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best category: \"Storage\". The text clearly emphasizes \"disks\", \"disk space\", and \"large files.\" While \"Purchase\" is present, it's a means to resolve the storage shortage. I've re-evaluated each category: \"Hardware\" feels too broad, \"Purchase\" is secondary, and the other options don't align. My focus is now on confirming this assignment is the most accurate solution based on the information provided.\n\n\n"
