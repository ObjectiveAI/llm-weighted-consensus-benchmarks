I'm carefully weighing these factors for the final category.\n\n\n**Finalizing Ticket Category**\n\nI've carefully considered the ticket's keywords. While \"Oracle\" hinted at a potential technical issue, the repeated references to \"annual leave\" and its management clearly point towards HR. Thus, I've confidently selected \"HR Support\" as the most relevant category.\n\n\n"
