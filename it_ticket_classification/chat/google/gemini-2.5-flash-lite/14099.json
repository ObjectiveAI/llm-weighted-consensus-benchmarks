I've narrowed down the options, considering the phrases \"time cards submission,\" \"pm re booking,\" and \"per.\" My intuition points towards a category that encompasses both administrative and project-related tasks, but the limited context makes a definitive choice tricky. I'm leaning towards \"Internal Project\" due to the booking element, but further clarification might be needed to confirm.\n\n\n**Identifying the Core Issue**\n\nI've re-evaluated the ticket. Initially, I leaned towards \"Internal Project,\" but the new keywords are much clearer. \"Time cards,\" \"maternity leave,\" and \"public holiday\" strongly indicate HR-related issues. I've ruled out all other categories, and \"HR Support\" seems like the most accurate and encompassing classification. I feel more confident in this choice now.\n\n\n"
