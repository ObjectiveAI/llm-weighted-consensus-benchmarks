The ticket's pointing towards TVs struggling with the regular wireless network, instead latching onto the guest network. It seems a fundamental access problem that needs investigation. I'm leaning toward either access control or device configuration as the root cause, but further details would help solidify my position.\n\n\n**Defining the Access Issue**\n\nI've refined my thinking on the ticket. While hardware is involved, the primary problem is access to the wireless network. The TVs are hardware, sure, but the fundamental issue is their failure to connect to the regular network. I've ruled out \"Hardware\" as the primary category and honed in on \"Access\" as the more precise descriptor. This ticket is ultimately about granting the TVs the appropriate network access.\n\n\n"
