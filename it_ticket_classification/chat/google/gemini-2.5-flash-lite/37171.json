Considering the options, it seems to be related to the \"HR Support\" category, as this often encompasses payroll and timekeeping issues. I'm leaning toward this, though I will double-check for any hardware or access implications.\n\n\n**Categorizing Timecard Issues**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. The added phrases solidify the HR Support category. \"Timecard error,\" \"submit for approval,\" and \"rejected card\" all point directly to timekeeping issues. No hardware or access concerns are apparent, so HR Support seems the most fitting. I'm now certain this falls within the purview of HR processes.\n\n\n"
