My understanding is that the user, a senior developer, needs immediate assistance. My objective is to categorize the IT ticket appropriately from the provided list, which includes \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" \"Access,\" \"Miscellaneous,\" \"Storage,\" \"Purchase,\" \"Internal Project,\" and \"Administrative rights.\" Given the server problem, I'm leaning toward a category that reflects a system-level malfunction.\n\n\n**Defining the Problem**\n\nI've been analyzing the issue with the server restarting immediately. It's clear that the senior developer needs urgent help. I've narrowed down the most suitable IT ticket category. After reviewing, I now believe the \"Hardware\" category is the best fit, as the issue directly relates to the server's startup process and suggests a system-level malfunction.\n\n\n**Clarifying the Root Cause**\n\nI've been examining the server issue where it immediately shuts down after startup. The senior developer requires urgent assistance. I've analyzed the keywords \"server,\" \"boot,\" \"restart,\" and \"configurations,\" recognizing their direct connection to hardware. After a comprehensive review, I've confirmed that \"Hardware\" is the most precise category. It aligns directly with the server's fundamental operational issue.\n\n\n"
