The keywords \"new starter,\" \"fill date,\" and \"kind regards\" are throwing me off as they could indicate several potential categories. I'm leaning toward HR Support, or maybe Access, but the \"id image cd\" part is still throwing me off. I'm continuing to analyze these keywords and their context.\n\n\n**Analyzing Ticket Context**\n\nI've refined my initial assessment. While I considered \"Access\" due to the \"id image cd,\" I now believe \"HR Support\" is the primary category. The phrase \"new starter\" and the request to \"fill date\" strongly suggest an onboarding or HR-related process. Although the other categories have been weighed, HR support remains the most probable match.\n\n\n**Refining Category Selection**\n\nI've further assessed the ticket description. While \"id image cd\" initially suggested \"Access,\" the core context of \"new starter\" and \"fill date\" firmly places this within \"HR Support\". The phrase \"center\" and \"id image cd\" could fit within HR, likely related to employee setup. Focusing on the key elements, HR Support emerges as the correct choice, surpassing the other possibilities.\n\n\n"
