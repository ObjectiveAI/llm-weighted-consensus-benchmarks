I'm leaning heavily towards categorizing this as \"Access\". It seems the user is requesting specific permissions changes.\n\n\n**Categorizing the Ticket**\n\nThe evidence firmly points to \"Access\" as the correct category. The user's multiple mentions of permissions, file access, and modifications strongly support this. The phrase \"new access permission\" especially cemented my conclusion. I considered other categories but ruled them out due to their lack of relevance to the core request. I am confident in my assessment.\n\n\n**Revisiting Ticket Categorization**\n\nMy analysis continues to focus on \"Access,\" given the repeated emphasis on file modification and sharing. The phrase \"new access permission for managers\" solidified this direction. While \"Internal Project\" is a possibility, the core issue remains the granting of access, with the daily file updates being a consequence of said access. I've eliminated other categories based on their lack of direct relevance to the user's primary concern. The request now feels clearly rooted in access control.\n\n\n"
