Based on the description of the laptop with no display after multiple monitor tests, I'm leaning heavily towards \"Hardware,\" but I need to be absolutely sure that's the best fit among the available options. The issue seems directly related to a physical component malfunction.\n\n\n**Analyzing the IT Issue**\n\nI've honed in on the hardware as the definitive root cause. After the initial assessment, the evidence from the thorough troubleshooting, including the failed monitor swap and cross-comparison with a known-good device, strongly suggests a component failure. Thus, the category of \"Hardware\" is the most fitting choice.\n\n\n"
