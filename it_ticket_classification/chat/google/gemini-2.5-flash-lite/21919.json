My focus is on accurately interpreting the \"welcome message to complete pm\" snippet to make the best categorization choice.\n\n**Refining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm refining the classification of the \"welcome message to complete pm\" ticket. While \"hires\" and \"joined position\" suggest HR, the overall context points more towards an IT-related administrative request, possibly concerning access or setup for a new developer.\n\n**Classifying Onboarding Tasks**\n\nI'm continuing to analyze the text, focusing on differentiating between purely HR functions and IT-facilitated onboarding tasks. The \"welcome message\" context, coupled with developer-specific details, suggests a request that likely falls under IT's purview for setup and access provisioning, rather than direct HR policy changes.\n\n**Determining Ticket Category**\n\nI'm currently working to determine the most appropriate category for the IT ticket based on the provided text. My focus is on interpreting phrases like \"change automatic hires\" and \"welcome message to complete pm\" in the context of the available enum options.\n\n**Assigning IT Ticket**\n\nI'm currently classifying an IT ticket related to a new developer joining. The phrase \"change automatic hires\" and the context of a \"welcome message\" suggest this falls under IT's support for HR onboarding processes. I'm leaning towards \"HR Support\" as the most fitting category.\n\n**Processing IT Onboarding Requests**\n\nI'm continuing to analyze the input text, specifically focusing on the context of \"change automatic hires\" in conjunction with new developer onboarding details. My current assessment leans towards classifying this as \"HR Support\" due to the direct reference to hiring processes, even though it involves IT-related tasks like mailbox setup.\n\n**Adjusting HR-Related Ticket**\n\nI'm refining my classification strategy for this ticket. While aspects like \"mailbox receive messages\" might initially suggest \"Access\", the core of the request seems to revolve around \"change automatic hires.\" This points more towards IT supporting HR processes, so I'm solidifying \"HR Support\" as the primary category.\n\n"
