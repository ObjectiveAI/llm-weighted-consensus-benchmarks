I'm carefully analyzing the provided text, dissecting it for key terms to map them onto the predefined categories like \"Hardware,\" \"HR Support,\" and others. The goal is to develop a reliable system for automatic sorting.\n\n\n**Analyzing Access Requests**\n\nI've been drilling down on the access requests, and it's looking like \"Access\" is the dominant category for these tickets. I'm seeing consistent patterns around file access and shared mailboxes. My analysis is focusing on the specific terminology employed, like \"shared folder access,\" to ensure precise categorization.\n\n\n**Determining Ticket Intent**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the IT ticket descriptions, focusing on identifying the central intent behind each request. Through keyword analysis, it's becoming evident that the predominant theme revolves around \"Access\" related to file shares and mailboxes. This points to a clear trend requiring a dedicated categorization strategy.\n\n\n"
