My current thought is that the request likely falls under \"Administrative rights\" due to the emphasis on permissions and user management, rather than general access.\n\n**Mapping Ticket Keywords**\n\nI'm correlating terms like \"add member,\" \"rights,\" and \"additional rights\" to pinpoint the ticket's purpose. My current analysis strongly suggests the request aligns with managing permissions, thus pointing towards the \"Administrative rights\" category.\n\n**Refining Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm now focusing on the interplay between \"add member\" and \"rights,\" specifically \"switched rights\" and \"additional rights.\" My current assessment indicates a strong lean towards the \"Administrative rights\" category, as the core of the request seems to be about managing user permissions and privileges rather than just granting general system access.\n\n**Assigning Ticket Category**\n\nI've analyzed the keywords and the context of the IT ticket. My current understanding is that the request to \"add member,\" \"switch rights,\" and \"give additional rights\" most accurately aligns with the \"Administrative rights\" category, as it pertains to managing user permissions.\n\n"
