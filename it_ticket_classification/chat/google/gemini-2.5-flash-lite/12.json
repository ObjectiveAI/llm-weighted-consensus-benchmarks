Given the \"new starter\" context, I'm leaning towards an HR Support or potentially Access categorization, though the \"fill date\" part is a bit ambiguous.\n\n**Prioritizing Ticket Classification**\n\nI'm refining my categorization for the \"new starter\" ticket. Given the IT context, \"Access\" seems the strongest candidate, covering typical new employee onboarding needs.

My current assessment leans towards \"Access,\" as onboarding typically involves system and tool provisioning. However, the ambiguous \"fill date\" element prompts consideration of \"HR Support\" as a potential secondary classification.\n\n**Selecting Primary Category**\n\nI'm continuing to assess the \"new starter hello please fill date\" ticket. While \"Access\" remains a strong possibility due to typical onboarding IT requirements, the phrase \"fill date\" is pushing me to consider \"HR Support\" as the primary category, as it suggests a process likely initiated or managed by HR.\n\n**Classifying the New Starter Ticket**\n\nI'm focusing on identifying the most appropriate IT category for the \"new starter hello please fill date\" ticket.

While \"Access\" is a strong IT category for new hires, the specific phrase \"fill date\" strongly suggests an HR-centric process, pushing me to consider \"HR Support\" as the primary classification.\n\n**Selecting HR-related Category**\n\nI'm focusing on the \"new starter hello please fill date\" ticket. The combination of \"new starter\" and \"fill date\" strongly suggests an HR onboarding process.
