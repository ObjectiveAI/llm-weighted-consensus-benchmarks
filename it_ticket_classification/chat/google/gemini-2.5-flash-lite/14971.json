I'm leaning toward a category that reflects user access and permissions, but I'm still weighing all possibilities before a final decision.\n\n\n**Revising Category Choice**\n\nNow I'm circling back to the \"Storage\" category, which seems to fit best given the repeated emphasis on file management. I am considering access to these storage areas. It appears the user seeks access to potentially sensitive information, which makes \"Access\" worth a closer look. I'll need to weigh whether access control is the primary focus, or if storage itself is the main issue.\n\n\n**Refining the Categorization**\n\nI've re-examined the ticket's language, paying particular attention to \"new manager social owners,\" \"shared,\" and the terms related to confidentiality. While \"Access\" still merits consideration due to the sensitivity implied by the text, I'm finding that the explicit mention of \"storage,\" \"library,\" and \"shared\" makes the \"Storage\" category the most accurate, focusing on the core issue of resource management and access, given the sensitive information. I'm focusing on the nature of access to these resources.\n\n\n"
