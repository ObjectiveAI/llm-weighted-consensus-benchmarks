The key phrases \"employee due to be leaving,\" \"leavers,\" and \"maternity leave\" strongly suggest an HR-related issue. My goal is to accurately select the \"HR Support\" category from the provided options. This seems like the most appropriate fit given the context.\n\n\n**Pinpointing HR connection**\n\nI have concluded that the IT ticket falls under \"HR Support.\" The explicit references to \"leavers,\" \"maternity leave,\" and \"leaving job\" provide the strongest evidence. The listed phrases align perfectly with HR-related processes. My analysis indicates this as the most suitable choice from the available categories.\n\n\n"
